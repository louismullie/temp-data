## Question

treatment of calcaneal spur

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of calcaneal (plantar) heel spurs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and whether the spur is incidental or contributory. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and when imaging changes management. Next, I will outline a tiered conservative treatment algorithm and check the strength of evidence for each modality. After that, I need to review interventional options and their indications. Finally, I will examine surgical strategies, including when spur excision is appropriate, and close with special populations, prognosis, and a practical decision framework, making sure I continuously cross-check claims against guidelines and studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its pathophysiology. Wait, let me verify the terminology: "heel spur syndrome" is largely synonymous with plantar fasciitis or plantar fasciopathy, and the spur itself is frequently an incidental radiographic finding rather than the pain generator, so I should not over-attribute symptoms to the spur alone [^1154THpN] [^116K2Gyd]. I need to ensure I distinguish plantar heel pain from posterior heel pain due to Haglund deformity or insertional Achilles pathology, because management diverges substantially and conflating these leads to errors in treatment selection [^1155xXt4] [^113zxCdZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. I should confirm that most cases of plantar heel pain are soft-tissue disorders of the plantar fascia and that calcaneal spurs are often reactive enthesophytes that correlate poorly with symptoms; thus, treatment should target the fascia and biomechanics rather than the spur per se [^116K2Gyd] [^113Q3BdG]. Let me consider imaging associations: larger spurs and plantar fascia thickening frequently coexist, and both are associated with chronic plantar heel pain, but tenderness does not reliably localize to the spur, reinforcing that the spur is not the sole driver of pain [^113Txqfo] [^115eugUe].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach. I need to check whether routine radiographs are warranted; guidelines advise against routine foot radiographs for nontraumatic plantar fasciitis because the presence of a spur rarely alters management, so I should reserve imaging for refractory cases or when alternative diagnoses are suspected [^113M7Hy9]. Ultrasound is my first-line imaging if needed, to assess plantar fascia thickness, echogenicity, and vascularity, while MRI helps when I suspect stress fracture, bone marrow edema, or atypical pathology; I should double-check that PF thickness greater than about 4–5 mm at the calcaneal origin supports the diagnosis on imaging [^112jihv8] [^111ZNVJJ].

> I will now examine Tier 1 conservative management. Let me think about patient-directed measures first: calf stretching, plantar fascia–specific stretching, activity modification to reduce barefoot walking on hard surfaces, ice, NSAIDs, and over-the-counter arch supports or heel cups are foundational and supported by guidelines and primary care summaries, with the caveat that many individual trials are heterogeneous in quality [^1136matF] [^111R772m]. I should confirm that most patients improve with conservative care alone; estimates suggest roughly 90% success with nonsurgical measures over time, though symptom duration often exceeds a year before resolution, which I need to communicate to set expectations [^112CfzPU] [^113Q3BdG].

> Let me verify the role of corticosteroid injections. Ultrasound-guided injections at the medial calcaneal tubercle can provide short-term pain relief, but I need to ensure I counsel on risks, including plantar fascia rupture and fat pad atrophy; therefore, injections should be used selectively and ideally image-guided to improve accuracy and safety [^111R772m] [^115HMEfw]. I should double-check comparative data: randomized trials show short-term superiority of corticosteroid over some alternatives, but effects wane by 3–6 months and long-term outcomes converge, so injections are best viewed as adjuncts within a broader program rather than definitive therapy [^116Xmbg3].

> Now, Tier 2 options. Night splints and prescription orthoses can be considered after failure of initial measures; I need to ensure I individualize based on foot structure and symptoms, and I should remember that evidence is mixed but generally supportive for selected patients, particularly with morning pain [^1136matF] [^111R772m]. Wait, I initially thought immobilization in a cast or CAM walker is broadly indicated at this stage; hold on, I should verify that immobilization is typically reserved for more refractory cases or when pain is severe enough to preclude rehabilitation, rather than routine second-line use for all [^1136matF].

> Let me consider physical therapy modalities. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has moderate-quality evidence for pain reduction and function improvement in plantar fasciitis, with both radial and focused devices showing benefit and no clear superiority between techniques; I should confirm that structural spur regression is uncommon, so benefit is likely neurogenic and regenerative rather than osseous remodeling [^111eB6F6] [^114neWUS]. But wait, what if I'm overstating ESWT's effect on the spur itself? A randomized trial showed no significant spur size change at 10 months, so I should avoid implying ESWT "shrinks" spurs and instead frame it as symptom control [^notfound].

> I need to check adjunctive modalities. Low-level laser therapy shows promise in some trials and meta-analyses, but heterogeneity and small studies temper certainty; it may be reasonable as an adjunct within a comprehensive program, especially when combined with exercise, though high-intensity laser has not consistently outperformed placebo in all settings [^115yJgK8]. Kinesiology taping has limited but growing evidence; a recent retrospective comparison suggested taping may outperform ESWT for pain and function at 3 months, but I should be cautious given design limitations and consider it low-to-moderate certainty evidence pending higher-quality trials [^113u8AcC].

> Next, I should review Tier 3 interventional options before surgery. Radiation therapy has historical European use with reported pain reduction in about 70% at 3 months and persistent benefit in about 65%, and a randomized trial favored 6 Gy over 0.6 Gy; however, I must emphasize that this remains low-credibility evidence, not standard of care in many regions, and should be reserved for carefully selected, refractory cases after shared decision-making and local regulatory considerations [^113F4Btb] [^112LtgW8]. Nerve-targeted procedures such as ultrasound-guided tibial nerve pulsed radiofrequency and fluoroscopy-guided intralesional radiofrequency can reduce pain in small randomized studies; I should confirm that these are emerging options for recalcitrant cases within specialized pain clinics rather than first-line therapy [^1168vHQ6].

> I will now examine surgical management. Let me first confirm the principle: surgery is reserved for persistent, function-limiting symptoms after at least 6–12 months of comprehensive conservative care, and the primary pathology addressed is plantar fasciopathy, not the spur itself [^112Z2VjR]. Endoscopic plantar fasciotomy yields outcomes comparable or slightly superior to nonoperative programs at 12–24 months in randomized data, with faster return to activity in some minimally invasive series; I should double-check that spur removal is not universally required and may not improve outcomes [^112Z2VjR] [^116SMria]. Hold on, I should verify the lateral column risk: releasing more than about 50% of the fascia increases the likelihood of lateral column pain, so I need to ensure surgical plans limit release to 50% or less when possible [^115aAimz].

> But wait, what about excising the spur itself? I need to ensure I do not overstate its benefit. A recent comparative study found that adding plantar calcaneal spur excision to plantar fascia surgery delayed symptom resolution and time to weight-bearing without reducing retreatment or complications, suggesting spur excision may be counterproductive in many cases; thus, spur removal should be reserved for select scenarios where the spur is clearly symptomatic or mechanically prominent, not routine practice [^116zuZ9A]. Let me reconsider historical endoscopic series that included spur removal: although some reported good results, these were uncontrolled and small, so they should not override more recent comparative evidence [^116Hh339].

> Next, I should review special populations. In children and adolescents, plantar heel pain is more often due to calcaneal apophysitis rather than plantar fasciitis; management is conservative with activity modification, heel cups, and eccentric loading, and symptoms generally resolve with growth, so I need to avoid adult plantar fasciitis protocols in this group [^111oGY1o] [^111Nd7Rw]. In patients with cancer, I should confirm that ESWT is acceptable when no tumor is in the treatment field, which can facilitate pain control and rehabilitation engagement; this requires careful screening and coordination with oncology [^116ZDMQ8] [^114nbJw1].

> I should confirm the prognosis and counseling points. Most patients improve slowly over 6–18 months with conservative care, and longer pre-treatment symptom duration predicts a longer time to resolution; I need to set expectations accordingly and reinforce adherence to stretching, footwear, and weight management given their association with outcomes [^113Q3BdG] [^112CfzPU]. Let me verify that imaging biomarkers like calcaneal bone marrow lesions and plantar fascia abnormalities correlate with chronic plantar heel pain; while these findings are not yet treatment-prescriptive, they support the degenerative, load-related nature of the condition and the importance of load modification [^115eugUe].

> Finally, I need to ensure a practical decision framework. If the patient has typical plantar medial heel pain with no red flags, I should proceed with Tier 1 conservative therapy for at least 3–6 months, escalate to Tier 2 modalities if needed, and consider Tier 3 injections or ESWT before any surgical referral; if pain is posterior rather than plantar, I should pivot to a Haglund or insertional Achilles pathway rather than plantar fasciitis algorithms to avoid mismanagement [^1136matF] [^113zxCdZ]. Hold on, I should verify that any consideration of spur excision is reserved for cases with clear mechanical impingement or failure of fascia-targeted surgery, given the potential to delay recovery without added benefit in most patients [^116zuZ9A].

---

Calcaneal spurs are managed with a **stepwise approach**, starting with **conservative care** (stretching, orthotics, NSAIDs, ESWT) for most patients [^1136matF] [^111R772m]. If symptoms persist, **minimally invasive options** such as ultrasound-guided corticosteroid or PRP injections are reasonable [^113zpvZi] [^116Xmbg3]. Surgery (plantar fasciotomy with or without spur excision) is reserved for refractory cases after 6–12 months of conservative therapy [^112Z2VjR] [^112CfzPU]. Spur excision alone is rarely indicated, as the spur is usually a **radiographic finding** rather than the pain source [^113M7Hy9] [^116K2Gyd]. Prognosis is **generally favorable**, with most patients improving with conservative care and a minority requiring surgery [^112CfzPU].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative therapy is the **first-line approach** for calcaneal spurs and includes:

- **Stretching exercises**: Plantar fascia and calf stretches reduce tension and pain [^111R772m].

- **Orthotic devices**: Heel cups, arch supports, and custom orthotics improve alignment and reduce stress [^111R772m].

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: Oral NSAIDs provide short-term pain relief [^116i3trX].

- **Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT)**: Effective for persistent pain, with radial and focused ESWT showing similar outcomes [^111eB6F6] [^116JjLiQ].

- **Physical therapy**: Modalities such as ultrasound, phonophoresis, and laser therapy may help [^115yJgK8].

---

## Minimally invasive procedures

If conservative measures fail, **minimally invasive options** include:

- **Ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections**: Provide short-term relief; ultrasound guidance improves accuracy [^113zpvZi].

- **Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections**: Offer sustained improvement in some studies [^116Xmbg3].

- **Radiation therapy**: Low-dose radiotherapy can reduce pain in refractory cases [^112LtgW8] [^113F4Btb].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is reserved for persistent symptoms despite **6–12 months of conservative therapy**. Options include **plantar fasciotomy** — partial release of the plantar fascia with favorable outcomes [^1162E2d3] — and **spur excision**, which is rarely indicated alone and is typically combined with fasciotomy when the spur is prominent [^112Z2VjR] [^116zuZ9A]. Minimally invasive techniques offer **faster recovery and less morbidity** than open surgery [^116SMria].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Conservative management is effective in **approximately 90% of patients** [^112CfzPU]; recurrence is common without ongoing stretching and orthotic use. Surgical outcomes are generally favorable, though complications such as lateral column pain and nerve injury can occur [^115aAimz].

---

Calcaneal spurs are best managed with a **stepwise approach**, starting with conservative care and escalating to minimally invasive or surgical options only if symptoms persist.

### Effect of field size and length of plantar spur on treatment outcome in radiation therapy of plantar fasciitis: the bigger the better? [^116DyvqG]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Radiation therapy is well established in the treatment of painful plantar fasciitis or heel spur. A retrospective analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of field definition on treatment outcome and to determine the impact of factors potentially involved.

Methods and Materials

A review of treatment data of 250 patients (285 heels) with a mean follow-up time of 11 months showed that complete symptom remission occurred in 38%, partial remission in 32%, and no change in 19% (11% were lost to follow-up). Variables such as radiologic evidence of plantar spurs, their length, radiation dose, field size, age, sex, and onset of pain before administration of radiation therapy were investigated in univariate and multivariate regression analyses.

Results

Treatment response depended upon age > 53 years, length of heel spur ≤ 6.5 mm (or no radiologic evidence of a heel spur), and onset of pain < 12 months before radiation therapy. Patients with these clinical prerequisites stood a 93% chance of clinical response. Without these prerequisites, only 49% showed any impact. No influence of field size on treatment outcome became evident.

Conclusion

Patients with short plantar heel spurs benefit from radiation therapy equally well as patients without any radiologic evidence. Moreover, smaller field sizes have the same positive effect as commonly used large field definitions covering the entire calcaneal bone. This leads to a recommendation of a considerable reduction of field size in future clinical practice.

Plantar heel pain — radiographic considerations and prognostic cues note that biomechanical interpretation of weight-bearing radiographs may provide insight into architectural faults; an infracalcaneal spur frequently is associated with plantar fasciitis but may not correlate with symptoms, and a radiographic plantar heel spur usually indicates the condition has been present for at least 6 to 12 months, with longer symptom duration generally predicting a longer period to final resolution.

### The effect of plantar calcaneal spur excision on plantar fascia surgery outcomes [^116zuZ9A]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Plantar heel pain is a prevalent condition affecting 10% of the population, with plantar fasciitis being the most common cause. Plantar calcaneal spurs are frequently associated with plantar fasciitis, yet their role in the condition and surgical outcomes remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of plantar calcaneal spur excision on the outcomes of plantar fascia surgery, utilizing a radiofrequency microtenotomy and bone marrow aspiration technique. A retrospective review of 136 plantar fascia surgeries was conducted with 83 cases including plantar calcaneal spur excision. Demographic and operative factors were analyzed. Outcomes included time to weight-bearing in a boot and shoes, symptom resolution, and complications. Plantar calcaneal spur excision was associated with a statistically significant delay in symptom resolution (p = 0.006) and time to weight-bearing in shoes (p = 0.020). A statistically significant difference was observed regarding operative laterality, with right-sided surgeries demonstrating an increased time to symptom resolution (p = 0.007) and a higher retreatment rate (p = 0.017) compared to left-sided surgeries. There was no significant difference in complication rates or the need for retreatment between excision and non-excision groups. These findings highlight the need for careful consideration of plantar calcaneal spur excision in surgical planning for plantar fasciitis, with implications for patient education and management strategies.

### Effect of acetic acid shockwave phonophoresis on spur morphology, foot pain and function in patients with calcaneal spur: a randomised controlled trial [^115xv9cL]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effect of acetic acid shockwave phonophoresis on spur morphology, foot pain, and function in patients with calcaneal spurs.

Design

A double-blinded, randomised clinical trial.

Setting

Outpatients physical therapy clinics.

Participants

One hundred forty-seven patients with calcaneal spurs, 18–65 years old, were randomly allocated to three equal groups.

Intervention

The study group (A) received acetic acid shockwave phonophoresis plus conventional physical therapy. The study group (B) received shockwave therapy plus conventional physical therapy. The control group received conventional physical therapy programme only. Interventions were applied twice a week for 3 weeks.

Outcome Measures

Calcaneal spur width, calcaneal spur length, pain intensity level, pain pressure threshold and foot and ankle ability measure activities of daily living subscale were measured at baseline, after 3 weeks of interventions and after 4 weeks of follow-up with no intervention.

Results

Between-group differences were observed for calcaneal spur width and length, pain intensity, pain pressure threshold and function after 3 weeks favouring Group A (p < 0.001). Mean differences (95% CI) between study groups were -1.11 mm (-1.46, -0.77) for spur width; -1.34 mm (-1.67, -1.01) for spur length; -20.71 mm (-24.66, -16.77) for pain; 1.45 kg/cm² (1.05, 1.85) for pain pressure threshold; and 12.16 points (9.24, 15.09) for function after 3 weeks.

Conclusions

Acetic acid shockwave phonophoresis combined with exercise clinically and statistically improves calcaneal spur width, length, pain intensity, pain pressure threshold and foot function more than shockwave therapy alone or conventional physical therapy. This method might be considered an effective, feasible, safe, non-invasive and locally applicable treatment for heel spurs.

### Endoscopic treatment of calcaneal spur syndrome: a comprehensive technique [^116Hh339]. Arthroscopy (2001). Low credibility.

We describe a comprehensive approach to the endoscopic treatment of calcaneal spur syndrome developed by the Arthroscopic Group of the Orthopedic Service of Hospital Hermanos Ameijeiras in Havana, Cuba. The surgical technique involves treatment of the heel spur and plantar fasciitis commonly found in calcaneal spur syndrome, but it also addresses adjacent calcaneal periostitis and allows decompression of the nerve to the abductor digiti quinti. Medial endoscopy and lateral instrumentation are used in a sequential approach with exposure and debridement of the posterior roof of the calcaneal arch, followed by removal of the calcaneal spur, lateral to medial release of the medial 75% of the plantar fascia, and if necessary, debridement of the calcaneal tuberosity periosteum. This technique was used in a prospective case series from June 1997 to May 1998 to treat a select group of 38 feet in 30 patients who reported unacceptable levels of pain despite 5 months of conservative treatment, which included an aggressive 8-week physical therapy program prescribed by the treating physician. Good to excellent results were obtained at 3 months postoperatively in all patients with regard to pain relief and return to normal activity, although 5 patients required a short course of physical therapy to resolve symptoms brought on by sports, trauma, or impact loading before 1-year follow-up, at which time all patients reported good to excellent results. Complications included 3 superficial wound infections cured by oral antibiotics and 2 transient lateral paresthesias that resolved with rest and nonsteroidal inflammatory medications. The described technique may provide a useful method for treating refractory heel spur syndrome and warrants further study.

### Comparison of tibial nerve pulsed radiofrequency and intralesional radiofrequency thermocoagulation in the treatment of painful calcaneal spur and plantar fasciitis: a randomized clinical trial [^1168vHQ6]. Pain Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Ultrasound-guided tibial nerve pulsed radiofrequency (US-guided TN PRF) and fluoroscopy-guided intralesional radiofrequency thermocoagulation (FL-guided intralesional RFT) adjacent to the painful calcaneal spur are two interventions for pain management in painful calcaneal spur and plantar fasciitis. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of the two procedures.

Design

A prospective, randomized, single-blind study.

Setting

Single-center pain clinic.

Subjects

Forty-nine patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomized into two groups.

Methods

Group U (25 patients) received US-guided TN PRF at 42°C for 240s, whereas Group F (24 patients) received FL-guided intralesional RFT at 80°C for 90s. The most severe numeric rating scale (NRS) score during the first morning steps and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scores were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the procedures. The study's primary outcome assessed treatment effectiveness via the NRS, whereas the secondary outcomes included changes in the AOFAS score and the incidence of procedure-related mild adverse events.

Results

NRS and AOFAS scores significantly improved in Groups U and F at 1 and 3months compared with baseline (P < .05), and there was no significant difference between the groups. At month 1, 50% or greater pain relief was achieved in 72% of patients in Group U and 75% of patients in Group F. No significant difference was observed in the incidence of mild adverse events between the groups.

Conclusions

US-guided TN PRF and FL-guided intralesional RFT have shown significant effectiveness in the treatment of painful calcaneal spur and plantar fasciitis. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed.

Clinical Trial Number

NCT06240507.

### Randomized, multicenter trial on the effect of radiation therapy on plantar fasciitis (painful heel spur) comparing a standard dose with a very low dose: mature results after 12 months' follow-up [^112LtgW8]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To conduct a randomized trial of radiation therapy for painful heel spur, comparing a standard dose with a very low dose.

Methods and Materials

Sixty-six patients were randomized to receive radiation therapy either with a total dose of 6.0 Gy applied in 6 fractions of 1.0 Gy twice weekly (standard dose) or with a total dose of 0.6 Gy applied in 6 fractions of 0.1 Gy twice weekly (low dose). In all patients lateral opposing 4- to 6-MV photon beams were used. The results were measured using a visual analogue scale, the Calcaneodynia score, and the SF12 health survey. The fundamental phase of the study ended after 3 months, and the follow-up was continued up to 1 year. Patients with insufficient pain relief after 3 months were offered reirradiation with the standard dosage at any time afterward.

Results

Of 66 patients, 4 were excluded because of withdrawal of consent or screening failures. After 3 months the results in the standard arm were highly significantly superior compared with those in the low-dose arm (visual analogue scale, P = 0.001; Calcaneodynia score, P = 0.027; SF12, P = 0.045). The accrual of patients was stopped at this point. Further evaluation after 12 months' follow-up showed the following results: (1) highly significant fewer patients were reirradiated in the standard arm compared with the low-dose arm (P < .001); (2) the results of patients in the low-dose arm who were reirradiated were identical to those in the standard arm not reirradiated (reirradiation as a salvage therapy if the lower dose was ineffective); (3) patients experiencing a favorable result after 3 months showed this even after 12 months, and some results even improved further between 3 and 12 months.

Conclusions

This study confirms the superior analgesic effect of radiation therapy with 6-Gy doses on painful heel spur even for a longer time period of at least 1 year.

### Classification of calcaneal spurs and their relationship with plantar fasciitis [^117DiEn7]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Calcaneal spurs, as a cause of plantar fasciitis, are currently debatable. A prospective study was performed to classify calcaneal spurs according to the findings from an investigation of the relationship between calcaneal spurs and plantar fasciitis. Thirty patients with calcaneal spurs and plantar heel pain underwent calcaneal spur removal and endoscopic plantar fasciotomy. The relationship between the classification of calcaneal spurs and plantar fasciitis was evaluated by endoscopic findings, clinical symptoms, radiographic images, and biopsy findings. The visual analog scale for pain and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot scores for functional evaluation were used preoperatively and postoperatively, respectively. The mean follow-up period was 24 months. Two separate types of calcaneal spurs were recognized. Type A calcaneal spurs were located superior to the plantar fascia insertion, and type B calcaneal spurs were located within the plantar fascia. Magnetic resonance imaging results showed a more severe plantar fasciitis grade in type B calcaneal spurs preoperatively. Histologic examination showed that the numbers of granulocytes per image in type B spurs were significantly increased compared with those in type A spurs. Statistically significant improvements were found in the mean visual analog scale and American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society scores and magnetic resonance imaging results in both groups. The amount of change in the visual analog scale score and American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society score, the number of granulocytes per image, and calcaneal spur length showed a high association with the classification of the calcaneal spurs. Calcaneal spurs were completely removed and did not recur in any of the patients on radiographic assessment during the follow-up period. Calcaneal spurs can be classified into 2 distinct types that are indicative of the severity of plantar fasciitis.

### Targeting the plantar fascia for corticosteroid injection [^112a8qQG]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is often a difficult condition to treat. It is related to repetitive strain of the fascia at its attachment to the heel bone. This condition quite often appears with the concomitant presence of a plantar calcaneal heel spur. Corticosteroid injection is a popular treatment choice for plantar fasciitis, and accurate localization of the injected medication is essential for successful resolution of symptoms after the injection. In the present brief technical communication, a method for targeting the attachment of the plantar fascia to the medial tubercle of the tuberosity of the calcaneus is described. The targeting method uses the lateral radiograph of the foot to aid in localization of the proximal attachment of the plantar fascia to the calcaneus.

### American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons clinical consensus statement: diagnosis and treatment of adult acquired infracalcaneal heel pain [^115cRKFK]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Adult acquired inferior calcaneal heel pain is a common pathology seen in a foot and ankle practice. A literature review and expert panel discussion of the most common findings and treatment options are presented. Various diagnostic and treatment modalities are available to the practitioner. It is prudent to combine appropriate history and physical examination findings with patient-specific treatment modalities for optimum success. We present the most common diagnostic tools and treatment options, followed by a discussion of the appropriateness of each based on the published data and experience of the expert panel.

### Endoscopic calcaneoplasty (ECP) as a surgical treatment of Haglund's syndrome [^116LZ3gQ]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Posterior calcaneal exostosis treatment modalities showed many controversial opinions. After failure of the conservative treatment, surgical bursectomy and resection of the calcaneal exostosis are indicated by many authors. But clinical studies also show a high rate of unsatisfactory results with a relative high incidence of complications. The minimal surgical invasive technique by an endoscopic calcaneoplasty (ECP) could be an option to overcome some of these problems. We operated on 81 patients with an age range between 25 and 55 years, 40 males and 41 females. The radiologic examination prior to surgery documented in all cases a posterior superior calcaneal exostosis that showed friction to the Achilles tendon. All patients included in the study had neither clinical varus of the hind foot nor cavus deformities. All patients had undergone a trial of conservative treatment for at least 6 months and did not show a positive response. The average follow-up was 35.3 months (12–72). According to the Ogilvie-Harris-Score, 34 patients presented good and 41 patients excellent results, while three patients showed fair results, and three patients only poor results. All the post-operative radiographs showed sufficient resection of the calcaneal spur. Only minor postoperative complications were observed. ECP is an effective and of minimal-invasive procedure for the treatment of patients with calcaneal exostosis. After a short learning curve, the endoscopic exposure is superior to the open technique has less morbidity, less operating time, and nearly no complications; moreover, the pathology can better be differentiated.

### Effects of kinesio taping versus extracorporeal shock wave therapy on pain in the treatment of plantar heel pain secondary to plantar fasciitis and a calcaneal spur: a retrospective clinical trial [^113u8AcC]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Plantar heel pain is a common musculoskeletal problem in adults that causes limitation and disability in daily life activities. This study aimed to compare the effects of extracorporeal shock wave therapy(ESWT) and kinesio taping(KT) treatments on pain, functionality and quality of life in the treatment of plantar heel pain secondary to plantar fasciitis and a calcaneal spur. Patients who received ESWT or KT treatment for plantar heel pain between September 2023 and February 2024 were retrospectively screened. Before treatment and at the third month after treatment, pain levels were evaluated with Visual Analog Scale (VAS), sensitivity with Heel Tenderness Index (HTI), functional status with Foot Function Index (FFI) and quality of life with the 12-item short form health survey(SF-12). A total of 60 patients were included in the study,32 patients in the ESWT group and 28 patients in the KT group. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of age, gender, VAS value, HTI level, FFI value and SF-12 physical component score (PCS) before treatment. There was a significant improvement in VAS, HTI, FFI, and SF-12 PCS evaluations after treatment in both groups compared to the baseline. Furthermore, while both treatment methods resulted in a regression in VAS levels and improvement in FFI scores, the KT group demonstrated significantly better outcomes than the ESWT group. There was no significant difference in improvement in SF-12 PCS scores between the two groups. Our study indicates KT may be more effective than ESWT for treating plantar heel pain in terms of pain and functionality, but both treatment modalities have similar effects on quality of life.

Other causes of heel pain (Pathway 4) — Although less common, benign and malignant tumors, infection (soft tissue and bone), and vascular compromise must be considered as etiologies of a patient's heel pain, and the potential morbidity of these conditions is substantial. Proper diagnostic testing along with consultation or referral to the appropriate specialist are paramount in these individuals. In adolescents, calcaneal apophysitis is probably the most frequent etiology of heel pain, and palliative treatment is successful in nearly all cases.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the supportive care and rehabilitation of cancer patients [^116ZDMQ8]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cancer patients sometimes show immobilizing musculoskeletal conditions which prohibit active exercise due to severe bodily pain. Therefore, before starting a rehabilitative exercise program, the pain has to be reduced to enable the patient to participate actively in the exercise program. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT, the application of radial and/or focused shock waves with low or high energy) has been shown to be effective and efficient in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. However, one historical paradigm was the fact that, in the past, cancer was seen as a contraindication for the use of ESWT.

Methods

Clinical note to present indications, benefits, and contraindications of shock wave treatment in cancer patients.

Results

Malignant tumors in the treatment area have to be seen as a contraindication for the use of ESWT treatment. Cancer itself — in the form of the underlying disease — is not a contraindication for the treatment with radial and focused shock wave therapy with low or high energy. Plantar fasciitis and calcaneal spurs, calcified shoulder, tennis elbow or Achilles tendinopathy, and delayed healing and chronic wounds are typical approved standard indications for ESWT, and are allowed when the malignant tumor is not in the treatment area. There are also other musculoskeletal and non-musculoskeletal indications (e.g. myofascial syndrome, erectile dysfunction, polyneuropathy, and lymphedema) that are relevant for cancer survivors. These indications are recommended by the International Society for Medical Shockwave Treatment (ISMST) for "common empirically tested clinical use" and as exceptional indications/expert indications.

Conclusion

ESWT is a safe and relevant modality for the supportive care and rehabilitation of cancer patients.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the supportive care and rehabilitation of cancer patients [^114nbJw1]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Only a qualified physician should use focused shock wave therapy to treat pathologies which have been determined by diagnostic testing.

For ESWT, there are approved standard indications (for example, plantar fasciitis, with or without heel spur; calcifying tendinopathy of the shoulder; lateral epicondylopathy of the elbow/tennis elbow or Achilles tendinopathy; bone non-union/pseudarthroses; delayed or non-healing wounds), common empirically tested clinical uses (for example, bone marrow edema, different tendinopathies, myofascial syndrome), and so-called "exceptional indications" (expert indications, for example, erectile dysfunction, polyneuropathy, and lymphedema).

In cancer rehabilitation, there are typical side-effects to overcome, such as polyneuropathy, lymphedema, musculoskeletal pain, and reduced physical performance. These side-effects need effective and, in most cases, time-efficient treatment. The interdisciplinary field of physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) has its clinical research focus on the treatment of musculoskeletal pain, polyneuropathy, and lymphedema, and on an improvement of physical performance by the use of exercise. At our department, we have a strong expertise in the use of ESWT for different conditions such as calcaneal spurs, calcific tendinitis of the shoulder, tennis elbow, and musculoskeletal pain syndromes. Secondary complications of cancer and its treatment, such as lymphedema and polyneuropathy, are of great relevance for many cancer patients. Since a specific causal therapy for those disorders does not exist, they are currently the focus of our research.

ESWT as a physical treatment option is only contraindicated at the tumor site. Unfortunately, many physicians still deem cancer as a general contraindication for the use of ESWT. As a result, many cancer patients remain undertreated and, in the worst cases, cannot be mobilized due to bodily pain. There are, however, additional conditions (e.g. polyneuropathy or lymphedema) for the use of ESWT in cancer patients recommended by the ISMST as exceptional indications or expert indications. For these indications (polyneuropathy and lymphedema), in our opinion, a superficial area-wide ESWT treatment (not at the tumor site) of the affected limb is suggested.

Erectile dysfunction is another condition of interest in cancer rehabilitation. This indication can also be treated with ESWT, but has to be managed in an interdisciplinary setting.

### The effect of high-intensity versus low-level laser therapy in the management of plantar fasciitis: randomized participant blind controlled trial [^115yJgK8]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Conservative therapy provides significant relief in approximately 90% of patients with plantar fasciitis, but there is neither golden standard nor unified algorithm for the treatment of plantar fasciitis. Clinical studies conclude that the low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a promising treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis. In 2019, a systematic review with meta-analysis of six studies concluded that the LLLT in patients with plantar fasciitis significantly relieves heel pain and the excellent efficacy lasts for three months after treatment.

To the best of our knowledge, to date, only one clinical trial has evaluated the effectiveness of different laser therapies in plantar fasciitis treatment. The conclusions were made that both high-intensity laser therapy (HILT) and LLLT improve pain levels, function and quality of life in individuals with plantar fasciitis, but HILT has a more significant treatment effect than LLLT on plantar fasciitis. Another recent randomized placebo-controlled study that aimed to evaluate the efficacy of HILT on pain, quality of life, foot function and plantar pressure in the treatment of patients with plantar heel pain with calcaneal spur found that all evaluated parameters, except dynamic pedographic measurements, have improved in both groups and results showed no superiority of HILT over placebo. However, it was recommended to add laser treatment along with exercise in case who have documented gait disorder with concurrent pain complaint.

LLLT seems to be an appropriate treatment of plantar fasciitis. There is very little data on the use of HILT to treat plantar fasciitis and the conclusions are controversial. The main aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of HILT and LLLT for plantar fasciitis. The secondary objective was to evaluate and compare opinion of participants on effect of treatment using HILT and LLLT.

### Comparison of two extracorporeal shock wave therapy techniques for the treatment of painful subcalcaneal spur. A randomized controlled study [^117GfZKk]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe and compare two extracorporeal shock wave therapy techniques for the treatment of painful subcalcaneal spur.

Design

Random assignment to two groups of treatment with two and eight months follow-up.

Setting

The data were collected in outpatients.

Subjects

Forty-five subjects with a history of at least six months of heel pain were studied.

Interventions

Each subject received a three-session ultrasound-guided extracorporeal shock wave therapy (performed weekly). Perpendicular technique was used in group A (n = 22, mean age 59.3 ± 12 years) and tangential technique was used in group B (n = 23, mean age 58.8 ± 12.3 years).

Main Outcome Measures

Mayo Clinical Scoring System was used to evaluate each subject before the treatment and at two and eight months follow-up.

Results

Mayo Clinical Scoring System pretreatment scores were homogeneous between the groups (group A 55.2 ± 18.7; group B 53.5 ± 20; P > 0.05). In both groups there was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the Mayo Clinical Scoring System score at two months (group A 83.9 ± 13.7; group B 80 ± 15,8) and eight months (group A 90 ± 10.5; group B 90.2 ± 8.7) follow-up. No significant differences were obtained comparing the Mayo Clinical Scoring System scores of the two groups at two and eight months follow-up.

Conclusions

There was no difference between the two techniques of using extracorporeal shock wave therapy. The tangential technique was found to be better tolerated as regards treatment-induced pain, allowing higher energy dosages to be used.

### Efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave treatment in calcaneal enthesophytosis [^116JjLiQ]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave treatment (ESWT) in calcaneal enthesophytosis.

Methods

60 patients (43 women, 17 men) were examined who had talalgia associated with heel spur. A single blind randomised study was performed in which 30 patients underwent a regular treatment (group 1) and 30 a simulated one (shocks of 0 mJ/mm² energy were applied) (group 2). Variations in symptoms were evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS). Variations in the dimension of enthesophytosis were evaluated by x ray examination. Variations in the grade of enthesitis were evaluated by sonography.

Results

A significant decrease of VAS was seen in group 1. Examination by x ray showed morphological modifications (reduction of the larger diameter > 1 mm) of the enthesophytosis in nine (30%) patients. Sonography did not show significant changes in the grade of enthesitis just after the end of the treatment, but a significant reduction was seen after one month. In the control group no significant decrease of VAS was seen. No modification was observed by x ray examination or sonography.

Conclusion

ESWT is safe and improves the symptoms of most patients with a painful heel, it can also structurally modify enthesophytosis, and reduce inflammatory oedema.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the supportive care and rehabilitation of cancer patients [^1122XHzu]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Cancer rehabilitation has been shown to be a relevant means to accelerate return to work and improve the work ability and social participation of cancer survivors. In cancer rehabilitation, physical modalities such as exercise to improve muscular strength, endurance capacity, sensorimotor functions, and flexibility are of a very high relevance. Nevertheless, some musculoskeletal conditions, such as plantar fasciitis or calcaneal spurs, calcifying tendinopathy of the shoulder, and tennis elbow or Achilles tendinopathy, immobilize the patient and prohibit active participation in exercise, due to severe bodily pain. Therefore, before starting a rehabilitative exercise program, the bodily pain has to be reduced to enable the patient to participate actively.

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in musculoskeletal disorders is a conservative treatment modality, which has been developed over the last 25 years, and has been shown to be both very effective and time- and cost-efficient. Nevertheless, there are several historical (and "traditional") paradigms which have changed during this time period; one of them was the fact that, in the past, cancer represented a contraindication for the use of ESWT.

The International Society for Medical Shockwave Treatment (ISMST) (the managing board, the advisory board and the Senators of the ISMST) issued clinical recommendations for the use of therapeutic shock waves in clinical practice in October 2016.

These recommendations were assembled based on an assessment of the current published scientific and clinical information and accepted approaches to treatment, and were intended to aid the clinician in the use of ESWT. In particular, the guidelines were intended to clarify the indications and contraindications for treatment. Malignant tumors, metastasis, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma in the treatment area have to be seen as contraindications for treatment with radial and focused shock waves with low and high energy. Cancer itself, in the form of the underlying disease, is not a contraindication for ESWT. Active leukemia and leukemic phase of lymphoma (not in remission) are, however, contraindications for the use of ESWT. A minimum level of standard examinations before performing ESWT is necessary, including clinical examination, radiological imaging, and neurological and/or laboratory diagnostic tests.

### Endoscopic calcaneoplasty – rationale, surgical technique, and early results: a preliminary report [^117EjLex]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2003). Low credibility.

We present our technique and preliminary results with endoscopic calcaneoplasty in ten patients resistant for conservative therapy for more than 6 months. All patients showed a Haglund spur on radiography; none had a cavovarus deformity. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 12 months (mean 5.2). All patients showed clinical improvement and would undergo for the procedure again. Three showed a good and seven an excellent result in Ogilvie-Harris score. Postoperative radiographic follow-up showed sufficient bone removal in all cases. Surgery lasted on average 46 min (range 28–84). There were no intra- or postoperative complications. Endoscopic calcaneoplasty is an effective minimally invasive treatment option for patients with retrocalcaneal bursitis.

### Efficacy of dexamethasone iontophoresis as treatment for insertional achilles tendonitis [^115QfiFE]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Dexamethasone iontophoresis has been used to treat insertional Achilles tendonitis with varying effects.

Purpose

This retrospective study evaluated the effectiveness of dexamethasone iontophoresis (DI) in patients with insertional Achilles tendinopathy (IAT) or retrocalcaneal bursitis.

Study Design and Method

We analyzed 159 patients, of which 87 received three or more DI treatments. We compared first and last-visit pain scores, range of motion (ROM), and posterior heel spur size radiographic measurements.

Results

No significant differences between treatment groups were observed in pain or ROM (p-values > 0.3). However, a substantial difference in posterior heel spur size was found, with more prominent spurs associated with more than three treatments (p-value = 0.019). Although not statistically significant, it was noted that increased spur size and Haglund bump height were linked to a higher likelihood of surgical intervention.

Conclusion

This study suggests DI may provide short-term relief in IAT but does not significantly improve long-term functional outcomes. Radiographic analysis can guide treatment, particularly in more prominent posterior heel spurs. Further prospective research is needed to explore the long-term efficacy of DI in managing IAT.

### Endoscopic plantar fasciotomy through two medial portals for the treatment of recalcitrant plantar fasciopathy [^1143s3fw]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciopathy is a common cause of heel pain. Endoscopic plantar fasciotomy has the advantage of less surgical trauma and rapid recovery. The aim of the present prospective study was to delineate the results of endoscopic plantar fascia release through 2 medial portals. The present study included 2 groups. The first group included 27 feet in 25 patients that had undergone endoscopic plantar fascia release followed up for 19.7 (range 12 to 33) months. The second group, the control group, included 20 feet in 16 patients treated conservatively and followed up for 16.4 (range 12 to 24) months. The results of endoscopic plantar fascia release were superior to the conservative methods. The surgically treated group experienced significantly less pain, activity limitations, and gait abnormality. The presence of a calcaneal spur had no effect on the final postoperative score. In conclusion, endoscopic plantar fascia release through 2 medial portals is an effective procedure for treatment of resistant plantar fasciopathy that fails to respond to conservative management options.

### The diagnosis and treatment of heel pain: a clinical practice guideline-revision 2010 [^1155xXt4]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Medium credibility.

Posterior heel pain (Pathway 3) — etiology, presentation, and imaging highlight Achilles insertional pathology and retrocalcaneal bursitis. The posterior heel is the second most common location of mechanically induced heel pain, and pathology in this area is categorized as (1) Achilles insertional tendinopathy or enthesopathy, and (2) Haglund's deformity with or without retrocalcaneal bursitis. Achilles enthesopathy most commonly presents with an insidious onset and frequently leads to chronic posterior heel pain and swelling. Pain is aggravated by increased activity (eg, walking, running) and increased pressure caused by the shoe's heel counter. A palpable prominence may be appreciated both medially and laterally to the insertion of the Achilles tendon. Other proximal pathologies of the Achilles tendon must be ruled out. Achilles-related tendinopathy and rupture have also been related to fluoroquinolone use. Radiographic findings commonly show insertional proliferative spurring and/or erosion or intra-tendinous calcifications.

### Lateral column symptomatology following plantar fascial release: a prospective study [^115aAimz]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis or heel spur syndrome usually resolves with conservative management, but for patients with continued pain, surgical intervention is often pursued. In some cases, plantar fasciitis is relieved, but pain in the lateral column area appears postoperatively. This lateral column pain may be debilitating for the patient and often overlooked by the foot and ankle surgeon. The goal of the study was to identify the maximum amount of plantar fascia that can be surgically released to treat recalcitrant heel pain effectively while preventing the development of lateral column symptoms. All patients undergoing plantar fasciotomy after failing conservative treatment were eligible to participate. Patients rated their pain with an 11-point (0–10) visual analog scale (VAS) and described its location prior to and at monthly intervals after their surgery. Surgeons recorded whether 25, 50, or 66% of the plantar fascia was released during surgery. Open procedures were performed 72% of the time, and endoscopically in 28% of the patients. Key outcome variables included degree of fascial release and foot structure. Patients (n = 47) with lateral column pain after surgery (n = 15 feet) had a mean ± S.E. of 60.6 ± 3.0% of their plantar fascia released while those without pain (n = 35 feet) had only 48.7 ± 1.9% of this fascia released during surgery (ANOVA, p = .019). Age, weight, body mass index, gender, smoking status, comorbidities, general health, surgical procedure, postoperative care, calcaneal inclination angle, and talar declination angle did not differ for these groups (p > .146). For this patient population, regardless of surgical technique (endoscopic or open release), lateral column symptoms were more likely to result when more than 50% of the plantar fascia was released. The report proposes that a maximum of 50% of the plantar fascia be released during surgery.

### The influence of local steroid injections, body weight and the length of symptoms in the treatment of painful subcalcaneal spurs with extracorporeal shock wave therapy [^113pCKNM]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for the treatment of painful subcalcaneal spurs and evaluate whether local steroid injections, body weight and the length of symptoms can affect the clinical results.

Design

Subjects were selected through clinical examination and heel radiograms according to diagnosis of painful subcalcaneal spurs.

Subjects

Sixty-four subjects were divided into two groups of treatment depending on their past history of previous local steroid injections.

Interventions

Each subject received a three-session ESWT (performed weekly). A rehabilitative programme was instituted, consisting of self-assisted plantar fascia and plantar flexors stretching exercises.

Main Outcome Measures

The Mayo Clinical Scoring System (MCSS) was utilized to evaluate each subject before the treatment and at two- and ten-month follow-ups. In addition, standard radiograms were done both before the treatment and at the ten-month follow-up.

Results

Patients with no past treatment using steroids did not show any statistically significant improvement of the MCSS at the two-month follow-up. The statistical significance was obtained at the ten-month follow-up. Patients with past treatment using steroids did not show any statistically significant improvement of the MCSS at either follow-up. At the radiogram check, none of the subjects showed any modification of the heel spurs.

Conclusions

According to the results of the present study ESWT should be considered as an effective treatment for painful subcalcaneal spurs. Previous local steroid injections may negatively affect the result of ESWT.

### Terminology for achilles tendon related disorders [^113NJM5s]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

The terminology of Achilles tendon pathology has become inconsistent and confusing throughout the years. For proper research, assessment and treatment, a uniform and clear terminology is necessary. A new terminology is proposed; the definitions hereof encompass the anatomic location, symptoms, clinical findings and histopathology. It comprises the following definitions: Mid - portion Achilles tendinopathy: a clinical syndrome characterized by a combination of pain, swelling and impaired performance. It includes, but is not limited to, the histopathological diagnosis of tendinosis. Achilles paratendinopathy: an acute or chronic inflammation and/or degeneration of the thin membrane around the Achilles tendon. There are clear distinctions between acute paratendinopathy and chronic paratendinopathy, both in symptoms as in histopathology. Insertional Achilles tendinopathy: located at the insertion of the Achilles tendon onto the calcaneus, bone spurs and calcifications in the tendon proper at the insertion site may exist. Retrocalcaneal bursitis: an inflammation of the bursa in the recess between the anterior inferior side of the Achilles tendon and the posterosuperior aspect of the calcaneus (retrocalcaneal recess). Superficial calcaneal bursitis: inflammation of the bursa located between a calcaneal prominence or the Achilles tendon and the skin. Finally, it is suggested that previous terms as Haglund's disease; Haglund's syndrome; Haglund's deformity; pump bump (calcaneus altus; high prow heels; knobbly heels; cucumber heel), are no longer used.

### The diagnosis and treatment of heel pain: a clinical practice guideline-revision 2010 [^112Z2VjR]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Medium credibility.

Heel pain surgical management — third tier care continues tier 1 and/or 2 programs with consideration of surgical management, and options may include plantar fasciotomy using recognized techniques or extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) as an alternative. Current practice favors a minimally invasive approach to plantar fasciotomy versus extensive open surgical exposures, and in most cases removal of the plantar heel spur does not seem to add to the success of the outcome. In some cases multiple etiologic factors including nerve entrapment may necessitate combining nerve release and plantar fasciotomy, and radiofrequency coblation of the plantar fascia as well as radiofrequency nerve ablation and cryoprobe have been advocated more recently as an alternative surgical approach to chronic heel pain.

### Surgical treatment of insertional achilles tendinopathy: results after removal of the subcutaneous bursa alone-a case series [^112S9aP1]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

In this case series on patients with chronic painful insertional Achilles tendinopathy, having ultrasound-verified pathology in bursa and tendon together with intra-tendinous bone pathology, excision of the subcutaneous bursa alone showed in almost all patients good clinical results at 21 months of follow-up.

Treatment of chronic painful insertional Achilles tendinopathy is challenging. When there is pathology in multiple tissues, it is difficult to identify the source for pain. For patients with intra-tendinous bone pathology and failed conservative treatments, major surgery is often instituted. Tendon detachment–bone removal–tendon re-attachment, or bone removal via longitudinal tenotomy, followed by initial immobilisation and long rehabilitation periods, is commonly used. The results vary, and the need for a long low-loading rehabilitation period is not optimal for any patient. Traditionally, the focus has been on removal of bone (spur, bone bridge, loose bone) and not the subcutaneous bursa. This methodology is likely based on the theory that the sometimes occurring major bone formations, or prominent loose bone, is the main source of pain.

Interestingly, in recent research on innervation patterns in patients with insertional Achilles tendinopathy, immunohistochemical analyses have shown that most nerves were found in the subcutaneous bursa. In that study, biopsies from the subcutaneous bursa, the retro-calcaneal bursa, the upper calcaneus and the ventral side of the distal Achilles were taken from patients having US-verified pathology in all these tissues. Thus, it is likely that the subcutaneous bursa is involved in the pain in this condition. Therefore, we routinely use diagnostic US-guided injections into the subcutaneous bursa alone, followed by provocative Achilles tendon loading activity. When patients are pain-free during provocation, it is likely that removal of the subcutaneous bursa alone (without addressing the neighbouring tissues) can give good treatment results. In a single case observation on an international high-level triathlete, there was a very good clinical result with only subcutaneous bursa removal despite major intra-tendinous bone pathology.

### Endoscopic decompression of the retrocalcaneal space [^111VdoUk]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Pain in the retrocalcaneal space can be incapacitating. Patients who do not respond to nonoperative treatment may seek a surgical solution. The first purpose of this paper was to describe and evaluate the efficacy of a minimally invasive procedure to address retrocalcaneal pain caused by retrocalcaneal bursitis, a Haglund spur, and impingement. The second purpose was to compare the endoscopic technique with a standard open technique.

Methods

Our prospective study included thirty-three heels in thirty consecutive patients with chronic pain in the retrocalcaneal space for which nonoperative treatment had failed and endoscopic decompression was performed. The mean age was forty-nine years (range, nineteen to seventy-nine years). This group was compared with a group of seventeen heels in fourteen patients with the same diagnostic criteria who were treated with an open technique. Both groups of patients were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively with the AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society) Ankle-Hindfoot Scale, and the patients treated with the endoscopic procedure were also evaluated postoperatively with the University of Maryland 100-point Painful Foot Center Scoring System.

Results

In the endoscopic group, the AOFAS scores averaged 61.8 points preoperatively and 87.5 points postoperatively (p < 0.001). The endoscopic procedures yielded nineteen excellent, five good, three fair, and three poor results at an average of twenty-two months postoperatively. (Three patients were excluded from the study.) In the open-treatment group, the AOFAS scores averaged 58.1 points preoperatively and 79.3 points at an average of forty-two months postoperatively (p = 0.006). The scores after the endoscopic procedures were numerically, but not significantly (p = 0.115), better than those after the open procedures. The time to recovery was the same in the two groups. The endoscopic procedures were performed more quickly than the open procedures (forty-four compared with fifty-six minutes) and were associated with fewer complications (a 3% compared with a 12% rate of infection, a 10% compared with an 18% rate of altered sensation, and a 7% compared with an 18% rate of scar tenderness).

Conclusions

Endoscopic decompression is a feasible and efficient procedure for the treatment of retrocalcaneal disorders. It produces final results equal to or better than those of an open technique, with a similar recovery time, fewer complications, and a better cosmetic appearance.

### Imaging of plantar fascia disorders: findings on plain radiography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging [^115niG28]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Plantar calcaneal spurs and calcifications within the PF are uncommon occurrences in patients with plantar fasciitis. The significance of calcaneal spurs as a cause of plantar fasciitis has received considerable attention in the literature, and currently their importance in terms of the diagnosis and prognosis of plantar fasciitis is debatable. Calcaneal spurs associated with plantar fasciitis include those located within the plantar fascia (Fig. 4). These are however very uncommon, as the most common site of plantar calcaneal spurs is in the abductor hallucis and flexor digitorum brevis origins, deep below the PF (Figs. 3 and 4). Thus, evidence of calcaneal spurs on conventional radiographs is not a pathognomonic sign of plantar fasciitis.

Apart from highlighting indirect signs of plantar fasciitis and calcaneal spurs, conventional radiography is useful in overviewing anatomical and pathological changes of the bone and soft tissues. Radiopaque foreign material, such as metals, may be easily revealed. In the case of infectious fasciitis, plain radiography shows soft-tissue swelling and blurring of soft-tissue planes. Concomitant osteomyelitic changes in bone morphology can also be detected and mainly include lytic lesions, osteopenia, loss of trabecular architecture, new bone apposition and periosteal thickening (Fig. 8). Finally, stress fractures may be associated with PF injuries and should be ruled out.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^117XD86C]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

4.6.5 Plantar fasciitis

Plantar fasciitis, also termed plantar fasciopathy due to the absence of inflammation in this condition, is estimated to affect one in 10 persons in their lifetime, making it among the most common musculoskeletal conditions. In one study, PF was present in 5% of patients referred for evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathy.PF affects active and sedentary adults of all ages, and presents with plantar surface heel pain.PF is an overuse and degenerative condition involving the plantar fascia at its attachment to the calcaneus. Risk factors for the development of PF include high body mass index, professions involving prolonged standing, high and/or low medial longitudinal arches (pes cavus or planus), altered ankle biomechanics, and excessive running. On physical examination, tenderness to palpation at the anteromedial plantar calcaneus and/or a positive Windlass test (heel pain with passive forced dorsiflexion of the metatarsophalangeal joints) (sensitivity 0.32, specificity 1), help confirm the diagnosis.PF often does not require imaging; however, in cases that persist despite appropriate treatment, plain radiographs (looking for a calcaneal heel spur) and/or ultrasound (looking for thickened and/or abnormal fascial tissue) may be helpful.

Calcaneal fractures and stress fractures — clinical features and management are outlined as follows: intra-articular fractures involving the subtalar joint result in diffuse pain in the hindfoot that is poorly localized to the heel itself; diagnosis is made by a history of trauma, focal pain upon palpation, and radiographic confirmation of the fracture; treatment may be surgical, although many relatively minor fractures often may occur in older or high-risk individuals for whom nonsurgical management may be the most judicious course; stress fractures of the calcaneus occur as a consequence of repetitive load to the heel, with the most common site of stress fracture immediately posterior and inferior to the posterior facet of the subtalar joint; the physical findings include tenderness to the lateral wall of the calcaneus, swelling and warmth may be present, pain elicited with compression of the calcaneus is highly suspicious of a stress fracture, and frequently the onset of symptoms precedes the radiographic findings, and ancillary measures can assist in early diagnosis, including Technetium bone scans or MRI.

Posterior heel pain — Insertional Achilles tendonopathy/enthesopathy pathway identifies history, exam, imaging, and staged management as follows: Significant history includes chronic posterior heel pain with insidious onset, symptoms aggravated by shoes, and symptoms relieved with barefoot or backless shoe. Significant findings include tenderness at Achilles insertion with ± central subcutaneous bony prominence and ± local inflammation. Radiographs show erosion or proliferative spurring at Achilles insertion and intratendinous calcification adjacent to insertion. Initial treatment options list patient-directed treatment options (heel lifts, open-back shoes, cryotherapy/topical analgesics, limit activities) plus oral antiinflammatories, orthoses, physical therapy, and weight loss. If improvement is unsatisfactory, immobilization with cast or CAM walker and continuation of initial treatment options are directed; persistent unsatisfactory improvement proceeds to surgery with resection of insertional spurring and tendon debridement. Satisfactory improvement at any step directs to continue therapy until symptoms resolve, and clinicians are prompted to consider alternative etiologies (Pathway 4).

### Treatment of calcaneal apophysitis: wait and see versus orthotic device versus physical therapy: a pragmatic therapeutic randomized clinical trial [^111Nd7Rw]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Calcaneal apophysitis is a frequent cause of heel pain in children and is known to have a significant negative effect on the quality of life in affected children. The most effective treatment is currently unknown. The purpose of this study is to evaluate 3 frequently used conventional treatment modalities for calcaneal apophysitis.

Methods

Three treatment modalities were evaluated and compared in a prospective randomized single-blind setting: a pragmatic wait and see protocol versus a heel raise inlay (ViscoHeel; Bauerfeind) versus an eccentric exercise regime under physiotherapeutic supervision. Treatment duration was 10 weeks.

Inclusion Criteria

age between 8 and 15 years old, at least 4 weeks of heel pain complaints due to calcaneal apophysitis based, with a minimal Faces Pain Scale-Revised of 3 points. Primary exclusion criteria included other causes of heel pain and previous similar treatment. Primary outcome was Faces Pain Scale-Revised at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included patient satisfaction and Oxford Ankle and Foot Questionnaire (OAFQ). Points of measure were at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months. Analysis was performed according to the intention-to-treat principles.

Results

A total of 101 subjects were included. Three subjects were lost to follow-up. At 6 weeks, the heel raise subjects were more satisfied compared with both other groups (P < 0.01); the heel raise group improved significantly compared with the wait and see group for OAFQ Children (P < 0.01); the physical therapy group showed significant improvement compared with the wait and see group for OAFQ Parents (P < 0.01). Each treatment modality showed significant improvement of all outcome measures during follow-up (P < 0.005). No clinical relevant differences were found between the respective treatment modalities at final follow-up.

Conclusions

Treatment with wait and see, a heel raise inlay, or physical therapy each resulted in a clinical relevant and statistical significant reduction of heel pain due to calcaneal apophysitis. No significant difference in heel pain reduction was found between individual treatment regimes. Calcaneal apophysitis is effectively treated by the evaluated regimes. Physicians should deliberate with patients and parents regarding the preferred treatment.

Plantar heel pain — presentation, contributing factors, and evaluation emphasize that the most common cause cited is biomechanical stress of the plantar fascia and its enthesis at the calcaneal tuberosity, with localized nerve entrapment also potentially contributory; patients usually present with pain at initiation of weight bearing that eases after minutes then returns with activity, and evaluation should include targeted history, exclusion of neurologic symptoms, and comprehensive lower-extremity examination including assessment of plantar fat pad quality and height.

### Investigation of the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy in patients diagnosed with plantar fasciitis: comparison of radial and focus applications [^111eB6F6]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of radial and focus (extracorporeal shock wave therapy) ESWT treatment on pain, function and size of the calcaneal spur in patients with clinical and radiological diagnosis of plantar fasciitis. A total of 112 patients aged between 18 and 95 years, were divided into 2 groups; group 1, rESWT (2.4 bar 12 hz 2000 beats), group 2 received fESWT (0.14 bar 14 hz 1000 beats) 3 times a week for 3 weeks. All patients were evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)-pain and Foot Function Index before and after the treatment, at 4 week and 12 weeks. Calcaneal spur size was measured radiographically in the patients before and after the treatment at the 12th week follow-up. According to our records, VAS scores were found to be similar between the groups before treatment and at follow-ups (all p > .05). In both groups, a significant decrease in VAS scores was found in the follow-ups compared to before treatment (p < .001). FFI total, pain, activity and disability scores were found to be similar between the groups before treatment and at follow-up (all p > .05). In both groups, a significant decrease in Foot Function Index scores was found in the follow-ups compared to before treatment (p < .001). Both of rESWT and fESWT were effective in plantar fasciitis treatment there were no significant difference between 2 modalities in long term.

### Ultrasound-guided injection of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid versus corticosteroid in management of plantar fasciitis: a 24-week randomized clinical trial [^113zpvZi]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Injection Technique

US is an accurate, reliable, and non-invasive technique for measuring PF thickness, monitoring effects of different interventions, and guiding therapeutic interventions in patients with PF. It can visualize increases in thickness of the plantar fascia, hypoechoic changes, perifascial fluid collections, and calcaneal spur. The US-guided injection is better than palpation-guided injection because the latter provides better relief in pain (VAS scores) and control of PFT by enhancing the accuracy of the injection site by exact localization of the plantar fascia during the injection. Kane et al claimed that the US-guided injection of four heels with recalcitrant PF is highly effective.

In this study, the plantar fascia was examined with a 3- to 12-MHz real-time linear-array transducer (Ecube7 US system (Alpinion, Seoul, Korea)) with the patient lying prone with 90° of knee flexion and neutral ankle position. The injection was performed under aseptic conditions using a 22-gauge needle. Plantar fascia thickening of > 4 mm and/or abnormal hypoechoic areas in plantar fascia were targeted under the longitudinal plane of US-guidance. Figure 1 presents our injection practice. Also, the needle was inserted through the medial heel along with the long-axis view (in-plane technique) toward the target area. Then, 2 mL of HA or CS were injected using a peppering technique, which involves a single skin portal followed by several penetrations of the fascia. Patients were kept in the sitting position without moving their foot for 30 min after the injection. They were sent home with instructions to limit the use of the affected foot for approximately 72 h and to use acetaminophen in case of pain. Moreover, they were taught to perform stretching exercises. It should be noted that the use of NSAIDs was not allowed.

Outcome Measures

Visual Analog Scale (VAS)

Patients were asked to rate pain by marking a horizontally positioned 10-cm VAS with anchor points of "no pain" and "worst possible pain". Patients were also asked to verbally rate their pain "on a scale of 0 to 10", with 0 indicating no pain and 10 showing the worst possible pain.

### Management of calcaneal cysts in the pediatric population: a review [^1135yPd7]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Surgical Management

Numerous studies discuss surgical management of calcaneal UBCs in the literature. Current surgical options include open curettage with or without bone augmentation, cannulated screw decompression, and more recently, endoscopic curettage. The different treatment options have varying success rates, but each surgical method provided superior healing rates to observation or injection, demonstrating efficacy rates from 85% to 100% depending on the approach. Regarding complications from surgery, no postoperative infections, loss of function, or nerve damage was reported in any studies we reviewed. Saraph et al.reported one case of nine patients who had irritation at the screw insertion site, which required early removal, but no other complication was noted.

A systematic review conducted by Levy et al. reported that pain was improved with all surgical approaches by 47% to 100%. Several aspects were included in the review; noteworthy that open curettage with and without augmentation (both allograft and autograft) had statistically notable improvements in pain, although no statistical difference existed between the two forms of augmentation. Furthermore, in their systematic review, Levy et al.showed that autografting resulted in higher healing rates than the allograft. Also discussed was endoscopic curettage with allograft augmentation, the newest approach included in the review, which has been the topic of numerous subsequent studies. These studies investigated operating time, length of stay in the hospital, overall healing, reduction in pain, and length of time to return to full activities. Operating time and length of stay in the hospital varied between articles, with some showing no difference in the operating time and others showing increased operating times with endoscopic surgery. The success rate was 100%, with no reported recurrences or failure to heal among the 44 patients, although the sample size is relatively small. Also noteworthy is the absence of reported complications and markedly improved pain.

### Indication, surgical technique and results of endoscopic fascial release in plantar fasciitis (E FRPF) [^115EPuUH]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of the present study is to present the surgical technique for, and review our indications and results after, endoscopic fascial release in patients with plantar fasciitis. In five thiel-embalmed human specimens, a biportal technique for endoscopic release of the plantar fascia was established. The aim was here to evaluate the relation between the plantar fascia and the heel spur and to perform a release that would not exceed 50–70% of the diameter of the calcaneoplantar fascia. The endoscopic technique was performed within the last 5 years in ten male and seven female patients. All patients with the clinical entity of plantar fasciitis underwent conservative treatment for at least 6 months. The average age at surgery was 35 years (24–56 years). In the first five patients, surgery was performed under c-arm control. In all patients the operation could be finished endoscopically. The endoscopic portals healed without complications. The time for surgery during the learning curve ranged between 21 and 74 min (average 41 min) and was still longer compared to the open technique. The clinical follow-up ranged between 4 and 48 months (average 18.5 months). Out of 17 patients, 13 improved clinically, and they would choose the treatment option again. In the Ogilvie-Harris score, seven patients showed good and six excellent results. In two patients, the initial results were not satisfactory, because of a bony stress reaction of the calcaneus. This complication was treated by 6 weeks of partial weight bearing, without any further problems. Two other patients developed secondary pain in the lateral column. In spite of the minimal invasive approach it seems to be important to be careful in increasing the weight bearing in early rehabilitation. The technique of the endoscopic plantar fascia release (E FRPF) can be performed in a standardised and reproducible procedure. The follow-up examination showed good midterm results, but a loss of stability of the plantar arch has to be strictly avoided.

### Imaging of plantar fascia disorders: findings on plain radiography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging [^1116zDEt]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

General features of PF disorders

Plantar fasciitis (Figs. 2, 3, and 4) is the most common injury of the PF and is estimated to induce more than 1 million patients to seek treatment annually. Despite its name, plantar fasciitis has a degenerative rather than inflammatory nature and is related to overuse trauma leading to microtears; thus, the term "plantar fasciopathy" is often preferred. The proximal third of the central bundle of the PF is classically involved; however, distal plantar fasciitis has recently been recognised as a cause of recalcitrant heel pain. The aetiology of plantar fasciitis is multifactorial. Biomechanical risk factors include those causing repetitive stress on the PF, such as foot deformities, improper footwear, increased body mass index and activities that involve prolonged walking, running or standing. Among the medical conditions associated with plantar fasciitis, the most notable are seronegative spondyloarthropathies and rheumatoid arthritis. Plantar calcaneal spurs, also known as calcaneal enthesophytes, have been investigated in great detail as a possible cause of plantar fasciitis, but they are not specific and also occur in asymptomatic individuals. The diagnosis of plantar fasciitis generally relies on clinical history and physical examination. The main symptoms include pain and stiffness in the morning, or pain at the beginning of activity after rest. Physical examination reveals tenderness at the origin of the PF and impaired dorsiflexion of the ankle and extension of the toes. Although generally self-limiting, plantar fasciitis may result in physical inactivity and impact quality of life. Imaging can aid in the diagnosis, particularly in recalcitrant cases or may rule out other heel pathology.

### Association between metabolic syndrome and radiographic changes in psoriatic arthritis: a cohort study [^112A1L1v]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Multivariate GEE analysis identified plantar and/or Achilles calcaneal spurs, DISH, and DDD (cervical and thoracolumbar) as radiographic features independently associated with MetS in patients with PsA but not radiographic damage to peripheral joints, sacroiliitis, or syndesmophytes. This is not unexpected because these radiographic findings share with MetS the close relation to aging, degenerative disease, and metabolic changes. Although not characteristic radiographic disease features of PsA, both DISH and DDD may occur in patients with psoriatic disease. In a previous study, we demonstrated an association between DISH and the presence of radiographic damage to peripheral joints. Calcaneal spurs, although commonly secondary to degenerative disease, may also represent enthesophytic manifestation of PsA. Thus, although MetS is associated with higher PsA disease activity, it is not associated with higher PsA‐related radiographic damage to axial or peripheral joints.

It should be emphasized that factors associated with MetS, such as higher BMI and lower physical activity, are modifiable; tight control and healthy lifestyle changes can result in favorable health‐related outcomes, especially in the cardiovascular domain. In PsA, weight loss was shown to be associated with a higher rate of minimal disease activity in patients with overweight or obesity taking TNFi. Klingberg et alfound that short‐term weight loss treatment with a very low energy diet correlated favorably with disease activity in joints, entheses, and skin in patients with PsA and obesity.

Our study has several strengths, including the large number of patients, the organized and well‐documented nature of the follow‐up, and detailed clinical and radiographic data. We do acknowledge some limitations, including the retrospective design and that it was conducted at a single center.

In conclusion, MetS was not associated with more severe peripheral or axial radiographic damage in our study. On the other hand, it was found to be associated with metabolic and degenerative changes in the spine and entheses, most likely due to shared underlying pathomechanisms. These imaging changes, although not being inherent radiographic features of PsA, may have untoward impacts on patient symptoms and quality of life. The relationship between MetS and PsA, and potential mitigating strategies, merit further investigation.

### Inferior heel pain in soccer players: a retrospective study with a proposal for guidelines of treatment [^115m17ob]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

The authors of this study fully agree with the scientific evidence on the importance of therapeutic exercise, foot orthoses, and manual therapy and physical energies (eg, low-level laser therapy) in the treatment of heel pain/plantar fasciitis, and that combined techniques have synergistic effects; it is necessary to emphasise that the weak evidence on the use of advanced physical energies might result in the initial definition of heel pain that excludes or considers in their own right the pain condition from nerve compression syndromes, inflammation and atrophy of the fat pad, stress injury of the heel spur, stress fracture, and heel spur.

According to what was observed in the present study on the treatment of inferior heel pain, and considering the technological progress achieved in recent years in rehabilitation and biomedicine, we can now propose an integrated therapeutic approach to treatment of heel pain, properly differentiated according to the specific disorder, in order to improve the functional outcome of athletes, reducing and possibly removing the residual subjective pain, respecting the need to resume to sport as soon as possible and with minimal use of pharmacological treatments.

### Association of calcaneal bone marrow lesions and plantar fascia imaging biomarkers with chronic plantar heel pain: a case-control study [^115eugUe]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine associations between chronic plantar heel pain (CPHP) and imaging biomarkers derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography.

Methods

We compared 218 participants with CPHP with 100 age- and sex-matched population controls. We assessed imaging biomarkers on MRI (calcaneal bone marrow lesions [BMLs], plantar fascia [PF] signal and thickness, spurs, and fat pad signal) and B-mode/power Doppler ultrasound (PF thickness, echogenicity, and vascularity). Covariate data collected included demographic characteristics, disease history, clinical measures, and physical activity by accelerometry. Data were analyzed using multivariable conditional logistic regression.

Results

Plantar calcaneal BML size (mm², odds ratio [OR] 1.03 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.02–1.05]), larger plantar spurs (OR for spurs > 5 mm 2.15 [95% CI 1.13–4.10]), PF signal (OR for signal penetrating > 50% of the dorsoplantar width 12.12 [95% CI 5.36–27.42]), PF thickness (mm, OR for MRI 3.23 [95% CI 2.36–4.43] and ultrasound OR 3.78 [95% CI 2.69–5.32]), and echogenicity (diffusely hypoechoic OR 7.89 [95% CI 4.02–15.48] and focally hypoechoic OR 24.92 [95% CI 9.60–64.69]) were independently associated with CPHP. PF vascularity was uncommon, occurring exclusively in cases (cases with signal n = 47 [22%]). Combining imaging biomarkers into 1 model, plantar BMLs and PF imaging biomarkers, but not fat pad signal or heel spurs, were independently associated with CPHP.

Conclusion

Calcaneal BMLs and PF imaging biomarkers are associated with CPHP. Further research is required to understand whether these different markers represent distinct phenotypes of heel pain, and if so, whether there are specific treatment implications.

Posterior heel pain — Bursitis/Haglund's pathway outlines a parallel evaluation and stepwise care: Significant history includes acute or chronic posterior heel pain, pain aggravated by shoe pressure, morning pain, and symptoms relieved with barefoot or backless shoe. Significant findings include tenderness lateral to Achilles, posterior lateral subcutaneous bony prominence, and ± local inflammation/bursitis. Radiographs demonstrate posterior superior prominence to calcaneus — Haglund's deformity and soft tissue swelling — bursitis. Initial treatment options include patient-directed treatment options (open-back shoes, cryotherapy/topical analgesics) plus orthoses, accommodative padding, oral antiinflammatories, physical therapy, and weight loss. If improvement is unsatisfactory, immobilization with cast or CAM walker, continuation of initial treatment options, and consideration of injection of bursa are directed; continued lack of improvement leads to surgery with resection Haglund's/bursa or calcaneal osteotomy. Satisfactory improvement at any step directs to continue therapy until symptoms resolve, with a reminder to consider alternative etiologies (Pathway 4).

### Endoscopic debridement for treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis: an Innovative technique and prospective study of 46 consecutive Patients [^116dAuFH]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is one the most common pathologies treated by foot and ankle surgeons. When nonoperative therapy fails, surgical intervention might be warranted. Various surgical procedures are available for the treatment of recalcitrant plantar fasciitis. The most common surgical management typically consists of open versus endoscopic plantar fascia release. Comorbidities associated with the release of the plantar fascia have been documented, including lateral column overload and metatarsalgia. We present an innovative technique for this painful condition that is minimally invasive, allows visualization of the plantar fascia, and maintains the integrity of the fascia. Our hypothesis was that the use of endoscopic debridement of the plantar fascia with or without heel spur resection would provide a minimally invasive technique with acceptable patient outcomes.

### Imaging of plantar fascia disorders: findings on plain radiography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging [^112jihv8]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Several pathologies involving structures other than the PF may mimic PF disease and should be included in the differential diagnosis. Achilles tendinopathy may present with symptoms that are similar to those of plantar fasciitis. This may be related to the close anatomic connection between the PF and the paratenon of the Achilles tendon. Thus, both the Achilles tendon and PF should be carefully evaluated using ultrasound or MRI. Further, if MRI reveals marked bone marrow oedema at the calcaneal origin of the PF in patients with plantar fasciitis, a concomitant enthesopathy of the Achilles tendon should be suspected. The presence of plantar calcaneal spurs should also be assessed. Spur genesis has traditionally been attributed to chronic traction of the PF and repetitive microtrauma, which in turn lead to periostitis and calcification. The role of vertical compression of the heel in spur formation has recently been hypothesised and related to older age, osteoarthritis and obesity. As stated above, calcaneal spurs are not specific for plantar fasciitis and are often identified in asymptomatic individuals; however, a strong association between spurs and chronic plantar heel pain has been demonstrated, specifically in cases of concurrent fat pad abnormalities. Finally, entrapment of the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve (Baxter's neuropathy), stress fractures of the calcaneus, vascular disease and heel fat pad atrophy and necrosis may present with nonspecific heel pain and represent all differential diagnoses of PF disease.

In conclusion, PF disorders are common causes of heel pain and disability in the general population. Imaging is often required to confirm diagnosis or reveal concomitant injuries. As an inexpensive, quick and dynamic imaging technique that also provides high-resolution depiction of the PF and comparison with the contralateral side, ultrasound should be considered the modality of first choice for assessing PF disorders. Several indirect findings of PF disorders can be detected on conventional radiographs and should be identified even in patients examined for other reasons. MRI can reliably delineate both the soft tissue and bone anatomy of the sole of the foot and enables correct diagnosis of PF disorders, but is expensive and should be regarded as a second-line imaging modality.

Calcaneal stress fractures and plantar fascia rupture — In patients with heel pain, scans are highly sensitive for stress fractures of the calcaneus, and radiographic features include an area of linear sclerosis corresponding to the fracture site. Treatment is conservative and involves protection and immobilization of the involved foot, and progression to an acute fracture is uncommon. Soft tissue trauma (eg, acute plantar fascia rupture) also can cause heel pain even with negative radiographic and bone scan findings, and plantar fascia rupture has also been reported as a complication of heel corticosteroid injection.

### Management of calcaneal cysts in the pediatric population: a review [^117Cr1z2]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment Modalities

Observation

Conservative management is preferred in the pediatric and adult populations whenever possible. Observation is commonly used as the primary treatment modality regarding simple bone cysts. The main concern with observation is that the cyst could continue to progress, potentially leading to a pathologic fracture. When this occurs, there is a risk for long-term complications including, but not limited to, compromised bone or joint, which could give way to chronic pain. Pogoda et al.treated 40 of 50 (80%) of their patients over 10 years with observation and experienced no fractures based on their parameters of critical size and pain discussed above. Another study by Donaldson and Wrightshowed no pathologic fractures in the 24 patients they followed for a mean of 7 years. Finally, in a study published in the Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery, there were no complications of pathologic fractures reported in the 86 nonsurgical patients followed for 3 years. Despite there being no pathologic fractures in the observation group in these three studies, none showed healing of the cysts, defined as a reduction in size greater than 50%. This means that the theoretical risk of pathologic fracture that exists initially persists and likely increases over the patient's life.

Importantly, these studies, except for Donaldson and Wright, did not look at the pediatric population specifically. In addition, although none of these studies showed pathologic fracture in the observation arm, it is worth noting that there are numerous case reports discussing fractures that have occurred secondary to simple bone cysts. It is unknown if these case reports would be within the critical size and symptomatology parameters set forth by Pogoda et al. and thus warrant surgical treatment.

### Endoscopic fasciotomy for plantar fasciitis provides superior results when compared to a controlled non-operative treatment protocol: a randomized controlled trial [^1162E2d3]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Plantar fasciitis is a frequent and painful condition with a lifetime incidence of 10%. Good results have been reported for operative treatment of plantar fasciitis refractory to non-surgical interventions in uncontrolled studies. The aim of this study was to compare the results of operative treatment (endoscopic debridement, removal of the heel spur and partial resection of the plantar fascia) with those of a controlled and supervised non-operative rehabilitation program.

Methods

Thirty consecutive patients with plantar fasciitis during more than 3 months were randomized to either (1) non-operative treatment with corticosteroid injections and a controlled strength training program or (2) an endoscopic 2-incision operation with partial fasciotomy and heel spur removal followed by the same strength training program. Patients were evaluated at entry and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-operatively with the foot function index (FFI) and pain score during activity on a 100 mm VAS scale (VAS activity). FFI at 6 and 12 months was defined a priori as primary endpoint.

Results

Both groups improved significantly over time. The FFI score was significantly better in the operated group compared to the non-surgically treated group 12 months post-operatively (p = 0.033), at 24 months this was, however, not significant (p = 0.06). VAS activity at 24 months was significantly (p = 0.001) in favor of the operative group. More patients returned to running and jumping in the operative group (p = 0.04).

Conclusion

This randomized controlled trial found significant and clinically relevant superior results for the operative treatment of plantar fasciitis as measured by Foot Function Index at 1 year and by VAS activity at 2-year follow-up when compared to the results of a supervised rehabilitation program.

### Plantar and medial heel pain: diagnosis and management [^117Fr37P]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Heel pain is commonly encountered in orthopaedic practice. Establishing an accurate diagnosis is critical, but it can be challenging due to the complex regional anatomy. Subacute and chronic plantar and medial heel pain are most frequently the result of repetitive microtrauma or compression of neurologic structures, such as plantar fasciitis, heel pad atrophy, Baxter nerve entrapment, calcaneal stress fracture, and tarsal tunnel syndrome. Most causes of inferior heel pain can be successfully managed nonsurgically. Surgical intervention is reserved for patients who do not respond to nonsurgical measures. Although corticosteroid injections have a role in the management of select diagnoses, they should be used with caution.

### Management of insertional achilles tendinopathy [^113Jzxrx]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Insertional Achilles tendinopathy is a common condition that can lead to chronic, debilitating heel pain in athletes and nonathletes alike. Conservative treatment options include activity and shoe wear modification, physical therapy, injections, and extracorporeal shock wave therapy. When nonsurgical treatment fails, surgical treatment is recommended. Although there are options aimed at preserving the tendon and débriding the retrocalcaneal bursa and excess bone formation, others are aimed at detaching the Achilles tendon to perform a thorough débridement and subsequent reattachment. Additional or alternate procedures may include a calcaneal closing wedge osteotomy, gastrocnemius lengthening, and flexor hallucis longus tendon transfer. Recent advances in suture anchor techniques further add to the complexity of available options. This review discusses the relevant anatomy, biomechanics, and pathophysiology as well as the recent available evidence for nonsurgical and surgical management of this condition to guide surgeons in selecting the most appropriate treatment for their patients.

Translational Relevance

Despite being so common, causing high risks for patients, HPIs pathophysiology is not yet completely understood. In particular, mechanisms underlying relationship between bed rest and development of heel ulcers still need clarification, precluding so far the development of adequate strategies for diagnosis and management. Not to mention the importance of the crucial involvement or vital structures such as bone and calcaneal tendon. This is much more evident and disabling in frail elderly and babies.

Weaknesses for our study include its retrospective design, potential selection bias related to surgical approach choice, and assessment of reduction based on the treating surgeon's surgical note. Owing to the number of contributing centers, we were not able to validate radiographic measurements at each institution. Our minimum required follow-up was 90 days to ensure we were able to capture our primary outcome of deep infection. Our median follow-up was 248 days which was not long enough to fully evaluate for all secondary outcomes, especially posttraumatic arthritis. Future prospective evaluations of this topic could include appropriate randomization to control for underlying confounding factors. A prospective evaluation could also allow for collection of patient-reported outcome variables at specific postoperative time points.

### Heel spur syndrome: a retrospective report on the percutaneous plantar transverse incisional approach [^115db6jS]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate patient satisfaction and pain relief of chronic heel spur syndrome via a percutaneous plantar transverse incisional surgical approach. Forty-five patients underwent the procedure between June 1995 and August 1997; 29 responded to a questionnaire. Of the 29 respondents, a 96% success rate was obtained (the procedure met or exceeded patient expectations) at an average of 21 months postoperatively. Based on a 10-point visual analog scale, pain improved from an average of 8.4 ± 0.3 preoperatively to 1.2 ± 0.3 at the time of the survey. The surgical technique is also described.

### Does a corticosteroid injection plus exercise or exercise alone add to the effect of patient advice and a heel cup for patients with plantar fasciopathy? A randomised clinical trial [^112t9zH4]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Design

This randomised, single-blinded superiority trial with a three-group parallel design was prospectively registered on clinicaltrials.gov, and the trial protocol was published before the inclusion of the final participant. The trial reporting follows the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines, TIDieR and the CHAMP statement.

Participants

Individuals with PF were recruited from general practices of the North Denmark Region or via Facebook. The inclusion criteria were inferior heel pain ≥ 3 months, pain on palpation of the medial calcaneal tubercle or the proximal plantar fascia, plantar fascia thickness ≥ 4.0 mm measured using ultrasonography, and mean heel pain of ≥ 30 mm on a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) during the previous week. Exclusion criteria were below 18 years of age; diabetes; history of inflammatory systemic diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis or spondyloarthritis); prior heel surgery; pregnancy or breastfeeding; corticosteroid injection specifically for PF within the previous 6 months; pain or stiffness in the first metatarsophalangeal joint to an extent where the exercises cannot be performed; known hypersensitivity to corticosteroids or local anaesthetics; skin or soft tissue infection near the injection site; received any treatment by a healthcare professional for PF within the previous 12 weeks or made any substantial changes to usual self-care of the condition in the last 4 weeks (eg, started using insoles, started performing stretching, made a substantial decrease in physical activity level). These criteria are in line with those of similar studies in this patient population.

### Determining the feasibility of exercise therapy and activity modification for treating adolescents with heel pain: a study protocol [^117GJkHe]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Background

Little is known about the development of Achilles tendon injury during adolescent years. Adolescents with insidious symptoms and pain at the posterior heel are commonly diagnosed as calcaneal apophysitis. Calcaneal apophysitis is caused by repeated pull and strain at the cartilaginous growth plate where the Achilles tendon inserts. The condition affects 3.7 per 1000 adolescents, with the highest prevalence in boys aged 8–15 years and girls 7–13 years. In adults, the same symptoms are clinically diagnosed as Achilles tendinopathy, defined by Achilles tendon pain with loading and loss of function.

Calcaneal apophysitis may be the most common diagnosis for heel pain in adolescents because little evidence for the presence of Achilles tendon injury and the associated tendon structural alterations (tendon thickening, altered mechanical properties) exists in this population. Calcaneal apophysitis is a clinical diagnosis that relies on the patient history of gradual onset of heel pain with activity and the patient's age (< 18 years old) relative to maturity. Radiograph is considered uninformative due to the appearance of a separated apophysial plate, which is seen in all skeletally immature children. Therefore, a radiograph is rarely used to confirm the diagnosis. Without imaging to confirm the diagnosis, the main distinction between a diagnosis of calcaneal apophysitis or Achilles tendinopathy is patient age and pain location. Considering chronological age and biological development are not equivalent, it is plausible that Achilles tendon injury masquerades as calcaneal apophysitis in some adolescents. The lack of description regarding pain location in studies may also contribute to the historic disregard of Achilles tendon involvement in adolescents. Few studies have used ultrasound imaging when evaluating adolescent patients with heel paindespite the frequent use of ultrasound for adults with tendon injuries. Determining the presence of Achilles tendon pain and/or altered tendon structure in adolescents diagnosed with calcaneal apophysitis is a critical concern considering that injury to either structure may prompt different treatment approaches.

### Successful application of focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy for plantar fasciitis in patients suffering from metastatic breast cancer [^116pkz1B]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

Patient history

A 75-year-old Caucasian female was referred to the Department of Physical Medicine, Rehabilitation and Occupational Medicine of the Medical University of Vienna with a diagnosis of polyneuropathy. The patient described a bilateral heel pain with a gradual onset, beginning approximately 4 months before the referral. The pain was of an undulating intensity, with maxima reaching 81 mm on a visual analog scale while walking upon getting out of bed. As the painful area was located medially on the heel, the patient was forced to put her weight on the lateral rim of the foot while walking.

The walking ability was severely reduced, with a maximum uninterrupted walking distance of approximately 100 m. The limiting factor was a pain in the lateral compartment of the left knee, which had become apparent about the same time as the heel pain. However, recurring knee pain had been known for several years before the referral.

She was suffering from breast cancer, which was diagnosed in 2014 and had been treated with surgery, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Metastatic bone disease was ascertained at the time of diagnosis and consisted of lesions in the spine, pelvic bones, and several ribs. No recent progression of the underlying disease had been observed.

Clinical presentation

In the clinical examination, the heel pain was localized on both sides along the medial part of the insertion of the plantar aponeurosis on the calcaneus, as well as along the most medial bundle of its central part. Pressure on these areas elicited pain of the same quality and location as experienced during walking.

A recent bone scintigraphy showed no tracer uptake in the feet. Uptake in the medial condyle of the left femur and of the left tibia was consistent with osteoarthritis.

Plain radiographs revealed a plantar heel spur on both sides, without indication of bone lesions. The plain radiograph of the left calcaneus is shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Plain radiograph of the left calcaneus. Arrow indicates plantar heel spur

Ultrasound showed a thickening of the plantar aponeurosis near the insertion on the calcaneus, with a thickness of 4.9 mm on the left side and 4.8 mm on the right side.

Polyneuropathy was excluded through electrodiagnostic testing.

### Imaging of plantar fascia disorders: findings on plain radiography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging [^115UF2dL]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Fig. 4
Plantar fasciitis. Lateral plain radiograph shows PF thickening (double-head arrow), a calcaneal spur located within the PF (open arrow) and another spur at the origin of intrinsic muscles of the foot (arrow); cortical irregularities of the calcaneus with sclerotic changes are also seen (a). On ultrasound, the PF is thickened and hypoechoic (double-head arrow) with a minute calcification (open arrow) at its insertion into the calcaneus (b). On colour-Doppler ultrasound, hypervascularisation of the PF and adjacent soft tissues is demonstrated (c)

Plantar fibromatosis or Ledderhose disease (Fig. 5) is a benign nodular formation due to fibroblastic proliferation in the PF. It tends to involve the distal two thirds of the PF, usually in its central bundle, although proximal nodules are not uncommon. Nodular lesions may be multiple and bilateral and typically measure less than 3 cm in diameter. Plantar fibromatosis is frequently seen as an isolated disease, but an association with Dupuytren's disease has been noted. Clinically, plantar fibroma appears as a firm thickening or a single nodule, generally localised in the medial portion of the sole, which is occasionally painful.

Fig. 5
Ledderhose disease. MRI shows a fusiform thickening (arrows) in the distal portion of the PF with low signal intensity on both T1-weighted (a) and fluid-sensitive images (b). On ultrasound, a well-demarcated, hypoechoic nodule is demonstrated (c) with no increased internal vascularity (d)

Tears of the PF (Fig. 6) are uncommon and can be partial or complete. Traumatic tears are often related to forcible plantar flexion of the foot in competitive athletes, mostly runners and jumpers; these are typically distal to calcaneal insertion of the PF and chronic overuse is considered an aetiological factor. Spontaneous ruptures may occur at the calcaneal attachment of the PF in patients with previous history of plantar fasciitis and local treatment with steroid injections. Clinical presentation includes acute pain, usually accompanied by a "snap" noise, and local swelling.

### Plantar fasciitis: evaluation and treatment [^112CfzPU]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of plantar heel pain. Its characteristic features are pain and tenderness, predominately on the medial aspect of the calcaneus near the sole of the heel. Considering a complete differential diagnosis of plantar heel pain is important; a comprehensive history and physical examination guide accurate diagnosis. Many nonsurgical treatment modalities have been used in managing the disorder, including rest, massage, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, night splints, heel cups/pads, custom and off-the-shelf orthoses, injections, casts, and physical therapy measures such as shock wave therapy. Most reported treatment outcomes rely on anecdotal experience or combinations of multiple modalities. Nevertheless, nonsurgical management of plantar fasciitis is successful in approximately 90% of patients. Surgical treatment is considered in only a small subset of patients with persistent, severe symptoms refractory to nonsurgical intervention for at least 6 to 12 months.

### Effectiveness of four different treatment modalities in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis during a 36-month follow-up period: a randomized controlled trial [^116Xmbg3]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

No consensus has been reached about the best treatment method of plantar fasciitis and the results of the treatment methods have been inconsistent. The objective of the present study was to compare the therapeutic effects of extracorporeal shock wave therapy, platelet-rich plasma injection, local corticosteroid injection, and prolotherapy for the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis using a randomized, controlled, prospective study. We performed a randomized controlled prospective clinical study of 4 groups. The first group received extracorporeal shock wave therapy, the second group received prolotherapy, the third group received platelet-rich plasma injection, and the fourth group received a local corticosteroid injection. The study included 158 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of chronic plantar fasciitis with a symptomatic heel spur. The clinical outcomes were assessed using the visual analog scale and Revised Foot Function Index. At the end of the follow-up period, the mean visual analog scale scores for all 4 groups were similar to the mean visual analog scale scores before treatment. At the end of the follow-up period, no significant improvement was noted in the Revised Foot Function Index score in any of the groups. The corticosteroid injection was more effective in the first 3 months and extracorporeal shock wave therapy was an effective treatment method in the first 6 months in regard to pain. The corticosteroid injection lost its effectiveness during the follow-up period. The effect of prolotherapy and platelet-rich plasma was seen within 3 to 12 months; however, at the 36-month follow-up point, no differences were found among the 4 treatments.

### Management of calcaneal cysts in the pediatric population: a review [^115NE5cD]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Cysts of the bone are a common pathology that, although benign, are frequently treated because of their tendency to compromise the integrity of affected bone. Two common entities are unicameral bone cysts and aneurysmal bone cysts. Although these are two distinct pathologies, they are treated similarly and thus will be discussed in tandem. The optimal treatment of calcaneal bone cysts in pediatric patients has long been debated among orthopaedic surgeons because of the relatively small number of cases and varied results within the literature. Currently, there are three lines of thought regarding treatment: observation, injection, and surgical intervention. When considering which course of treatment is best for an individual patient, the surgeon must consider the fracture risk without treatment, the risk of complications with treatment, and the recurrence rate with each treatment approach. There are limited data on pediatric calcaneal cysts specifically. Still, there are much data concerning simple bone cysts of long bones in the pediatric population and calcaneal cysts in the adult population. Because of the lack of literature on the subject, there is a need for a review of the available literature and a consensus on the approach to treating calcaneal cysts in the pediatric population.

### A retrospective comparison of percutaneous plantar fasciotomy and open plantar fasciotomy with heel spur resection [^116SMria]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Minimally invasive surgery for the treatment of recalcitrant heel pain is a relatively new approach. To compare the 2 approaches, a retrospective chart review was conducted of 53 patients (55 feet) who had undergone surgical treatment of plantar fasciitis by either open fasciotomy with heel spur resection or percutaneous medial fascial release. The outcomes measures included perioperative pain and the interval to return to full activity. Pain was measured on a subjective 10-point visual analog scale. Of the 55 fasciotomies performed, 23 were percutaneous and 32 were open, with adjunctive heel spur resection. The percutaneous group experienced a mean pain reduction of 5.69 points at the first postoperative visit, whereas open fasciotomy group experienced a mean pain reduction of 3.53 points. At 12 months postoperatively, no statistically significant difference was found in the pain levels between the 2 groups. The results also showed that the percutaneous group returned to normal activity an average of 2.82 weeks (p < .001) faster than the open group. In the patient cohorts studied, percutaneous medial fascial release was as effective at resolving recalcitrant plantar fasciitis pain as the open procedure and involved less postoperative pain and a faster return to full activity.

### Treatment of unicameral bone cysts of the calcaneus: a systematic review [^115nHXXg]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The calcaneus is the most common tarsal affected by unicameral bone cysts (UBCs); however, the treatment of calcaneal UBCs remains controversial. The purpose of the present systematic review was to evaluate the treatment modalities for calcaneal UBCs. A systematic review was performed using clinical studies of calcaneal UBCs with a minimum of 1 year of follow-up and level I to IV evidence. Ten studies with 171 patients (181 cysts) were selected. Heel pain and radiographic cyst consolidation were the primary outcomes. A series of Z tests were used to compare the outcomes in the nonoperative and operative groups, cannulated screw and bone augmentation groups, and autografting and allografting groups. All patients treated with open curettage and bone augmentation had significant improvements in heel pain (p < .001). Only 1.1% ± 1.0% of the cysts treated conservatively had healed on radiographs compared with 93.0% ± 13.0% of the cysts after surgery (p < .001). A greater percentage of patients treated with bone augmentation had preoperative heel pain and resolution of that pain than did patients treated with cannulated screws (p < .001). Autografting had a significantly greater percentage of radiographic cyst consolidation than did allografting (97.4% ± 11.1% versus 85.1% ± 15.8%, p < .001, Z = 3.5). Objective outcomes data on calcaneal UBCs are relatively sparse. The results of the present review suggest that open curettage with autograft bone augmentation is the most effective procedure. We would encourage future comparative clinical studies to elucidate differences in UBC treatment modalities.

### Imaging of plantar fascia disorders: findings on plain radiography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging [^111ZNVJJ]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Plain radiography

Plain radiography is widespread, cost-effective and panoramic, thus often representing the imaging modality of first choice for the evaluation of painful heel.

Several findings suggestive of plantar fasciitis can be detected on conventional radiographs. Despite this, plain radiography should not be used to make a diagnosis of plantar fasciitis without knowledge of clinical history or physical examination findings. PF thickness can be measured with accuracy on lateral plain radiographs of the ankle and foot. PF mean thickness at its calcaneal origin, in the central fascicle, is 4.0 mm. Increased thickness of the PF measuring more than 4–5 mm within 5 mm of its calcaneal attachment is evident on lateral plain radiographs of individuals with plantar fasciitis (Figs. 2, 3 and 4) and represents a reliable sign of plantar fasciitis. Deep below the PF, at its calcaneal origin, a fat pad is seen and usually has a triangular shape on lateral non-weight-bearing plain radiographs. This fat pad becomes narrowed or is absent in individuals with plantar fasciitis, maybe owing to both mechanical and inflammatory mechanisms, thus representing a further sign of plantar fasciitis. The combination of thickened PF and fat pad abnormalities on lateral plain radiography has a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 95% for plantar fasciitis. Changes in the cortex of the calcaneus at the attachment of the PF, with or without spur formation, have been correlated with plantar fasciitis (Fig. 4). These are cortical irregularities presenting with loss of the smooth contour of the bone and both cortical lucency and sclerosis.

### Management of calcaneal cysts in the pediatric population: a review [^116t2sL3]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

ABCs are estimated to account for as many as one-quarter of the lesions in the calcaneus, with about two of every three arising de novo and the rest the resulting sequelae of other oncologic processes. One theory that has strong support is that venous obstruction is responsible for the formation and progression of these cysts through increased intraosseous pressure. A biopsy, which is often necessary to differentiate from other pathologies such as a chondroblastoma, will demonstrate an expansive capillary network lined by endothelial cells with or without remnants from a preexisting lesion dependent on if the lesion is secondary to another process or arising de novo. Treatment success rates are determined by the activity level of the cyst, with active lesions requiring more aggressive margin resection and bone grafting.

The optimal treatment of calcaneal bone cysts in pediatric patients has long been debated among orthopaedic surgeons because of the relatively small number of cases and varied results within the literature. Currently, there are three lines of thought regarding treatment: observation with serial radiographs, injection with steroids or bone marrow, and surgical intervention. Although each of these treatment groups has numerous variations, we will discuss them collectively in this article. When considering which course of treatment is best for an individual patient, the surgeon must consider the fracture risk without treatment, the risk of complications with treatment, and the recurrence rate with each treatment approach. There are limited data on pediatric calcaneal cysts specifically. Still, there are much data concerning simple bone cysts of long bones in the pediatric population and calcaneal cysts in the adult population. Because of the lack of literature on the subject, there is a need for a review of the available literature and a consensus on the approach to treating calcaneal cysts in the pediatric population.

### Radiotherapy in painful heel spurs (plantar fasciitis) – results of a national patterns of care study [^113F4Btb]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

After a general patterns of care study, the German Cooperative Group on Radiotherapy for Benign Diseases conducted a multicenter cohort study to analyze radiotherapy (RT) in painful heel spur syndrome (HSS).

Methods and Materials

In 2001, a patterns of care study was conducted in all German RT institutions using a standardized structured questionnaire. Patient accrual, patient number, pretreatment, pain record, treatment indications, RT technique, and target volume concepts for painful HSS were assessed. In addition, the functional and subjective outcomes were evaluated.

Results

Of the institutions, 146 (79.3%) returned the questionnaire: 10 (6.8%) reported no clinical experience with RT for HSS, and 136 (93.2%) treated 3621 patients annually, a median of 23 cases/institution. The indications for treatment were chronic or therapy refractory pain. The total dose ranged between 2.5 and 18.75 Gy (median 6), and single fractions ranged between 0.3 and 1. 5 Gy (median 1). Of the responding institutions, 44.9% applied two fractions and 37.5% three fractions weekly. RT was delivered with orthovoltage units (38.2%), linear accelerators (53.7%), (60)Co units (5.1%), or other treatment units (3%). Seventy-six institutions presented their retrospective clinical evaluation in a total of 7947 patients. Pain reduction for at least 3 months was reported in 70%, and persistent pain reduction was reported in 65% of the treated patients. In 19 institutions, a second RT series was applied for inadequate pain response or early pain recurrence. No radiogenic acute or chronic side effects were observed.

Conclusion

The study comprised the largest number of cases reported of RT for painful HSS. Despite variations in the daily RT practice, this national patterns of care study represents a very large number of painful and refractory HSS cases that were treated effectively with RT.

### Inferior heel pain in soccer players: a retrospective study with a proposal for guidelines of treatment [^116HpnsC]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

The cause of heel pain among soccer players is multifactorial and is related to repetitive microtrauma due to impact forces involving technical moves, but also the playground, the exercise mode, the recovery time, the climatic conditions and the footwear used.

Aim

To investigate the aetiology of plantar heel pain of soccer players with the objective of proposing an example of guidelines for treatment.

Methods

We investigated the prevalence and characteristics of inferior heel pain of 1473 professional, semiprofessional and amateur players. All evaluated subjects were submitted to a specific rehabilitation protocol that involved advanced physical therapies and viscoelastic insoles depending on the aetiology of pain.

Results

Clinical and instrumental examinations revealed that 960 of 1473 athletes had inferior heel pain. These patients were divided into seven groups based on aetiology: sural nerve compression, abductor digiti minimi compression, atrophy and inflammation of the fat pad, plantar fasciitis, stress injury of the heel spur, stress fracture of the heel bone and heel spur. The proposed rehabilitation treatment aims for a reduction of pain and an early return to sports, with excellent results.

Conclusions

According to what was observed in the present study, related also to the specific treatment of inferior heel pain, and considering the technological progress achieved in recent years, we can now propose an integrated therapeutic approach to treatment of heel pain, properly differentiated according to specific aetiology.

### Impact of plantar fasciitis on the quality of life of male and female patients according to the foot health status questionnaire [^115RLZVF]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Plantar fasciitis (PF; also known as "plantar heel pain") is a common foot disorder in adults secondary to an inflammatory response caused by repetitive micro-trauma. PF is commonly observed by health care practitioners, and is a musculoskeletal disease. Typically, this pain is described as "burning", "aching" and, occasionally, "lancinating". PF may increase during the first steps after waking-up or a prolonged rest. Furthermore, this pain can be associated with tenderness at the medial calcaneal tuberosity and along the plantar fascia.

PF may affect > 1 million people worldwide per year. The exact prevalence of PF is not known. The lifetime prevalence may reach 10% of the general population worldwide. A local population study of 3206 participants in Australia showed that the prevalence of heel pain was 3.6%. Landorf reported that the prevalence and prognosis of PF are not clear, though the symptoms seem to resolve over time in most people. Approximately 11%–15% of all foot symptoms require long-term professional care and affect all age groups, sexes, and ethnicities, with a higher prevalence noted in females aged 40–60 years.

Terms such as "jogger's heel", "tennis heel" or "policeman's heel" have been used to describe PF. Indeed, the most common etiologies of heel pain are mechanical factors. Common causes of heel pain include heel spur, Sever's disease, heel bump, Achilles tendinopathy, heel neuritis, and heel bursitis. After the initial inflammatory response and repetitive micro-trauma of plantar aponeurosis, myxoid degeneration with PF fragmentation as well as vascular ectasia in bone marrow, are the most common histologic findings. Therefore, PF may be considered a degenerative fasciosis in the absence of inflammation.

Pain and tenderness are sometimes extended into the medial arch. Pain associated with this condition may cause substantial disability and poor health-related quality of life (QoL). Risk factors include obesity, occupations that necessitate prolonged standing, pes planus, limited ankle dorsiflexion, plantar heel spurs and running, sedentary or athletic occupations, excessive foot pronation, and excessive running.

### The heel complex: anatomy, imaging, pathologic conditions, and treatment [^112PVkqZ]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis for heel pain is broad but primarily involves abnormalities of the Achilles tendon, calcaneus, and plantar fascia. Achilles tendon disorders include tendinosis, tendinitis, and partial or complete tears. Tendinosis refers to tendon degeneration, while tendinitis is inflammation after acute overload. Untreated tendinosis can progress to partial or complete tears. Tendon disorders can be accompanied by paratenonitis or inflammation of the loose sheath enclosing the tendon. Initial management involves rehabilitation and image-guided procedures. Operative management is reserved for tendon tears and includes direct repair, tendon transfer, and graft reconstruction. The calcaneus is the most commonly fractured tarsal bone. The majority of fractures are intra-articular; extra-articular fractures, stress or insufficiency fractures, medial process avulsion, and neuropathic avulsion can also occur. Posterosuperior calcaneal exostosis or Haglund deformity, retrocalcaneal bursitis, and insertional Achilles tendinosis form the characteristic triad of Haglund syndrome. It is initially managed with orthotics and physiotherapy. Operative management aims to correct osseous or soft-tissue derangements. The plantar fascia is a strong fibrous tissue that invests the sole of the foot and contributes to midfoot stability. Inflammation or plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain and can be related to overuse or mechanical causes. Acute rupture is less common but can occur in preexisting plantar fasciitis. Conservative treatment includes footwear modification, calf stretches, and percutaneous procedures. The main operative treatment is plantar fasciotomy. Plantar fibromatosis is a benign fibroblastic proliferation within the fascia that can be locally aggressive and is prone to recurrence. © RSNA, 2024 Test Your Knowledge questions for this article are available in the supplemental material.

### Management of calcaneal malunion [^1143AZ2A]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

The potential for disabling malunion following calcaneal fracture is high, regardless whether a patient is treated nonsurgically or surgically. Fracture displacement typically results in loss of hindfoot height, varus heel position, and widening of the hindfoot, with possible subfibular impingement and irritation of the peroneal tendon and/or sural nerve. Frequently, the subtalar joint develops posttraumatic arthritis. In symptomatic patients with calcaneal malunion, systematic evaluation is required to determine the source of pain. Nonsurgical treatment, such as activity modification, bracing, orthoses, and injection, is effective in many patients. Surgical treatment may involve simple ostectomy, subtalar arthrodesis with or without distraction, or corrective calcaneal osteotomy. A high rate of successful arthrodesis and of patient satisfaction has been reported with surgical management.

Unlabelled

This article reviews the diagnosis, pathology, and treatment of plantar heel neuroma, an entity that has previously been described and recognized, yet one that we feel warrants further review because of the prevalence of plantar heel pain that does not respond to the usual array of treatments. We feel that neuroma of the medial calcaneal nerve often goes undiagnosed, and may progress to a severely painful condition that requires surgical intervention. In this article, we describe another case of heel neuroma in an otherwise healthy patient with a history of chronic plantar heel pain that was unresponsive to a wide array of nonsurgical treatments.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy in runners with a symptomatic heel spur [^114neWUS]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this paper is to assess the benefit to treat plantar fasciitis with low-dose energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) and the efficacy of such treatment to abate the painful symptoms allowing a rapid return to the running activity. Our study included 54 running athletes treated for plantar fasciitis associated with a heel spur who received four sessions (once weekly) of low-dose ESWT, and followed prospectively on average 45 days, 6 and 24 months after their last session. The clinical results were excellent in 59% of cases, good in 12%, satisfactory in 21% and distinctly unsatisfactory in 8%. No patient was observed a significant modification of the heel spur at the follow-up X-ray. The ultrasound examination at 24 months showed a disappearance of the inflammation signs in 61% of cases. A strong correlation between ultrasound improvement and clinical results were found. Low-energy ESWT seems to be a good mean to treat plantar fasciitis in runners with a 71% of good or excellent results and a persistent improvement lasting 24 months. A randomized multicentric study seems to be necessary to define the type of energy that should be used in the future to treat plantar fasciitis, in particular in the athletic patients, to allow a faster return to sports activities.

### Nerve entrapment syndromes of the lower limb: a pictorial review [^1169xBPH]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

A clinically important branch of the lateral plantar nerve is the first branch, the inferior calcaneal nerve, also known as Baxter's nerve (shown in Fig. 2 (a)). Entrapment of this nerve can occur at three sites: deep to or adjacent to the fascial edge of a hypertrophied abductor hallucis muscle in long-distance runners, at the medial edge of the quadratus plantae muscle where the nerve changes from a vertical to a horizontal course, and most commonly at the medial calcaneal tuberosity. Entrapment at the latter site can be related to spur formation and soft-tissue inflammatory changes of plantar fasciitis (Fig. 5). Patients typically present with heel pain. MRI findings include denervation oedema or fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle. Abductor hallucis muscle hypertrophy and plantar fasciitis may be found as potential sources of inferior calcaneal nerve entrapment. Ultrasound can be utilised to trace the nerve, to detect abductor digiti minimi atrophy and also to perform the ultrasonographic Tinel's sign.

### Coexistence of plantar calcaneal spurs and plantar fascial thickening in individuals with plantar heel pain [^113Txqfo]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To examine associations between plantar calcaneal spurs, plantar fascia thickening and plantar heel pain (PHP), and to determine whether tenderness on palpation of the heel differentiates between these presentations.

Methods

Adults aged ⩾50 years registered with four general practices were mailed a Health Survey. Responders reporting foot pain within the last 12 months underwent a detailed clinical assessment. PHP in the past month was documented using a foot manikin. Plantar calcaneal spurs were identified from weight-bearing lateral radiographs and plantar fascia thickening (defined as > 4 mm) from ultrasound. Tenderness on palpation of the plantar fascia insertion was documented. Associations between these factors and PHP were explored using generalized estimating equations.

Results

Clinical and radiographic data were available from 530 participants (296 women, mean [s.d.] age 64.9 [8.4] years), 117 (22.1%) of whom reported PHP. Plantar calcaneal spurs and plantar fascia thickening were identified in 281 (26.5%) and 501 (47.3%) feet, respectively, but frequently coexisted (n = 217, 20.4%). Isolated plantar calcaneal spurs were rare (n = 64, 6.0%). Participants with PHP were more likely to have a combination of these features compared with those without PHP (odds ratio 2.16, 95% CI 1.24, 3.77, P = 0.007). Tenderness on palpation of the heel was not associated with plantar calcaneal spurs or plantar fascia thickening, either in isolation or in combination, in those with PHP.

Conclusion

Plantar calcaneal spurs and plantar fascial thickening are associated with PHP, but frequently coexist. Tenderness on palpation of the heel does not appear to differentiate between clinical presentations of PHP.

Heel pain, whether plantar or posterior, is predominantly a mechanical pathology although an array of diverse pathologies including neurologic, arthritic, traumatic, neoplastic, infectious, or vascular etiologies must be considered. This clinical practice guideline (CPG) is a revision of the original 2001 document developed by the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons (ACFAS) heel pain committee.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Setting

The University of Toronto PsA clinic has recruited and prospectively followed patients with PsA since 1978. Patients are enrolled if they have psoriasis and inflammatory arthritis. Over 99% fulfill the classification criteria for PsA. Patients are evaluated at the time of recruitment into the clinic and every 6 to 12 months according to a standard protocol that includes a detailed history, physical examination, and laboratory assessment. Radiographs of peripheral joints and spine are obtained at baseline (clinic entry) and every 2 years and are scored according to the modified Steinbrocker method for peripheral jointsand the New York criteria for sacroiliac joints. The presence of syndesmophytes, atlantoaxial subluxation, degenerative disc disease (DDD) (cervical and/or thoracolumbar), calcaneal spurs (Achilles and/or plantar), and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is also recorded. Radiographs are scored by at least two rheumatologists by consensus. All information is collected via a web portal and stored in a database. We have previously shown that the methods of clinical and radiographic evaluation in our cohort are reliable, with no systematic bias with regard to disease severity and follow‐up.

Data collection

From our program database, we retrieved data (between 1978 and 2024) at the patients' first evaluation in the clinic and at 6 to 12 month intervals, including age, sex, ethnicity, age at the diagnosis of psoriasis and PsA, duration of PsA, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities (ever smoking, fibromyalgia, DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease), and the presence of mechanical and/or inflammatory back pain. Patients were classified as having MetS at their last clinic visit if they satisfied the harmonized definition by Alberti et al. According to this definition, the condition is diagnosed when any three of the five following risk factors are present:
Elevated waist circumference with sex, population, and country‐specific criteria.
Elevated triglycerides, defined as ≥ 150 mg/dL or its treatment.
Decreased high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, defined as < 40 mg/dL in men and < 50 mg/dL in women or its treatment.
Elevated blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 85 mm Hg or its treatment.
Elevated fasting glucose, defined as blood glucose > 100 mg/dL or its treatment.

### Calcaneal spurs… [^1165drsH]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Painful heels have for purposes of treatment been classified into those cases in which a calcaneal spur can be demonstrated roentgenographically and those in which no spur is present. In most cases in which no spur is demonstrable, relief is obtained by the use of well fitting supports applied to the plantar area of the foot which relax the structures. In those cases in which a calcaneal spur can be demonstrated and in which there is pain treatment has been both conservative and radical. The conservative treatment consists of avoidance of weight bearing as well as the use of certain types of heels, shoe correction and the use of soft insoles. The radical treatment is concerned with either the surgical removal of the spur or some other method designed to remove weight bearing on the point of the spur, such as the. Regan JR.

### Comparison of the treatment effects of different methods in patients with calcaneal spur… [^115fj9jh]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Comparison Of The Treatment Effects Of Different Methods In Patients With Calcaneal SpurClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Calcaneal spur is one of the most common disorders associated with foot pain. Patients may complain of pain at every step during the day, so it is important to find the most effective treatment method for patients. The aim of this study is to compare the therapeutic efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave therapy and kinesiology taping in patients with calcaneal spurs. Thirty patients with calcaneal spurs will be included in the study. The gender, age, body weight, height, body mass index, and affected side of the patients will be recorded. Patients will be randomly divided into three treatment groups: ESWT to the first group, KB therapy to the second group, and combined ESWT+KB to the third group. Treatment aims to reduce pain, reduce inflation, and shrink and eliminate the spur.

Conservative treatment includes exercises, massage, ultrasound, phonophoresis, laser, short wave diathermy, cryotherapy and extracorporeal shock wave therapy as physiotherapy applications. ESWT are pressure waves delivered to the body to stimulate soft tissue growth through local hyperemia, neovascularization, reduction of calcification, inhibition of pain receptors and denervation to provide pain relief and healing of chronic processes. ESWT is also used effectively in the treatment of calcaneal spur. The aim of this study is to observe the superiority, if any, of ESWT and KB in the treatment of each other or to show how effective the combined application of the two is in the treatment of calcaneal spur. This study will be a single-blind, randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of BP and ESWT in patients with calcaneal spurs.

All procedures used will be carried out in accordance with the ethical rules of the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the Amasya University Clinical Research Ethics Committee. Inclusion criteria for the study were diagnosis of calcaneal spur by a physician, being in the age range of 30–70 years, patient complaining of pain in the heel region, appearance of calcaneal protrusion in the radiographic image, no other treatment or medication., steroids, other drugs, etc.) analgesics) and the patient volunteered to participate in the study.

### Heel pain: diagnosis and management… [^111R772m]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Initial treatment is typically conservative, with rest, activity modification, stretching, strengthening exercises, ice massage, and use of anti-inflammatory or analgesic medications. 1, 4, 5 Custom or prefabricated orthotics, arch taping, night splinting, and physical therapy are effective and can be combined with more conservative approaches. 4–7 Corticosteroid and platelet-rich plasma injections — particularly when performed with ultrasound guidance — can provide short-term pain relief and are often used when conservative measures are ineffective or more immediate pain control is desired. Effective treatments include activity modification, eccentric exercises, reduction of pressure to the area, deep friction massage, tendon mobilization, and use of analgesic medications and heel lifts or other orthotic devices. 22, 25 Some studies have shown benefit with extracorporeal shock wave therapy 26 and nitroglycerin patches.

27 Kinesiology taping 28 and corticosteroid or platelet-rich plasma injections 22, 24 have been found ineffective for Achilles tendinopathy. Injections, particularly with corticosteroids, should be avoided because of the risk of tendon rupture. Severe cases may require surgery. Treatment is aimed at decreasing pressure and inflammation and may include wearing open-heeled shoes, corticosteroid injections, physical therapy, and use of anti-inflammatory or analgesic medications. 13, 29 In refractory cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the deformity. 13, 29. 1 Treatment is conservative and includes limiting of pain-inducing activities, use of anti-inflammatory or analgesic medications, ice, stretching and strengthening the gastrocnemius-soleus complex, and shoe modifications with orthotics, heel cups, or lifts. 30, 31.

18, 33 Treatment is typically conservative and consists of activity modification, corticosteroid injections, biomechanical interventions, and use of oral or topical anti-inflammatory medications, orthotic devices, and neuromodulator medications. Surgery can be considered if conservative measures are ineffective. 17, 18, 33. 34 Treatment includes ice, massage, taping, balance and proprioceptive training, muscle strengthening, corticosteroid injections, and use of anti-inflammatory medications, ankle braces, and orthotics. 1, 34 Surgery is usually required in patients for whom rehabilitation has been ineffective. 34 This article updates previous articles on this topic by Tu and Bytomski.

### Treatment for calcaneal apophysitis… [^116oKCLQ]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What are effective therapies for calcaneal apophysitis. Evidence-Based Answer Several treatments for calcaneal apophysitis may produce modest short-term improvements in pain scores. Heel inserts and prefabricated orthotics may initially improve pain scores and dysfunction, but patients have equal improvement by three months with or without therapy. Evidence Summary A clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of inserts and footwear for persons with calcaneal apophysitis found that two inserts were associated with improved pain scores. A control group of five patients 10 to 13 years of age had pain scores measured before and after seven to eight weeks of no treatment. During the trial, patients were active at least three times per week in their two most painful sports.

Patients using inserts had decreased heel pain during treatment; mean soccer and running pain scores changed from 4. 0 and
4. 5, respectively, to 2, then returned to near-pretreatment levels after treatment. Mean pain scores for those in the control group decreased from 7 to 6. A follow-up crossover study comparing the same heel cup and wedge used in the previous study found that the heel cup was more effective in reducing pain scores. 3 Patients were randomized to the heel cup or wedge for four weeks, followed by a two-week washout period. They then crossed over to the other treatment. The study used the same 10-point pain scale used in the previous study. After four weeks, the heel cup was associated with more pain relief during activity. When patients were offered their choice of treatment, the heel cup was preferred.

Another randomized controlled trial of 101 patients eight to 15 years of age who had calcaneal apophysitis found no differences at 10 weeks in examiner-induced pain with pressure measured using a standardized scale. Patients were randomized to one of three treatments: a wait-and-see protocol, use of shock-absorbing heel inserts, and physical therapy focusing on eccentric calf-strengthening exercises.

### A comparison of the analgesic efficacies of ultrasound and shock wave therapy in the patients with calcaneal spur… [^117SYNdk]. ClinicalTrials (2011). Low credibility.

The study included 52 patients of both sexes, aged 38–86 with plantar heel spur confirmed radiographically. The patients were randomly divided into two groups; in Group 1 the patients underwent ultrasound procedure and in Group 2
- radial shock wave procedure. In the studied periods of time a decrease in pain was observed. The most rapid change was noted in both the groups after the first week of treatment. Ultrasound and shock wave therapies show a comparably significant analgesic efficacy in patients with heel spur. Shock wave therapy has an advantage over ultrasound therapy. A smaller number of procedures is required to obtain comparable results, which makes the therapy less expensive. No side effects were observed during and after the treatment. The study was conducted on a group of 52 patients of both sexes, aged 38–86 years with a plantar calcaneal spur confirmed by X-ray images. Patients were treated in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Day Unit of the University Hospital im. WAM
- Central Veterans Hospital in Lodz and Municipal Health Clinic of Andrespol. In order to compare the effectiveness of the two forms of physiotherapy, ultrasound and radial shock wave therapy, the patients were randomly assigned into two groups: In addition, all patients underwent kinesitherapy
- exercises to strengthen the muscles that bending plantar and supinated foot to improve the mobility of the feet and to maintain the normal longitudinal arch of the foot. SPR orthopedic inserts with a pit on the painful area was used to support the longitudinal foot arch and relieve the medial ridge of the calcaneal tumor. The study was conducted on a group of 52 patients of both sexes, aged 38–86 years with a plantar calcaneal spur confirmed by X-ray images.
