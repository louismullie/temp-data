## Question

Using Skyrizi in pregnancy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage Skyrizi (risankizumab) use in pregnancy, including considerations of human and animal data, guideline recommendations, timing of placental transfer, and implications for neonatal vaccines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and the quality of human pregnancy data. Then, I should review animal toxicology and translate it into human exposure context. Next, I will examine placental transfer kinetics and the timing of highest fetal exposure. After that, I need to appraise disease-related maternal and fetal risks that could shift the risk–benefit balance. Then, I should align recommendations with professional society guidelines and weigh competing guidance. Finally, I will translate this into practical management steps, including monitoring, vaccine planning, and lactation considerations, and close with a cautious conclusion that reflects uncertainty and registry enrollment.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status and human data landscape. The FDA labeling states that available human data are insufficient to define a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse outcomes with risankizumab, and there is a pregnancy exposure registry (GLOW) that patients should be encouraged to join, which underscores the paucity of prospective human safety data and the need for ongoing pharmacovigilance [^113mkYB2] [^114vapvN]. I should also verify that large prospective registries for biologics in IBD do not currently provide robust risankizumab-specific outcomes; the AGA guidance extrapolates class safety from TNF inhibitors and ustekinumab to newer anti–IL-23 agents, but acknowledges the evidence gap for risankizumab, reinforcing that any recommendation remains conditional and data-limited [^112txnwu].

> Wait, let me verify the animal data and carefully translate exposure. In enhanced pre- and post-natal studies in cynomolgus monkeys, weekly subcutaneous risankizumab during organogenesis through parturition showed no maternal toxicity, no developmental immunotoxicology or neurobehavioral effects in infants, but a dose-dependent increase in fetal/infant loss at 5 and 50 mg/kg, with the 50 mg/kg dose associated with approximately 5-fold higher exposure than the human induction dose and 32-fold higher than the maintenance dose; the NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 5 mg/kg, roughly 0.6× the human induction exposure and 5× the maintenance exposure [^112vCijw] [^113mkYB2]. Hold on, I should verify that infant serum levels were about 17–86% of maternal concentrations and remained detectable up to roughly 3 months postpartum in some dyads, aligning with the long IgG half-life and the expectation of third-trimester transfer in humans [^112vCijw].

> I need to check placental transfer physiology and timing next. Monoclonal antibodies of the IgG1 class, like risankizumab, cross the placenta via the neonatal Fc receptor with negligible transfer in the first trimester and increasing transfer in the second trimester, peaking in the third trimester; thus, the highest fetal exposure occurs late in gestation, which has implications for neonatal immunosuppression and vaccine scheduling after in utero exposure [^115uUCpm] [^113mkYB2]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought transfer might begin at 20 weeks; I should correct that nuance: transfer rises progressively after mid-second trimester and is most substantial in the third trimester, which guides risk stratification by timing of doses and postnatal planning [^115uUCpm].

> Next, I should review disease-related maternal and fetal risks to avoid a biased risk assessment. Active inflammatory bowel disease is associated with increased risks of preterm delivery, low birth weight, and small-for-gestational-age infants, and in psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases, uncontrolled maternal disease correlates with worse pregnancy outcomes; therefore, abrupt withdrawal of effective therapy may increase adverse obstetric risks, which must be weighed against theoretical drug risks in shared decision-making [^111BCiYn] [^115frtsd]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; disease control itself modifies baseline risk, so individualized risk–benefit discussions should explicitly compare the consequences of untreated disease versus the uncertain but possible fetal effects of continued biologic therapy [^115frtsd].

> I will now examine professional society guidance, but I should confirm the strength of evidence and any inconsistencies. The AGA clinical practice update supports continuing biologic agents for IBD throughout pregnancy and postpartum and notes that newer anti–IL-23 agents like risankizumab are expected to have safety profiles similar to ustekinumab based on mechanistic class reasoning, albeit with limited direct data, placing risankizumab in a "use if benefits outweigh risks" category for all trimesters [^116M1sUh] [^112txnwu]. By contrast, rheumatology guidance for non-TNF IgG-based biologics often advises continuation through conception but discontinuation at pregnancy confirmation, reflecting a more conservative stance given limited class-specific data; this creates a tension that requires specialty-specific counseling and shared decision-making rather than a one-size-fits-all rule [^116E1HKL] [^117Wcyvf]. I should double-check dermatology guidance: psoriasis guidance generally flags IL-23 inhibitors as having unknown pregnancy safety, aligning with a cautious, data-sparse posture that supports individualized decisions and registry participation rather than a blanket prohibition [^111oMYpf].

> Let me consider how to translate this into practical management steps. Preconception, I should confirm disease control and review contraception; if risankizumab is needed, continue treatment while planning pregnancy and coordinate early obstetric involvement, and if pregnancy is confirmed, counsel that data are limited and enroll the patient in the GLOW registry prospectively for outcome tracking [^114vapvN] [^113mkYB2]. During pregnancy, I need to ensure close multidisciplinary follow-up with maternal–fetal medicine and the treating specialty; monitor maternal disease activity and fetal growth given known associations of active IBD with adverse outcomes, and if continued, plan dosing recognizing the long half-life and progressive placental transfer in the third trimester [^111BCiYn] [^115uUCpm]. But wait, what if we aim to minimize third-trimester exposure? Some clinicians may time the last dose before 30 weeks when disease control permits, balancing relapse risk against fetal exposure, although evidence for optimal timing is limited and should be individualized with explicit risk–benefit documentation [^117VhhGK] [^112txnwu].

> I should confirm neonatal implications and vaccine planning. Because maternal IgG transfer peaks late in gestation, in utero–exposed infants may be functionally immunosuppressed and should avoid live vaccines for an initial period; while an exact interval is uncertain for risankizumab, a pragmatic minimum of 5 months is reasonable based on the drug's half-life and infant PK data from monkeys, and many IBD and biologic guidance documents extend this to 6 months as a conservative approach, which I should reconcile with evolving registry and real-world data as they mature [^111BCiYn] [^114AuhaC]. Hold on, I should verify that families receive clear written instructions on deferring live vaccines such as rotavirus, BCG, and MMR until the recommended interval has elapsed, and coordinate with pediatricians to ensure a non-live alternative schedule where feasible [^111BCiYn].

> Let me think about lactation. There are no human data on risankizumab in breast milk, but endogenous IgG and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are transferred into human milk at low levels, and oral bioavailability of large proteins in neonates is limited. Therefore, the net systemic infant exposure is expected to be low, though caution remains prudent until more data accrue, and this should be individualized alongside maternal disease control needs and infant risk factors [^112vCijw] [^115uUCpm]. I should confirm that parents are counseled on observable infant infection risks and that we document shared decision-making regarding continuation or temporary interruption during lactation [^112vCijw].

> I should double-check safety signals and immunogenicity that could influence decisions. Across psoriasis trials, risankizumab has a favorable long-term safety profile with low rates of serious infections and no new safety signals identified, although serious infections such as pneumonia have been reported and immunogenicity occurs in a minority of patients; the clinical relevance of anti-drug antibodies to pregnancy outcomes is unknown, so this should not be over-interpreted in isolation but warrants routine vigilance for infections and loss of efficacy if immunogenicity emerges [^111zDGQw] [^113LjRGd] [^1151vKgs]. Hold on, I should verify that any infectious symptoms during pregnancy prompt prompt evaluation given the immunomodulatory mechanism, even though specific pregnancy-related infection signals have not been defined for risankizumab [^114vLC4n].

> Bringing this together, I need to ensure my conclusion is transparent about uncertainty and aligned with guidance. For risankizumab in pregnancy, there are insufficient human data to define risk, animal data suggest developmental toxicity at exposures above therapeutic ranges with a clear NOAEL below induction dosing, placental transfer is greatest in the third trimester, and disease control itself materially affects maternal–fetal outcomes. Therefore, management should be individualized, favoring continuation when disease is moderate to severe or refractory, with registry enrollment, multidisciplinary care, and neonatal vaccine deferral planning, while considering dose timing adjustments where feasible and safe to mitigate late-gestation exposure [^113mkYB2] [^112vCijw] [^111BCiYn] [^112txnwu]. I should confirm that patients receive written counseling on risks, benefits, uncertainties, and follow-up plans, and that we document shared decision-making given the evolving evidence base and the importance of prospective registries to close knowledge gaps [^113mkYB2] [^115xUH2p].

Skyrizi (risankizumab) is not **teratogenic** in animal studies [^112vCijw], but human pregnancy data are limited; it should be used only if benefits outweigh risks [^113mkYB2] [^116M1sUh]. Monoclonal antibodies cross the placenta, especially in the third trimester, so infants exposed in utero may have transient immunosuppression [^115uUCpm]; delay live vaccines for at least 6 months after birth [^117VhhGK]. There is no evidence of increased miscarriage or congenital anomalies, but patients should enroll in the pregnancy registry (glowpregnancyregistry.com) [^113mkYB2] [^116M1sUh]. For psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis, consider safer alternatives if possible; for IBD, continuing biologics is often recommended to maintain remission [^116M1sUh].

---

## Pharmacological properties relevant to pregnancy

- **Mechanism of action**: IL-23 inhibition via p19 subunit binding, reducing Th17-mediated inflammation [^116NphBt].

- **Structure**: Humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody with Fc-mediated placental transfer, increasing with gestation [^115uUCpm].

- **Half-life**: ~28 days, supporting 12-week dosing and prolonged fetal exposure if continued late in pregnancy [^notfound].

---

## Preclinical safety data

- **Animal studies**: No teratogenicity or structural malformations in cynomolgus monkeys; increased fetal/infant loss at 50 mg/kg (about 5× human induction exposure) but not at 5 mg/kg (about 0.6× induction exposure) [^notfound].

- **NOAEL**: 5 mg/kg for developmental toxicity; higher doses increased fetal/infant loss.

- **Long-term effects**: No adverse effects on growth, development, immunology, or neurobehavior in exposed infants through 6 months [^112vCijw].

---

## Clinical data in human pregnancy

Human data are **limited**, with no established increase in major birth defects or miscarriage in pharmacovigilance or clinical trials [^113mkYB2] [^116M1sUh]. Registry data are insufficient to define risk; patients should enroll in the GLOW registry (glowpregnancyregistry.com) [^113mkYB2] [^114vapvN]. Case reports show no clear pattern of adverse outcomes, but numbers are small.

---

## Placental transfer and fetal exposure

Transfer increases with gestation, rising from minimal in the first trimester to **significant in the third trimester**, which can cause transient fetal immunosuppression [^115uUCpm] [^111BCiYn]. Infant serum levels at birth are 17–86% of maternal levels and decline over months [^112vCijw].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

- **Immunosuppression**: Transient neonatal immunosuppression with increased infection risk; avoid live vaccines for at least 6 months after birth [^117VhhGK].

- **Pregnancy outcomes**: No clear increase in miscarriage or congenital anomalies, but data are limited [^113mkYB2] [^116M1sUh].

- **Long-term effects**: Unknown; ongoing monitoring and registry enrollment are recommended [^113mkYB2].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

For **psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis**, consider alternatives with more pregnancy data if feasible; if Skyrizi is essential, use with caution and monitor closely. For **IBD**, maintain biologic therapy to preserve remission and reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes; Skyrizi may be continued if benefits outweigh risks [^111BCiYn] [^116M1sUh]. General principle: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks, with shared decision-making and registry enrollment [^113mkYB2].

---

## Alternative treatments during pregnancy

| **Condition** | **Preferred alternatives** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Psoriasis | - Topicals <br/> - UVB phototherapy <br/> - Certolizumab (minimal placental transfer) | More pregnancy safety data; minimal fetal exposure |
| Psoriatic arthritis | - Certolizumab <br/> - Etanercept <br/> - Adalimumab | Extensive pregnancy experience; acceptable risk profiles |
| IBD | - Certolizumab <br/> - Adalimumab <br/> - Ustekinumab | Maintain remission; favorable pregnancy safety data |

---

## Postpartum and lactation considerations

Breastfeeding is likely **compatible**; minimal transfer into milk is expected for large IgG molecules, but data are limited [^112vCijw]. Infant monitoring should include growth, infection risk, and vaccine scheduling; **delay live vaccines for at least 6 months** after birth [^111BCiYn].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Use in pregnancy**: Only if benefits outweigh risks; enroll in registry; monitor closely [^113mkYB2] [^116M1sUh].

- **First trimester**: Minimal placental transfer; consider continuation if disease control is critical [^115uUCpm].

- **Third trimester**: Significant transfer; weigh benefits vs neonatal immunosuppression risk [^115uUCpm].

- **Postpartum**: Delay infant live vaccines ≥ 6 months; breastfeeding likely compatible with caution [^117VhhGK] [^111oMYpf].

---

Skyrizi may be used in pregnancy when benefits outweigh risks, with **cautious monitoring** and registry enrollment; avoid live vaccines in exposed infants for 6 months and consider alternatives when feasible.

Interleukin-17 inhibitors

Interleukin-17 inhibitors (IL-17i) were not in general use and so not considered in our previous search. Secukinumab has an IgG1 structure, which may theoretically suggest increased transplacental transfer compared with the IgG4 structure of ixekizumab.

We found three studies of mostly first trimester pregnancy exposures to secukinumab (n = 244) and ixekizumab (n = 18). The authors did not report any increased incidence of adverse outcomes directly attributable to the drugs, although information, particularly for ixekizumab, remains very limited.

In addition, Novartis provided data from a search of their Global Safety Database, relating to 298 reports of maternal pregnancy exposures and 90 paternal exposures to secukinumab, mostly during the first trimester. No outcome data were provided, but analysis within Novartis did not reveal any new safety information. UKTIS does not report on these drugs.

There were no data on breastmilk exposure to IL-17i identified in our search or in LactMed. Data provided from the Novartis Global Safety Database identified six breastmilk exposures to secukinumab, including one report of newborn pyrexia during breastfeeding. The data in all cases were too limited to draw conclusions, but no new safety concerns were inferred.

Recommendations for interleukin-17 inhibitors in pregnancy and breastmilk exposure

Limited evidence has not shown IL-17i to be teratogenic; however, there remains insufficient evidence to be confident that they are compatible with pregnancy. Consider stopping the drug at conception. Any exposure, however, during pregnancy is unlikely to be harmful (GRADE 2C, SOA 99.3%).
IL-17i may be considered to manage severe maternal disease in pregnancy if no other pregnancy-compatible drugs are suitable (GRADE 2C, SOA 99%).
If IL-17i are used to treat severe maternal disease in the third trimester, it is currently recommended to avoid all live vaccines in the infant vaccination schedule until 6 months of age (GRADE 2C, SOA 99.3%).
Based on limited evidence, maternal treatment with IL-17i is compatible with breastmilk exposure (GRADE 2C, SOA 99.5%).

### Psoriasis and pregnancy in the biologic era, a feared scenario. what do we do now? [^114h7kGj]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic, multifactorial inflammatory disease; its clinical severity can vary widely. Treatment of severe cases during pregnancy is of special interest. To date there is scarce information available and most data comes from other medical specialties that use similar treatments. Immunosuppressors are strongly discouraged during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Amongst biologic agents, anti-TNFα having been the longest on the market has allowed for the most experience. It is known that transplacental transport of these drugs does not occur until gestational week 22, once organogenesis is completed. Within this group certolizumab pegol, seems to be the safest choice, as its molecular structure does not cross the placental barrier. Beyond pregnancy, it is important to take into account these drugs' half-life and passage to breast milk, as well as its impact on neonatal immunization.

### Long-term safety of risankizumab from 17 clinical trials in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis [^117XZG56]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Risankizumab has demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in randomized clinical trials.

Objectives

To evaluate safety data from risankizumab psoriasis phase I-III clinical trials.

Methods

Short-term safety (through week 16) was analysed using integrated data from five phase II and III clinical trials. Long-term safety was evaluated using integrated data from 17 phase I-III completed and ongoing trials.

Results

Short-term safety analyses included 1306 patients receiving risankizumab 150 mg and 300 patients receiving placebo [402·2 and 92·0 patient-years (PY) of exposure, respectively]. Long-term analyses included 3072 risankizumab-treated patients (exposure: 7927 PY). The median (excluding four outliers) treatment duration was 2·9 years (range 2 days to 5·9 years). Exposure-adjusted adverse event rates did not increase with long-term treatment (318 vs. 171 events per 100 PY for short- and long-term analyses). With long-term risankizumab treatment, rates of serious adverse events were 7·8 per 100 PY, serious infections 1·2 per 100 PY, nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) 0·7 per 100 PY, malignant tumours excluding NMSC 0·5 per 100 PY, and adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events 0·3 per 100 PY, with no important identified risks. Limitations include that the study inclusion and exclusion criteria varied and that three studies enrolled ≤ 50 patients.

Conclusions

Risankizumab demonstrated a favourable safety profile over short- and long-term treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Patients

A total of 17 patients, including eight patients with GPP and nine patients with EP, were enrolled and 10 (58.8%) patients completed the study (Figure 1). The mean age for patients with GPP was 57.5 years (standard deviation [SD], 18.7 years), and for patients with EP was 40.2 years (SD, 18.8 years); 82.4% were men (Table 1). At baseline, mean PASI was 17.4 (SD, 9.4) for patients with GPP and 52.1 (SD, 13.6) for patients with EP. All patients with GPP had a JDA score of mild (0–6) or moderate (7–10) at baseline; the mean JDA score was 4.8. All patients also had an overlapping comorbidity of psoriatic arthritis. Prior biologic therapy use was reported for three (37.5%) patients with GPP and two (22.2%) patients with EP.

FIGURE 1
Patient disposition. † There were five study discontinuations in the generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) group (one due to lost to follow‐up, one due to noncompliance with the protocol, one due to a serious adverse event [AE] of scirrhous gastric cancer that was unrelated to study drug, and two due to withdrawal by patient [one due to need for prohibited medication to treat a nonserious AE of inflammation, pain in extremity, and rash and one due to patient desire to stop tuberculosis prophylaxis medication]). ‡ There were two study discontinuations in the erythrodermic psoriasis (EP) group (one due to a serious AE of ischemic heart failure that was unrelated to study drug and one due to an unintended pregnancy).

Adverse events in areas of safety interest

Areas of safety interest were identified based on their higher prevalence in the population with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis, customary concerns with injected immunoglobulin products, or the immunomodulatory activity of risankizumab. EAERs for TEAEs of safety interest were low for both analysis sets and generally remained consistent or decreased over time (Table 2 and Figure 1).

### Risankizumab-rzaa (Skyrizi) [^113LjRGd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Safety T hrough Week 52

Through Week 52, no new adverse reactions were identified, and the rates of the adverse reactions were similar to those observed during the first 16 weeks of treatment. During this period, serious infections that led to study discontinuation included pneumonia.

Psoriatic Arthritis

The overall safety profile observed in subjects with psoriatic arthritis treated with SKYRIZI is generally consistent with the safety profile in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Additionally, in the Phase 3 placebo-controlled trials the incidence of hepatic events was higher in the SKYRIZI group (5.4%, 16.7 events per 100 patient years) compared to the placebo group (3.9%, 12.6 events per 100 patient years). Of these, the most common events that were reported more frequently in both the placebo group and the SKYRIZI group were ALT increased (placebo: n = 12 (1.7%); SKYRIZI: n = 16 (2.3%)), AST increased (placebo: n = 9 (1.3%); SKYRIZI: n = 13 (1.8%)), and GGT increased (placebo: n = 5 (0.7%); SKYRIZI: n = 8 (1.1%)). There were no serious hepatic events reported. The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions was higher in the SKYRIZI group (n = 16, 2.3%) compared to the placebo group (n = 9, 1.3%). In the Phase 3 placebo-controlled trials, hypersensitivity reactions reported at a higher rate in the SKYRIZI group included rash (placebo: n = 4 (0.6%); SKYRIZI: n = 5 (0.7%), allergic rhinitis (placebo: n = 1 (0.1%); SKYRIZI: n = 2 (0.3%), and facial swelling (placebo: n = 0 (0.0%); SKYRIZI n = 1 (0.1%). One case of anaphylaxis was reported in a subject who received SKYRIZI in the Phase 2 clinical trial.

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors outcomes in women who become pregnant while treated with SKYRIZI. Patients should be encouraged to enroll by calling 1–877–302–2161 or visiting http://glowpregnancyregistry.com.

Risk Summary

Available pharmacovigilance and clinical trial data with risankizumab use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Although there are no data on risankizumab-rzaa, monoclonal antibodies can be actively transported across the placenta, and SKYRIZI may cause immunosuppression in the in utero - exposed infant. There are adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with inflammatory bowel disease (see Clinical Considerations).

In an enhanced pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were administered subcutaneous doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg risankizumab-rzaa once weekly during the period of organogenesis up to parturition. Increased fetal/infant loss was noted in pregnant monkeys at the 50 mg/kg dose (see Data). The 50 mg/kg dose in pregnant monkeys resulted in approximately 5 times the exposure (AUC) in humans administered the maximum recommended induction dose (1,200 mg) and 32 times the exposure (AUC) to the maximum recommended maintenance dose (360 mg). No risankizumab-rzaa-related effects on functional or immunological development were observed in infant monkeys from birth through 6 months of age. The clinical significance of these findings for humans is unknown.

### Exposure-response relationships for efficacy and safety of risankizumab in phase II and III trials in psoriasis patients [^111XEKQY]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Risankizumab has demonstrated efficacy in phase III trials in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The exposure-response relationships for risankizumab efficacy (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)75, PASI90, PASI100, and static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA)0/1) at week 16 (N = 1,732) and week 52 (N = 598) as well as safety (incidence of any adverse event, serious adverse event, infection and infestation, or serious infection) over up to 52 weeks were characterized using the data from risankizumab phase II and III clinical trials in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Impact of clinically relevant covariates was evaluated. Risankizumab phase III regimen (150 mg subcutaneously at weeks 0, 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter) achieved the plateau of the exposure-efficacy relationships with model-estimated PASI90 and sPGA0/1 response probabilities of 77%, and 87%, respectively, at week 16 and 85%, and 88%, respectively, at week 52. There was no apparent relationship between risankizumab plasma exposure and the evaluated safety variables.

### A retrospective review of pregnancies on biologics for the treatment of dermatological conditions [^114J6BtR]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis often first presents in young adulthood, with the average age of diagnosis in women being 28 years, thus in the prime reproductive years. In addition, approximately 50% of pregnancies worldwide are unplanned. Although biologic therapies have revolutionized the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis, there are no controlled studies of biologics in pregnant women. The increasing use of these agents in women of childbearing age highlights the need to further assess their safety during pregnancy. Postmarketing experience regarding the safety of these drugs is accumulating and being published, with largely reassuring results. We present our real-world experience of 17 pregnancies occurring in women on treatment with biologic agents for dermatological conditions to further add to the body of knowledge.

### Direct comparison of risankizumab and fumaric acid esters in systemic therapy-naïve patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: a randomized controlled trial [^114AXYcW]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Fumaric acid esters (FAEs; Fumaderm ®) are the most frequently prescribed first-line systemic treatment for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in Germany. Risankizumab (Skyrizi ®) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin 23.

Objectives

To compare risankizumab treatment to FAEs in patients with psoriasis.

Methods

This phase III randomized, active-controlled, open-label study with blinded assessment of efficacy was conducted in Germany. Patients were randomized (1: 1) to subcutaneous risankizumab 150mg (weeks 0, 4 and 16) or oral FAEs at increasing doses from 30mg daily (week 0) up to 720mg daily (weeks 8–24). Enrolled patients were adults naïve to and candidates for systemic therapy, with chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Phototherapy was not allowed within 14days before or during the study.

Results

Key efficacy endpoints were met at week 24 for risankizumab (n = 60) vs. FAEs (n = 60) (P < 0·001): achievement of a ≥ 90% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI; primary endpoint 83·3% vs. 10·0%), ≥ 100% improvement in PASI (50·0% vs. 5·0%), ≥ 75% improvement in PASI (98·3% vs. 33·3%), ≥ 50% improvement in PASI (100% vs. 53·3%) and a Static Physician's Global Assessment of clear/almost clear (93·3% vs. 38·3%). The rates of gastrointestinal disorders, flushing, lymphopenia and headache were higher in the FAE group. One patient receiving risankizumab reported a serious infection (influenza, which required hospitalization). There were no malignancies, tuberculosis or opportunistic infections in either treatment arm.

Conclusions

Risankizumab was found to be superior to FAEs, providing earlier and greater improvement in psoriasis outcomes that persisted with continued treatment, and more favourable safety results, which is consistent with the known safety profile. No new safety signals for risankizumab or FAEs were observed.

Data

Animal Data

An enhanced pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity study was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. Pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were administered weekly subcutaneous doses of risankizumab-rzaa of 5 or 50 mg/kg from gestation day 20 to parturition, and the cynomolgus monkeys (mother and infants) were monitored for 6 months after delivery. No maternal toxicity was noted in this study. There were no treatment-related effects on growth and development, malformations, developmental immunotoxicology, or neurobehavioral development. However, a dose-dependent increase in fetal/infant loss was noted in the risankizumab-rzaa-treated groups (32% and 43% in the 5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg groups, respectively) compared with the vehicle control group (19%). The increased fetal/infant loss in the 50 mg/kg group was considered to be related to risankizumab-rzaa treatment. The no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal toxicity was identified as 50 mg/kg, and the NOAEL for developmental toxicity was identified as 5 mg/kg. The 5 mg/kg dose in pregnant monkeys resulted in approximately 0.6 times the exposure (AUC) in humans administered the maximum recommended induction dose (1,200 mg) and 5 times the exposure (AUC) in humans administered the maximum recommended maintenance dose (360 mg). In the infants, mean serum concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner and were approximately 17%-86% of the respective maternal concentrations. Following delivery, most adult female cynomolgus monkeys and all infants from the risankizumab-rzaa-treated groups had measurable serum concentrations of risankizumab-rzaa up to 91 days postpartum. Serum concentrations were below detectable levels at 180 days postpartum.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of risankizumab-rzaa in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Endogenous maternal IgG and monoclonal antibodies are transferred in human milk. The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure in the breastfed infant to risankizumab-rzaa are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for SKYRIZI and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from SKYRIZI or from the underlying maternal condition.

Belimumab

We identified one recent and two previous studies of belimumab (BEL).

Recommendations for belimumab in pregnancy and breastmilk exposure

Limited evidence has not shown BEL to be teratogenic; however, there remains insufficient evidence to be confident that it is compatible with pregnancy. Consider stopping the drug at conception. Any exposure, however, during pregnancy is unlikely to be harmful (GRADE 2C, SOA 99.3%).
BEL may be considered to manage severe maternal disease in pregnancy if no other pregnancy-compatible drugs are suitable (GRADE 2C, SOA 99.5%).
If BEL is used to treat severe maternal disease in the third trimester, it is currently recommended to avoid all live vaccines in the infant vaccination schedule until 6 months of age (GRADE 2C, SOA 98.8%).
Based on limited evidence, maternal treatment with BEL is compatible with breastmilk exposure (GRADE 2C, SOA 99.5%).

Interleukin-17 inhibitors

We identified three studies of secukinumab and ixekizumab.

Recommendations for interleukin-17 inhibitors in pregnancy and breastmilk exposure

Limited evidence has not shown interleukin-17 inhibitors (IL-17i) to be teratogenic; however, there remains insufficient evidence to be confident that they are compatible with pregnancy. Consider stopping the drug at conception. Any exposure, however, during pregnancy is unlikely to be harmful (GRADE 2C, SOA 99.3%).
IL-17i may be considered to manage severe maternal disease in pregnancy if no other pregnancy-compatible drugs are suitable (GRADE 2C, SOA 99%).
If IL-17i are used to treat severe maternal disease in the third trimester, it is currently recommended to avoid all live vaccines in the infant vaccination schedule until 6 months of age (GRADE 2C, SOA 99.3%).
Based on limited evidence, maternal treatment with IL-17i is compatible with breastmilk exposure (GRADE 2C, SOA 99.5%).

### Long-term safety of risankizumab from 17 clinical trials in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis [^111VZpSt]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Individual studies were conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines, applicable regulations and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki that were in place at the time the studies were conducted. Studies and study‐related documents were approved by independent ethics committees or institutional review boards, and all patients provided written informed consent.

In all studies, participation was terminated for safety reasons if, in the opinion of the sponsor or the investigator, continued exposure to the study medication represented a significant risk. Other reasons for discontinuation included lack of efficacy, patient withdrawal, other medical reasons [e.g. surgery, adverse events (AEs), other diseases or pregnancy] or loss to follow‐up.

Integrated analyses of safety outcomes

Safety data were pooled at the individual patient level. Rates of AEs were expressed as exposure‐adjusted event rates (EAERs) per 100 patient‐years (PY) for the entire treatment period and were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms, versions 22.1 and 20.0 for long‐ and short‐term analysis, respectively.

Short‐term safety (up to 16 weeks) was analysed in the integrated data from the double‐blinded placebo‐ or active‐comparator‐controlled periods of one phase II and four phase III clinical trials. In addition to these five trials, the long‐term safety analysis set also included data from two phase I studies, one phase II extension study, one phase IIb/III study, seven phase III studies and a phase II/III extension study, for a total of 17 studies. The majority of patients in both analysis datasets received the standard 150‐mg dose of risankizumab.

The analysis populations for short‐ and long‐term safety consist of different sets of patients, and patients included in the long‐term analysis set have varying lengths of treatment exposure. Any risankizumab safety events included in the short‐term analysis set are also included in the long‐term analysis set.

### Modern advanced therapies for inflammatory bowel diseases: practical considerations and positioning [^1164p5Es]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The therapeutic armamentarium for management of inflammatory bowel diseases has expanded dramatically in the last 5 years, with the introduction of several medications with different mechanisms of action. These include the oral small molecule drugs Janus kinase inhibitors (including upadacitinib, approved for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [UC], and tofacitinib, approved for UC) and sphingosphine 1-phosphate receptor modulators (ozanimod and etrasimod, both approved for UC), and biologic agents, such as selective interleukin-23 antagonists (risankizumab approved for Crohn's disease, and mirikizumab approved for UC). The efficacy and safety of these therapies vary. In this review, we discuss practical use of these newer advanced therapies focusing on real-world effectiveness and safety data, dosing and monitoring considerations, and special situations for their use, such as pregnancy, comorbid immune-mediated disease, use in hospitalized patients with acute severe UC, and in the perioperative setting. We also propose our approach to positioning these therapies in clinical practice, relying on careful integration of the medication's comparative effectiveness and safety in the context of an individual patient's risk of disease- and treatment-related complications and preferences.

### Ixekizumab (Taltz) [^112J1Zip]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to TALTZ during pregnancy. Pregnant women exposed to TALTZ are encouraged to enroll in the TALTZ Pregnancy Registry by calling 1–800–284–1695. Contact information for the registry is also available on http://www.pregnancyregistry.lilly.com.

Risk Summary

Available data from the published literature and the pharmacovigilance database with TALTZ use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.

Human IgG is known to cross the placental barrier; therefore, TALTZ may be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. An embryofetal development study conducted in pregnant monkeys during organogenesis at doses up to 19 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) revealed no evidence of harm to the developing fetus. When dosing was continued until parturition, neonatal deaths were observed at 1.9 times the MRHD [see Data]. The clinical significance of these nonclinical findings is unknown.

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

### The effects of immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory medications on fertility, pregnancy, and lactation… [^114R4DfY]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations. Cyclophosphamide is generally contraindicated for treatment of rheumatic diseases during pregnancy and lactation. It should be withdrawn at least 3 months before the patient tries to conceive. For the woman who may desire pregnancy at a later time, consideration should be given to preserving ovarian follicle reserve by the timing of intravenous cyclophosphamide administration, use of oral contraceptives, use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, and/or cryopreservation of oocytes. 36 For the patient with life-threatening rheumatic disease, the use of cyclophosphamide may be considered after the first trimester. Fertility and Conception. Many pregnant patients with renal transplants, hematologic malignancies, inflammatory bowel disease, and SLE have been treated with azathioprine. The drug does not seem to be teratogenic in humans.

44 Although sporadic anomalies have been reported, no definite association between the drug and the observed abnormalities has been established. There seems to be no effect on fertility and no reported increase in abortion. Recommendations. Patients using azathioprine should use adequate contraception. Because of the potential for carcinogenesis and the unknown long-term effects of fetal immunosuppression, use of azathioprine should be reserved for pregnant women whose rheumatic diseases are severe or life-threatening. Reduction of the azathioprine dose at 32 weeks' gestation may prevent serious neonatal leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. 51 Close prenatal monitoring for growth and long-term evaluation of the offspring are essential. Recommendations. During treatment with methotrexate, patients should receive supplemental folic acid. Strict attention to contraception is advised.

Should the patient desire pregnancy, both she and the potential father should discontinue treatment with the drug at least 3 months before conception because of its prolonged retention in the tissues after discontinuation. Despite reports of some successful outcomes after exposure to methotrexate during early pregnancy, the numbers are too small to draw significant conclusions on the safe use of this drug. Recommendations. Hydroxychloroquine does not seem to pose a significant risk to the fetus, especially with lower doses. It may be most prudent to avoid its use during pregnancy in patients with RA, since these patients can be managed safely with corticosteroids. However, for patients with SLE already taking hydroxychloroquine, the benefits of continuing treatment with this medication throughout pregnancy seem to outweigh the risks associated with its use.

### Efficacy and safety of continuous risankizumab therapy vs treatment withdrawal in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis: a phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^1148A3g5]. JAMA Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Selective inhibition of IL-23 with risankizumab demonstrated high and durable efficacy that was maintained with every-12-week dosing during 2 years of therapy. The overall safety profile of risankizumab was comparable with that of placebo at week 16 and remained stable over time with no new safety findings. Together, these findings support the use of 12-week risankizumab dosing as an efficacious and safe regimen for maintenance of clinical efficacy in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

Non–TNF biologics and rituximab — periconception and pregnancy: There are limited data on the compatibility of other biologics with pregnancy; given likely placental transfer timing, the panel conditionally recommends that non–TNF inhibitor IgG-based molecules are compatible in the periconception period but should be discontinued during pregnancy (i.e. at the time of the first positive pregnancy test result). We conditionally recommend continuing treatment with anakinra, belimumab, abatacept, tocilizumab, secukinumab, and ustekinumab while a woman is trying to conceive, but discontinuing once she is found to be pregnant. We conditionally recommend continuing treatment with rituximab while a woman is trying to conceive, and we conditionally recommend continuing rituximab during pregnancy if severe life- or organ-threatening maternal disease so warrants; dosing in the second half of pregnancy puts the fetus at high risk of having minimal B cells at delivery.

### Safety of dermatologic medications in pregnancy and lactation: an update-part I: pregnancy [^1118Mj69]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The breadth of therapeutic options for the management of dermatologic skin conditions continues to expand rapidly as exemplified by biologics and small molecule drug development. While dermatologists and health care providers are aware of the underlying mechanisms and indications for these therapeutics, there is a recognized practice gap due to an incomplete understanding of the safety of these medications in women of childbearing age during the prepartum, antepartum, and postpartum phases. Although a two-part continuing medical education review was published regarding the prescribing practices and safety profiles of these new therapeutics in women of childbearing age while pregnant or lactating in 2014, many new medications have been approved since then. Herein, we will update the safety of dermatologic therapies during pregnancy and Part II will review the safety of medications during lactation.

### Pregnancy outcomes in women with moderate-to-severe psoriasis from the psoriasis longitudinal assessment and registry (PSOLAR) [^113pVfLm]. JAMA Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Study Population

PSOLAR is an observational disease-based registry that collects data related to demographic characteristics, disease activity, clinical outcomes, and safety events. Pregnancies are monitored on a real-time basis. The PSOLAR protocol was approved by appropriate institutional review boards or ethics committees. All patients provided written informed consent at enrollment into the registry. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

A PSOLAR report of outcomes of 83 pregnancies from June 20, 2007, through August 23, 2012, was presented previously. The present analysis includes all pregnancy outcomes from that assessment plus additional data through August 23, 2019.

Assessments

Data were analyzed from April 23 to June 23, 2020. Safety observations captured in PSOLAR support postmarketing regulatory commitments for psoriasis treatments manufactured by the study sponsor (Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC), including ustekinumab, infliximab, and golimumab. Therefore, exposure to biologic therapy is collected specifically for these drugs and separately for all other biologics approved to treat psoriasis (predominantly etanercept and adalimumab, but also secukinumab, risankizumab, alefacept, efalizumab, tildrakizumab, brodalumab, ixekizumab, and guselkumab). Although it is manufactured by the study sponsor, guselkumab is handled in a separate PSOLAR protocol amendment; therefore, in the present assessment, guselkumab is termed other biologic.

Observational data related to demographic and clinical characteristics were collected for all women of childbearing age. For women who became pregnant, pregnancy outcomes (births, stillbirths, spontaneous abortions, and elective terminations) and live-birth characteristics (full-term [≥ 37 weeks] or premature [< 37 weeks], neonatal adverse events, and congenital anomalies) were recorded. Pregnancy data were considered based on exposure to ustekinumab, infliximab or golimumab, other biologics, or nonbiologics within the prenatal period (ie, ≤ 1 year before birth or ≤ 6 months before spontaneous abortion) or outside the prenatal period (ie, exposure at any other time).

### Highlights of the updated Dutch evidence-and consensus-based guideline on psoriasis 2017 [^116TMeeg]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This is a summary of the 2017 updated Dutch psoriasis guideline, based on the Dutch Society of Dermatology and Venereology guideline on the treatment of psoriasis (2011), 1, 2 the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) guideline on the treatment of psoriasis (2015) 3 and newer literature. The focus is mainly on patients with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis, which is the minority of the total patient population. Topical therapies and phototherapies are outside the scope of this update, but remain important treatment options.

We provide sections per drug and patient group, aiming for a useful manual for daily clinical practice, including recommendations for screening and monitoring. In the section on treatment decisions in psoriasis we address the most important aspects of therapeutic decision making. To support dermatologists in making treatment decisions, we provide a concise physician decision aid for the biologics and the small molecule inhibitor apremilast (Table S1; see Supporting Information).

The following sections have been updated: systemic therapy (methotrexate, fumarates, adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, ustekinumab), treatment for paediatric patients, serum concentration and antibody formation in biologics, and quality of life. There are newly added sections on treatment decisions in psoriasis, secukinumab, apremilast, combination therapy, psoriatic arthritis, biosimilars, and pregnancy and biologics. The section on paediatric patients provides guidance on topical therapy and phototherapy in addition to conventional systemic therapy and biologics. We have only included agents that were available in the Netherlands at the start of the update in 2015, meaning that ixekizumab, brodalumab, guselkumab, certolizumab and risankizumab are not included. The sections on retinoids and ciclosporin were not updated; only when strictly necessary minor changes were made, which are clearly indicated in the text. For more detailed information, we refer readers to the full guideline. 4

The limitations of this study include a smaller number of patients vs. previous risankizumab and FAE trials, the relatively short study duration and that this study was conducted only in Germany, unlike other trials of risankizumab and FAEs that had a more global population.

The superiority of risankizumab to FAEs was consistently shown across all reported endpoints, including skin, scalp, nail and palmoplantar psoriasis. Significantly more patients randomized to risankizumab achieved clear or almost‐clear skin earlier than patients randomized to FAEs. A significantly greater improvement in psoriasis from baseline was observed in the risankizumab group compared with the FAE group. The risankizumab safety profile appeared to be more favourable than that of FAEs, and was consistent with the known risankizumab safety profile. No new safety signals were observed.

### Efficacy and safety of risankizumab in Japanese patients with generalized pustular psoriasis or erythrodermic psoriasis: primary analysis and 180-week follow-up results from the phase 3, multicenter IMMspire study [^113E6dmh]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Risankizumab, a humanized immunoglobin G1 monoclonal antibody that specifically inhibits interleukin 23 by binding to its p19 subunit, is approved in Japan to treat numerous indications, including generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) and erythrodermic psoriasis (EP). Both GPP and EP are severe forms of psoriasis that have limited treatment options. In IMMspire (A Study to Assess Efficacy and Safety of Two Different Dose Regimens of Risankizumab Administered Subcutaneously in Japanese Subjects With Generalized Pustular Psoriasis or Erythrodermic Psoriasis) (NCT03022045), a phase 3, randomized, multicenter study in Japan, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of risankizumab for Japanese adults with GPP or EP. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive open‐label risankizumab 75 mg or 150 mg at weeks 0 and 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter through week 160. The primary efficacy end point was GPP or EP clinical response at week 16. Other efficacy end points included GPP or EP clinical response, ≥ 90% improvement from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) and Dermatology Life Quality Index of 0 or 1 (DLQI 0/1) through 180 weeks (last follow‐up visit). Safety was assessed throughout. A total of 17 patients (eight with GPP and nine with EP) were enrolled. All patients achieved the primary end point of GPP or EP clinical response at week 16. Among patients continuing risankizumab treatment, achievement of GPP or EP clinical response, PASI 90 and DLQI 0/1 were generally sustained throughout the treatment. The safety profile remained consistent with the safety profiles noted in previous risankizumab studies. Risankizumab demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy at week 16, with durable efficacy and a favorable long‐term safety profile in Japanese patients with GPP or EP.

### Direct comparison of risankizumab and fumaric acid esters in systemic therapy-naïve patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: a randomized controlled trial [^116naNJd]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Fumaric acid esters (FAEs; Fumaderm ®) are the most frequently prescribed first‐line systemic treatment for moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis in Germany. Risankizumab (Skyrizi ®) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin 23.

Objectives

To compare risankizumab treatment to FAEs in patients with psoriasis.

Methods

This phase III randomized, active‐controlled, open‐label study with blinded assessment of efficacy was conducted in Germany. Patients were randomized (1: 1) to subcutaneous risankizumab 150 mg (weeks 0, 4 and 16) or oral FAEs at increasing doses from 30 mg daily (week 0) up to 720 mg daily (weeks 8–24). Enrolled patients were adults naïve to and candidates for systemic therapy, with chronic moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis. Phototherapy was not allowed within 14 days before or during the study.

Results

Key efficacy endpoints were met at week 24 for risankizumab (n = 60) vs. FAEs (n = 60) (P < 0·001): achievement of a ≥ 90% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI; primary endpoint 83·3% vs. 10·0%), ≥ 100% improvement in PASI (50·0% vs. 5·0%), ≥ 75% improvement in PASI (98·3% vs. 33·3%), ≥ 50% improvement in PASI (100% vs. 53·3%) and a Static Physician's Global Assessment of clear/almost clear (93·3% vs. 38·3%). The rates of gastrointestinal disorders, flushing, lymphopenia and headache were higher in the FAE group. One patient receiving risankizumab reported a serious infection (influenza, which required hospitalization). There were no malignancies, tuberculosis or opportunistic infections in either treatment arm.

Conclusions

Risankizumab was found to be superior to FAEs, providing earlier and greater improvement in psoriasis outcomes that persisted with continued treatment, and more favourable safety results, which is consistent with the known safety profile. No new safety signals for risankizumab or FAEs were observed.

### Efficacy and safety of risankizumab in Japanese patients with generalized pustular psoriasis or erythrodermic psoriasis: primary analysis and 180-week follow-up results from the phase 3, multicenter IMMspire study [^115ukXYv]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Results from IMMspire demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy with risankizumab, regardless of dose (75 or 150 mg); all patients achieved the primary end points of clinical response at week 16. Most patients achieved skin clearance assessed by PASI 90 at week 16. In addition, most of the patients who received risankizumab achieved DLQI 0/1 (no effect on patient's life) at week 16, which may suggest that risankizumab may help improve patient's quality of life. Overall, long‐term treatment with risankizumab demonstrated durable high rates of skin clearance in patients with GPP or EP. All patients who continued with risankizumab therapy maintained a clinical response at week 160.

Risankizumab was generally well tolerated by patients with GPP or EP, and no new safety signals were identified. The safety profile of risankizumab observed through 160 weeks of therapy and follow‐up through 180 weeks was consistent with the safety profile of risankizumab observed through 172 weeks of treatment in patients with psoriasis. In addition, safety findings are generally consistent with long‐term treatment with other biologics studied in Japanese patients with GPP or EP.

IMMspire has some limitations. First, the interpretation of efficacy and safety outcomes is limited by the lack of a placebo group. Second, the open‐label nature of the study may introduce bias as patients and investigators were aware of the study treatment. Last, the small sample size of the study may overestimate the magnitude of efficacy and AEs. Despite these limitations, findings from the present study suggest that there are positive treatment benefits for Japanese patients with GPP and EP.

In conclusion, the results from IMMspire showed clinically meaningful and durable efficacy of risankizumab over time in patients with GPP or EP. Efficacy was achieved at week 16 and maintained throughout treatment, and up to the last follow‐up visit. The safety profile was consistent with the safety profiles outlined in other psoriasis studies with risankizumab treatment. These results suggest that risankizumab may be an effective long‐term treatment option for GPP or EP.

### Exposure to medication for neurological disease in pregnancy-time to consider the long-term implications? [^115uUCpm]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Monoclonal antibodies used in immune-mediated neurological disease

Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly used to treat inflammatory diseases. With the exception of natalizumab, all monoclonal antibodies in clinical use are IgG1, designed to target key receptors and modulate immune processes. Maternal IgG passes to the fetus via the placenta, utilising the neonatal Fc receptor on syncytiotrophoblast cells, providing passive immunological protection. There is negligible IgG transfer in the first trimester, with increasing maternal–fetal IgG transfer through the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Relatively little IgG1 transfer occurs through breastfeeding postpartum. As neurological and inflammatory disease stability is associated with improved maternal and fetal outcomes, there is an increasing tendency to continue treatment until conception or throughout pregnancy.

Neonatal immunity remains a concern following in utero exposure to targeted monoclonal antibodies. Severe cytopenias have been reported following in utero exposure to natalizumaband anti-CD20 therapies. Immature phenotypes of T and B helper cells and prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia have also been seen in infants with prenatal exposure to rituximab.

The short-term consequences of monoclonal antibody exposure during pregnancy seem, in general, to relate to the biological target of the antibody. Evaluating these potential consequences against the risk and results of loss of disease control inform pragmatic decisions around treatment. However, further research is required to understand the longer-term effects on the health of exposed children.

### A guide to the management of hidradenitis suppurativa in pregnancy and lactation [^115dbX66]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Bimekizumab

Bimekizumab, an IL-17A and IL-17F dual inhibitor, was recently approved in November 2024 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe HS in adult patients. Given the minimal pregnancy safety data in humans, bimekizumab should generally be avoided in pregnant women at this time in favor of TNFα inhibitors and IL-17A inhibitors with more pregnancy data. However, bimekizumab may still be considered with extreme caution when it is a reasonable clinical scenario to do so (e.g. for a patient with severe HS who has failed or is intolerant to multiple other biologics). A 2024 paper included 11 cases of reported exposure to bimekizumab in pregnant psoriasis patients using the World Health Organization Pharmacovigilance Database. There was no increased risk in adverse pregnancy-related outcomes compared to TNF-alpha inhibitors. Regarding animal data, one study of pregnant monkeys on doses of bimekizumab up to 38 times the maximum human dosing did not find any adverse developmental abnormalities in exposed infants. In terms of breastfeeding, there is a lack of data on its presence in human breast milk or the effects on infants who are breastfed by exposed mothers. Overall, bimekizumab may be considered with caution during lactation given it is a large protein molecule that is most likely present in low concentrations in breast milk and at least partial break down by the infant gastrointestinal tract would be expected.

### Risankizumab for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis [^112VcRAt]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective: Risankizumab (Skyrizi), an interleukin-23 (IL-23) antagonist, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in April 2019. This article will review phase II and III clinical trials to assess the efficacy, safety, and clinical application of this drug. Data Sources: A systematic literature review was performed using the terms "psoriasis AND risankizumab" in the OVID MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched to identify ongoing or nonpublished studies. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Articles written in English between January 2000 and October 2019 discussing phase II and phase III clinical trials were evaluated. Data Synthesis: By the primary end point at week 16 in phase III trials, more patients achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 90 receiving 150 mg risankizumab (72%-75%) compared with placebo (2.0%-4.9%, P < 0.001), 45 or 90 mg ustekinumab (42.0%-48%, P < 0.0001), and 40 mg adalimumab (47%, P < 0.0001). More patients achieved a static Physician's Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 receiving 150 mg risankizumab (84%-88%) compared with placebo (5.1%-7.8%, P < 0.001), 45 or 90 mg ustekinumab (62%-63%, P < 0.0001), and 40 mg adalimumab (60%, P < 0.0001). Risankizumab was well tolerated across all studies. Conclusion: Risankizumab is a newly FDA-approved IL-23 inhibitor that shows particular promise in the treatment of plaque psoriasis. Based on this review, it is an effective and safe addition to the armamentarium of biologics that are currently available.

### Treatment with biologics of pregnant patients with rheumatic diseases [^115RzrZb]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Due to limited human pregnancy experience safety issues in regard to children exposed antenatally to biological drugs are still under debate. A survey of new published experience on biological agents during pregnancy is necessary to assist clinicians with adequate counseling and management of patients who desire children.

Recent Findings

No controlled study has been published on use of TNFα inhibitors, rituximab, abatacept, tocilizumab or anakinra in pregnancy during the years 2009–2010. New case reports confirm that all monoclonal antibodies expose the child to the full adult dose when administered in late pregnancy with a risk for adverse effects in the newborn and perinatally. Data from a drug registry show that preconceptional and early first-trimester use of rituximab appears to confer no serious side effect to the child. Case reports on abatacept, tocilizumab or anakinra in pregnancy are not conclusive.

Summary

Differences in molecular structure of TNFα inhibitors may turn out to favor the use of agents that are not complete monoclonal antibodies in women who consider pregnancy. The very limited experience with abatacept, tocilizumab or anakinra in pregnancy allows no statement as to their compatibility with pregnancy. At present use of biological agents throughout pregnancy cannot be recommended.

### Can tumor necrosis factor inhibitors be safely used in pregnancy? [^114Ta1Zo]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

We review available safety data for use of currently approved tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors during pregnancy and lactation and suggest guidelines for use of these agents among women of reproductive age. Method. Although regulatory agencies encourage the inclusion of pregnant women and those of child-bearing age in randomized controlled trials, pregnant and lactating women have universally been excluded from studies because of unknown or potential risks to the fetus. Thus, strong evidence-based treatment recommendations during pregnancy are usually lacking and safety information is derived from voluntary reports of adverse events during postmarketing surveillance or via uncontrolled, observational studies, reviewed here.

Results

Uncommon adverse pregnancy outcomes observed with TNF inhibitor therapy appear to approximate those seen in women not receiving such therapy and may include premature birth, miscarriage, low birthweight, hypertension, and preeclampsia. There are rare reports of fetal malformations or congenital anomalies in patients exposed to TNF inhibitors during conception or pregnancy. However, the incidence of these events appears to be far below the 3% rate of congenital anomalies in the general population.

Conclusion

If the activity or disease severity precludes the cessation of a TNF inhibitor and/or DMARD, uncontrolled observations suggest that conception and early pregnancy are not adversely affected by use of TNF inhibitors. Nearly 70% of pregnant patients can discontinue their TNF inhibitor early in the pregnancy (or with determination of pregnancy) without augmenting maternal or fetal risks.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with biologics [^116NphBt]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Risankizumab — mechanism, regulatory status as of December 2017, and randomized efficacy versus ustekinumab are reported: Risankizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits IL-23 by binding to the p19 subunit, and as of December 2017, risankizumab was not yet FDA-approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. An RCT assigned 166 patients to receive risankizumab subcutaneously (a single 18-mg dose at week 0 or 90-mg or 180-mg doses at weeks 0, 4, and 16) or ustekinumab (45 or 90 mg depending on body weight) at weeks 0, 4, and 16; at week 12, 77% of patients receiving risankizumab (the 90-mg and 180-mg groups pooled), as compared with 40% in the ustekinumab-treated group, achieved PASI 90 (P < .001), and 45% versus 18% achieved PASI 100. Currently, there is no evidence to support combination of risankizumab with topical or systemic therapies, but there is no reason to consider such combination unsafe, and there are no data available on antidrug antibodies and their impact on risankizumab efficacy.

### Pregnancy outcomes after exposure to certolizumab pegol: updated results from a pharmacovigilance safety database [^115frtsd]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

For women affected by chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), axial spondyloarthritis (SpA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and Crohn's disease (CD), disease onset, diagnosis, and initiation of treatment increasingly overlap with peak reproductive age 1, 2. For many of these patients, disease activity during pregnancy requires effective management to maintain maternal health and ensure optimal fetal outcomes. Up to half of pregnant patients with rheumatic diseases and the majority of those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) experience active disease and need treatment 3, 4. High disease activity is associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications and adverse outcomes, including preeclampsia, preterm delivery, low birth weight, small for gestational age, and fetal loss 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Adequate disease control during pregnancy is therefore paramount for fetal and maternal health, as acknowledged by recent publications 6, 14, 15, 16, and the risks of untreated disease during pregnancy should be evaluated against the risks related to drug exposure of mother and fetus. However, some treatments are not used in pregnant patients, due to proven teratogenicity (for example, methotrexate) or because of concerns due to the absence of a well‐established safety profile in pregnancy 16.

Clinical trial data on the effects of drugs on pregnancy outcomes are sparse, since pregnant women are generally excluded from participation in clinical studies, and women who become pregnant during a trial have treatment stopped immediately 14. Therefore, evidence generated through pharmacovigilance reporting and pregnancy registries is extremely important to help physicians and patients make informed decisions regarding anti–tumor necrosis factor (anti‐TNF) treatment for rheumatic diseases and CD during pregnancy 15, 17.

The UCB Pharma safety database contained reports of 625 pregnancies exposed to certolizumab pegol (CZP) up to 2014 18, while the 2017 data cutoff presented here includes 1,600 CZP‐exposed pregnancies. With a substantial number of pregnant patients now being exposed to CZP across the different indications, more data are available to gain a better understanding of the timing of gestational exposure and its impact on maternal and infant health. In particular, exposure during the first trimester, when most organogenesis takes place, is of interest. The objective of our investigation is to provide information on pregnancy outcomes, including major congenital malformations and other adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, with a specific focus on the timing of CZP exposure.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with biologics [^111oMYpf]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

IL-23 inhibitors — contraindications, temporary discontinuation and reinitiation, and special populations include absolute contraindications such as history of allergic reaction to the therapeutic agents or vehicle. For febrile illness, especially illness requiring antibiotic treatment, treatment can be restarted after full resolution of the symptoms/signs of infection and the completion of any antibiotic course; the necessity of repeating loading doses upon restarting depends on disease severity and the number of doses missed, and consider repeating doses upon restarting if the patient is flaring and/or if more than 3–4 half-lives have passed since the previous dose. Safety during pregnancy for IL-23 inhibitors is unknown, and the presence of IL-23 inhibitors in secreted human milk has not been studied; however, antibodies are effectively secreted during lactation and caution is recommended.

### Natalizumab (Tysabri) [^111tBgwJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of natalizumab IV (also known as Tysabri) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: consider safer alternatives. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monoclonal antibodies cross the placenta, particularly during the third trimester, and may affect the immune response of the fetus. Cases of neonatal thrombocytopenia, sometimes associated with anemia, were reported. The drug natalizumab IV (also known as Tysabri) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Drug survival, effectiveness, and safety of risankizumab for moderate-to-severe psoriasis for up to 4 years [^113PNTH5]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Risankizumab has been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of psoriasis in numerous randomized clinical trials and real-life studies. Real-life data on treatment for up to 4 years are lacking.

Objectives

The present study aims to estimate the drug survival (DS), effectiveness, and safety of risankizumab over a period of 208 weeks (W).

Methods

We included all consecutive patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis receiving at least 1 dose of risankizumab. Effectiveness was evaluated according to the achievement of PASI 100 and PASI 90. DS was evaluated by a Kaplan-Meyer curve.

Results

A total of 545 patients were included in the study. Mean PASI decreased from 14 at baseline to 0.5 at 208W. PASI100 showed an increasing response, which was achieved in 33% and 74% of patients at 16W and 208W, respectively. For PASI90 a similar trend was seen, with a peak at 208W of 81% patients achieving the outcome. The estimated DS at 208W was 87.2% in patients at risk. Bio-naïve patients showed a significantly faster response than bio-experienced patients. Obesity and difficult-to-treat involvement seem to slow the response, with patients with difficult-site involvement having a lower risk of drug interruption (HR 0.15, CI 0.07–0.31, p < 0.001). Safety was good and only 5 patients interrupted the treatment for adverse events.

Conclusions

Our study confirms the good effectiveness and favorable safety of risankizumab in a real-world setting for up to four years.

### Monoclonal antibodies (biologics) for allergic rhinitis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis during pregnancy and lactation [^111mC7KA]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma, allergic rhinitis, chronic urticaria, and atopic dermatitis are common diseases that affect hundreds of thousands of pregnant women each year. The authors discuss the use of biologics in women who are pregnant or lactating, indications, available safety information, and knowledge gaps. There are pregnant patients for which standard treatment is either inadequate or contraindicated; in those cases, monoclonal antibodies (biologics) should be considered despite the unknown risk to the fetus. In severe asthma, omalizumab is the best studied with reassuring available safety data. Insufficient safety data exist on mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, dupilumab, and tezepelumab use during pregnancy and lactation.

Patients

Patients aged 20 years or older with chronic plaque psoriasis diagnosed 6 months or more before first administration of the study drug were eligible for participation if they had stable moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis (with or without psoriatic arthritis) with involved body surface area of 10% or more, PASI of 12 or more and sPGA of 3 or more; were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy for psoriasis treatment; had no known chronic or relevant acute infections, including active tuberculosis, HIV or viral hepatitis; and had no documented active or suspected malignancy or history of malignancy within 5 years before screening, with the exception of appropriately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Patients with drug‐induced psoriasis, guttate, erythrodermic or pustular psoriasis, or any other active inflammatory disease that could have interfered with study assessments were ineligible for enrollment, as were women who were pregnant, breast‐feeding or planning to become pregnant. Women of child‐bearing potential were required to use highly effective methods of birth control. Patients were ineligible for study participation if they had had prior exposure to the study drug; enrolled in or had completed another investigational study within 30 days of screening; undergone major surgery 12 weeks or less before randomization; or surgery was planned within 12 months after screening. Additional exclusion criteria included history of allergy or hypersensitivity to a systematically administrated biologic agent or its excipients and evidence of a current or previous disease or medical condition other than psoriasis that investigators believed would interfere with study participation.

End‐points

The primary end‐point was 90% or more improvement from baseline in PASI (PASI‐90) at week 16. Secondary and other pre‐specified end‐points included PASI‐90 at week 52, achievement of 75% or more improvement from baseline PASI (PASI‐75) at weeks 16 and 52, 100% improvement from baseline PASI (PASI‐100) at weeks 16 and 52, an sPGA score of 0 or 1 at weeks 16 and 52, a DLQI of 0 or 1 at weeks 16 and 52, absolute PASI of less than 3 at all visits, percentage change from baseline in PASI at all visits, and achievement of American College of Rheumatology (ACR)‐20 response at weeks 16 and 52 in the subset of patients with psoriatic arthritis.

### Monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis: an overview with emphasis on pregnancy, vaccination, and risk management [^112H4KEA]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

The advent of mAb has revolutionized treatment of MS due to their targeted mechanism, potent efficacy and favorable risk profile. They were originally developed from mice to prevent organ rejection in 1986; however, reactions to murine mAbs were soon associated with antidrug antibodies which led to the development of chimeric mouse-human mAbs. To minimize risks, particularly the risk of allergic or infusion-related reactions (IRRs), mAb have undergone several engineering generations to humanize their components in the last decades. This renders them less immunogenic and less likely to evoke generation of anti-drug antibodies. Also this increases clearance times. The first-generation biologics were entirely murine in structure, sometimes leading to potentially fatal immune responses. Second-generation biologics were engineered as either chimeric (combining human Fc-regions with murine variable regions) or humanized (the variable region containing relatively more human protein). Third generation biologics are fully human mAb, yet these still appear to induce production of anti-human mAb. The mAb currently licensed for in MS have proven high efficacy in phase 3 studies and are therefore used in patients with high disease activity. Labels given by regulatory agencies in different countries vary. While all mAbs are approved to treat relapsing forms of MS in the USA, none of those are licensed in Europe for use in less active disease, based on weighing benefits vs. risks.

mAbs belong to the immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotype which bind specifically with their fragment antigen-binding (Fab) region to the epitope of the target molecule. The latter can either inhibit a specific function or directly induce an intracellular signaling. The binding of the fragment-crystallizable (Fc) region can lyse a target cell through either antibody-dependent cell-mediated (ADCC) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). However, they differ not only in the target antigen they recognize but also regarding the mechanism by which they exert their therapeutic effect (Fig. 1). Natalizumab, for instance, works via binding to cell surface receptors, blocking interaction with their ligands and, thereby prevents the transition of leukocytes across the blood–brain barrier (BBB). On the other hand, alemtuzumab and the class of anti-CD20 mABs rituximab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, and ublituximab work via killing selected cell populations. Potential adverse effects may be serious and can necessitate treatment discontinuation. Such serious adverse events are the risk for (opportunistic) infections, autoimmune diseases or malignancies.

### Rituximab, MS, and pregnancy [^114SddiY]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The main limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size. We believe this is the most likely explanation for the lower than expected numbers of major malformations, stillbirths, preterm births, and low birthweight babies. The rates of pregnancy complications are particularly low when considering that a high proportion of women had at least 1 risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Alternatively, high-quality prenatal care could explain these findings. Strengths of this study are a population-based sample with comprehensive medical records of the mother and infant, allowing unbiased and thorough assessment of maternal and infant outcomes and risk factors.

Although our findings are reassuring for women with suboptimally controlled MS who desire pregnancy, we caution against extending these findings to all women with MS or to treatment with ocrelizumab. Women diagnosed with MS today appear to have milder disease before, during, and after pregnancy compared with historical cohorts, and some are adequately controlled on glatiramer acetate, interferon-beta, or no treatment. Exposing these women to even a small increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes from routine RTX infusions likely outweighs any benefit they would experience. The risk of maternal and neonatal infections and ensuing adverse pregnancy outcomes could be higher with ocrelizumab compared with our findings. This is quite plausible because RTX is FDA-approved for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) without significant complications, but the ocrelizumab RA development program was ended because of the increased risk of serious infections. The FDA-approved MS ocrelizumab dose of 600 mg every 6 months is substantially higher than those used in the RA development program.

Taken together, our findings indicate that periconceptional RTX is a highly effective and safe treatment of women with suboptimally controlled MS or those on fingolimod or natalizumab. These women should start or switch to RTX before pregnancy, should be encouraged to breastfeed exclusively to maximize the general maternal and infant health benefits, and may not need to resume RTX until much later in the postpartum period. Future studies to determine the minimum RTX dosing interval are needed to optimize safety, particularly in young women who will want to get pregnant in the more distant future.

### International Delphi consensus on the management of AQP4-IgG + NMOSD: recommendations for eculizumab, inebilizumab, and satralizumab [^1171MwwH]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Statement 18 reached consensus in round 1 of voting (83.3% of panel agreed). Patients with comorbidities that influence the risk of infection, adolescents, older people, pregnant women, and patients with significant immunosuppression were the most commonly mentioned subgroups when panel members were asked whether certain patient types should be monitored more closely than others.

Statement 19 reached consensus in round 1 of voting (100% of panel agreed). Many panel members noted that pregnancy and family planning is a key consideration for their patients. Current literature suggests that multidisciplinary teams should be involved in the overall treatment and care of pregnant women with NMOSD. Reviews of eculizumab treatment during pregnancy suggest there are no major safety concerns. Evidence is less clear for inebilizumab and satralizumab. A review of inebilizumab suggested that treatment could be linked to transient hematologic abnormalities in the fetus if given during the second or third trimester of pregnancy, in the same way as ocrelizumab or rituximab can lead to these abnormalities; however, this has not been formally investigated. Little evidence is available for satralizumab use during pregnancy. Potentially, evidence for tocilizumab use in rheumatoid arthritis during pregnancy could be indicative of satralizumab use, given the similarities between the 2 treatments for mechanism of action. Overall, recommendations in the literature emphasize that more evidence is needed for the newly approved NMOSD therapies during pregnancy and lactation, and a long-term follow-up of infants is also recommended. Plans to generate such evidence are under way: the US Food and Drug Administration mandated a worldwide single-arm pregnancy safety registry study to collect and analyze information for a minimum of 10 years on pregnancy complications and birth outcomes in women with NMOSD exposed to satralizumab and inebilizumab during pregnancy.

### Efficacy and safety of risankizumab vs. secukinumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (IMMerge): results from a phase III, randomized, open-label, efficacy-assessor-blinded clinical trial [^1113Ydbh]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this phase III trial of adult patients with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis, risankizumab was noninferior to secukinumab at week 16 (difference of 8·2% in PASI 90 response rate between groups, which fell within the predetermined noninferiority margin), and superior at week 52 based on PASI 90 (primary endpoint), as well as PASI 100, sPGA 0/1 and PASI 75 (secondary endpoints). The safety profile of risankizumab in this study is comparable with that of secukinumab, and no new safety concerns were identified during the study.

Overall, the efficacy and safety results observed in this trial are generally consistent with those seen in the other phase III risankizumab efficacy and safety studies, further supporting its benefit‐to‐risk profile for the treatment of moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis. 18, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 The efficacy and safety of secukinumab observed in this study are also consistent with efficacy and safety findings noted in previous phase III trials, validating its consistent performance in controlled clinical trials. 20, 23, 27, 31, 32, 33 The trend we observe in this study of a smaller difference in PASI 90 response between IL–23– and IL‐17A‐targeted treatments at week 16 followed by larger differences favouring the IL‐23 inhibitor after 52 weeks of treatment are consistent with results from a previous phase III study. 31

### Risankizumab-rzaa (Skyrizi) [^1151vKgs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.2 Immunogenicity

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products, including other risankizumab products, may be misleading.

Plaque Psoriasis

By Week 52, approximately 24% (263/1079) of subjects treated with SKYRIZI at the recommended dose developed antibodies to risankizumab-rzaa. Of the subjects who developed antibodies to risankizumab-rzaa, approximately 57% (14% of all subjects treated with SKYRIZI) had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. Higher antibody titers in approximately 1% of subjects treated with SKYRIZI were associated with lower risankizumab-rzaa concentrations and reduced clinical response.

Psoriatic Arthritis

By Week 28, approximately 12.1% (79/652) of subjects treated with SKYRIZI at the recommended dose developed antibodies to risankizumab-rzaa. None of the subjects who developed antibodies to risankizumab-rzaa had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. Antibodies to risankizumab-rzaa were not associated with changes in clinical response for psoriatic arthritis. A higher proportion of subjects with anti-drug antibodies experienced hypersensitivity reactions (6.3% (5/79)) and injection site reactions (2.5% (2/79)) compared to subjects without anti-drug antibodies (3.8% (22/574) with hypersensitivity reactions and 0.7% (4/574) with injection site reactions). None of these hypersensitivity and injection site reactions led to discontinuation of risankizumab-rzaa.

Results

Baseline characteristics and risankizumab exposure

In total 3072 risankizumab‐treated patients were included in the long‐term analysis set, representing 7927 cumulative PY of risankizumab exposure. The median risankizumab treatment duration was 2·9 years. The treatment duration (i.e. the time between the first and last doses plus 12 weeks) was ≥ 3, ≥ 6, ≥ 12, ≥ 24, ≥ 36 and ≥ 48 months in 2942 (96%), 2831 (92%), 2447 (80%), 2019 (66%), 1455 (47%) and 172 (6%) patients, respectively. The short‐term analysis set included 1306 patients receiving risankizumab 150 mg (402 PY of exposure). The baseline characteristics were similar between the two analysis sets (Table 1).

Baseline demographic and disease characteristics

General safety overview

The EAER for AEs in the long‐term analysis set was 171 events per 100 PY (Table 2). The majority of AEs were mild to moderate in severity, did not require study discontinuation and were considered by the investigators to be unrelated to risankizumab treatment. In the short‐term analysis set, EAERs were comparable between risankizumab‐ and placebo‐treated patients (Table 2 and Table S2; see Supporting Information) and were consistent with those in the long‐term analysis set. In a post hoc subanalysis of patients ≥ 65 years of age (11·7% of the analysis population), EAERs were consistent with or lower than those in the entire population, with the exception of malignancies excluding NMSC, and deaths – trends typical for this older subgroup of patients (Table S3; see Supporting Information).

Regarding the use of risankizumab SC (also known as Skyrizi) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Monoclonal antibodies cross the placenta, particularly during the third trimester, and may affect the immune response of the fetus. The American Gastroenterological Association recommends continuing biologic agents for IBD throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period. The drug risankizumab SC (also known as Skyrizi) is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage.

### Considerations on inhibition of IL-23 in psoriatic women of childbearing potential [^1155TrLj]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Data from pregnancies during guselkumab clinical trials showed no premature births; two spontaneous abortions were reported, involving women enrolled as healthy controls. Seven patients receiving guselkumab for psoriasis had pregnancies resulting in full‐term births. 6

No data on pregnant patients could be retrieved from clinical trials for risankizumab in psoriasis (IMMvent, UltIMMa‐1 and ‐2, IMMhance). 7

It has been proposed that IL‐23 may play a role in unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortions (URSA), defined as at least two consecutive abortions before week 12 of gestation, excluded any verifiable causes. In fact, increased levels of IL‐23, as well as of IL‐17, IL‐17R, and p‐STAT3, were found in peripheral blood and in deciduae of women with unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortions in their first trimester of pregnancy, compared to women in normal early pregnancies. 8

A study on decidual samples from 15 healthy pregnant women demonstrated that treatment of decidual immune cells with IL‐23 resulted in unbalance of Th17/Treg ratio in favor of Th17 and in hypersecretion of IL‐1B and IL‐17; oppositely, treatment with anti‐IL‐23 antibody significantly increased the Th17 percentage and decreased the production of IL‐1B and IL‐17, whereas it amplified the secretion of IL‐10. Moreover, the expression of p‐STAT3 was significantly elevated by treatment with IL‐23 and inhibited by treatment with anti‐IL‐23 antibody. 9 Considering the role of IL‐23 in differentiation and expansion of Th17 cells, 10 these findings are of interest. In fact, Th17/Treg ratios are important to successful pregnancy, so they are regarded as therapeutic targets for URSA. 11, 12, 13 Specifically, remarkably higher amounts of Th17 cells have been found in the peripheral blood and decidua of women with URSA, 11, 14, 15 whereas normal pregnancy is characterized by Th2 and Treg dominance. 16 Moreover, higher levels of IL‐1B and IL‐17 have been found in women with URSA. 17

Regarding the use of benralizumab SC (also known as Fasenra) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. Monoclonal antibodies such as benralizumab are transported across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy; therefore, potential effects on a fetus are likely to be greater during the third trimester of pregnancy. The drug benralizumab SC (also known as Fasenra) is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed.

### Long-term safety of risankizumab from 17 clinical trials in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis [^111zDGQw]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Risankizumab has demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis in randomized clinical trials.

Objectives

To evaluate safety data from risankizumab psoriasis phase I–III clinical trials.

Methods

Short‐term safety (through week 16) was analysed using integrated data from five phase II and III clinical trials. Long‐term safety was evaluated using integrated data from 17 phase I–III completed and ongoing trials.

Results

Short‐term safety analyses included 1306 patients receiving risankizumab 150 mg and 300 patients receiving placebo [402·2 and 92·0 patient‐years (PY) of exposure, respectively]. Long‐term analyses included 3072 risankizumab‐treated patients (exposure: 7927 PY). The median (excluding four outliers) treatment duration was 2·9 years (range 2 days to 5·9 years). Exposure‐adjusted adverse event rates did not increase with long‐term treatment (318 vs. 171 events per 100 PY for short‐ and long‐term analyses). With long‐term risankizumab treatment, rates of serious adverse events were 7·8 per 100 PY, serious infections 1·2 per 100 PY, nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) 0·7 per 100 PY, malignant tumours excluding NMSC 0·5 per 100 PY, and adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events 0·3 per 100 PY, with no important identified risks. Limitations include that the study inclusion and exclusion criteria varied and that three studies enrolled ≤ 50 patients.

Conclusions

Risankizumab demonstrated a favourable safety profile over short‐ and long‐term treatment in patients with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis.

### Safety of biologic agents for the management of rheumatic diseases during pregnancy [^114aQKms]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss the current understanding regarding the use of biologic therapeutics in pregnancy.

Recent Findings

Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the potential fetal and infant exposure to biologics as well as a growing body of empirical evidence from real world use of biologics in pregnancy have demonstrated that biologics are generally compatible preconception and during pregnancy. Long-term effects of exposure to biologic agents in utero are not known, but will be uncovered in time. Biosimilars, which are becoming more popular, may not always share the same safety profiles as their originators.

Summary

Biologics have revolutionized the management of rheumatologic disease and ushered in a new era of clinical remission among patients. These agents, developed and introduced into clinical use at the beginning of the new millennium, are very potent, yet their efficacy in treating disease often in reproductive aged women, raises questions regarding their safety during pregnancy. These therapeutics can cause immunosuppression and can inhibit immunologic circuits that are not only involved in disease pathophysiology but hypothetically could impact the development of the fetal immune system. Reassuringly, biologics, typically antibodies or antibody-based proteins, are introduced to the fetus via the typical route of transplacental antibody transfer, and thus only begin to be transferred in appreciable amounts in the second trimester (after organogenesis). From theoretic and empirical standpoints, biologic use during pregnancy appears well tolerated for fetal development and to not substantially affect infant immune development.

### Safety of biologics for atopic diseases during pregnancy [^113kusBz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The high prevalence of atopic diseases in women of childbearing age reveals the need to determine the safety of biologics during pregnancy. This review summarizes the effects of 7 Food and Drug Administration-approved biologics (omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, dupilumab, tezepelumab, and tralokinumab) on maternal and fetal outcomes. For this purpose, we reviewed English-language publications to investigate whether the use of biologics for atopic diseases during pregnancy increased the risk of preterm delivery, stillbirth, low birth weight, or congenital malformations. Most publications found were case reports, case series, or observational studies reporting outcomes in a total of 313 pregnancies. No randomized controlled studies were identified. We found that biologics do not seem to influence maternal or fetal outcomes. Indeed, worsening of the underlying atopic disease during pregnancy appears to be more detrimental to the viability of the pregnancy. Given the small sample size and scarcity of studies, future research should include prospective studies with comparable control groups without exposure to biologics and multicenter registries for long-term follow-up.

### Efficacy and safety of risankizumab in Japanese patients with generalized pustular psoriasis or erythrodermic psoriasis: primary analysis and 180-week follow-up results from the phase 3, multicenter IMMspire study [^111NJycz]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Risankizumab, a humanized immunoglobin G1 monoclonal antibody that specifically inhibits interleukin 23 by binding to its p19 subunit, is approved in Japan to treat numerous indications, including generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) and erythrodermic psoriasis (EP). Both GPP and EP are severe forms of psoriasis that have limited treatment options. In IMMspire (A Study to Assess Efficacy and Safety of Two Different Dose Regimens of Risankizumab Administered Subcutaneously in Japanese Subjects With Generalized Pustular Psoriasis or Erythrodermic Psoriasis) (NCT03022045), a phase 3, randomized, multicenter study in Japan, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of risankizumab for Japanese adults with GPP or EP. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive open-label risankizumab 75mg or 150mg at weeks 0 and 4 and every 12weeks thereafter through week 160. The primary efficacy end point was GPP or EP clinical response at week 16. Other efficacy end points included GPP or EP clinical response, ≥ 90% improvement from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) and Dermatology Life Quality Index of 0 or 1 (DLQI 0/1) through 180weeks (last follow-up visit). Safety was assessed throughout. A total of 17 patients (eight with GPP and nine with EP) were enrolled. All patients achieved the primary end point of GPP or EP clinical response at week 16. Among patients continuing risankizumab treatment, achievement of GPP or EP clinical response, PASI 90 and DLQI 0/1 were generally sustained throughout the treatment. The safety profile remained consistent with the safety profiles noted in previous risankizumab studies. Risankizumab demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy at week 16, with durable efficacy and a favorable long-term safety profile in Japanese patients with GPP or EP.

### Trick or TREAT? More safety data of infliximab during pregnancy [^1116EVeJ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Infliximab was the first FDA approved biologic for the treatment of Crohn's disease. Data for its use before and during pregnancy in both females and males have been increasing over the last decade, but most studies have had fewer than 100 patients and inconsistent comparison to healthy control outcomes. New data from the TREAT Safety Registry have a robust N of female and male patients exposed to infliximab with known birth outcomes from both academic and community settings. There does not appear to be any increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes from this population.

### Choosing the right biologic for the right patient with severe asthma [^116pkYEp]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Arguably, the key to this case lies in the first four words of the case description: (1) a woman of child-bearing age, urging safety and teratogenic considerations, with (2) early-onset asthma, suggesting epithelial or atopic-drive disease. If she is actively considering pregnancy, it seems reasonable to base our choice of biologic first on teratogenicity safety profiles.

Pregnancy-Related Considerations

Prescribers can be reassured that no concerns of teratogenicity for biologics have been substantiated, despite the drugs undergoing trials and being used in various diseases for > 2 decades. Nevertheless, all these treatments are IgG based, and thus are transported across the placenta in varying degrees according to gestational age and subtype. Thus, we would rather choose a biologic with the most robust safety profile.

Omalizumab has been administered to humans since 1995and has been marketed since 2003. It has a long history of safety in pregnancy. An analysis of a prospective exposure cohort registry of 250 pregnant women with asthma treated with this biologic showed no increase in adverse fetal outcomes when compared with a disease-matched external cohort. Although the magnitude of exacerbation reduction and corticosteroid sparing may be lower, omalizumab is a safer choice for women hoping to become pregnant. In the setting of an early-onset atopic phenotype with no steroid dependency such as in patient 1, it is a reasonable choice.

IL-5 - and IL - 5R - targeting agents include mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab. Mepolizumab has undergone trials in humans since 2000. Its growing clinical experience, presence in registries, and the publications in which it is a topic are very reassuring. No signal of harm in pregnancy and breastfeeding has been published. In pregnant nonhuman primates, administration of mepolizumab and benralizumab surrogate-antibody doses of ninefold and 310-fold of the maximum recommended human dose elicited no maternal or fetal adverse effect up to 9 months after birth. No such data are available for reslizumab, whose administration is IV and thus less practical. Although mepolizumab or benralizumab are adequate choices for this patient, they would be our first choice only if she were corticosteroid-dependent (Table 2).

### Disease activity and neonatal outcomes after exposure to natalizumab throughout pregnancy [^116HZc52]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

After natalizumab discontinuation severe relapses can occur despite pregnancy, but third trimester exposure is associated with neonatal haematological abnormalities (HA). The best time point for stopping natalizumab during pregnancy is unclear.

Methods

Prospective, observational cohort with 350 natalizumab exposed pregnancies from the German Multiple Sclerosis and Pregnancy Registry. Clinical disease activity and neonatal outcomes are compared between women with natalizumab discontinuation during (1st Trim-group) versus after the first trimester (maintaining-group) and for subgroup analysis before (< 30-subgroup) or after (≥ 30-subgroup) the 30th gestational week (gw).

Results

Baseline characteristics did not significantly differ between the 1st Trim-group (n = 179; median exposure duration: 2.60 gw, IQR 1.30–3.60) and the maintaining-group (n = 171; median exposure duration: 30.9 gw, IQR 26.9–33.3). Fewer relapses occurred during pregnancy and the postpartum year in the maintaining-group (25.7%) compared with the 1st Trim-group (62.6%; p < 0.001). Women in ≥ 30-subgroup had a significantly lower relapse risk in the first 6 months postpartum (relapse rate ratio: 0.36, 95%CI: 0.15 to 0.84). In total, 7.5% retained meaningful disability 12 months postpartum. No significant effect on neonatal outcomes were observed, but anaemia (OR: 2.62, 95%CI: 1.12 to 6.52) and thrombocytopaenia (OR: 2.64, 95%CI: 1.15 to 6.46) were significantly more common in the ≥ 30-subgroup. 21.8% of all neonates were born small for gestational age, independent of the timing of natalizumab discontinuation.

Conclusion

Continuing natalizumab during pregnancy after gw 30 decreases the relapse risk postpartum going along with a higher risk for HA in the newborns. These results add relevant knowledge as a basis for informed risk-benefit discussion.

### Risankizumab effectiveness and safety in Crohn's disease: real-world data from a large tertiary center [^111ST4W7]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

L23 is a recognized cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). 1 The first IL23-targeting agent that became available for clinical use in IBD was Ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets p40, a shared subunit of both IL23 and IL12. 2,3 Risankizumab (Skyrizi; Abbvie) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody which binds to the p19 subunit and therefore selectively inhibits IL23. 4 In June 2022, it was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD). Here, we describe the effectiveness and safety of risankizumab throughout the induction period in a real-world setting of a large tertiary center.

### Risdiplam (Evrysdi) [^116e4U5G]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy and fetal/neonatal/infant outcomes in women exposed to EVRYSDI during pregnancy. Physicians are encouraged to register patients and pregnant women are encouraged to register themselves by calling 1–833–760–1098 or visiting https://www.evrysdipregnancyregistry.com.

Risk Summary

There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of EVRYSDI in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of risdiplam during pregnancy or throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in adverse effects on development (embryofetal mortality, malformations, decreased fetal body weights, and reproductive impairment in offspring) at or above clinically relevant drug exposures [see Data].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defect and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^112txnwu]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis therapies and pregnancy — biologics versus small molecules: Large prospective registries have demonstrated that maternal use of TNF antagonists or other biologics during pregnancy is not associated with a significant increase in risk of adverse pregnancy or early childhood outcomes. Although there are limited data on newer anti-IL23 inhibitors (ie, mirikizumab, risankizumab, and guselkumab), it can be reasonably expected that their safety profile during pregnancy will be similar to ustekinumab. In contrast, there is a paucity of data on small molecule treatments, including JAK inhibitors and S1P receptor modulators, with animal data suggesting potential adverse pregnancy effects at doses much higher than used for treatment of IBD; thus, in women of childbearing age actively contemplating pregnancy, we recommend avoiding JAK inhibitors and S1P receptor modulators and selecting an alternate therapeutic option when possible.

### Critical review of the current recommendations for the treatment of systemic inflammatory rheumatic diseases during pregnancy and lactation [^117VhhGK]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

The crucial issue for a better pregnancy outcome in women with autoimmune rheumatic diseases is appropriate planning, with counseling of the ideal timing and treatment adaptation. Drugs used to treat rheumatic diseases may interfere with fertility or increase the risk of miscarriages and congenital abnormalities. MTX use post-conception is clearly linked to abortions as well as major birth defects, so it should be stopped 3months before conception. Leflunomide causes abnormalities in animals even in low doses. Although in humans, it does not seem to be as harmful as MTX, when pregnancy is detected in a patient on leflunomide, cholestyramine is given for washout. Sulfasalazine can be used safely and is an option for those patients who were on MTX or leflunomide. Azathioprine is generally the immunosuppressive of choice in many high-risk pregnancy centers because of the safety profile and its steroid-sparing property. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus can also be used as steroid-sparing agents, but experience is smaller. Although prednisone and prednisolone are inactivated in the placenta, we try to limit the dose to the minimal effective one, to prevent side effects. Antimalarials have been broadly studied and are safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Among biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic agents (bDMARD), the anti-TNFs that have been used for longer are the ones with greater experience. The large monoclonal antibodies do not cross the placenta in the first trimester, and after conception, the decision to continue medication should be taken individually. The experience is larger in women with inflammatory bowel diseases, where anti-TNF is generally maintained at least until 30weeks to reduce fetal exposure. Live vaccines should not be administrated to the infant in the first 6months of life. Pregnancy data for rituximab, abatacept, anakinra, tocilizumab, ustekinumab, belimumab, and tofacitinib are limited and their use in pregnancy cannot currently be recommended.

### Exposure-response relationships for efficacy and safety of risankizumab in phase II and III trials in psoriasis patients [^117HQVUR]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

The phase III trials demonstrated that continued treatment with risankizuamb beyond 16 weeks results in incremental efficacy benefit, particularly for PASI100 response, 10 which can be further appreciated from the data presented in Figure 2 and from the E max estimate for PASI100 at week 52 compared with week 16 (Table 2).

Exploratory analyses of the key safety variables of interest indicated no apparent relationship between risankizumab exposure and any AE, SAE, infection and infestation, or serious infection over the first 16 weeks and up to 52 weeks of treatment duration using pooled data from all four phase III trials of risankizumab in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. These analyses indicate that the evaluated phase III clinical regimen of risankizumab is supported from a safety perspective as well.

In conclusion, the exposure–efficacy and exposure–safety analyses results indicated that the clinical regimen of risankizumab, 150 mg SC at weeks 0 and 4 and q12w thereafter, achieved the plateau of efficacy with no apparent relationship between risankizumab exposure and key safety events in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Overall, these results support that the risankizumab 150 mg SC dose maximized efficacy in different patient subpopulations regardless of age, bodyweight, sex, baseline disease characteristics, or comorbidities, such as presence of psoriatic arthritis or immunogenicity status.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of SKYRIZI have not been established in pediatric patients.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 6,862 subjects exposed to SKYRIZI, a total of 664 were 65 years or older (243 subjects with plaque psoriasis, 246 subjects with psoriatic arthritis, 72 subjects with Crohn's disease and 103 subjects with ulcerative colitis), and 71 subjects were 75 years or older.

Clinical studies of SKYRIZI, within each indication, did not include sufficient numbers of subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult subjects.

No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of risankizumab-rzaa were observed based on age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Exposure to biological therapies during conception and pregnancy: a systematic review [^114LeuWw]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Biological therapies are effective treatments for psoriasis and are often prescribed to women of child-bearing age.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety of biological therapy in conception and/or pregnancy.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases for multivariate-adjusted studies of women exposed to biologics relevant to the treatment of psoriasis during conception and/or pregnancy.

Results

We identified four population-based cohort studies involving 1300 women exposed to tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors (TNFi) 3 months prior to or during the first 3 months of pregnancy. These studies showed a trend towards drug-specific harm with TNFi exposure in women with different inflammatory diseases, with an increased risk of congenital malformations [three studies; odds ratio (OR) range 1·32–1·64] and preterm birth (one study; OR 1·69, 95% confidence interval 1·10–2·60). This trend did not reach statistical significance in all studies; study heterogeneity, variation across comparator cohorts, inadequate adjustment for important confounding variables such as co-therapy, and an absence of a common constellation of malformations means there is uncertainty about the causal role of TNFi. No studies specifically addressed the effect of TNFi exposure in psoriasis during conception and/or pregnancy, or of interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-12/23 antagonists in any indication.

Conclusions

When counselling women these findings must be balanced against the potential impact of untreated severe psoriasis on conception and/or pregnancy and maternal wellbeing; ongoing pharmacovigilance via registries remains essential to address this evidence gap.

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk

Published data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with inflammatory bowel disease is associated with increased disease activity. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth.

Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions

Transport of endogenous IgG antibodies across the placenta increases as pregnancy progresses, and peaks during the third trimester. Because risankizumab may interfere with immune response to infections, risks and benefits should be considered prior to administering live vaccines to infants exposed to SKYRIZI in utero. There are insufficient data regarding infant serum levels of risankizumab at birth and the duration of persistence of risankizumab in infant serum after birth. Although a specific timeframe to delay live virus immunizations in infants exposed in utero is unknown, a minimum of 5 months after birth should be considered because of the half-life of the product.
