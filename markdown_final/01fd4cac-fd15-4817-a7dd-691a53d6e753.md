## Question

How long do you give zosyn for acute pyelonephritis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long to treat acute pyelonephritis with piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA label says about duration for piperacillin-tazobactam in general. Then, I should verify contemporary guideline recommendations for duration in complicated UTI and pyelonephritis, including whether shorter courses are acceptable. Next, I will examine randomized trials that used piperacillin-tazobactam for pyelonephritis to see what durations were studied. After that, I need to consider special populations and modifiers such as bacteremia, renal function, and source control. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation and confirm dosing and administration details that affect duration decisions.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory baseline. The FDA labeling for piperacillin-tazobactam states that the usual duration of treatment for indications other than nosocomial pneumonia is 7 to 10 days, which provides a conservative anchor for duration decisions in pyelonephritis when using this agent [^115FTWwy] [^11696zBn].

> Wait, let me verify whether guidelines endorse shorter courses in complicated UTI and pyelonephritis. The 2025 IDSA guidance recommends that patients with complicated UTI, including acute pyelonephritis, who are clinically improving on effective therapy, can be treated with shorter courses, specifically 5–7 days for fluoroquinolones or 7 days for non-fluoroquinolone agents, rather than 10–14 days, and that the duration should be counted from the first day of effective therapy, which supports a 7-day target for piperacillin-tazobactam when the patient is responding appropriately [^114Rndbn] [^111669ub].

> I should double-check the evidence base that specifically included piperacillin-tazobactam for pyelonephritis. In the ZEUS randomized trial of complicated UTI including acute pyelonephritis, patients received piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g every 8 hours for 7 days, with allowance to extend to 14 days if bacteremia was present, which operationalizes a 7-day default with extension for bloodstream infection, and shows that 7 days is an evidence-based duration in this syndrome [^113MUQeh] [^113posth]. In another randomized trial in cUTI/pyelonephritis, cefepime/enmetazobactam was compared with piperacillin-tazobactam using 7–14 day courses, again reflecting that 7 days is an accepted lower bound in contemporary practice for this disease state [^113ozfZZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about bacteremia. I initially thought bacteremia uniformly mandates 14 days, but I should confirm the most current guidance. The 2025 IDSA guidance explicitly allows shorter courses, including 7 days total, for complicated UTI with Gram-negative bacteremia if the patient is clinically improving, hemodynamically stable, and source control has been achieved, which means 7 days can be sufficient in selected bacteremic patients rather than defaulting to 14 days in all cases [^117G4Hrr] [^115EJrG2]. That said, many trials and protocols still allowed extensions to 10–14 days for bacteremia, so extending to 10 days remains reasonable if clinical response is slower or if there are residual concerns about source control or severity [^113MUQeh] [^113ozfZZ].

> Next, I should review modifiers that can justify longer therapy. Let me consider men with suspected prostatitis, obstructed urinary tracts, immunocompromise, or slow clinical response. IDSA notes that men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from 10–14 days, and patients without prompt clinical improvement should be evaluated for an ongoing nidus requiring source control, which may necessitate longer therapy and procedural intervention rather than simply extending antibiotics indefinitely [^1132mcKt] [^113XMyaH]. I need to ensure that any decision to extend beyond 7 days is tied to objective clinical trajectory and source control status rather than habit [^113XMyaH].

> I will now examine dosing and administration because duration interacts with PK/PD optimization. Standard dosing for piperacillin-tazobactam in complicated UTI/pyelonephritis is 4.5 g every 8 hours, and extended-infusion strategies over 3–4 hours are frequently used in critical illness to improve time above MIC, though the pivotal pyelonephritis trials used 1-hour infusions and still support 7-day efficacy, so extended infusion is reasonable but not mandatory for success in this indication [^113MUQeh] [^113posth] [^113bGebD]. I should confirm renal dosing adjustments when creatinine clearance is 40 mL/min or less, since half-lives increase and dose reductions are required to avoid accumulation and neurotoxicity, which can indirectly influence duration decisions if adverse effects emerge [^115FTWwy] [^114e7tEY].

> But wait, what if the pathogen is an ESBL-producing organism. I should confirm stewardship guidance here. IDSA 2023 guidance prefers carbapenems or active oral agents for ESBL-E pyelonephritis/cUTI rather than piperacillin-tazobactam, although some observational data suggest piperacillin-tazobactam may perform acceptably in nonbacteremic ESBL-E UTI; if piperacillin-tazobactam was started empirically and the patient is improving, continuing for the planned 7 days is reasonable with close follow-up, recognizing the theoretical microbiologic failure risk and the need to tailor to susceptibilities [^113u3k1t] [^115SPMPY] [^112wumTy].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation. For most adults with acute pyelonephritis treated with piperacillin-tazobactam who are clinically improving, hemodynamically stable, and have adequate source control, a total of 7 days is appropriate and evidence-based, counting from the first day of effective therapy, with transition to an appropriate oral agent as soon as feasible to complete the course when susceptibilities allow [^114Rndbn] [^112BXcnZ]. If the patient is bacteremic but improving promptly with source control, 7 days remains acceptable; if response is slower or severity is high, extending to 10 days is reasonable, and up to 14 days may be warranted in select scenarios such as prostatic involvement, persistent obstruction, or immunocompromise, always reassessing for a nidus if improvement lags [^117G4Hrr] [^1132mcKt] [^113XMyaH].

> I should confirm the bottom line and guardrails. The default duration of piperacillin-tazobactam for acute pyelonephritis is 7 days, supported by FDA labeling ranges, IDSA 2025 guidance endorsing shorter non-fluoroquinolone courses, and randomized trials using 7-day regimens, with extension to 10–14 days reserved for bacteremia with slow response, suspected prostatitis, inadequate source control, or immunocompromised hosts, and with therapy counted from the first day of effective antibiotics rather than from a later switch date [^115FTWwy] [^114Rndbn] [^113MUQeh] [^111669ub].

For acute pyelonephritis, **7 days of Zosyn (piperacillin-tazobactam) is standard** [^114Rndbn] when the patient is clinically improving and there is no bacteremia or complicating factors [^114Rndbn]. Extend to **10–14 days** for slow clinical response, bacteremia, immunocompromise, or structural urinary abnormalities [^113ozfZZ]. Adjust dose for renal impairment (reduce frequency if CrCl ≤ 40 mL/min) [^111NB3KQ] and monitor for adverse effects [^116222rw]. Transition to oral therapy once stable and cultures guide narrowing [^112BXcnZ] [^112gtP1T].

---

## Recommended duration of Zosyn therapy

- **Standard duration**: 7 days for clinically improving patients without bacteremia or complicating factors [^114Rndbn].

- **Extended duration**: 10–14 days for slow clinical response, bacteremia, immunocompromise, or structural urinary abnormalities [^notfound].

- **Clinical judgment**: Tailor duration to response, comorbidities, and culture results [^111Hu8AB].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting duration recommendations

Evidence supports **short-course therapy** [^114JHKpy], with 5–7 days of fluoroquinolones or 7 days of non-fluoroquinolone therapy (including piperacillin-tazobactam) yielding outcomes comparable to longer courses [^114JHKpy]. Trials also show that **7 days of piperacillin-tazobactam** is effective for complicated UTI and pyelonephritis, including in patients with bacteremia [^113159cK] [^117G4Hrr].

---

## Factors influencing duration of therapy

Several factors **influence duration**:

| **Factor** | **Impact on duration** |
|-|-|
| Clinical response | Extend if slow or inadequate [^notfound] |
| Presence of bacteremia | Extend to 10–14 days [^notfound] |
| Immunocompromised status | Extend to 10–14 days [^notfound] |
| Structural urinary abnormalities | Extend to 10–14 days [^notfound] |
| Renal impairment | Adjust dose; may affect duration [^111NB3KQ] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

IDSA 2025 recommends **7 days** for clinically improving patients without bacteremia or complicating factors [^114Rndbn], with **10–14 days** for those with bacteremia, immunocompromise, or structural abnormalities [^notfound]. ACP 2021 supports **short-course therapy** (5–7 days) for uncomplicated pyelonephritis [^11279yxK].

---

## Risks and benefits of shorter vs. longer courses

Shorter courses (7 days) reduce adverse effects, resistance, and costs without compromising efficacy [^114JHKpy], whereas longer courses (10–14 days) may be needed for severe disease or complicating factors but increase adverse effects and resistance risk [^1132mcKt].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Adjust dose; monitor closely [^111NB3KQ].

- **Allergies**: Avoid if history of hypersensitivity to beta-lactams [^notfound].

- **Comorbidities**: Consider longer courses for diabetes, immunosuppression, or structural abnormalities [^111YoH6n].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of therapy

- **Clinical monitoring**: Track fever, symptoms, and labs [^113PocEW].

- **Microbiological monitoring**: Use culture results to narrow therapy [^112gtP1T].

- **Adverse effects**: Watch for nephrotoxicity, electrolyte disturbances, and hypersensitivity [^116222rw].

---

## Transition to oral therapy

Transition to oral therapy is appropriate once the patient is **clinically stable**, **afebrile for 24–48 hours**, and able to tolerate oral intake [^112BXcnZ]. Oral options include fluoroquinolones, TMP-SMX, or beta-lactams, selected based on susceptibilities [^112gtP1T].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard duration**: 7 days for clinically improving patients without bacteremia or complicating factors [^114Rndbn].

- **Extended duration**: 10–14 days for slow response, bacteremia, immunocompromise, or structural abnormalities [^notfound].

- **Clinical judgment**: Adjust based on response, comorbidities, and culture results [^111Hu8AB].

- **Monitoring**: Track clinical and microbiological response, and adjust as needed [^111SjmRZ].

---

Zosyn is appropriate for acute pyelonephritis; use **7 days** for most patients and extend to 10–14 days for severe disease or complicating factors, with therapy individualized to clinical response and culture results.

Metabolism

Piperacillin is metabolized to a minor microbiologically active desethyl metabolite. Tazobactam is metabolized to a single metabolite that lacks pharmacological and antibacterial activities.

Excretion

Following single or multiple ZOSYN doses to healthy subjects, the plasma half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam ranged from 0.7 to 1.2 hours and was unaffected by dose or duration of infusion.

Both piperacillin and tazobactam are eliminated via the kidney by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Piperacillin is excreted rapidly as unchanged drug with 68% of the administered dose excreted in the urine. Tazobactam and its metabolite are eliminated primarily by renal excretion with 80% of the administered dose excreted as unchanged drug and the remainder as the single metabolite. Piperacillin, tazobactam and desethyl piperacillin are also secreted into the bile.

Specific Populations

Renal Impairment

After the administration of single doses of piperacillin and tazobactam to subjects with renal impairment, the half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam increases with decreasing creatinine clearance. At creatinine clearance below 20 mL/min, the increase in half-life is twofold for piperacillin and fourfold for tazobactam compared to subjects with normal renal function. Dosage adjustments for ZOSYN are recommended when creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min in patients receiving the usual recommended daily dose of ZOSYN. See Dosage and Administration (2) for specific recommendations for the treatment of patients with renal-impairment.

2.1	Important Administration Instructions

If a dose of ZOSYN is required that does not equal 2.25 g, 3.375 g, or 4.5 g, ZOSYN injection in GALAXY Containers is not recommended for use and an alternative formulation of ZOSYN should be considered.

2.2	Dosage in Adult Patients With Indications Other Than Nosocomial Pneumonia

The usual total daily dosage of ZOSYN for adult patients with indications other than nosocomial pneumonia is 3.375 g every six hours [totaling 13.5 g (12.0 g piperacillin and 1.5 g tazobactam)], to be administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The usual duration of ZOSYN treatment is from 7 to 10 days.

2.3	Dosage in Adult Patients With Nosocomial Pneumonia

Initial presumptive treatment of adult patients with nosocomial pneumonia should start with ZOSYN at a dosage of 4.5 g every six hours plus an aminoglycoside, [totaling 18.0 g (16.0 g piperacillin and 2.0 g tazobactam)], administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The recommended duration of ZOSYN treatment for nosocomial pneumonia is 7 to 14 days. Treatment with the aminoglycoside should be continued in patients from whom P. aeruginosa is isolated.

2.4	Dosage in Adult Patients With Renal Impairment

In adult patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 40 mL/min) and dialysis patients (hemodialysis and CAPD), the intravenous dose of ZOSYN should be reduced based on the degree of renal impairment. The recommended daily dosage of ZOSYN for patients with renal impairment administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes is described in Table 1.

For patients on hemodialysis, the maximum dose is 2.25 g every twelve hours for all indications other than nosocomial pneumonia and 2.25 g every eight hours for nosocomial pneumonia. Since hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of the administered dose, an additional dose of 0.75 g ZOSYN (0.67 g piperacillin and 0.08 g tazobactam) should be administered following each dialysis period on hemodialysis days. No additional dosage of ZOSYN is necessary for CAPD patients.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^113u3k1t]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

ESBL-E pyelonephritis/cUTI clinical evidence and panel preference — A randomized, open-label clinical trial included 66 patients with ESBL-producing E. coli pyelonephritis or cUTI randomized to either piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours or ertapenem 1 g IV every 24 hours, with clinical success similar at 94% for piperacillin-tazobactam and 97% for ertapenem; these studies suggest noninferiority between piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for pyelonephritis or cUTIs. In the subgroup of 231 patients with ESBL-E bloodstream infections from a urinary source in the aforementioned trial, higher mortality was identified in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (7% vs 3%) although not achieving statistical significance. Evaluating the totality of the data, the panel prefers carbapenem therapy (or oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, if susceptible) for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI; if piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated as empiric therapy and clinical improvement occurs, the decision to continue should be made with the understanding that theoretically there may be an increased risk for microbiological failure with this approach.

Specific Populations

Renal Impairment

After the administration of single doses of piperacillin and tazobactam to subjects with renal impairment, the half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam increases with decreasing creatinine clearance. At creatinine clearance below 20 mL/min, the increase in half-life is twofold for piperacillin and fourfold for tazobactam compared to subjects with normal renal function. Dosage adjustments for ZOSYN are recommended when creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min in patients receiving the usual recommended daily dose of ZOSYN. See Dosage and Administration (2) for specific recommendations for the treatment of patients with renal‑impairment.

Hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of a piperacillin and tazobactam dose with an additional 5% of the tazobactam dose removed as the tazobactam metabolite. Peritoneal dialysis removes approximately 6% and 21% of the piperacillin and tazobactam doses, respectively, with up to 16% of the tazobactam dose removed as the tazobactam metabolite. For dosage recommendations for patients undergoing hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Hepatic Impairment

The half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam increases by approximately 25% and 18%, respectively, in patients with hepatic cirrhosis compared to healthy subjects. However, this difference does not warrant dosage adjustment of ZOSYN due to hepatic cirrhosis.

### Effect of cefepime / enmetazobactam vs piperacillin / tazobactam on clinical cure and microbiological eradication in patients with complicated urinary tract infection or acute pyelonephritis: a randomized clinical trial [^113ozfZZ]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cefepime/enmetazobactam is a novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination and a potential empirical therapy for resistant gram-negative infections.

Objective

To evaluate whether cefepime/enmetazobactam was noninferior to piperacillin/tazobactam for the primary outcome of treatment efficacy in patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) or acute pyelonephritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, noninferiority clinical trial conducted at 90 sites in Europe, North and Central America, South America, and South Africa. Recruitment occurred between September 24, 2018, and November 2, 2019. Final follow-up occurred November 26, 2019. Participants were adult patients aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis caused by gram-negative urinary pathogens.

Interventions

Eligible patients were randomized to receive either cefepime, 2 g/enmetazobactam, 0.5 g (n = 520), or piperacillin, 4 g/tazobactam, 0.5 g (n = 521), by 2-hour infusion every 8 hours for 7 days (up to 14 days in patients with a positive blood culture at baseline).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in the primary analysis set (patients who received any amount of study drug with a baseline gram-negative pathogen not resistant to either treatment and ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units [CFU]/mL in urine culture or the same pathogen present in concurrent blood and urine cultures) who achieved overall treatment success (defined as clinical cure combined with microbiological eradication [< 103 CFU/mL in urine] of infection). Two-sided 95% CIs were computed using the stratified Newcombe method. The prespecified noninferiority margin was -10%. If noninferiority was established, a superiority comparison was also prespecified.

Results

Among 1041 patients randomized (mean age, 54.7 years; 573 women [55.0%]), 1034 (99.3%) received study drug and 995 (95.6%) completed the trial. Among the primary analysis set, the primary outcome occurred in 79.1% (273/345) of patients receiving cefepime/enmetazobactam compared with 58.9% (196/333) receiving piperacillin/tazobactam (between-group difference, 21.2% [95% CI, 14.3% to 27.9%]). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 50.0% (258/516) of patients treated with cefepime/enmetazobactam and 44.0% (228/518) with piperacillin/tazobactam; most were mild to moderate in severity (89.9% vs 88.6%, respectively). A total of 1.7% (9/516) of participants who received cefepime/enmetazobactam and 0.8% (4/518) of those who received piperacillin/tazobactam did not complete the assigned therapy due to adverse events.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis caused by gram-negative pathogens, cefepime/enmetazobactam, compared with piperacillin/tazobactam, met criteria for noninferiority as well as superiority with respect to the primary outcome of clinical cure and microbiological eradication. Further research is needed to determine the potential role for cefepime/enmetazobactam in the treatment of complicated UTI and pyelonephritis.

### Is piperacillin-tazobactam effective for the treatment of pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing organisms? [^112wumTy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited data exist regarding the efficacy of piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) for the management of nonbacteremic pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter observational study comparing clinical outcomes of adults hospitalized with ESBL-producing pyelonephritis who were receiving TZP versus carbapenems, using an inverse probability of treatment weighted propensity score analysis. Patients were eligible for inclusion if all of the following criteria were met: (1) urine cultures growing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, or Proteus mirabilis at ≥ 50 000 colony-forming units/mL; (2) identification of an ESBL gene; (3) pyuria (≥ 10 white blood cells per high powered field in the urine); and (4) dysuria and fever plus at least 1 of the following symptoms: emesis, rigors, hypotension, or flank pain.

Results

There were 186 patients included in the propensity score-weighted cohort; 45 (24%) received TZP and 141 (76%) received a carbapenem. Of these 186 patients, 27% were admitted to the intensive care unit, 48% were immunocompromised, and 45% had underlying urologic abnormalities. There were no differences between the 2 groups in the proportion of patients (20% vs 25%) with recurrent cystitis or pyelonephritis with the same ESBL-producing organism within 30 days (odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, .31–1.81; p = 0.52). There were no differences in the resolution of clinical symptoms by Day 7 or in 30-day mortality. There was 1 (2%) patient in the TZP arm and 11 (8%) patients in the carbapenem arm who had incident carbapenem-resistant organisms isolated within 30 days (P = 0.09).

Conclusions

TZP may be a reasonable alternative to carbapenems for the management of ESBL-producing pyelonephritis and may mitigate the risk of emergence of carbapenem-resistant organisms, compared with carbapenem therapy.

### Short vs. long antibiotic treatment for pyelonephritis and complicated urinary tract infections: a living systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114JHKpy]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Reducing antibiotic exposure is desirable.

Objectives

This study aims to compile evidence on the durations of treatment for pyelonephritis or febrile complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) in a living systematic review.

Methods

DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science from inception to 30 November 2024, trial registries, and conference proceedings. Living review searches will be updated monthly and the evidence yearly. Updates will be available at https://github.com/LivingSystematicReview/Pyelonephritis-KeepItShort.

Study Eligibility Criteria and Participants

We included randomized controlled trials involving adults with pyelonephritis or cUTI with systemic signs (mainly fever). The primary outcome was clinical success by day 7 after the end of treatment.

Interventions

Different treatment durations within the same antibiotic class or treatment strategy (e.g. physicians' selected, in vitro-matching antibiotics). ASSESSMENT OF RISK OF BIAS: was conducted using the Cochrane risk-of-bias 2.0 tool and certainty of evidence was assessed.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

Risk ratios (RRs) were compiled using the fixed effect model. Subgroups of interest were assessed.

Results

Sixteen randomized controlled trials were included, comprising 4643 patients. Treatment durations of 5–7 days vs. 10–14 days were compared in 12 trials. There was some risk-of-bias concern in most trials, mainly because of dropouts and lack of blinding. There was no significant difference between short- and long-treatment durations for clinical success (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.98–1.04; moderate-certainty evidence); 0.97 (0.91–1.04) in men (low-certainty evidence); 1.01 (0.97–1.05) among patients treated with quinolones and 1.01 (0.94–1.08) among patients treated with any (physician-selected or penicillin-based) antibiotic. Similarly, there were no significant differences between short and long-treatment groups in microbiological cure, relapse or reinfection, and adverse events. The mortality analysis comprised 57.2% (2274/3976) patients with bacteraemia; no significant difference was observed between groups (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.68–1.13).

Conclusions

Treatment durations of 5–7 days for pyelonephritis or febrile cUTI were as effective as longer treatment durations.

### Piperacillin sodium and tazobactam sodium (piperacillin and tazobactam) [^113pDj7E]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolism

Piperacillin is metabolized to a minor microbiologically active desethyl metabolite. Tazobactam is metabolized to a single metabolite that lacks pharmacological and antibacterial activities.

Excretion

Following single or multiple piperacillin and tazobactam doses to healthy subjects, the plasma half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam ranged from 0.7 to 1.2 hours and was unaffected by dose or duration of infusion.

Both piperacillin and tazobactam are eliminated via the kidney by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Piperacillin is excreted rapidly as unchanged drug with 68% of the administered dose excreted in the urine. Tazobactam and its metabolite are eliminated primarily by renal excretion with 80% of the administered dose excreted as unchanged drug and the remainder as the single metabolite. Piperacillin, tazobactam and desethyl piperacillin are also secreted into the bile.

Specific Populations

Renal Impairment

After the administration of single doses of piperacillin and tazobactam to subjects with renal impairment, the half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam increases with decreasing creatinine clearance. At creatinine clearance below 20 mL/min, the increase in half-life is twofold for piperacillin and fourfold for tazobactam compared to subjects with normal renal function. Dosage adjustments for piperacillin and tazobactam are recommended when creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min in patients receiving the usual recommended daily dose of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection. See Dosage and Administration (2) for specific recommendations for the treatment of patients with renal-­impairment.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^116h1STd]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In the last decade, treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs) has become more complicated by the rising antimicrobial resistance of Enterobacteriaceae, the most common uropathogens. With a scarcity of new antimicrobial classes in the development pipe-line, it is essential to develop strategies to maintain effectiveness of the available antimicrobials. Therefore, among strategies to control resistance, the determination of an optimal duration of treatment is essential in addition to optimization of diagnostics to target treatment and antibiotic stewardship concerning antibiotic choice and dose. Shortening of antimicrobial therapy will lead to less selection pressure on the gut microbiome with benefits to both the individual patient as well as the ecological environment, including reduction of antibiotic resistance development. Therefore, the focus upon treatment duration of common infections should be that shorter is better. With respect to febrile UTI (fUTI) or acute pyelonephritis, trials upon treatment duration have usually focused on previously healthy young women and have addressed optimal treatment duration by comparing the same drug for different durations of therapy, or compared various treatment durations of different antimicrobial agents. As such, recommendations upon optimal treatment duration of UTIs in men, the elderly, hospitalized patients, and patients with comorbidities or bacteremia, remain unclear.

Recently, a randomized placebo-controlled trial showed that community-acquired acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis in women of all ages can be safely and efficaciously treated with oral ciprofloxacin for 7 days. Clearly, such findings need to be extended to men and patients with significant comorbidities. In the present investigator-initiated randomized trial of treatment duration, we use fUTI as the clinical syndrome of interest because this is a broadly recognized specific clinical presentation of patients. Consecutive patients with fUTI were included, including men and women with comorbidities, and treated with antibiotics for 7 or 14 days. The aims of the study were to compare clinical and bacteriological cure at both the short and long term.

### Antibiotics for acute pyelonephritis in children [^112d759c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infection in infants. The most severe form of UTI is acute pyelonephritis, which results in significant acute morbidity and may cause permanent renal damage. Published guidelines recommend treatment of acute pyelonephritis initially with intravenous (IV) therapy followed by oral therapy for seven to 14 days though there is no consensus on the duration of either IV or oral therapy.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of articles and conference proceedings without language restriction. Date of most recent search: December 2006.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different antibiotic agents, routes, frequencies or durations of therapy in children aged 0 to 18 years with proven UTI and acute pyelonephritis were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (WMD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Twenty three studies (3295 children) were eligible for inclusion. No significant differences were found in persistent renal damage at 6 months (2 studies, 424 children: RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.16) or in duration of fever (2 studies, 693 children: WMD 1.54, 95% CI -1.67 to 4.76) between oral antibiotic therapy (10 to 14 days) and IV therapy (3 days) followed by oral therapy (10 days). Similarly no significant differences in persistent renal damage (3 studies, 341 children: RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.49) were found between IV therapy (3 to 4 days) followed by oral therapy and IV therapy for 7 to 14 days. No significant differences in efficacy were found between daily and thrice daily administration of aminoglycosides (1 study, 179 children, persistent symptoms at 3 days: RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.53).

Authors' Conclusions

These results suggest that children with acute pyelonephritis can be treated effectively with oral antibiotics (cefixime, ceftibuten and amoxycillin/clavulanic acid) or with short courses (2 to 4 days) of IV therapy followed by oral therapy. If IV therapy is chosen, single daily dosing with aminoglycosides is safe and effective. Studies are required to determine the optimal total duration of therapy.

### Short-versus long-course antibiotic therapy for acute pyelonephritis in adolescents and adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114fQZsZ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the high incidence of acute pyelonephritis in the community setting, there is no consensus on the optimal duration of treatment. A potential reduction in the duration of the administered antibiotic regimens could contribute to avoiding further development of antimicrobial resistance.

Objective

The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare short-course (7- to 14-day) with long-course (14- to 42-day) treatment with the same antibiotic regimens, in terms of the effectiveness and tolerability, in acute pyelonephritis.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and SCOPUS (January 1966-March 2008) to identify and extract data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness and toxicity of short- versus long-course regimens. Additionally, references of studies were searched. A publication was included if: it was an RCT; involved adult and/or adolescent patients with acute pyelonephritis; compared regimens with the same antibiotic, at the same daily dosage, that were administered for differing durations (a short course and a long course lie, no absolute time cutoff (in days) was employed; rather, the duration of one regimen compared with another defined short- vs long-course]); and reported data regarding clinical success, bacteriologic efficacy, relapses, recurrences, and adverse events and/or patient withdrawals due to adverse events. Trials with a mixed population, including patients with acute pyelonephritis as a subset, were also included in the meta-analysis. Efficacy was assessed by evaluating clinical success, defined as resolution of symptoms and signs at the test-of-cure visit, and bacteriologic efficacy, defined as yielding sterile urine cultures or positive cultures with < 10³ colony-forming units per milliliter of urine at the test-of-cure visit. Tolerability was assessed by extracting data for adverse events.

Results

According to our initial search, 205, 136, 179, and 73 potentially relevant articles were retrieved from PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCOPUS, and references of evaluable trials, respectively. Four RCTs were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Significant differences were not found between the short- and long-course treatment of acute pyclonephritis in terms of clinical success (odds ratio [OR], 1.27; 95% CI, 0.59–2.70), bacteriologic efficacy (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.13–4.95), and relapse (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.08–5.39). Also, significant differences were not found between the short- and long-course treatments regarding adverse events (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.33–1.25), withdrawals due to adverse events (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.28–1.55), and recurrences (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.63–3.06).

Conclusion

This meta-analysis failed to identify any significant differences, with regard to effectiveness and tolerability, between short- and long-course treatment with the same antibiotic.

### Antibiotics for acute pyelonephritis in children [^112WBDMH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants. The most severe form of UTI is acute pyelonephritis, which results in significant acute morbidity and may cause permanent kidney damage. There remains uncertainty regarding the optimum antibiotic regimen, route of administration and duration of treatment. This is an update of a review that was first published in 2003 and updated in 2005 and 2007.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of antibiotics used to treat children with acute pyelonephritis. The aspects of therapy considered were 1) different antibiotics, 2) different dosing regimens of the same antibiotic, 3) different duration of treatment, and 4) different routes of administration.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of articles and conference proceedings without language restriction to 10 April 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different antibiotic agents, routes, frequencies or durations of therapy in children aged 0 to 18 years with proven UTI and acute pyelonephritis were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model and the results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This updated review included 27 studies (4452 children). This update included evidence from three new studies, and following re-evaluation, a previously excluded study was included because it now met our inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed as low for sequence generation (12 studies), allocation concealment (six studies), blinding of outcome assessors (17 studies), incomplete outcome reporting (19 studies) and selective outcome reporting (13 studies). No study was blinded for participants or investigators. The 27 included studies evaluated 12 different comparisons. No significant differences were found in duration of fever (2 studies, 808 children: MD 2.05 hours, 95% CI -0.84 to 4.94), persistent UTI at 72 hours after commencing therapy (2 studies, 542 children: RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.07 to 17.41) or persistent kidney damage at six to 12 months (4 studies, 943 children: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.12) between oral antibiotic therapy (10 to 14 days) and intravenous (IV) therapy (3 days) followed by oral therapy (10 days). Similarly, no significant differences in persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment (4 studies, 305 children: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.55) or persistent kidney damage (4 studies, 726 children: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.29) were found between IV therapy (three to four days) followed by oral therapy and IV therapy (seven to 14 days). No significant differences in efficacy were found between daily and thrice daily administration of aminoglycosides (1 study, 179 children, persistent clinical symptoms at three days: RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.53). Adverse events were mild and uncommon and rarely resulted in discontinuation of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review increases the body of evidence that oral antibiotics alone are as effective as a short course (three to four days) of IV antibiotics followed by oral therapy for a total treatment duration of 10 to 14 days for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in children. When IV antibiotics are given, a short course (two to four days) of IV therapy followed by oral therapy is as effective as a longer course (seven to 10 days) of IV therapy. If IV therapy with aminoglycosides is chosen, single daily dosing is safe and effective. Insufficient data are available to extrapolate these findings to children aged less than one month of age or to children with dilating vesicoureteric reflux (grades III-V). Further studies are required to determine the optimal total duration of antibiotic therapy required for acute pyelonephritis.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^115mn8Lz]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the comparative effectiveness of a short-course of antibiotic treatment for pyelonephritis in children vs a prolonged-course of antibiotics?

Findings

In this comparative effectiveness research study of 791 children (aged 6 months to 18 years) with pyelonephritis, no difference was found in the odds of treatment failure for children prescribed a short-course of antibiotics (median 8 days) vs a prolonged-course of antibiotics (median 11 days).

Meaning

Results of this study suggest that short-courses of antibiotic therapy may be as effective as prolonged-courses for the treatment of pyelonephritis in children.

### Effect of meropenem-vaborbactam vs piperacillin-tazobactam on clinical cure or improvement and microbial eradication in complicated urinary tract infection: the TANGO I randomized clinical trial [^114umekd]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Meropenem-vaborbactam is a combination carbapenem/beta-lactamase inhibitor and a potential treatment for severe drug-resistant gram-negative infections.

Objective

To evaluate efficacy and adverse events of meropenem-vaborbactam in complicated urinary tract infection (UTI), including acute pyelonephritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, randomized clinical trial (TANGO I) conducted November 2014 to April 2016 and enrolling patients (≥ 18 years) with complicated UTI, stratified by infection type and geographic region.

Interventions

Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive meropenem-vaborbactam (2g/2g over 3 hours; n = 274) or piperacillin-tazobactam (4g/0.5g over 30 minutes; n = 276) every 8 hours. After 15 or more doses, patients could be switched to oral levofloxacin if they met prespecified criteria for improvement, to complete 10 days of total treatment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end point for FDA criteria was overall success (clinical cure or improvement and microbial eradication composite) at end of intravenous treatment in the microbiologic modified intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Primary end point for European Medicines Agency (EMA) criteria was microbial eradication at test-of-cure visit in the microbiologic modified ITT and microbiologic evaluable populations. Prespecified noninferiority margin was -15%. Because the protocol prespecified superiority testing in the event of noninferiority, 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated.

Results

Among 550 patients randomized, 545 received study drug (mean age, 52.8 years; 361 [66.2%] women; 374 [68.6%] in the microbiologic modified ITT population; 347 [63.7%] in the microbiologic evaluable population; 508 [93.2%] completed the trial). For the FDA primary end point, overall success occurred in 189 of 192 (98.4%) with meropenem-vaborbactam vs 171 of 182 (94.0%) with piperacillin-tazobactam (difference, 4.5% [95% CI, 0.7% to 9.1%]; P < .001 for noninferiority). For the EMA primary end point, microbial eradication in the microbiologic modified ITT population occurred in 128 of 192 (66.7%) with meropenem-vaborbactam vs 105 of 182 (57.7%) with piperacillin-tazobactam (difference, 9.0% [95% CI, -0.9% to 18.7%]; P < .001 for noninferiority); microbial eradication in the microbiologic evaluable population occurred in 118 of 178 (66.3%) vs 102 of 169 (60.4%) (difference, 5.9% [95% CI, -4.2% to 16.0%]; P < .001 for noninferiority). Adverse events were reported in 106 of 272 (39.0%) with meropenem-vaborbactam vs 97 of 273 (35.5%) with piperacillin-tazobactam.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with complicated UTI, including acute pyelonephritis and growth of a baseline pathogen, meropenem-vaborbactam vs piperacillin-tazobactam resulted in a composite outcome of complete resolution or improvement of symptoms along with microbial eradication that met the noninferiority criterion. Further research is needed to understand the spectrum of patients in whom meropenem-vaborbactam offers a clinical advantage.

IDSA 2023 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), piperacillin–tazobactam suggested approach — If piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated as empiric therapy for uncomplicated cystitis caused by an organism later identified as an ESBL-E and clinical improvement occurs, no change or extension of antibiotic therapy is necessary. The panel suggests TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems rather than piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI, and piperacillin-tazobactam is not suggested for the treatment of infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam is demonstrated.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^112M3bSK]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pyelonephritis, an infection of the upper urinary tract, can lead to both short-term and long-term morbidity, including sepsis, acute kidney injury, renal scarring, and chronic hypertension. To alleviate symptoms during the acute phase of the infection and reduce the potential for long-term consequences, pediatric guidelines recommend treating pyelonephritis with a total of 7 to 14 days of antibiotic therapy.

A growing body of evidence supports the noninferiority of short durations of therapy (in the range of 5–7 days) compared with prolonged durations for producing clinical cure in adults with pyelonephritis. However, limited data explore this question in children. Moreover, there is a need for more robust evidence in children with urological abnomalities. The benefits of a short course of antibiotic therapy for pyelonephritis include improved patient convenience, a decreased likelihood of adverse drug events, a reduced risk of the emergence of antibiotic resistant organisms, and reduced abdominal discomfort.

Since 2016, The Johns Hopkins Hospital Pediatric Antibiotic Treatment Guidelines, accessible to clinicians at all 5 of the hospitals contributing data to the current study, recommend treating children with pyelonephritis with 7 days of antibiotic therapy (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). These guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary team including primary care clinicians, emergency medicine clinicians, hospitalists, urologists, nephrologists, intensivists, and infectious diseases clinicians based on a review of the available evidence in adult and pediatric populations and expert opinion where gaps in data were evident. However, despite the availability of local treatment guidelines, variability remains in prescribed treatment durations for children with pyelonephritis, providing an opportunity to investigate the association between varying durations of antibiotic therapy and patient outcomes. Our objective was to compare the clinical outcomes of children receiving a short-course (< 10 days) vs a prolonged-course (≥ 10 days) of antibiotics for the treatment of pyelonephritis.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI — In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, sepsis or septic shock, immunocompromised states, severe renal insufficiency, and functional or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and some patients in these subpopulations may need an individualized plan of therapy. An effective antimicrobial agent means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115GiUUr]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The ICU is the epicenter of bacteremia, antibiotic use, and antibiotic resistance in most hospitals. Reductions in the length of antibiotic treatment courses could potentially limit antibiotic use, adverse effects, and resistance pressure, but antibiotic stewardship efforts to shorten therapy are hampered by the lack of research regarding minimally acceptable durations of treatment for BSIs. Our systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that both inpatients and outpatients with non- S. aureus bacteremia secondary to mild to moderate intra-abdominal infection, CAP, or pyelonephritis may be successfully treated with shorter (5 to 7 days) courses of therapy. However, this finding must be interpreted with caution, as only very small numbers of patients and subgroup analyses are currently available for interpretation. A large dedicated trial of treatment duration for bacteremia in severely ill patients is urgently needed to determine the optimal duration of therapy.

Randomization and Masking

Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either 6 g ZTI-01 infused over 60 minutes every 8 hours [q8h] or 4.5 g PIP-TAZ (4 g PIP/0.5 g TAZ) infused over 60 minutes q8h. The PIP-TAZ dosage was based on labeled guidelines for cUTI/AP in the current Summary of Medicinal Product Characteristics, with no dosage adjustment necessary. ZTI-01 doses were adjusted for patients with CrCl < 50 and ≥ 20 mL/min (Supplementary Appendix). Subjects with baseline CrCl < 20 mL/min were excluded from the study. Randomization was stratified by region (US vs Rest of World), baseline diagnosis (cUTI vs AP), and prior antibiotic therapy (single dose of short-acting antibiotic vs no prior antibiotic therapy). At least 30% of patients were intended to have a diagnosis of AP at study entry.

Patients received ZTI-01 and PIP-TAZ as 1-hour infusions 3 times daily for a fixed 7 days, except in patients with concurrent bacteremia who could receive up to 14 days at the investigator's discretion. Oral step-down therapy was prohibited.

Study Procedures

Procedures included baseline urine collection for quantitative culture and blood cultures. Routine monitoring occurred for signs and symptoms of cUTI/AP and adverse events (AEs), and prespecified collection of laboratory data including chemistry panels, complete blood counts, and urine/blood cultures (Supplementary Appendix).

Baseline urine cultures growing ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL and any positive blood cultures were sent to the central laboratory (JMI Laboratories, North Liberty, Iowa) for identification, quantification, susceptibility testing, and further characterization of the organism(s). Fosfomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined at a central lab using the agar dilution reference method.

AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E) serious infections — piperacillin-tazobactam use is discouraged except in limited circumstances. The panel suggests against prescribing piperacillin-tazobactam for serious infections caused by AmpC-E, noting at least 4 observational studies identifying poorer clinical outcomes in patients prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^115syJci]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that short courses of antibiotic therapy may be as effective as prolonged courses for children with pyelonephritis. Given the high incidence of UTIs in children and the increasing concern for antibiotic resistance and other negative sequelae associated with antibiotic overuse, a shorter duration of therapy for pyelonephritis could have implications for public health.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

PIPRACIL may be administered by the intramuscular
route (see NOTE) or intravenously as a three- to five-minute intravenous
injection or as a 20- to 30-minute infusion. The usual dosage of PIPRACIL
for serious infections is 3 to 4 g given every four to six
hours as a 20- to 30-minute infusion. For serious infections, the
intravenous route should be used.

PIPRACIL should
not be mixed with an aminoglycoside in a syringe or infusion bottle
since this can result in inactivation of the aminoglycoside.

The maximum daily dose for adults is usually 24 g/day,
although higher doses have been used.

Intramuscular
injections (see NOTE) should be limited to 2 g per injection site.
This route of administration has been used primarily in the treatment
of patients with uncomplicated gonorrhea and urinary tract infections.

The average duration of PIPRACIL treatment is from
seven to ten days, except in the treatment of gynecologic infections,
which is from three to ten days; the duration should be guided by
the patient's clinical and bacteriological progress. For most
acute infections, treatment should be continued for at least 48 to
72 hours after the patient becomes asymptomatic. Antibiotic therapy
for S. pyogenes infections
should be maintained for at least ten days to reduce the risk of rheumatic
fever.

When PIPRACIL is given concurrently with
aminoglycosides, both drugs should be used in full therapeutic doses.

Renal Impairment

For patients on hemodialysis, the maximum daily
dose is 6 g/day (2 g every 8 hours). In addition, because
hemodialysis removes 30% to 50% of piperacillin in 4 hours, a 1-g
additional dose should be administered following each dialysis period.

For patients with renal failure and hepatic insufficiency,
measurement of serum levels of piperacillin will provide additional
guidance for adjusting dosage.

Prophylaxis

When possible, PIPRACIL should be administered as
a 20- to 30-minute infusion just prior to anesthesia. Administration
while the patient is awake will facilitate identification of possible
adverse reactions during drug infusion. (See PRECAUTION, Drug Interactions .)

Pediatric patients. Dosages in pediatric patients under 12 years of age have not been
studied in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and associated Gram-negative bacteremia treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly included patients who were afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and had achieved source control (relief of any urinary obstruction) before transitioning to oral antibiotics. An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

Data are insufficient to favor 1 of these agents over the others, and once-daily tobramycin or amikacin are alternative agents for the treatment of P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis or cUTI, although there is a duration-dependent risk of nephrotoxicity.

METHODS

Objectives

The primary objective was to demonstrate noninferiority (NI) of ZTI-01 to PIP-TAZ in overall success (clinical cure and microbiologic eradication) in microbiologic modified intent-to-treat (m-MITT) population at test of cure (TOC, day 19–21). Secondary objectives were to compare: (1) clinical cure rates in the 2 treatment groups in MITT, m-MITT, clinical evaluable (CE), and microbiologic evaluable (ME) populations at TOC, and (2) microbiological eradication rates in m-MITT and ME populations at TOC.

Study Design and Participants

ZEUS was a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind phase 2/3 trial designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ZTI-01 in treating hospitalized adults with cUTI/AP versus PIP-TAZ at 92 global sites in 16 countries (Figure 1).

Early administration of appropriate empiric antibiotics is essential for achieving the best possible outcomes in sepsis. Yet the choice of antibiotic therapy has become more challenging due to recent reports of nephrotoxicity with the combination of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, the "workhorse" regimen at many institutions. In this article we assess the evidence for nephrotoxicity and its possible mechanisms, provide recommendations for risk mitigation, address the advantages and disadvantages of alternative antibiotic choices, and suggest areas for future research.

### Case report: xanthogranulomutous pyelonephritis presenting as "Wilms' tumor" [^114Jr7Cx]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Medical therapy with antibitics only has been effective for treatment of XGP in a handful of cases but may be appropriate as a temporary measure for patients requiring workup before nephrectomy and prophylactic antibiotics should be administered before and after surgical intervention. The choice of antibiotic has to be tailored toward the identity and sensitivity of the offending organism. Proteus species and E coli are usually sensitive to several antibiotics, including first-generation cephalosporins which can be started empirically pending sensitivity results. Pseudomonas species has a narrow spectrum of sensitivity and usually require the use of aminoglycosides, third-generation cephalosporins, or fluoroquinolones. For non-septic patients and those evaluated on an outpatient basis, some authors recommend use of oral antibiotics until surgery, at which point intravenous antibiotics should be administered. There is no clear recommendation regarding the duration of antibiotic therapy but data from published case series favor a continuation of oral antibiotics at least for one week post nephrectomy. Our patient underwent left radical nephrectomy and was kept on intravenous Piperacillin-tazobactam for 7 days post nephrectomy and remains asymptomatic at the time of submission of this manuscript.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^113TcUvx]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

National guidelines recommend treating children with pyelonephritis for 7 to 14 days of antibiotic therapy, yet data are lacking to suggest a more precise treatment duration.

Objective

To compare the clinical outcomes of children receiving a short-course vs a prolonged-course of antibiotic treatment for pyelonephritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective observational study using inverse probability of treatment weighted propensity score analysis of data from 5 hospitals in Maryland between July 1, 2016, and October 1, 2018. Participants were children aged 6 months to 18 years with a urine culture growing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, or Proteus mirabilis with laboratory and clinical criteria for pyelonephritis.

Exposures

Treatment of pyelonephritis with a short-course (6 to 9 days) vs a prolonged-course (10 or more days) of antibiotics.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Composite outcome of treatment failure within 30 days of completing antibiotic therapy: (a) unanticipated emergency department or outpatient visits related to urinary tract infection symptoms, (b) hospital readmission related to UTI symptoms, (c) prolongation of the planned, initial antibiotic treatment course, or (d) death. A subsequent urinary tract infection caused by a drug-resistant bacteria within 30 days was a secondary outcome.

Results

Of 791 children who met study eligibility criteria (mean [SD] age 9.2 [6.3] years; 672 [85.0%]) were girls, 297 patients (37.5%) were prescribed a short-course and 494 patients (62.5%) were prescribed a prolonged-course of antibiotics. The median duration of short-course therapy was 8 days (interquartile range, 7–8 days), and the median duration of prolonged-course therapy was 11 days (interquartile range, 11–12 days). Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups in the inverse probability of treatment weighted cohort. There were 79 children (10.1%) who experienced treatment failure. The odds of treatment failure were similar for patients prescribed a short-course vs a prolonged-course of antibiotics (11.2% vs 9.4%; odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.75–1.98). There was no significant difference in the odds of a drug-resistant uropathogen for patients with a subsequent urinary tract infection within 30 days when prescribed a short-courses vs prolonged-course of antibiotics (40% vs 64%; odds ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.09–1.43).

Conclusions and Relevance

The study findings suggest that short-course antibiotic therapy may be as effective as prolonged-courses for children with pyelonephritis, and may mitigate the risk of future drug-resistant urinary tract infections. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.

DISCUSSION

In ZEUS, ZTI-01 was noninferior to PIP-TAZ in overall success for treatment of cUTI/AP. Overall success occurred in 64.7% of ZTI-01 and 54.5% of PIP-TAZ patients (treatment difference of 10.2%, 95% CI [−0.4, 20.8]). Post hoc analysis of this primary endpoint using PFGE-typed uropathogens demonstrated an increased treatment difference favoring ZTI-01 (69.0% ZTI-01 vs 57.3% PIP-TAZ patients, treatment difference of 11.7% [95% CI: 1.3, 22.1]). Clinical cure rates were > 90% in both treatment groups (Table 2). Microbiologic eradication rates at TOC (70.7% ZTI-01 vs 60.1% PIP-TAZ) were within range of those observed in contemporary cUTI trials, considering differences in timing of TOC, definitions of eradication, proportions of enrolled cUTI versus AP, instrumentation rates, and other factors. Most patients with microbiological persistence had identifiable reasons or risk factors for persistence. Notably, these patients were clinical cures at TOC, did not require rescue antimicrobial therapy, and remained sustained clinical cures at late follow-up. High dose of PIP-TAZ utilized in this study was according to current labeled guidelines for treating cUTI/AP, and the dosage was similar to that used in a recent registration cUTI/AP study.

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

Treatment

Randomized participants were stratified and dosed by age group. The selected doses were based on population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations. For participants in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group, those 12 to < 18 years of age were given 1.0 g ceftolozane and 0.5 g tazobactam (the dose indicated for adult patients with cUTI), and those from birth to < 12 years of age were given 20 mg/kg ceftolozane and 10 mg/kg tazobactam (maximum of 1.0 g ceftolozane and 0.5 g tazobactam per dose). All participants in the meropenem group received 20 mg/kg (maximum of 1.0 g per dose), with higher dosing up to 30 mg/kg for participants who were 14 days to < 3 months of age permitted at the investigator's discretion. Each dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam or meropenem was administered as a 60-minute (± 10 minutes) infusion and dosed every 8 hours (± 1 hour) after the previous infusion.

Treatment duration was 7–14 days. After 3 days (9 doses) of IV therapy, optional open-label, standard-of-care, oral step-down therapy was permitted at the investigator's discretion, with choice of therapy guided by culture and antibacterial susceptibility results, as well as local standard of care for treatment of cUTI. Recommended options for oral step-down therapy were β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim‚ or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

Specimen Collection

A baseline urine sample for culture was obtained ≤ 48 hours before the start of administration of the first dose of study treatment. Urine specimens were obtained by suprapubic aspiration, clean urethral catheterization, indwelling urethral catheter‚ or midstream clean catch. Additional details of specimen collection and culture of urine specimens are included in Methods, Supplemental Digital Content 1.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111PZ2N8]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

A recent global point prevalence survey of infections in 1,265 intensive care units (ICUs) documented bloodstream infection (BSI) among 15% of patients, and this rate may be increasing over time because of increased use of immunosuppressive drugs, invasive procedures, and older patients who have concomitant medical conditions and who are admitted to intensive care. These infections are a major contributor to patient morbidity and are associated with a doubling or even tripling of mortality. Mortality rates may be higher if delayed or ineffective initial antimicrobial therapy is prescribed, and so it is difficult to reduce broad-spectrum antibiotic use in the initial empiric phase of treatment in this vulnerable patient population. In contrast, it may be more feasible to reduce antibiotic use at the back end of treatment courses. Up to half of the antibiotic use in hospital wards and critical care units is unnecessary or inappropriate, and excessive durations of treatment are the greatest contributor to inappropriate use. A reduction in the length of antibiotic courses is, therefore, a potentially viable strategy to minimize the consequences of antibiotic overuse in critical care, including antibiotic resistance, adverse effects, Clostridium difficile colitis, and costs.

The optimal duration of therapy for primary BSI and BSI secondary to major organ system infections has been poorly defined. A review of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the treatment of infections most commonly encountered in the critical care setting - including guidelines for community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia, intra-abdominal infection, catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), pyelonephritis, and skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) - provides no guidance about the optimal duration of therapy for the subset of patients with bacteremia. In the absence of high-grade evidence, there is wide variability in antibiotic treatment duration recommendations from infectious disease and critical care specialists, and the presence of bacteremia is often used as a justification for extended courses of antibiotic therapy regardless of the observed clinical response to treatment. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining duration of therapy in several organ system infections have demonstrated that treatment can be shortened to 1 week or less without worsening patient outcomes, so it is plausible that treatment duration could potentially be shortened for BSIs as well.

CONCLUSIONS

In this study, ZTI-01 met the primary objective of NI compared with PIP-TAZ in treatment of hospitalized patients with cUTI/AP. ZTI-01 provides a differentiated MOA with a broad spectrum of activity inclusive of Gram-negative pathogens, including ESBL producing and MDR Enterobacteriaceae. In the era of unmet medical needs due to growing concerns pertaining to MDR bacteria, ZTI-01 potentially offers an important novel IV therapeutic to the antibiotic armamentarium in the United States.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

In addition to the adverse drug reactions identified in clinical trials in Table 4 and Table 5, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ZOSYN. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Hepatobiliary — hepatitis, jaundice

Hematologic — hemolytic anemia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia

Immune — hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions (including shock), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), acute myocardial ischemia with or without myocardial infarction may occur as part of an allergic reaction.

Renal — interstitial nephritis

Nervous system disorders — seizures

Psychiatric disorders — delirium

Respiratory — eosinophilic pneumonia

Skin and Appendages — erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, (DRESS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), dermatitis exfoliative, and linear IgA bullous dermatosis.

Musculoskeletal Disorders — rhabdomyolysis

Postmarketing experience with ZOSYN in pediatric patients suggests a similar safety profile to that seen in adults.

6.3 Additional Experience with Piperacillin

The following adverse reaction has also been reported for piperacillin for injection:

Skeletal — prolonged neuromuscular blockade [see Drug Interactions (7.5)].

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115pdiDB]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

The eligible trials of treatment duration in pyelonephritis involved diverse patient populations, durations of treatment, and outcome measures, and this explains the heterogeneity of outcomes with shorter durations of therapy. Recently, the results of several RCTs have demonstrated short-course (5 or 7 days) fluoroquinolone therapy to be equally as efficacious as 10 to 14 days of treatment with comparator medications. IDSA guidelines were accordingly amended to recommend therapy for 7 days, but the issue of bacteremia was not explicitly addressed. Our data suggest that patients with bacteremia secondary to uncomplicated pyelonephritis can be successfully treated with shorter-duration therapy.

The sole trial of treatment duration in SSTI demonstrated that, in a carefully selected healthy adult population, a short duration of therapy was associated with a cure rate equal to that of a long duration of therapy. However, the explicit exclusion of patients with more serious infections, argues that it is unlikely that these data can be directly extrapolated to critically ill patients with bacteremic soft tissue infections.

The present review has several important limitations. The prespecified search strategy excluded unpublished data and non-English language trials. Of eligible trials, bias may have been introduced by low rates of blinding and use of placebo controls. Some studies included only patients with early clinical improvement for randomization to short- or long-course therapy; consequently, the effect size and findings may not be generalizable to sicker patient populations. Other trials excluded patients post-randomization or presented only per-protocol analyses and so may have excluded bacteremic patients failing therapy. Treatment outcomes for patients with bacteremia in individual studies were derived from small post hoc subgroup analyses. Finally, within individual infectious syndromes, significant variability was encountered both in study design and in the durations of therapy employed (with 14 days even considered shorter-course therapy in one study). However, the lack of outcome heterogeneity between syndromes suggests that it is valid to pool BSI data from multiple infectious foci into a single meta-analysis or enroll such patients within a single RCT.

### Evaluation of the efficacy of piperacillin / tazobactam in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producingUrinary tract infections: a systematic review of the literature [^112NYRSw]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of piperacillin/tazobactam (PTZ) for the treatment of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Data Sources

A systematic review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards on PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Central through July 2024.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies providing efficacy data associated with PTZ in patients ≥ 18 years old experiencing an ESBL-PE UTI that documented clinical and microbiological cure data were included.

Data Synthesis

A total of 577 articles were obtained for screening. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 7 studies comparing PTZ with carbapenems comprised of 1156 patient cases were analyzed. Piperacillin/tazobactam was found to be noninferior to carbapenems in the treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTI's caused by ESBL-PE. The observed noninferiority encompassed clinical response, clinical cure, and microbiological cure outcome metrics. Although not specifically evaluated in this systematic review, adverse effects associated with PTZ were found to be minimal and lesser in incidence than with the carbapenem comparators in aggregate.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

While a definitive dosing strategy remains elusive, a PTZ total daily dose of 13.5 g infused over 3 to 4 hours may be appropriate for this indication.

Conclusion

Piperacillin/tazobactam may be an effective carbapenem-sparing agent for the treatment of ESBL-PE UTIs that show in-vitro susceptibility to PTZ. However, additional robust randomized clinical trials are still needed to validate the findings of this review and determine the best dosage regimen of PTZ for ESBL-PE UTIs.

Discussion

Our findings show that community-acquired fUTI can be safely and efficaciously treated with antimicrobial treatment for 7 days in women as it is non-inferior to 14 days of therapy. However, in men with fUTI, the 7-day treatment was significantly inferior to 14 days of treatment.

The main strength of this trial is its pragmatic nature reflecting daily clinical practice with the inclusion of consecutive patients with fUTI, both men and women, irrespective of age and underlying medical conditions, with the notable exception of those with severe kidney disease, antibiotic allergy, and pregnancy. Several hospitals were involved, including a referral university hospital, and general practitioners, who enrolled about one fourth of our patients. Therefore, patients recruited into the study are considered representative of individuals with acute community-acquired fUTI, encompassing acute pyelonephritis, prostatitis, and the urosepsis syndrome. Over 55% of patients were initially hospitalized because of fUTI, likely because of presumed urosepsis syndrome, and a relative high number of patients had bacteremia. Of note, the findings hold for both the ITT and the PP analyses, underlying the high compliance by patients randomized with respect to the treatment protocol and precluding that poor study procedures may have concealed differences in patient management. Finally, the clinical cure rate at 90 days after initial presentation with fUTI was evaluable in 188 (94%) patients and, though characterized as a secondary outcome measure, for the whole group as well as the subgroups of men and women, they all met the criteria for non-inferiority.

There are, however, also some limitations. First of all, the diagnosis of fUTI was not confirmed by cultures for all patients. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the attending physicians still made a clinical diagnosis of fUTI is such cases, and no alternative diagnosis for fever or urinary tract symptoms was made. Secondly, our study lacks statistical power to draw confident conclusions on the various subgroups because of the limited number of patients enrolled. However, it should be noted that all subgroups analyzed were predefined in the study protocol. Finally, it should be noted that several patient categories (e.g. ciprofloxacin-resistant uropathogen, renal transplant, pregnancy, indication for antimicrobial treatment for at least 14 days) were excluded from randomization. Thus, our findings might not be generalizable to all patients with fUTI.

Table 5.
Patients With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (≥ 2% of Patients in Any Treatment Group) by System Organ Class and Preferred Term (Population: Safety)

Most common laboratory abnormality TEAEs were increased ALT and AST (Table 5). None of the aminotransferase elevations were symptomatic or treatment-limiting. No patient met Hy's law criteria. All cases exhibiting ALT or AST > 3×ULN were adjudicated by an independent, blinded Transaminase Elevation Adjudication Committee; most ALT/AST elevations were deemed mild and possibly related to the study drug (23 ZTI-01, 5 PIP-TAZ cases).

Hypokalemia occurred in 71/232 (30.6%) ZTI-01 and 29/230 (12.6%) PIP-TAZ patients. Most cases were mild-to-moderate in severity; shifts in potassium levels from normal at baseline to hypokalemia were more frequent in the ZTI-01 group for mild (17.7% vs 11.3%), moderate (11.2% vs 0.9%), and severe (1.7% vs 0.4%) categories of hypokalemia. Hypokalemia was deemed a TEAE in 6.4% ZTI-01 and 1.3% PIP-TAZ, and all cases were transient and asymptomatic (Table 5). Although no significant cardiac AEs were observed, postbaseline QTcF of > 450 to ≤ 480 msec (baseline QTcF of ≤ 450 msec) occurred at a higher frequency in ZTI-01 patients (7.3%) compared with PIP-TAZ (2.5%). In the ZTI-01 arm, these appear to correlate with the hypokalemia associated with IV formulation salt load. Only 1 patient (PIP-TAZ group) had a baseline QTcF of ≤ 500 msec and postbaseline QTcF of > 500 msec.

### Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: a focus on microbiological and antibiotic resistance profiles [^113oePy2]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conservative management of XGP (with antibiotics or partial nephrectomy) has been described for focal forms of the disease. Nevertheless, diffuse forms usually require total nephrectomy. As recommended by Schlossberg et al. extended-spectrum penicillin (e.g. piperacillin–tazobactam), cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime), fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin) or ampicillin with gentamicin are all appropriate choices for treatment. Intravenous treatment for 24–48 h after resolution of symptoms and fever is necessary, followed by at least 2 weeks of oral antibiotics based on susceptibility testing. In our case series, piperacillin–tazobactam (48.1%) and ceftriaxone (18.5%) were the most frequent antibiotic therapies.

Considering increasing antibiotic resistance rates over the last decades, antibiotic therapy recommendations and prescribing patterns for acute pyelonephritis have changed. Enterobacteriaceae are common uropathogens causing acute pyelonephritis (APN), and E. coli is the most frequent among them. These uropathogens have become resistant to several important antibiotics, such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones (FQs) and 3 rd generation cephalosporins (3 rd CEPs). According to a study conducted in Korea by Kim et al. 3 rd CEPs were the most commonly prescribed antibiotics (41.4%) for inpatients, followed by FQs. However, the use of 3 rd CEPs, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, and carbapenems increased substantially for the treatment of hospitalized APN patients. In particular, carbapenem use increased 3.1-fold over 5 years. Moreover, the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART), which has collected 1,116 gram-negative urinary pathogens from hospitalized patients in 33 countries during 2009–2010, showed that the rates of fluoroquinolone resistance (FQR) in gram-negative bacilli vary widely country to country; for example, they were 23.5% in North America, 29.4% in Europe, and 33.2% in Asia. As a consequence, this study suggests that FQs may no longer be effective as first-line therapy for gram-negative UTIs in hospitalized patients.

Excretion

Following single or multiple piperacillin and tazobactam doses to healthy subjects, the plasma half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam ranged from 0.7 to 1.2 hours and was unaffected by dose or duration of infusion.

Both piperacillin and tazobactam are eliminated via the kidney by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Piperacillin is excreted rapidly as unchanged drug with 68% of the administered dose excreted in the urine. Tazobactam and its metabolite are eliminated primarily by renal excretion with 80% of the administered dose excreted as unchanged drug and the remainder as the single metabolite. Piperacillin, tazobactam and desethyl piperacillin are also secreted into the bile.

Renal Impairment

After the administration of single doses of piperacillin and tazobactam to subjects with renal impairment, the half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam increases with decreasing creatinine clearance. At creatinine clearance below 20 mL/min, the increase in half-life is twofold for piperacillin and fourfold for tazobactam compared to subjects with normal renal function. Dosage adjustments for piperacillin and tazobactam are recommended when creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min in patients receiving the usual recommended daily dose of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection [see Dosage and Administration (2)] for specific recommendations for the treatment of patients with renal impairment.

Hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of a piperacillin and tazobactam dose with an additional 5% of the tazobactam dose removed as the tazobactam metabolite. Peritoneal dialysis removes approximately 6% and 21% of the piperacillin and tazobactam doses, respectively, with up to 16% of the tazobactam dose removed as the tazobactam metabolite. For dosage recommendations for patients undergoing hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Hepatic Impairment

The half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam increases by approximately 25% and 18%, respectively, in patients with hepatic cirrhosis compared to healthy subjects. However, this difference does not warrant dosage adjustment of piperacillin and tazobactam due to hepatic cirrhosis.

### We need to optimize piperacillin-tazobactam dosing in critically ill patients-but how? [^113bGebD]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Administering PIP-TAZ as a prolonged infusion — that is, either administering the antibiotic over half the dosing interval (e.g. over 3 h if given QID), or administering the total daily dose as a continuous infusion over 24 h after an initial loading dose — may help overcome subtherapeutic PIP concentrations in the critically ill. There are now observational studies as well as randomized controlled trial (RCT) data that show increased likelihood of PIP concentrations being maintained above the MIC of pathogens using the prolonged infusion strategy. Furthermore, there were higher rates of clinical cure associated with PIP-TAZ administered as a continuous infusion in the RCTs. Both of the RCTs included patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, and so, coupled with the results from the study by Zander et al. showing PK/PD target attainment being problematic in these groups of patients via intermittent bolus dosing, the use of prolonged infusions may be a simple strategy that ICUs can employ. Notably, however, prolonged infusions may still not achieve therapeutic targets in certain groups of patients, such as those displaying ARC. In these circumstances, dose up-titration may also be advisable, but can only be comfortably performed with use of TDM.

Statistical Analyses

Sample size of 230 patients per arm (N = 460) was based on FDA-agreed upon 15% NI margin, 70% predicted evaluability rate, 70% overall success rate in both treatment groups, 80% power, and 1-sided α = 0.025. Number and percentage of patients in each treatment group with an overall success, failure, and indeterminate response (ie, patients with missing data) were determined and response rate for the primary analysis was defined as the number of successes divided by the number of success, failure, and indeterminate. A 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the observed difference in overall success rate (ZTI-01 group minus PIP-TAZ group) was calculated using a continuity-corrected Z-statistic. Noninferiority of ZTI-01 to PIP-TAZ determined if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in the m-MITT was > −15%. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).

2.1 Dosage in Adult Patients with Indications Other Than Nosocomial Pneumonia

The usual total daily dosage of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection for adult patients with indications other than nosocomial pneumonia is 3.375 g every six hours [totaling 13.5 g (12 g piperacillin and 1.5 g tazobactam)], to be administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The usual duration of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection treatment is from 7 to 10 days.

2.2 Dosage in Adult Patients with Nosocomial Pneumonia

Initial presumptive treatment of adult patients with nosocomial pneumonia should start with piperacillin and tazobactam for injection at a dosage of 4.5 g every six hours plus an aminoglycoside, [totaling 18 g (16 g piperacillin and 2 g tazobactam)], administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The recommended duration of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection treatment for nosocomial pneumonia is 7 to 14 days. Treatment with the aminoglycoside should be continued in patients from whom P. aeruginosa is isolated.

2.3 Dosage in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment

In adult patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 40 mL/min) and dialysis patients (hemodialysis and CAPD), the intravenous dose of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection should be reduced based on the degree of renal impairment. The recommended daily dosage of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection for patients with renal impairment administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes is described in Table 1.

For patients on hemodialysis, the maximum dose is 2.25 g every twelve hours for all indications other than nosocomial pneumonia and 2.25 g every eight hours for nosocomial pneumonia. Since hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of the administered dose, an additional dose of 0.75 g piperacillin and tazobactam for injection (0.67 g piperacillin and 0.08 g tazobactam) should be administered following each dialysis period on hemodialysis days. No additional dosage of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection is necessary for CAPD patients.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotics (guidance for selection), IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider guiding the selection of empiric antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected complicated UTI, including pyelonephritis, by the severity of illness, specifically whether the patient is in sepsis.
Use the Sepsis-3 definition, which defines sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Identify patients by an increase in the SOFA score of ≥ 2 points, indicating an in-hospital mortality risk > 10%, or presumptively identify using screening tools such as qSOFA or Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome.

Safety

A total of 42.1% ZTI-01 patients and 32.0% PIP-TAZ patients experienced at least 1 TEAE (Table 5). Most were mild or moderate in severity; severe TEAEs were uncommon (2.1% ZTI-01, 1.7% PIP-TAZ). Most common TEAEs in both treatment groups were asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities and gastrointestinal events. Serious AEs (SAEs) were uncommon in both treatment groups (2.1% ZTI-01, 2.6% PIP-TAZ). There were no deaths in the study; 1 SAE in each treatment group was deemed related to study drug (hypokalemia in a ZTI-01 patient, renal impairment in a PIP-TAZ patient). Study drug discontinuations due to TEAEs were infrequent and similar between treatment groups (3.0% ZTI-01, 2.6% PIP-TAZ).

### Diagnosis and management of acute pyelonephritis in adults [^116DKHYK]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

There are approximately 250,000 cases of acute pyelonephritis each year, resulting in more than 100,000 hospitalizations. The most common etiologic cause is infection with Escherichia coli. The combination of the leukocyte esterase test and the nitrite test (with either test proving positive) has a sensitivity of 75 to 84 percent and a specificity of 82 to 98 percent for urinary tract infection. Urine cultures are positive in 90 percent of patients with acute pyelonephritis, and cultures should be obtained before antibiotic therapy is initiated. The use of blood cultures should be reserved for patients with an uncertain diagnosis, those who are immunocompromised, and those who are suspected of having hematogenous infections. Outpatient oral antibiotic therapy with a fluoroquinolone is successful in most patients with mild uncomplicated pyelonephritis. Other effective alternatives include extended-spectrum penicillins, amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium, cephalosporins, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Indications for inpatient treatment include complicated infections, sepsis, persistent vomiting, failed outpatient treatment, or extremes of age. In hospitalized patients, intravenous treatment is recommended with a fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside with or without ampicillin, or a third-generation cephalosporin. The standard duration of therapy is seven to 14 days. Urine culture should be repeated one to two weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy. Treatment failure may be caused by resistant organisms, underlying anatomic/functional abnormalities, or immunosuppressed states. Lack of response should prompt repeat blood and urine cultures and, possibly, imaging studies. A change in antibiotics or surgical intervention may be required.

2.4	Dosage in Adult Patients With Renal Impairment

In adult patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 40 mL/min) and dialysis patients (hemodialysis and CAPD), the intravenous dose of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection should be reduced based on the degree of renal impairment.

METHODS

Study Design and Participants

RECAPTURE 1 and 2 comprised 2 identical phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trials designed incorporating FDA and EMA guidance. All patients (or their legal representatives) provided written informed consent. The studies were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Protocols (available at:) were approved by study sites' independent ethics committees and/or institutional review boards.

Thelists full inclusion/exclusion criteria. In brief, eligible patients were aged 18–90 years, and had cUTI or acute pyelonephritis considered by the investigator to be serious and requiring hospitalization for intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy. Diagnosis was based on positive urine cultures obtained within 48 hours of enrollment showing 1–2 gram-negative uropathogens at ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, and pyuria. Complicated UTI without pyelonephritis was defined as presence of ≥ 2 symptoms, including ≥ 1 UTI-specific symptom (dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain with onset/worsening within the previous 7 days) as well as ≥ 1 complicating factor. Acute pyelonephritis was indicated by flank pain with onset/worsening within the previous 7 days, and/or costovertebral angle tenderness, with fever and/or nausea/vomiting. Patients could be enrolled before cultures were available, providing that positive results were expected, the study drugs were considered appropriate empiric therapy, and a urine Gram stain showed gram-negative bacilli and no gram-positive bacteria. Indwelling bladder catheters in place for > 24 hours had to be removed or replaced (unless considered unsafe or contraindicated) before the baseline urine collection. Standardized catheter management guidelines were followed.

Key exclusion criteria included complete obstruction of any portion of the urinary tract, perinephric or intrarenal abscess, or prostatitis; UTI symptoms potentially attributable to another process; urinary diversion or vesicoureteral reflux; creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≤ 30 mL/minute (including patients on dialysis).

### Defining effective durations of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infections in hospitalized children [^112SQDPL]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and urinary tract infections (UTI) are two common childhood infections often leading to hospital admission. National guidelines for CAP and UTI in children recommend durations of antibiotic therapy of 10 days and 7–14 days, respectively. Due to concerns of rising antimicrobial resistance and an increased awareness of harms associated with prolonged courses of antibiotics, there is a renewed emphasis on reevaluating commonly prescribed durations of antibiotic therapy across bacterial infections. We describe recent clinical trials and observational studies evaluating durations of therapy for CAP and UTI in adults and children and translate the findings to our suggested approach for selecting durations of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized children.

Recent Findings

There is a growing body of evidence, primarily in adults, that shorter durations of therapy than are commonly prescribed are just as effective as longer durations for CAP and UTIs.

Summary

Combining clinical trial data from adults with available data in children, we believe it is reasonable to consider 5 days of therapy for CAP, 3–5 days of therapy for cystitis, and 7 days of therapy for pyelonephritis for most hospitalized children with uncomplicated infections.

### We need to optimize piperacillin-tazobactam dosing in critically ill patients-but how? [^113vaxgM]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Zander and colleagues have provided new information on target attainment of PIP concentrations in a heterogeneous group of critically ill patients. Among patients without severe renal dysfunction, there are concerns of not reaching PK/PD targets using traditional TID dosing of PIP-TAZ. There also is high inter- and intra-patient variability in PIP concentrations. Alternative dosing strategies that optimize PIP-TAZ therapy are needed and may include the use of prolonged infusions. Importantly, there is strong rationale for the use of regular TDM to be the cornerstone for individualizing PIP-TAZ therapy and maximize efficacy.

### Acute pyelonephritis in adults: rapid evidence review [^111SjmRZ]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute pyelonephritis is a bacterial infection of the kidney and renal pelvis and should be suspected in patients with flank pain and laboratory evidence of urinary tract infection. Urine culture with antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be performed in all patients and used to direct therapy. Imaging, blood cultures, and measurement of serum inflammatory markers should not be performed in uncomplicated cases. Outpatient management is appropriate in patients who have uncomplicated disease and can tolerate oral therapy. Extended emergency department or observation unit stays are an appropriate option for patients who initially warrant intravenous therapy. Fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are effective oral antibiotics in most cases, but increasing resistance makes empiric use problematic. When local resistance to a chosen oral antibiotic likely exceeds 10%, one dose of a long-acting broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotic should also be given while awaiting susceptibility data. Patients admitted to the hospital should receive parenteral antibiotic therapy, and those with sepsis or risk of infection with a multidrug-resistant organism should receive antibiotics with activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms. Most patients respond to appropriate management within 48 to 72 hours, and those who do not should be evaluated with imaging and repeat cultures while alternative diagnoses are considered. In cases of concurrent urinary tract obstruction, referral for urgent decompression should be pursued. Pregnant patients with pyelonephritis are at significantly elevated risk of severe complications and should be admitted and treated initially with parenteral therapy.

WHAT'S NEW ON THIS TOPIC Pyelonephritis As of 2014, Escherichia coli resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones in the United States exceeded 35% and 10%, respectively. A systematic review of 8 randomized controlled trials demonstrated equivalent clinical success rates in treating uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis with a 5- to 7-day course of fluoroquinolones compared with a 14-day course. In the male subgroup of a 2017 randomized controlled trial, a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin was inferior to a 14-day course with respect to short-term cure rates with no differences in long-term outcomes. Special Considerations UROLOGIC ABNORMALITIES AND/OR OBSTRUCTION Urgent decompression is recommended in patients with acute pyelonephritis and urinary tract obstruction identified on imaging. 8, 9 Patients with structural urologic abnormalities or obstruction may benefit from longer antibiotic courses.

23 To expedite clinical improvement, indwelling catheters that have been in place for two weeks or longer should be removed or replaced.
31. 32, 34 Because of the increased risk of serious complications, pregnant patients with pyelonephritis should be admitted to the hospital for initial parenteral antibiotic therapy and monitoring. 33, 35 Treatment options for pyelonephritis in pregnancy are limited because of a lack of evidence regarding antibiotic safety in utero. A Cochrane review of 10 trials found cefazolin or ceftriaxone to be effective. 32 Pyelonephritis recurs in 6% to 8% of pregnant patients, and some experts have advocated for antibiotic suppression therapy with nitrofurantoin or cephalexin to reduce the risk of recurrence. However, data are insufficient to support this practice.
36. MEN Data are lacking on the appropriate treatment length and regimen for men with acute pyelonephritis.

30 In the male subgroup of one randomized controlled trial, a seven-day course of ciprofloxacin was inferior to a 14-day course with respect to short-term cure rates, with no differences in long-term outcomes.

### Effect of cefepime / enmetazobactam vs piperacillin… [^113PqbjS]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Among patients with complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis due to gram-negative pathogens, cefepime/enmetazobactam, compared with piperacillin/tazobactam, met criteria for noninferiority as well as superiority with respect to the primary efficacy outcome of clinical cure and microbiological eradication. Among patients with complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis caused by gram-negative pathogens, cefepime/enmetazobactam, compared with piperacillin/tazobactam, met criteria for noninferiority as well as superiority with respect to the primary outcome of clinical cure and microbiological eradication. Further research is needed to determine the potential role for cefepime/enmetazobactam in the treatment of complicated UTI and pyelonephritis.

Pyelonephritis, in Adults) was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, clinical trial designed to evaluate whether cefepime/enmetazobactam was noninferior to piperacillin/tazobactam for treatment efficacy over 7 to 14 days in adult patients with complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis. Patients were randomized by computer-generated random number using a centralized Interactive Response Technology system. Patients were randomized in a balanced 1: 1 ratio into 1 of the 2 treatment groups, stratified by type of infection had acute pyelonephritis, 148 had a complicated UTI with a removable infection source, and 181 had a complicated UTI without a removable source of infection.

In adults with complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis, cefepime/enmetazobactam was noninferior to piperacillin/tazobactam for the primary outcome of clinical and microbiological cure. Additionally, cefepime/enmetazobactam was superior to piperacillin/tazobactam for the primary outcome. These findings suggest that cefepime/enmetazobactam may be an appropriate empirical therapy for suspected gram-negative complicated UTI.

### Antimicrobial therapy and acute pyelonephritis… [^1117M8Ea]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Talan and colleagues compared the effectiveness of a seven-day course of ciprofloxacin with a traditional 14-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of uncomplicated pyelonephritis in otherwise healthy women. All patients received one capsule twice daily for 14 days: ciprofloxacin-treated patients received placebo twice daily for the last seven days. Follow-up urine cultures were obtained at days 3 to 5 during therapy, and days 4 to 11 and 22 to 48 post-therapy. The main outcomes were bacteriologic and clinical cure who received ciprofloxacin and 80 of 108 patients who received TMP/SMX. Among women who received ciprofloxacin, bacteriologic cure rates were similar regardless of whether the initial dose was given intravenously.

In women who received TMP/SMX, an initial intravenous dose of ceftriaxone was associated with a greater bacterial cure rate at days 4 through 11, but not days 22 through 48 post-therapy, compared with that seen in women who received only oral TMP/SMX. Clinical cure rates in the ciprofloxacin group and the TMP/SMX group were similarly skewed in favor of ciprofloxacin. Initial intravenous antimicrobial therapy did not significantly change these results. One quarter of the women in the ciprofloxacin group had adverse effects, compared with 33 percent of those in the TMP/SMX group. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. The authors conclude that women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis can be successfully and safely treated in the outpatient setting and that a seven-day course of ciprofloxacin was statistically superior to a 14-day course of TMP/SMX.

Although ciprofloxacin is more expensive, women in the ciprofloxacin group had fewer side effects and the drug was given for a shorter period, leading to potentially improved compliance. Outpatient treatment is not recommended in women with severe sepsis or complicated pyelonephritis, or in men.
