## Question

ddx for unilateral arm swelling

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a differential diagnosis for unilateral arm swelling. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how the history and physical examination narrow the etiologies. Then, I should verify which life-threatening or high-morbidity vascular causes must be excluded first. Next, I will review lymphatic, infectious, traumatic, neoplastic, and iatrogenic considerations. After that, I need to check imaging pathways and laboratory work that are appropriate. Finally, I will consider red flags, pitfalls, and when to escalate care or involve subspecialists [^112zZJxU] [^116Zo6sj].

> Let me first confirm the essential features from history and examination that guide the differential. I need to ask about onset (sudden versus gradual), pain, erythema, warmth, fever, recent central venous catheter or pacemaker, dialysis access, breast/axillary surgery or radiation, cancer, trauma, repetitive overhead activity, and neurologic symptoms such as paresthesias; on exam I should distinguish pitting versus non-pitting edema, look for skin thickening or peau d'orange, a palpable venous cord, lymphadenopathy, and positional exacerbation, because these clues partition the problem into venous thrombosis/obstruction, lymphatic failure, infection, or compressive syndromes [^111BAQEj] [^112zZJxU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — first I must exclude upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis (UEDVT) and catheter-related thrombosis, which classically present with acute painful swelling, erythema, and sometimes a palpable cord, especially with a central line, pacemaker leads, or malignancy; duplex venous ultrasound is first-line, but if nondiagnostic and suspicion remains, contrast venography, MR venography, or CT venography of the central veins may be needed [^116Zo6sj] [^111GjXtv].

> I will now examine for central venous stenosis or obstruction, particularly in patients with ipsilateral arteriovenous fistula/graft or a history of transvenous cardiac devices; arm swelling can be accompanied by venous hypertension symptoms or even pulsatile tinnitus, and fistulography or CT venography confirms the lesion and guides endovascular therapy or, if needed, access ligation [^114Kuv5n].

> Wait, let me verify whether venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS) is in play, because subclavian vein compression without frank thrombosis can cause unilateral swelling that is positional and may include paresthesias; dynamic venography is diagnostic, and first-rib resection with venolysis is often curative when conservative measures fail [^115xYEV5] [^113qFQio].

> Next, I should review lymphatic etiologies. Non-pitting edema with skin thickening, a positive Stemmer sign, or peau d'orange suggests primary or secondary lymphedema; secondary lymphedema often follows breast or axillary surgery and radiation, and quantification of limb swelling plus confirmatory imaging such as lymphoscintigraphy can refine diagnosis and staging, with persistent arm symptoms well documented after even limited axillary surgery like sentinel lymph node biopsy [^111BAQEj] [^1139YZC6] [^112kRSof] [^115JmZJF].

> Hmm, wait a minute — I initially thought lymphedema is usually bilateral; but wait, I should double-check — primary lymphedema and secondary cancer-related lymphedema can absolutely be unilateral, and malignancy can rarely present first with unilateral arm edema due to occult breast cancer or nodal disease compressing lymphatic or venous channels, so I need to maintain a high index of suspicion and examine the breast and axilla carefully when the diagnosis is unclear [^112iSP7n] [^111zuGgv] [^111BAQEj].

> I need to ensure infection is not masquerading as thrombosis. Cellulitis and deep soft tissue infection, including pyomyositis, can present with painful swelling, warmth, and fever; in immunocompromised patients or those with systemic autoimmune disease, pyomyositis may mimic UEDVT, and CT or MRI plus culture helps differentiate, with early antibiotics and surgical drainage as indicated [^113snZjN] [^111QG118] [^116Zo6sj].

> Let me consider traumatic and musculoskeletal contributors. Although clavicle fractures most often cause local pain and deformity, I should confirm there is no associated hematoma or malunion compressing the subclavian vein that could secondarily impair venous return; this is less common but worth reconsidering when swelling is positional or accompanied by neurovascular symptoms after shoulder girdle injury [^114MziZv] [^115xYEV5].

> Next, I should review neoplastic and compressive lymphadenopathy. Axillary or central venous compression from lymphoma or metastatic disease can produce unilateral arm swelling; rare pediatric or young adult malignancies such as anaplastic large cell lymphoma may present with acute upper-extremity edema, and Hodgkin lymphoma can also involve axillary nodes, so targeted imaging and tissue diagnosis may be required when clinical suspicion persists [^112FTtEb] [^1138n77B] [^111zuGgv].

> I should confirm iatrogenic and postoperative causes. Central venous catheters and pacing leads are major risk factors for UEDVT and central venous stenosis, and breast cancer treatments including axillary surgery and radiation are leading causes of secondary unilateral arm lymphedema with persistent swelling and mobility impact on long-term patient-reported outcomes [^111GjXtv] [^1139YZC6] [^111BAQEj].

> Let me think about an orderly diagnostic pathway. For acute unilateral arm swelling with suspected venous etiology, duplex ultrasound is first-line; if results are equivocal but suspicion remains, escalate to contrast venography or MR/CT venography to visualize the central veins and dynamic compression at the thoracic outlet; when lymphedema is suspected based on history and exam, quantify limb volume and consider lymphoscintigraphy or near-infrared lymphatic imaging to confirm lymphatic dysfunction; in broader edema evaluations, limited laboratory screening for systemic contributors can be obtained, though isolated unilateral arm swelling is far more likely local rather than systemic in origin [^116Zo6sj] [^111BAQEj] [^112kRSof] [^113cEMx8].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags and immediate actions. Signs of extensive thrombosis or embolism such as sudden dyspnea, chest pain, or neurologic deficits necessitate urgent evaluation; progressive severe pain with systemic toxicity suggests a deep infection requiring prompt imaging and source control; and any rapidly worsening swelling in the setting of dialysis access or central lines warrants expedited vascular assessment and possible anticoagulation or endovascular intervention [^113adJsi] [^116Zo6sj] [^114Kuv5n].

> Let me reconsider the practical synthesis. The highest-yield sequence is: use history and examination to triage to venous versus lymphatic versus infectious categories; rule out UEDVT or central obstruction early with duplex and, if needed, central venous imaging; if negative and the pattern is chronic, non-pitting with skin changes or post-cancer therapy, pivot to lymphedema work-up and management; interleave infection work-up when erythema, warmth, tenderness, or fever coexists; and keep compressive neoplasm and vTOS in mind when symptoms are positional or refractory to standard pathways, engaging vascular surgery, oncology, or infectious disease as indicated [^112zZJxU] [^116Zo6sj] [^111BAQEj] [^115xYEV5].

Unilateral arm swelling has a broad differential, but the most common and urgent causes are **DVT/venous obstruction** [^116Zo6sj] and **lymphedema** [^111BAQEj]. Other important etiologies include **infection**, **trauma**, **malignancy**, vascular anomalies, and systemic or medication-related causes [^112zZJxU]. A focused history and exam, with **targeted imaging** (ultrasound [^116Zo6sj], CT/MRI [^116Zo6sj], lymphoscintigraphy [^112kRSof]), are essential to determine the cause and guide management [^111BAQEj].

| **Category** | **Etiologies** |
|-|-|
| Venous | - DVT (axillary/subclavian) [^116Zo6sj] <br/> - Catheter-related thrombosis [^111GjXtv] <br/> - Central venous stenosis/obstruction [^114Kuv5n] <br/> - Venous thoracic outlet syndrome [^113qFQio] [^115xYEV5] |
| Lymphatic | - Primary lymphedema [^113Z1ckS] [^111uWZog] <br/> - Secondary lymphedema (post-surgical, radiation, malignancy) [^111BAQEj] [^1139YZC6] <br/> - Lymphatic malformations [^115PzCyY] |
| Infectious | - Cellulitis <br/> - Lymphangitis <br/> - Abscess <br/> - Pyomyositis [^113snZjN] |
| Traumatic | - Fractures (clavicle, humerus) [^114MziZv] <br/> - Soft tissue injury <br/> - Compartment syndrome |
| Malignancy | - Breast cancer [^112iSP7n] <br/> - Lymphoma [^1138n77B] <br/> - Metastatic disease |
| Vascular anomalies | - AV fistula [^114Kuv5n] <br/> - Venous malformations [^113oXciA] <br/> - Hemangioma |
| Systemic/medication | - Angioedema [^113n32sz] [^114jqV6K] <br/> - Drug-induced edema (NSAIDs, calcium channel blockers) [^111nJDny] [^113HNBS2] |

---

Initial evaluation should include a focused history and physical, with **duplex ultrasound** [^116Zo6sj]; further imaging (CT/MRI [^116Zo6sj], lymphoscintigraphy [^112kRSof]) is guided by clinical suspicion [^111BAQEj].

Congenital onset lymphoedema

In this category, congenital onset is defined as lymphoedema that is present at birth or develops within the first year of life. Bilateral lower limb swelling is the most frequent presentation (figure 2D), but the swelling may be unilateral and/or involve the arms, genitalia, and/or face, depending on the underlying cause. There are a number of different genetic disorders presenting with congenital lymphoedema (table 1). Milroy disease (ORPHA79452; OMIM 153100) is the most common form, occurring as a result of pathogenic variants in FLT4/VEGFR3. The mutation may occur de novo, so a family history is not essential for this diagnosis. The lymphoedema is always confined to the lower limbs but may be unilateral, and may (rarely) involve the genitalia. Approximately 10% of mutation carriers do not have lymphoedema. Fetuses with Milroy disease may present antenatally with pedal oedema in the third trimester and, in a few cases, with bilateral hydrothoraces that resolve before birth.

Pathogenic variants in VEGFC, the ligand for VEGFR3, have also been identified in association with congenital primary lymphoedema of Gordon (OMIM 615907), also affecting the lower limbs.

The congenital category represents 21% (n = 47) of the patients seen in 2016 (figure 2, pie chart) compared with 24% in 2010. A pathogenic variant was identified in 19 of the 47 (40%) patients genetically tested in this category. The majority (n = 18) had pathogenic variants identified in FLT4/VEGFR3 and, in one patient, a pathogenic variant in the GJC2 gene.

### Pulsatile tinnitus as a presenting symptom of central venous stenosis secondary to an ipsilateral upper arm arteriovenous PTFE graft [^114Kuv5n]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 51-year-old man presented with a swollen left arm and unilateral pulsatile tinnitus two weeks following a left upper arm polytetrafluoroethylene graft was created for haemodialysis access. A fistulogram of the left upper arm showed a central venous stenosis and significant retrograde flow up the left internal jugular vein. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was attempted unsuccessfully, and fistula ligation was subsequently performed, leading to the immediate resolution of the tinnitus. The venous stenosis was likely secondary to a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator, which had been removed one year previously. Central venous stenosis is a common but often asymptomatic complication of a cardiac device, except in patients with upper extremity arteriovenous fistulas, who frequently develop symptomatic venous hypertension. This generally presents with ipsilateral arm swelling and/or high venous pressures during dialysis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of pulsatile tinnitus arising in this context.

### Breast cancer presenting as unilateral arm edema [^112iSP7n]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Symptomatic arm lymphedema as the presenting symptom of invasive breast carcinoma is a rare occurrence. We report a case of invasive breast cancer presenting with unilateral arm swelling. The patient was initially thought to have venous thrombosis. A thorough physical examination and a mammogram revealed the presence of breast cancer and associated subclinical axillary lymphadenopathy. Failure to recognize this presentation can lead to misdiagnosis or a significant delay in diagnosis and treatment.

Clavicle fractures can be associated with a variety of symptoms and factors, including arm numbness, shoulder pain, sports participation, shoulder swelling, motor vehicle accidents, and a positive belly press test. The condition may also result in decreased shoulder active range of motion, chest pain, pneumothorax, shoulder deformity, crepitus in the shoulder, osteoporosis, and chest wall ecchymosis. Additional associations include falls, arm pain, decreased shoulder passive range of motion, arm weakness, traumatic injury, bone cancer, and the external rotation lag sign.

### Severe thoracic pyomyositis in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus [^113snZjN]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Pyomyositis may mimic deep vein thrombosis and be misdiagnosed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We report here on a patient with SLE who presented with severe thoracic pyomyositis, right upper arm swelling, and fever. The patient fully recovered following a series of surgical debridements and antibiotic therapy.

Pyomyositis, as well as deep vein thrombosis, should be considered during the differential diagnosis of patients with SLE experiencing fever and unilateral limb oedema. CT and identification of causal pathogens are crucial in the diagnosis of pyomyositis. Early effective antibiotic treatment, along with surgical intervention, can lead to better outcomes.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected upper extremity deep vein thrombosis [^116Zo6sj]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Upper-extremity venous thrombosis frequently manifests as unilateral arm swelling. The differential diagnosis includes lesions compressing the veins and leading to functional venous obstruction, venous stenosis, infection causing edema, obstruction of previously functioning lymphatics, or insufficient lymphatic channels to ensure effective drainage. Recommendations are made with the understanding that venous disease, specifically venous thrombosis, is the primary diagnosis to be excluded or confirmed in patients presenting with unilateral upper-extremity swelling.

Contrast venography remains the best reference-standard diagnostic test for suspected upper-extremity acute venous thrombosis and may be needed when other noninvasive strategies fail to image the upper-extremity veins adequately. Duplex, color flow, and compression ultrasound have established a clear role in the evaluation of more peripheral veins accessible to sonography. Gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRI is routinely used to evaluate the status of the central veins. Delayed CT venography can often confirm or exclude more central venous thrombi, although substantial contrast loads are required.

The ACR Appropriateness Criteria® are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions reviewed every two years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology.

### Venous thoracic outlet syndrome as a cause of intractable migraines [^113qFQio]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) refers to the compression of the neurovascular bundle within the thoracic outlet. Cases are classified by primary etiology: arterial, neurogenic, or venous. In addition to the typical symptoms of arm swelling and paresthesias, headaches have been reported as a potential symptom of TOS. In this report, we describe a patient with debilitating migraines, which were consistently preceded by unilateral arm swelling. Resolution of symptoms occurred only after thoracic outlet decompression. Patients with migraines and concomitant swelling and/or paresthesias, especially related to provocative arm maneuvers, should be considered a possible atypical presentation of TOS and evaluated in more detail.

### Axillary swelling and a reduced general condition in a middle-aged man [^1138n77B]. Nature Clinical Practice Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

A 48-year-old man presented to his GP with an indolent swelling in his left axillary region. He also complained of a cough, a feeling of pressure in his chest, general poor health, and had increasingly suffered from nighttime sweating and fever. Physical examination and an ultrasound revealed an enlarged lymph node of almost 4 cm in the left axillary region and several smaller lymph nodes of 1.5–2.0 cm in the left cervical region. Laboratory tests were unremarkable, except for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

- **Investigations**: Excisional biopsy, radiography, ultrasound, CT scan, bone marrow biopsy, radionuclide imaging, echocardiography, and lung function tests.

- **Diagnosis**: Early-stage unfavorable (intermediate) lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.

- **Management**: Chemotherapy (treatment with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) and involved-field radiotherapy.

### Severe thoracic pyomyositis in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus [^111QG118]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Pyomyositis may mimic deep vein thrombosis and be misdiagnosed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We report here on a patient with SLE who presented with severe thoracic pyomyositis, right upper arm swelling, and fever. The patient fully recovered after undergoing serial surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy.

Pyomyositis, as well as deep vein thrombosis, should be considered during the differential diagnosis of patients with SLE experiencing fever and unilateral limb edema. CT scans and the identification of causal pathogens are crucial in the diagnosis of pyomyositis. Early and effective antibiotic treatment, along with surgical intervention, can together lead to a better outcome.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and clinical management of cavernous malformations of the brain and spinal cord: Consensus recommendations based on a systematic literature review by the Alliance to Cure Cavernous Malformation Clinical Advisory Board Experts Panel [^113pjkdd]. Neurosurgery (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for cavernous malformations, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, ACCM 2025 guidelines recommend considering the following diagnostic criteria for cavernous malformations:

- **Popcorn appearance**: A typical "popcorn" appearance of cavernous malformations (CM) with a surrounding "hemosiderin ring" on T2 MRI establishes a diagnosis of CM. The presence of an associated developmental venous anomaly or multifocal CMs further confirms the diagnosis of sporadic/solitary or multifocal/familial disease, respectively.

- **Clustered CMs**: Multiple clustered CMs in association with a single developmental venous anomaly can be considered as solitary (clustered) CM and sporadic disease.

- **Growing CM and contrast enhancement**: The presence of a growing CM and/or dense contrast enhancement raises a differential diagnosis of tumor, which can be adjudicated by histopathological biopsy on CM excision.

- **Contrast enhancement caution**: Contrast enhancement in CM lesions and capillary telangiectasias should not, by itself, imply tumor.

- **Tiny hemorrhagic lesions**: Tiny hemorrhagic lesions without any associated typical CM lesions ("popcorn" appearance with "hemosiderin ring") may be cerebral microbleeds rather than CM. These are more common in association with aging and vascular risk factors and typically without family history. Consider obtaining genetic testing to identify evidence of mutation in a CM gene to help resolve the differential diagnosis.

- **Family history and genetic testing**: A family history of multiple affected relatives raises a question of familial cavernous malformation (FCM) disease, warranting genetic testing for confirmation. Multifocal CMs without an associated developmental venous anomaly also raise the possibility of FCM, which genetic testing can confirm.

### Unilateral mydriasis after maxillary osteotomy: A case series and review of the literature [^111nHKB6]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

This study presents four cases of unilateral mydriasis associated with orthognathic surgery, along with a review of the differential diagnosis and management related to this condition.

- **Materials and methods**: Four cases of unilateral mydriasis related to orthognathic surgery were identified from the authors' institutional experience. All maxillary osteotomies performed by the authors' department from 2001 to 2013 were identified based on Procedural Terminology codes. From this, four cases of unilateral mydriasis were found. These cases are presented, and the literature is reviewed.

- **Results**: Two male and two female patients, aged 16 to 34 years, developed unilateral mydriasis following maxillary osteotomy. The estimated prevalence is 0.004%. Although determining the precise cause can be challenging, in this series one case was attributable to swelling affecting contents of the superior orbital fissure, one was related to edema or medications, and two were pharmacologically induced.

- **Conclusion**: Though rare, reviewing the differential diagnosis and management of unilateral mydriasis associated with orthognathic surgery is pertinent for those performing corrective jaw surgery.

### Risk factors and prediction model for persistent breast-cancer-related lymphedema: A 5-year cohort study [^113Uj1N1]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Low credibility.

This study involved 342 patients with breast cancer with unilateral arm swelling and a mean age of 52.31 ± 11.25 years. Among them, 229 (67%) were patients with persistent lymphedema (PLE).

- **Demographics and disease characteristics**: The comparison of demographics and disease, treatment, and swelling characteristics between PLE and transient lymphedema (TLE) are presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively. As shown, the average age at surgery or onset of swelling was significantly higher for patients with PLE than those with TLE (p = 0.017 and p = 0.011, respectively). The risk of PLE for patients with breast cancer, after the onset of swelling, significantly increased with respect to the severity of the AJCC (American Joint Commission on Cancer) cancer stage (p = 0.001). A similar phenomenon was observed for the AJCC node stage (p = 0.004) but not the AJCC tumor stage (p = 0.169).

- **Treatment characteristics**: Patients treated with modified radical mastectomy (MRM) had the highest risk of PLE among the four types of surgery. The average number of lymph node metastases was significantly higher for patients with PLE than for those with TLE (p < 0.001). The risks of PLE were significantly associated with radiotherapy (RT; p = 0.004) and RT to regional lymph nodes (supraclavicular RT, internal mammary RT, and axillary RT; p = 0.002, p < 0.001, and p = 0.002, respectively).

- **Swelling characteristics**: Among the various swelling characteristics, significant differences existed between the two types of lymphedema in the following variables: weight changes from presurgery to onset of swelling (p = 0.012), the maximal circumference difference of both arms (p < 0.001), and the initial severity of lymphedema (p < 0.001).

### Down in the mumps [^113hesg7]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

A 10-week-old female infant presented with a right-sided facial swelling without any constitutional symptoms. The swelling was nontender, nonfluctuant, with no erythema or induration. Based on the clinical picture, magnetic resonance imaging findings, and serology, a diagnosis of unilateral mumps parotitis was made. The United Kingdom is currently experiencing a mumps epidemic with a 28-fold rise in the number of cases over the last 10 years. Infants are being increasingly affected. Mumps parotitis, which was previously unreported in infants, needs to be considered as part of the differential diagnosis when a small child presents with swelling of the parotid gland.

### Metastatic Crohn's disease in a boy presenting with genital swelling [^116Xbhgg]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Cutaneous manifestations of Crohn's disease are uncommon and can occasionally affect the genitals with varying symptomatology. When cutaneous features precede or occur in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, this condition may remain undiagnosed. We report the case of a 14-year-old boy who presented for evaluation of persistent penile edema with clinicopathological features consistent with a diagnosis of genital metastatic Crohn's disease, successfully treated with infliximab.

### A 12-year-old boy presenting with unilateral proximal interphalangeal joint swelling [^1174Zvgv]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Pachydermodactyly is a rare and benign superficial dermal fibromatosis characterized by asymptomatic soft tissue hypertrophy of the lateral and dorsal aspects of the proximal interphalangeal joints. The majority affected are males, with only a few reported female cases, and it usually begins to develop around the age of puberty. Pachydermodactyly affects the second, middle, and ring fingers of the hand symmetrically and bilaterally. Most reported cases demonstrate bilateral involvement of joints; only a small proportion report unilateral involvement. In this case report, the authors review the literature and discuss a case of pachydermodactyly presenting as unilateral swelling of the proximal interphalangeal joints of only the left hand in a right-handed young male.

### Bilateral lower limbs swelling as uncommon manifestation of primary congenital lymphoedema: Navigating diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in resource-limited Ende, Indonesia [^115JmZJF]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

The clinical symptom that appears in patients with primary lymphoedema is swelling in one or more limbs. The skin is tighter on palpation. In some cases, this swelling can be accompanied by pitting oedema, while in others, it is not. On the back of the foot, a 'buffalo hump' caused by swelling can appear, known as a positive Stemmer sign, which aligns with the clinical symptoms found in this patient. Cutaneous involvement may occur in primary lymphoedema, such as hyperpigmentation, hyperkeratosis, lymphorrhoea, and papillomatous/verrucous lesions. This condition is most common in children with an earlier onset.

A perometer and a tape measure can be used to measure the volume of the limbs. Although tape measurements are the least accurate way to determine extremity volume, they can be particularly difficult for paediatrics because their limbs are still growing. Perometers, despite their high cost, are fast and accurate tools. The technique involves a square frame with several perpendicular light beams. By moving the frame along the limb, it continually estimates the cross-sectional area and hence the volume.

In this case, we found severe bilateral swelling on both dorsums of the feet. There was bilateral swelling starting from the dorsum of the feet and extending to the lower leg area below the knee with a positive Stemmer sign. The patient had no pitting oedema or cutaneous involvement. We did not perform a perometer measurement in our hospital due to the limited resources available in Ende.

### An 11-year-old male with periorbital edema and painful subcutaneous nodules [^111y3jbG]. Pediatric dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

An 11-year-old previously healthy male presented with painful skin lesions on the lower legs. In the six weeks leading up to presentation, he experienced profound lethargy, polyarthritis of large joints of the extremities, cyclic low-grade fever, approximately 7 kg weight loss, and bilateral periocular edema. He had traveled to Liberia for three weeks, one year prior to symptom onset. The patient was not on any medications. He was normotensive and intermittently febrile without a consistent pattern (T max = 38.5°C).

On physical examination, he had hyperpigmented reticulated plaques and painful erythematous nodules on the lower legs, ankles, and dorsal feet, with milder involvement of the hands. He was also noted to have robust bilateral periorbital edema. An extensive workup revealed elevated inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) > 130 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP) 19.5 mg/dL. He had an elevated anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titer of 592 IU/mL. The remainder of his workup was normal, including DNAse B antibody level, creatinine, urinalysis, terminal complement deficiency testing, immunologic titers, transthoracic echocardiogram, and full-body MRI. A punch biopsy from the left foot was taken.

### An unusual presentation of mastocytosis: Unilateral swelling of the vulva [^117GEpVU]. Pediatric Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Mastocytosis is a primary, abnormal accumulation of mast cells associated with a broad range of local and systemic symptoms. We report two female adolescents with episodic unilateral swelling of the labia majora that was discovered to be an unusual presentation of mastocytosis. This condition is frequently misdiagnosed due to its rarity and variable clinical presentation, which often mimics other conditions. In the appropriate clinical setting, mastocytosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of labium majus swelling.

### Peripheral edema: Evaluation and management in primary care [^113cEMx8]. American Family Physician (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for lymphedema, more specifically with respect to the evaluation of limb swelling, the AAFP 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining BNP, TSH, LFTs, a basic metabolic panel, and a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio in the initial laboratory evaluation of patients with lower extremity edema.

### Prenatal ultrasound in the diagnosis of anorectal malformations: Correlating prenatal signs with postnatal outcomes [^111dB2GK]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Low credibility.

This exploratory retrospective cohort study provides valuable insights into the potential role of prenatal ultrasound markers in detecting anorectal malformations (ARMs). While caution is necessary when interpreting the results due to the selective nature of our study population, the findings suggest a role for transectional sonography (TS) assessment in the prenatal diagnosis of ARMs, particularly in distinguishing between simple and complex types. Furthermore, the study identified indirect prenatal findings commonly seen in patients with ARMs, which, if present, warrant comprehensive fetal screening with ARMs included in the differential diagnosis. Further prospective studies in the general low-risk population are required to validate our results and ultimately improve prenatal screening protocols, enhancing the early detection of ARMs.

### Flector [^113HNBS2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

Different types of arthritis, menstrual cramps, and other types of short-term pain can sometimes require treatment with Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs). However, not everyone should take NSAID medicines.

Do not take an NSAID medicine if you have had an asthma attack, hives, or other allergic reaction with aspirin or any other NSAID medicine, or for pain right before or after heart bypass surgery.

- **Tell your healthcare provider**: About all of your medical conditions and the medicines you take. NSAIDs and some other medicines can interact with each other and cause serious side effects. Keep a list of your medicines to show to your healthcare provider and pharmacist. If you are pregnant, NSAID medicines should not be used past 30 weeks of pregnancy. If you are breastfeeding, talk to your doctor.

- **What are the possible side effects of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)?** Get emergency help right away if you have any of the following symptoms: shortness of breath or trouble breathing, chest pain, weakness in one part or side of your body, slurred speech, or swelling of the face or throat.

Stop your NSAID medicine and call your healthcare provider right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: nausea, more tired or weaker than usual, itching, your skin or eyes look yellow, stomach pain, flu-like symptoms, vomit blood, blood in your bowel movement or it is black and sticky like tar, unusual weight gain, skin rash or blisters with fever, or swelling of the arms and legs, hands and feet.

### An atypical case of Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome presenting with crossed-bilateral limb hypertrophy and postaxial polydactyly: a case report [^115Tn1Co]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

This patient had multiple cystic masses, which were all lymphatic malformations. Lymphatic malformation presents as localized or generalized overgrowth caused by micro- and macrocystic anomalies, sometimes in association with lymphedema. Often, there is lymphatic swelling and fatty deposition on the contralateral foot. The lymphatic anomalies can also occur in the pelvis, bladder, and lower gastrointestinal tract. Lymphatic cysts in the spleen are also common. Lymphatic malformation is documented by ultrasonography and/or MRI. Lymphography shows that lymphedema is the result of a diminished number or absence of lymphatic channels.

Our patient had port wine stains on the trunk, back, and extremities, and cross-bilateral hypertrophy of the right lower limb and left upper limb, which is unusual since limb involvement is most often unilateral (85%), sometimes bilateral (12.5%), and only rarely crossed-bilateral (2.5%). Varicose veins were not present on physical examination or imaging. Further, this patient had post-axial polydactyly of the left hand, which has only previously been described in four KTS cases, none with cross-bilateral limb involvement. Other limb anomalies, including macrodactyly, syndactyly, clinodactyly, camptodactyly, ectrodactyly, and congenital hip dislocation, have been reported in association with KTS. However, this case represents the first KTS case with both cross-bilateral limb involvement and polydactyly. The patient had a history of polydactyly in a maternal grandfather. Polydactyly can be inherited as well as forming part of the KTS syndrome.

### Bupropion hydrochloride [^115unUpV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Bupropion hydrochloride tablets can cause seizures. The risk of seizure is dose-related. The dose should not exceed 450 mg per day, and it is critical to increase the dose gradually. Discontinue bupropion hydrochloride tablets and do not restart treatment if the patient experiences a seizure.

The risk of seizures is also related to patient factors, clinical situations, and concomitant medications that lower the seizure threshold. Consider these risks before initiating treatment with bupropion hydrochloride tablets. Bupropion hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with seizure disorders, or a prior diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia, or those undergoing abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and antiepileptic drugs [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.3)].

- **Conditions that can increase the risk of seizure**: Severe head injury, arteriovenous malformation, CNS tumor or CNS infection, severe stroke, and concomitant use of other medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g. other bupropion products, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, and systemic corticosteroids). Metabolic disorders (e.g. hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, severe hepatic impairment, and hypoxia) and the use of illicit drugs (e.g. cocaine) can also increase seizure risk.

Additional predisposing conditions include diabetes mellitus treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin, use of anorectic drugs, and excessive use of alcohol, benzodiazepines, sedative/hypnotics, or opiates.

### Subclavian vein obstruction without thrombosis [^115xYEV5]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Unilateral arm swelling caused by subclavian vein obstruction without thrombosis is an uncommon form of venous thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). In a study of 87 patients with venous TOS, only 21 patients had no thrombosis. This paper describes the diagnosis and treatment of these patients.

- **Material and methods**: Twenty-one patients with arm swelling, cyanosis, and venograms demonstrating partial subclavian vein obstruction were treated with transaxillary first rib resection and venolysis.

- **Results**: Eighteen (86%) of 21 patients had good-to-excellent improvement of symptoms, although there were two failures (9%).

- **Conclusions**: Unilateral arm swelling without thrombosis, when not caused by lymphatic obstruction, may be due to subclavian vein compression at the costoclavicular ligament. This compression can be due either to the ligament itself or the subclavius tendon, most often because of a congenital close proximity of the vein to the ligament. Arm symptoms such as neurogenic TOS, pain, and paresthesia often accompany venous TOS, while neck pain and headache, which are other common symptoms of neurogenic TOS, are infrequent. Diagnosis was made by dynamic venography. First rib resection, involving the anterior portion of the rib and cartilage plus division of the costoclavicular ligament and subclavius tendon, proved to be an effective treatment.

We report a case of a 44-year-old female patient who presented to us after years of intermittent episodes of unilateral left neck swelling. An MR lymphangiogram demonstrated a lymphatic varix at the confluence of the left upper extremity lymphatic ducts, confirmed by intranodal axillary lymphangiography. After successful catheterization of the feeding lymphatic vessels, the varix was successfully embolized with detachable microcoils and an autologous blood patch. The patient has been free from symptoms on subsequent outpatient follow-up.

### Prenatal ultrasound in the diagnosis of anorectal malformations: Correlating prenatal signs with postnatal outcomes [^111oHhBK]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Low credibility.

- **What is already known about this topic**: The reported prenatal detection rate for anorectal malformations (ARMs) ranges from 0% to 16%. Diagnosing ARMs prenatally would allow for prenatal counseling and contribute to optimal perinatal care.

- **What does this study add**: The assessment of the target sign may aid in the prenatal differentiation between simple and complex ARMs. In patients with ARM, abnormal findings can be seen on prenatal ultrasound, which requires thorough fetal screening with ARM included in the differential diagnosis.

### Congenital muscular torticollis [^112VTr7F]. Annals of Maxillofacial Surgery (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on congenital muscular torticollis. Congenital muscular torticollis is a benign congenital musculoskeletal disorder characterized by unilateral shortening of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, leading to ipsilateral head tilt and contralateral rotation of the face and chin.

- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of congenital muscular torticollis is unknown. Several theories have been proposed, including intrauterine crowding, muscle trauma during a difficult delivery, soft tissue compression leading to compartment syndrome, and congenital abnormalities of soft tissue differentiation within the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of congenital muscular torticollis ranges from 0.3% to 2%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include breech presentation, prolonged labor, and difficult birth. Associated conditions may include developmental dysplasia of the hip and plagiocephaly.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include ipsilateral head tilt, contralateral rotation of the face and chin, plagiocephaly, palpable pseudotumor, and tightness of the muscle. Untreated congenital muscular torticollis in infancy may lead to craniofacial growth deformity in adults.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Congenital muscular torticollis is not associated with increased mortality.

### Soft-tissue considerations in shoulder surgery in the patient with lymphedema [^1142NLop]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a chronic, progressive, and often debilitating condition that results in swelling of the affected tissue. Secondary lymphedema is most commonly recognized by unilateral swelling of the ipsilateral extremity after the treatment of cancer. It is estimated that nearly 1.45 million women suffer from breast cancer-related lymphedema in the United States. The number of patients suffering from upper extremity lymphedema is expected to increase because multimodal treatment of breast cancer increases the long-term survival after diagnosis.

As this population ages, the likelihood of encountering a patient with concurrent lymphedema and shoulder pathology requiring orthopaedic intervention is likely to rise. A patient with an already edematous arm and/or impaired drainage of that arm is likely to have different and more complex intraoperative and postoperative courses than patients with normal lymphatic drainage. Although a lymphedematous arm should not preclude surgical intervention, there are considerations when approaching shoulder surgery in the setting of upper extremity lymphedema that may help mitigate complications and aid the patient in their orthopaedic recovery.

### A case of unilateral extremity swelling [^115n6M6s]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 33-year-old woman presented with swelling of the left arm that had persisted for 2 years with pain. The swelling involved her forearm, hand, and fingers. There was no preceding trauma, drug use, travel, or arthralgia. She denied any relevant family history. Physical examination showed nonpitting, 2+ edema of her left forearm (Figs 1 and 2). There was tenderness but no synovitis, erythema, or other rash. Limb length was symmetric with full range of motion, and there was no lymphadenopathy of her axilla. Her other extremities and breast examination results were normal. Mammography, Doppler ultrasonography, and electromyography results were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast coronal sections showed soft-tissue and superficial fascial edema of the left forearm and wrist (Fig 3).

### Unilateral lower extremity swelling as a rare presentation of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [^111zuGgv]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Lower extremity oedema is frequently encountered in clinical practice. The challenge is to correctly identify the aetiology of oedema and hence correctly manage the cause. Oedema can be classified as venous oedema and lymphoedema. Lymphoedema of the lower extremities is usually bilateral. Unilateral leg lymphoedema may occur secondary to radiation, surgery, compression by a tumour, or early filariasis infection.

Unilateral lower extremity lymphoedema has been reported as a rare initial presentation for lymphoma, mostly in women, usually without B-symptoms, and often with inguinal lymphadenopathies or abdominal masses. In this paper, we report a rare case of unilateral lower extremity oedema in a healthy male presenting to the outpatient clinic following trauma; further work-up revealed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with bulky inguinal lymphadenopathy compressing the iliac veins.

### A rare mutation causing autosomal dominant STAT1 deficiency in a South African multiplex kindred with disseminated BCG infection [^117CDhQL]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Five years after the proband presented, his well-grown, HIV-uninfected, 10-month-old maternal half-brother presented with intermittent swelling and decreased range of motion in the right middle finger and the right knee. He received the BCG vaccine at birth and developed ulceration at the BCG vaccination site with surrounding papule formation and swollen right axillary lymph nodes. At the time, the local clinic prescribed a course of antibiotics.

At presentation, he had a healing scar at the BCG vaccination site, a small single firm lymph node with soft tissue swelling in the right axilla, uniform soft tissue swelling of the right middle finger, and normal lower limbs. Radiology showed expansion of the proximal third phalanx with multiple ill-defined lucencies, and expansion of the second left anterior rib with ill-defined lucencies consistent with multifocal osteomyelitis. Right axillary soft tissue swelling consistent with adenopathy was demonstrated. Lung fields were clear, and there was no mediastinal adenopathy.

- **Radiological images of the proband's half-brother**:
	- a. AP radiograph of the right hand demonstrates expansion of the proximal third phalanx with multiple ill-defined lucencies consistent with osteomyelitis. There is associated soft tissue swelling.
	- b. AP chest radiograph demonstrates right axillary soft tissue swelling consistent with adenopathy. There is expansion of the second left anterior rib with ill-defined lucencies consistent with osteomyelitis. A lateral x-ray confirmed the absence of mediastinal adenopathy.

### Acute upper extremity edema in a 10-year-old girl as presenting symptom of a rare cancer [^112FTtEb]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Low credibility.

Acute onset upper extremity edema presents a diagnostic challenge for emergency physicians, with potential causes ranging from mild local allergic reactions to deep venous thrombosis and other life-threatening conditions. We discuss a case involving a 10-year-old female with upper extremity edema, highlighting the diagnostic considerations that ultimately revealed a malignant etiology. This case is a rare presentation of her underlying diagnosis, anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

### Risk factors and prediction model for persistent breast-cancer-related lymphedema: a 5-year cohort study [^1147QsQy]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Low credibility.

All patients with breast-cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) recruited in this study were diagnosed, treated, and followed up at Koo Foundation Sun Yat-Sen Cancer Center, Taiwan. The follow-up protocols were developed by the breast cancer treatment team. All patients with breast cancer visited the oncologist every three months in the first two years after surgery, every six months in the third to fifth years, and once per year thereafter.

Patients were routinely asked by a case manager whether they noticed arm swelling, indentations, heaviness, or firm skin. They were also examined by an oncologist for arm swelling and skin texture during each follow-up. In the follow-up clinic, patients with either subjective or objective arm swelling were referred to a physiatrist experienced in lymphedema diagnosis and management. Patients could also visit the physiatrist directly at any time during the follow-up period if they noticed arm swelling.

The initial screening of the database between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2015, identified 488 patients with BCRL.

- **Inclusion criteria**:
	- Patients who exhibited circumferential difference (CD) in both arms of > 1 cm as measured by the physiatrist, or CD in both arms of < 1 cm but manifesting as pitting edema or subcutaneous tissue hardening, or having symptoms of arm swelling, heaviness, or tight clothes.

Among these patients, 146 were excluded from the study.

- **Exclusion criteria**:
	- Stage IV cancer (n = 53), having chest wall or axillary local recurrence (n = 37), bilateral breast cancer (n = 34), incomplet…

### Split notochord syndrome with congenital unilateral Horner's SIGN [^111Z4shz]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

A 2-year-old boy exhibited congenital right Horner's sign and right finger, wrist, and elbow flexion arthrogryposis. He had dyspnea and feeding difficulty 12 hours after birth. Radiologic examination revealed a thoracoabdominal intestinal tube and mediastinal cystic lesion on the right side, with a vertebral anomaly at the cervical level. Histopathologically, the intestinal tube was diagnosed as bowel duplication. Because the mediastinal lesion could not be resected surgically, no histopathological diagnosis was made.

Embryologically, the combination of transdiaphragmatic duplication, mediastinal cystic lesion, anterior spina bifida, and hemivertebra suggested notochord malformation. The diagnosis was split notochord syndrome, an extremely rare embryological malformation syndrome. Congenital unilateral Horner syndrome often has an unknown etiology. In this case, cervical vertebral anomalies and the mediastinal cystic lesion implied a compressed nerve root, resulting in Horner syndrome and right finger, wrist, and elbow flexion joint contracture. Split notochord syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis of congenital unilateral Horner syndrome.

### Rationale for study of the deep subfascial lymphatic vessels during lymphoscintigraphy for the diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema [^112kRSof]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The study aimed to determine the utility of including the study of deep subfascial lymphatic vessels in a two-compartment lymphoscintigraphy for the diagnosis of lymphedema in patients with limb swelling. Lymphoscintigraphy is a valuable imaging tool for the timely diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema; however, there is a lack of standardization in its application, especially regarding which type of lymphatic vessels to examine (superficial, deep, or both).

- **Methods**: Two hundred fifty-eight patients with lymphedema underwent segmental lymphoscintigraphy. The transport index (TI) was calculated to categorize the flow of the superficial and deep vessels as normal (< 10) or pathological (≥ 10). The scores from 248 patients (48 unilateral arm, 86 unilateral leg, 114 bilateral leg) were tested with a three-way analysis of variance to examine the relationship between the affected limb, deep or superficial pathways, and primary or secondary lymphedema. The relationship between clinical presentation and TI was also investigated.

- **Results**: In general, primary and secondary lymphedema patients had similar patterns of lymphoscintigraphic lymphatic abnormalities. Patients with unilateral clinical presentation can have bilateral TI abnormalities. The vast majority of patients (88%-98%) had either the deep subfascial vessels alone or both the superficial and deep vessels with a pathological TI.

- **Conclusions**: A two-compartment lymphoscintigraphy is able to accurately detect lymphatic flow abnormalities in patients with limb swelling. Given that the vast majority of patients had deep lymphatic vessel abnormalities, inclusion of deep vessels in lymphoscintigraphy can enhance diagnostic accuracy.

### Surgical management of perineal masses in patients with anorectal malformations [^115feRDy]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to review the outcome of surgical management of various types of perineal masses encountered in patients with anorectal malformations (ARM).

- **Methods**: Retrospective review from two large pediatric anorectal referral centers.

- **Results**: Twenty-two patients with a perineal mass were identified among more than 2000 patients treated for ARM over a 15-year period. The 22 patients (4 male) represented all levels of severity of ARMs. The lesions were of three types: lipomas (n = 10), vascular anomalies (n = 4), and hamartomas/choristomas (n = 8).

	- The lipomas were carefully removed from between the muscle fibers during the posterior sagittal anorectoplasty.
	- The vascular anomalies (3 of 4 were hemangiomas) underwent magnetic resonance imaging preoperatively; however, none were found to invade deeply, and all were excised during the posterior sagittal anorectoplasty.
	- The hamartomas/choristomas all occurred in women, with 50% arising as a pedunculated mass from the vulva. These lesions contained tissues such as glia, osteoid, nephrogenic rests, and endocervical-type mucosa. One was initially misinterpreted as a teratoma, prompting a wider excision. This and all subsequent patients were correctly diagnosed pathologically as having either hamartomas or choristomas, which were not widely excised.

	- Follow-up ranged from 5 months to 12 years. Six of the 10 patients with lipomas are continent. One vascular anomaly was re-excised, and there was minor wound separation in another. None of the hamartoma/choristoma lesions recurred.

- **Conclusion**: The presence of unusual perineal masses in patients with ARMs requires careful diagnosis and surgical management.

### Monkeypox presenting as a hand consult in the emergency department: Two case reports [^115FZkuc]. Hand (2023). Low credibility.

Patient B is a 29-year-old man with a medical history of HIV for 11 years, who has had poor medication compliance for the past 6 months. He presented to the ED with a 2-week history of purulent penile discharge and a gradually worsening ulcer over the dorsum of his long finger metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ; Figure 3). Additionally, he reported a truncal rash that started 3 weeks ago. As a dishwasher, he has been repeatedly picking at the ulcer during this time. In the past week, the area surrounding the wound became swollen, erythematous, and painful, with several vesicles appearing on the dorsum of the hand. Physical examination showed swelling and erythema surrounding the long finger MCPJ, with an ulcer exhibiting hypertrophic scarring over the MCPJ dorsum and mild tenderness to palpation. There was no pain with movement, and he had normal strength and sensation throughout. The review of systems was largely negative except for his penile discharge and hand pain.

- **Diagnosis**: Hand x-ray showed some soft tissue swelling with no signs of osteomyelitis. Labs demonstrated a CD4 count of 319 and a viral load of 156,000. An excision of the lesion was performed at bedside and sent for pathology, stain, and cultures. A urethral swab was positive for gonorrhea but negative for Chlamydia trachomatis. Blood cultures were negative. After the patient developed vesicular lesions on the face and arms, swabs of vesicular fluid were sent for PCR NAAT testing, confirming a diagnosis of mpox.

### Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome - current perspectives [^115wWwvi]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKHD) includes many other causes of panuveitis and posterior scleritis. Sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) has a similar clinical and histopathological appearance to VKHD, with swollen hyperemic optic discs and serous retinal detachments (SRDs) and is included in the differential diagnosis of VKHD. However, bilateral granulomatous panuveitis in eyes with SO follows previous penetrating trauma or surgery to one eye.

Posterior scleritis may present with SRD, optic disc swelling, and choroidal or retinal folds and may be a presenting feature of VKHD. However, in cases of posterior scleritis, pain is a common feature, classically radiating to the forehead or face and waking the patient during the night. Additionally, posterior scleritis is usually unilateral, often presenting with reduced vision and ocular pain. Scleral and choroidal thickening, fluid in Tenon's capsule, and optic nerve head with the resulting "T sign" appearance are characteristic features on ultrasound (US).

Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is an idiopathic condition that commonly affects healthy middle-aged men and is characterized by the development of SRDs. Patients may present with headaches that might be mistaken for the prodromal stage of VKHD. However, in CSCR, visual acuity remains good, patients do not complain of ocular pain, and there is no evidence of granulomatous ocular inflammation or a hot optic disc on fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA). Infectious choroiditis caused by syphilis, tuberculosis, and Bartonella henselae infection should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of VKHD. Cat scratch disease caused by B. henselae can present similarly.

### Severe unilateral orbitopathy in a patient with Hashimoto's thyroiditis - a case report [^117UCSkL]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

Even though unilateral exophthalmos tends to occur more often in euthyroid and hypothyroid patients, it is still not a typical manifestation of TAO and requires a wider differential diagnosis. In such groups of patients, orbital neoplasms, such as lymphoma, benign tumors (e.g. rhabdomyomas, hamartomas), and metastases to the orbit, should be primarily excluded. Furthermore, specific orbital inflammation (e.g. due to sarcoidosis or systemic lupus erythematosus), orbital myositis, vascular malformations, infections, neuromuscular dysfunctions, orbital pseudotumor/non-specific orbital inflammation, cavernous sinus thrombosis, sphenoid meningioma, and IgG4-related ophthalmic disease also require consideration. Unfortunately, the patient's IgG4 concentration level was not measured, which constitutes a limitation of our report. However, our patient had a negative history of any rheumatoid disorders, no signs of any other organs' involvement, and the MRI picture was not typical of IgG4 disease presentation (i.e. lacrimal glands were not involved). In fact, MRI is a method of choice in a differential diagnosis of TAO due to the great potential of tissue differentiation and the capability of multiple plane imaging with no exposure to ionizing radiation.

### Unilateral parotid mass as an unusual presentation of lupus erythematosus profundus [^113dU8gp]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Unilateral parotid swelling or mass in a person with lupus erythematosus profundus is a rare or underreported clinical scenario in existing literature. This is a case of a 49-year-old man with such a presentation, for whom medical management of the underlying condition led to the resolution of the swelling. Lupus erythematosus profundus must be considered a differential diagnosis for unexplained parotid swelling to prevent incorrect diagnosis, unnecessary surgical intervention (e.g. parotidectomy), and the morbidity that comes with it (e.g. facial nerve weakness, Frey's syndrome).

### Adult woman presenting progressive enlargement of mass on the left leg [^11591ZXF]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Lymphedema**: Incorrect. Lower extremity lymphedema is caused by the excessive retention of lymphatic fluid in the interstitial compartment. The initially affected area of lower extremity lymphedema is the distal part of the leg, such as the ankle, foot, and toes. The foot of the patient is completely spared.

- **Chronic venous disease (CVD)**: Incorrect. CVD is associated with telangiectasias, varicose veins, swelling, and skin changes. Leg swelling in CVD often occurs in the ankles and calves, while the feet are usually spared, and it can be effectively improved by leg elevation.

- **Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs)**: Correct. PNs are benign nerve sheath tumors that occur commonly in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The family history of NF1 is significant in her father and aunt. The MRI result showed a well-demarcated, encapsulated, ≥ 3 cm lesion matching the imaging features of PNs. Histologically, they exhibit a typical composition of spindled cells with wavy, tapered, and comma-shaped nuclei.

- **Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS)**: Incorrect. KTS is a congenital disorder characterized by capillary, lymphatic, and venous system malformation, as well as bone and/or soft tissue hypertrophy. MRI can identify the asymmetric soft tissue hypertrophy and osteohypertrophy of the leg. Leg function impairment secondary to hypertrophy can be observed in KTS, but many patients demonstrate a reduced body area rather than increased growth. By comparison, most PNs are characterized by continuous growth and PN shrinkage mainly occurs in adults.

### Liposuction for advanced lymphedema in a multidisciplinary team setting in Australia: 5-year follow-up [^117P7ENU]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Liposuction for lymphedema is not new to Australia. In 1989, O'Brien and colleagues from Melbourne published a preliminary report of 19 patients who underwent liposuction for lymphedema. They reported "objective improvement in 10 of the 11 patients with unilateral lymphedema, with an average reduction of 23% of the excess volume". Around the same time, Sando and Nahai from the United States reported a similar experience in 15 patients with lymphedema, with average volume reductions of 8%.

In 1997, Brorson and Svensson from Sweden published their results of complete reduction of arm lymphedema after breast cancer using liposuction, with an average reduction in limb excess volume of 106% in 28 patients. Their follow-up report revealed that liposuction needed to be combined with controlled compression therapy to be effective; without compression, the lymphatic fluid will reaccumulate. Subsequent long-term follow-up reports did not show any recurrence of swelling. Liposuction does not affect the already impaired lymph transport, and quality of life was found to be improved after reduction of limb volumes with liposuction. The incidence of cellulitis was reduced by 87% in patients with arm lymphedema and by 65% in patients treated for leg lymphedema.

Other teams have been trained in this technique, and the results have been reproduced by Damstra et al. in the Netherlands, Schaverien et al. and Stewart and Munnoch in the United Kingdom, Granoff et al. and Greene and Maclellan in the United States, and Boyages et al. in Australia. In 2012, we established a multidisciplinary Australian team.

### Ultrasound examination of extensive limb swelling reactions after diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis or reduced-antigen content diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis immunization in preschool-aged children [^111VgU3x]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the site, extent, and resolution of tissue involvement when extensive limb swelling occurred in the injected limb for children who received diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis or reduced-antigen content diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine at 4 to 6 years of age.

- **Methods**: Children who had experienced an injection site reaction at 18 months of age were assigned randomly to receive an intramuscular injection of either reduced-antigen content diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine or diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine between 4 and 6 years of age. Children who developed extensive limb swelling were recruited for assessment by clinical examination. Ultrasound studies of the affected and opposite (control) arms were performed 24 to 48 hours after immunization and 48 to 96 hours later.

- **Results**: Twelve children with extensive limb swelling were enrolled in the study. Ultrasound examinations demonstrated swelling of both the subcutaneous and muscle layers of the vaccinated arm. Ultrasound assessment showed that the swelling exceeded the clinical measurements of skin redness and swelling. Subcutaneous and muscle tissues expanded to 281% and 111% of the tissue thicknesses of the control arm, respectively. Repeat ultrasound examinations after 48 to 96 hours showed considerable resolution of muscle swelling, compared with subcutaneous tissue swelling. There was no significant difference in the extent of swelling detected between children who received diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine and the reduced-antigen content vaccine.

### Alhemo [^113adJsi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling, specifically the Medication Guide and Instructions for Use.

- **Thromboembolic events**: Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events, including swelling, warmth, pain, or redness of the skin (indicating a potential blood clot in the legs or arms); shortness of breath or severe chest pain (indicating possible blood clots in the chest, heart, or lungs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Additionally, advise on signs like headache, confusion, difficulty with speech or movement, numbness of the face, eye pain or swelling, or vision problems (indicating a blood clot in the brain or eyes), and sudden pain in the stomach or lumbar area (indicating blood clots in the gut or kidneys). Patients should contact their healthcare provider for mild reactions and seek immediate medical attention for moderate to severe reactions.

- **Conditions of tissue factor overexpression**: In conditions such as advanced atherosclerotic disease, crush injury, cancer, or septicemia, there may be a risk of thromboembolic events or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with Alhemo treatment.

- **Hypersensitivity**: Inform patients of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, redness, hives, itching, facial swelling, tightness of the chest, and wheezing. Additionally, provide information on the signs of an anaphylactic reaction, such as widespread itching; redness and/or swelling of the lips, tongue, face, or hands; difficulty swallowing; and shortness of breath.

### Penile and scrotal swelling: An underrecognized presentation of Crohn's disease [^114Lfo2N]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Penile and scrotal swelling can occur as an extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn's disease (CD) and is considered an uncommon form of metastatic CD (MCD) due to its rarity. Consequently, much is unknown concerning the presentation, treatment, and response to therapy in children with genital MCD.

- **Methods**: Boys aged 1 to 17 years presenting with genital edema and a confirmed diagnosis or strong suspicion of CD, who were evaluated at the Mayo Clinic between 1996 and 2014, were included for review. We aimed to characterize the clinical and pathologic features of genital MCD and patients' response to treatment in our cohort.

- **Results**: Eight patients with genital MCD were identified from our institution (mean age 11.4 years, range 7–16 years). Seven (88%) patients experienced cutaneous symptoms before a formal diagnosis of CD was made, and two of the seven had no adverse gastrointestinal symptoms at that time. Patients were prescribed an average of 3.4 medications (topical and systemic) for managing their gastrointestinal CD and MCD.

- **Conclusions**: Penile and scrotal swelling can occur as an extraintestinal manifestation of CD and is regarded as an uncommon form of MCD. In boys, genital swelling typically precedes intestinal CD. Treatment of the underlying CD with systemic medications proved most effective in this series. An evaluation for CD is necessary in all patients presenting with unexplained genital swelling.

### Clinical effectiveness of unilateral single-armed vasoepididymostomy in obstructive azoospermia: a single-center experience [^112eMwEr]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

In summary, unilateral single-armed vasoepididymostomy (VE) can achieve high patency and pregnancy rates in patients with obstructive azoospermia (OA), whether they have congenital unilateral absence of the vas deferens (CUAVD) or acquired OA. When considering treatment options, unilateral single-armed VE is a feasible choice for OA patients with different underlying causes.

### Patient-reported outcomes for the intergroup sentinel mamma study (INSEMA): A randomised trial with persistent impact of axillary surgery on arm and breast symptoms in patients with early breast cancer [^1139YZC6]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

The 3-item arm symptoms scores showed major differences between the first randomization treatment arms. Arm functioning worsened in both groups, but the deterioration was much greater in the SLNB group than in the no SLNB group (P < 0.001). The BRAS scores favor the no SLNB group in all post-baseline assessments (Fig. 2A). Patients in the SLNB group showed persistent higher scores for BRAS (differences in mean values ≥ 5.0 points at all times of evaluation), including pain, arm swelling, and impaired mobility in all postoperative visits, with the highest difference at one month after the final surgery (mean scores, 23.6 vs. 12.6). Figure 2B–D shows the score curves for each BRAS item among the first randomization. The most remarkable differences between treatment arms were observed for pain in the arm or shoulder and limited arm mobility at one month postoperatively. Each item, including arm swelling, showed a persistent impact by treatment arms at all time points, favoring the no SLNB group.

- **Curves for PROs concerning QLQ-BR23 arm symptoms (BRAS scales)**: The first randomization analysis includes overall curves with P-values for treatment, time, and treatment by time; pain in the arm or shoulder; swelling in the arm or hand; and limited arm mobility.

The second randomization with a greater extent of axillary surgery revealed more significant differences using BRAS mean scores, favoring SLNB alone at all post-baseline visits (P < 0.001). The prominent impairment occurred between 1 and 3 months following surgery (Fig. 3A). Separated analyses for each item showed clinically significant impacts.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs), specifically concerning indications for screening, the HHT-WG 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining an agitated saline contrast transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) or a low-dose non-contrast chest CT, depending on local expertise. This is advised for the initial screening of PAVMs in asymptomatic pregnant patients with HHT who have not been recently screened for PAVMs. If a chest CT is performed, it should be done early in the second trimester.

### Epididymitis: An overview [^1173XH2k]. American Family Physician (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute epididymitis:

- **Definition**: Acute epididymitis is the acute inflammation of the epididymis characterized by pain and scrotal swelling present for less than six weeks.

- **Pathophysiology**: Acute epididymitis is caused by a bacterial ascent (urinary tract infections or sexually transmitted infections), viral genesis (adenovirus, enterovirus), fungi (C. albicans, Histoplasma capsulatum), parasites (Trichomonas vaginalis, Schistosoma species, Filariasis), drug-induced factors (amiodarone), and rheumatic conditions (Behçet's disease, vasculitis, Henoch-Schönlein purpura). It may also result from obstruction (vasectomy), genital trauma, and sterile reflux.

- **Disease course**: The inflammation of the epididymis results in acute epididymitis, which causes clinical manifestations such as gradual unilateral scrotal pain and epididymal swelling with concurrent symptoms of fever, hematuria, dysuria, and urinary frequency. Disease progression may lead to abscess formation or Fournier gangrene, infertility, and chronic pain.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acute epididymitis is not associated with an increase in mortality.

### Non-healing arm wound with a discharging sinus in an elderly patient with diabetes [^111LDuFM]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

A 48-year-old Filipino female presented with unilateral acute onset of a painful red eye, blurred vision, and yellow discharge. On examination, she had a corrected visual acuity of 6/5 in the right eye and 6/18 in the left eye. There was a left-sided periorbital swelling, with chemosis involving the bulbar conjunctiva on the temporal aspect. Ocular motility showed a limitation of left-sided abduction with mild limitations of laevoelevation and laevodepression. She was afebrile and systemic examination was unremarkable. Her medical history included a diagnosis of Crohn's disease since the age of 20. She was on oral mesalamine 1 g for mildly active colitis. Her full blood count was normal, but erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were raised. Blood culture and conjunctival swab were negative. A contrast-enhanced CT scan demonstrated enlargement of the lacrimal gland. She was managed conservatively with acetaminophen and codeine for pain and swelling. She recovered completely in two weeks with no sequelae.

### Large cystic tumour at the chest wall mimicking an echinococcosis: A case report [^115PzCyY]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The authors report an atypical late onset of a large axillary lymphatic malformation in a 41-year-old male. Considering the patient's history and clinical findings at first presentation, the swelling was highly suspicious for malignancy or cystic echinococcosis. A consequent CT showed non-infiltrative growth with inhomogeneous density but remained inconclusive regarding diagnosis. Subsequently, an incision biopsy revealed lymphatic tissue and raised suspicion for lymphatic malformation. The tumour was excised completely, and there was no recurrence in a 1-year follow-up.

Late-onset lymphatic malformations can mimic malignant tumours or other rare conditions such as echinococcosis, which has to be taken into consideration as a differential diagnosis, especially in known areas of hydatid diseases.

### Abdominal hereditary angio-oedema caught on magnetic resonance imaging [^114jqV6K]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Hereditary angio-oedema (HAE) is a rare condition that typically presents with swelling of the lips, extremities, and pharynx. Abdominal angio-oedema, which usually presents with abdominal pain and distension, is often missed due to the numerous differentials of acute abdominal pain. The average time from first presentation to diagnosis in HAE has been reported as 8–10 years.

We report a case of a 17-year-old woman presenting with readmissions to the hospital due to acute abdominal pain, who was later diagnosed with HAE. She exhibited no extra-abdominal symptoms of the disease other than ankle swelling. An MRI of the small bowel was performed during an acute attack of pain, demonstrating ascites and small bowel submucosal oedema. This may be the first example of abdominal angio-oedema visualised on MRI. These findings resolved spontaneously on repeat imaging 72 hours later.

### Periorbital necrotizing fasciitis: The Manchester experience [^115iEyhK]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

The majority of patients in our cohort presented with a short history of unilateral periocular swelling. Periocular swelling is a common, non-specific symptom which may be associated with many less serious infective conditions, such as pre-septal cellulitis. Given the severity of the swelling in our cohort, the differential diagnosis in most patients was orbital cellulitis, and urgent Ophthalmology input was sought. Early commencement of antimicrobial therapy for probable orbital cellulitis was common and preceded the clinical diagnosis of PONF in all cases. In most cases, clinical diagnosis of PONF was delayed until the patient was referred and transferred from the presenting trust to our centre for ophthalmic assessment, which caused a delay in diagnosis and appropriate management for PONF.

Patient 4 of this case series presented to a different centre with unilateral periocular swelling and scab-like lesions in the periocular region. She was initially treated for HZO for around 12 hours, followed by a rapid increase in periocular swelling and systemic deterioration with the development of sepsis. Several cases of NF following Herpes Zoster infection have been reported. Unfortunately, at the centre to which she presented, Patient 4 had no microbiological testing at the onset of the initial vesicular rash, and no viral Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was sent as the disease progressed. It remains unclear if the presumed preceding viral infection led to the development of PONF or if there was a misdiagnosis at presentation.

### Clinical effectiveness of unilateral single-armed vasoepididymostomy in obstructive azoospermia: A single-center experience [^1122ePRc]. BMC Urology (2024). High credibility.

Vasoepididymostomy (VE) is an important surgical treatment to achieve natural conception for patients with obstructive azoospermia (OA). Only unilateral VE can be performed under certain conditions, such as in OA patients with congenital unilateral absence of the vas deferens (CUAVD) and some cases of acquired OA. There is a lack of relevant reports assessing the clinical outcomes of unilateral VE in OA patients with different causes. This study aims to describe the clinical features and evaluate treatments and outcomes of unilateral single-armed VE in OA patients.

- **Methods**: From December 2015 to June 2021, 46 OA patients, including 13 with CUAVD-associated OA and 33 with acquired OA, underwent unilateral single-armed VE at Shanghai General Hospital (Shanghai, China). Patient information, semen analysis, hormone profiles, and treatment information were collected, and the clinical outcomes were evaluated.

- **Results**: Obstruction in the distal portion of the unilateral vas deferens (16/46) was the most common cause for OA patients undergoing unilateral VE. CUAVD accounted for 28.4% (13/46) of the cases. The overall patency rate was 50.0% (23/46), with 38.5% (5/13) for the CUAVD group and 54.5% (18/33) for the acquired group (p > 0.05). The natural pregnancy rates in the CUAVD group and the acquired group were 20.0% and 33.3%, respectively (p > 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: These findings suggest that unilateral single-armed VE can achieve high patency and pregnancy rates in OA patients, whether they have CUAVD or acquired OA.

### Bilateral lower extremity inflammatory lymphedema after an ultramarathon [^112SQW9H]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A 54-year-old male ultramarathoner presented with severe swelling, redness, and pain in bilateral lower extremities. Symptoms began a few hours after finishing a 100-mile trail-running race in eastern Texas. The race occurred in February, with ambient temperatures ranging from 44 to 76 °F. The swelling progressively worsened, and he presented to the clinic approximately 3 days after finishing. He reported having run almost continuously for over 30 hours but denied any specific injury. He denied any changes in urine color, fever, severe or focal pain, or numbness/tingling. He reported running three prior races of over 100 miles but denied any history of similar symptoms. His medical and surgical histories were unremarkable.

The patient arrived in a wheelchair but transitioned to the examination table unassisted. His vital signs were normal, and he was in no distress. Upon inspection, prominent 4+ pitting edema, and moderate diffuse erythema and warmth were noted from the knees to the toes bilaterally (Fig 1). There was no purpura. The knees, ankles, and feet were nontender, and there was only mild tenderness to palpation of the lower leg muscular compartments. There was mild pain on passive ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Strength testing revealed mild weakness (4+/5) in ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Neurovascular examination was unremarkable.

### Vascular malformation masquerading as sialolithiasis and parotid obstruction: A case report and review of the literature [^113oXciA]. The Laryngoscope (2010). Low credibility.

Salivary gland obstruction caused by sialolithiasis or duct stricture is one of the more common causes of non-infectious unilateral facial swelling. Vascular malformations of the head and neck are less common but may present with intermittent facial swelling. Phleboliths can be found in venous malformations of nearly all adult patients and are a key diagnostic imaging finding. The clinical and radiographic appearance of phleboliths may resemble sialolithiasis, making the diagnosis more difficult. We present a case of intermittent unilateral facial swelling caused by a venous malformation involving the buccal space where the phleboliths were initially misdiagnosed as parotid sialolithiasis.

- **Study design**: Illustrative case report and literature review.

- **Methods**: A 48-year-old woman presented to our office with 9 months of intermittent left facial swelling. On bimanual examination, multiple small firm nodules were palpated in the left cheek. A computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated multiple oval-shaped radiopaque lesions in the buccal space, initially interpreted as sialoliths. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained, confirming the diagnosis of venous malformation with phleboliths. Sialendoscopy revealed a normal appearing parotid duct system without stricture or sialolithiasis. Ultrasound revealed a buccal space vascular lesion surrounding the distal Stensen's duct.

- **Results**: Currently, the patient is being observed and is clinically stable. Illustrative CT scan and MRI images are presented. A literature review shows that vascular malformations mimic sialolithiasis.

### Hand dermatitis and lymphoedema [^114pYYt6]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Hand dermatitis is common, with lymphoedema of the hand and forearm being a rare complication. The mechanism of lymphoedema in such cases is poorly understood, thereby making management challenging. To investigate the underlying mechanism of lymphoedema associated with hand dermatitis and outline recommendations for management, we identified all patients with lymphoedema associated with hand dermatitis referred to our lymphoedema service, a tertiary referral centre. Treatment outcomes were assessed via telephone interviews and correspondence with primary physicians and therapists.

In total, nine patients, six with bilateral and three with unilateral lymphoedema associated with hand dermatitis, attended our service over a four-year period. Most patients had long-standing bilateral pompholyx eczema. Three patients reported no signs of infection prior to the onset of swelling, although all patients experienced episodes of infection after swelling onset.

Lymphoscintigraphy, when utilized, revealed a failure of small initial lymphatics of the hand to absorb and drain lymph to regional nodes. Prophylactic antibiotics, combined with aggressive management of the dermatitis — often requiring systemic therapy — were necessary to reduce swelling. Possible mechanisms for lymphoedema associated with hand dermatitis include obliterative lymphangitis from infection, an inflammatory impact of the dermatitis on local lymphatics, or a constitutive weakness of lymph drainage exacerbated by chronic inflammation, or any combination of these factors. Treatment is only successful once both infection and inflammation from the dermatitis are managed.

### Near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging of a toddler with congenital lymphedema [^111uWZog]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Primary lymphedema in the pediatric population remains poorly diagnosed and misunderstood due to a lack of information on the causation and underlying anatomy of the lymphatic system. Consequently, therapeutic protocols for pediatric patients remain sparse and with little evidence to support them. In an effort to better understand the causation of primary pediatric lymphedema and to better inform clinical care, we report the use of near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging on the extremities of an alert, 21-month-old boy who presented with unilateral right arm and hand lymphedema at birth.

The imaging results indicated an intact, apparently normal lymphatic anatomy with no obvious malformation, but with decreased lymphatic contractile function of the affected upper extremity relative to the contralateral and lower extremities. We hypothesized that the lack of contraction of the lymphatic vessels rather than an anatomic malformation was the source of the unilateral extremity swelling, and that compression and manual lymphatic drainage could be effective treatments.
