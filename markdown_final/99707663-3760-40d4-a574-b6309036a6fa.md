## Question

Patient fell. All looks good except her BP. Staff took about 5 minutes ago with two different machines and different arms. In her chart, her BP readings have been recorded low.
Three BP readings at 85/46, 84/58 and 90/47. ALF staff asking if they need to further assess? Please advise.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether assisted living staff should further evaluate an older adult who fell and now has repeatedly low blood pressure readings, and what immediate steps to take. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate safety and injury assessment after the fall. Then, I should review whether these blood pressure values meet clinically significant hypotension thresholds. Next, I will outline the correct orthostatic vital sign protocol and timing. After that, I need to check contributing factors such as medications, hydration, and comorbidities. Then, I will review indications for urgent medical referral and recommended diagnostic tests. Next, I should detail immediate non-pharmacologic safety measures while awaiting evaluation. Finally, I will consolidate this into a clear recommendation for the ALF staff, making sure my reasoning aligns with current guidelines and evidence and correcting any missteps along the way if needed.

> Let me first confirm immediate priorities after the fall, because I need to ensure we are not missing injury or a life-threatening cause of syncope. A fall in an older adult is a red flag for potential cardiovascular causes, especially orthostatic hypotension, but I must not jump to conclusions before ruling out head injury, fractures, lacerations, or bleeding and before confirming current symptoms such as dizziness, confusion, chest pain, palpitations, or visual changes; the patient should not ambulate unassisted until the cause is clarified and injuries are excluded, and if orthostatic hypotension is suspected but not detected with standard cuff methods, beat-to-beat testing or tilt evaluation is recommended as a next step according to falls guidelines [^1173kqJG].

> Now, I will examine the recorded blood pressures of 85/46, 84/58, and 90/47 mmHg and ask, do these qualify as clinically significant hypotension that increases risk for falls. Wait, let me verify the threshold from syncope guidelines: ESC 2018 advises that syncope due to orthostatic hypotension should be suspected when there is a fall in SBP by at least 20 mmHg or DBP by at least 10 mmHg, or when SBP decreases to less than 90 mmHg, so systolic values in the 80s clearly meet a concerning threshold even without documented positional change, and they warrant prompt evaluation for hypotension-related causes of falls; moreover, in SPRINT, orthostatic hypotension was associated with hypotension-related hospitalizations or emergency visits with a hazard ratio of 1.77, reinforcing the clinical significance of these findings even when overt symptoms are limited [^111kcQ1q] [^112DCV2o] [^114SnhnQ] [^115WqAa5].

> Next, I should review the correct protocol for standardized orthostatic vital sign testing because current measurements are insufficient to confirm or exclude classic or delayed orthostatic hypotension. Let me think this through: guidelines recommend the patient rest supine for at least 5 minutes and then measure BP and heart rate immediately upon standing and again at 1 and 3 minutes, and if delayed orthostatic hypotension is suspected or symptoms occur later, extend measurements to 5 minutes; hold on, I initially considered stopping at 3 minutes, but the STURDY analysis showed that both immediate and delayed measurements predicted falls, with a notable association at approximately 5 minutes, so extending to 5 minutes when suspicion is high is prudent and consistent with falls guidance [^112y5Hrs] [^1173kqJG] [^115fznvR].

> I will now examine potential contributors and medications because drug-induced or volume-related causes are common and modifiable. I need to check for antihypertensives, diuretics, alpha-blockers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and Parkinson's medications, as consensus and hypertension guidelines emphasize medication review and, when orthostatic hypotension is present, considering dose reduction or discontinuation of BP-lowering drugs; I should also confirm hydration status, anemia, diabetes, autonomic dysfunction, time-of-day effects, and postprandial hypotension, and I must not forget that atypical antipsychotics can cause orthostatic hypotension and falls, so if agents like cariprazine, olanzapine/samidorphan, or brexpiprazole are used, orthostatic monitoring is advised and fall risk should be reassessed, especially during initiation or dose increases [^11354SU4] [^117K1NdP] [^112ctFpp] [^112Vtr17] [^112vW2ym] [^116TDEG4].

> But wait, what if neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is a concern and supine hypertension coexists, which could change management choices. I should double-check for a blunted heart rate response on standing to differentiate neurogenic from non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, and if uncertainty remains, additional autonomic testing or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can help characterize daytime hypotension and nocturnal supine hypertension, since neurogenic orthostatic hypotension often coincides with supine hypertension and may require tailored targets and permissive supine values in select cases [^111jn2Ym] [^113sfH2Y] [^112DGX5e].

> Next, I should review indications for urgent physician referral and the diagnostic work-up, and I need to ensure I do not under-triage given the combination of a fall and low blood pressures. A fall with SBP readings in the 80s justifies same-day medical evaluation; evaluation should include a focused injury assessment, a 12-lead ECG to assess arrhythmia or conduction disease, lab tests for dehydration, electrolytes, renal function, and anemia, and standardized orthostatic vitals as described; if standard measurements are nondiagnostic but suspicion remains high, consider beat-to-beat standing BP or head-up tilt testing because these can uncover initial or delayed orthostatic hypotension associated with falls [^111JYUVe] [^1173kqJG] [^111uYiUy].

> While awaiting medical evaluation, I need to implement immediate safety and non-pharmacologic interventions and simultaneously avoid premature medication changes without clinician oversight. Let me reconsider the medication point: I almost advised holding antihypertensives broadly, but guidelines suggest considering down-titration or discontinuation when orthostatic hypotension is confirmed, so I should instruct the team to contact the prescribing clinician urgently rather than independently adjust therapy; in the meantime, ensure adequate oral hydration if not contraindicated, teach slow positional changes with pre-standing calf and thigh muscle activation, consider abdominal binders or graded compression stockings, elevate the head of bed if supine hypertension is present, use assistive devices for transfers, and supervise all standing and ambulation for 48–72 hours to mitigate repeat fall risk [^11354SU4] [^113XSwHB] [^116Nd1Z9].

> I should confirm additional nuances of orthostatic testing and differential diagnoses so that we do not miss alternative causes like POTS or arrhythmias. ESC syncope guidance reminds me that syncope due to orthostatic hypotension is supported when symptoms and BP criteria coincide, whereas POTS involves a heart rate rise exceeding 30 bpm without orthostatic hypotension, and if short-lived BP changes are suspected, continuous beat-to-beat monitoring during active standing helps detect initial orthostatic hypotension, which can be missed by intermittent cuff measurements [^112DCV2o] [^114d7mkK] [^111uYiUy].

> Final recommendation to ALF staff: Yes, immediate and comprehensive further assessment is required because the combination of a fall and documented systolic blood pressures in the 80s constitutes a high-risk scenario. The next steps are to ensure injury triage, perform standardized orthostatic vital signs with supine rest and serial standing measurements extending to 5 minutes if needed, obtain urgent clinician evaluation with ECG and targeted labs, review and reconcile medications for potential contributors, and institute non-pharmacologic fall-safety measures while avoiding unsupervised medication changes; this approach aligns with falls, syncope, hypertension, and orthostatic hypotension guidance and addresses both immediate safety and modifiable risk [^1173kqJG] [^111kcQ1q] [^112y5Hrs] [^113XSwHB] [^115fznvR].

The ALF staff should **immediately reassess** the patient with a focused evaluation for causes of hypotension [^1173kqJG], including orthostatic vitals [^112y5Hrs], medication review, and an assessment for dehydration or bleeding. Persistent **SBP < 90 mmHg or MAP < 65 mmHg** in an older adult is clinically significant and increases the risk of falls, syncope, and organ hypoperfusion [^112DCV2o]. If the patient is symptomatic, has a MAP < 65 mmHg, or shows signs of shock, **urgent transfer to a higher level of care is indicated** [^notfound]. Otherwise, initiate non-pharmacologic measures (supine rest, hydration, compression stockings) and monitor closely [^116Nd1Z9] [^113XSwHB]. If hypotension persists or worsens, escalate care promptly [^11354SU4].

## Clinical significance of persistent low blood pressure

Persistent low BP (SBP < 90 mmHg or MAP < 65 mmHg) in older adults is **clinically significant** and associated with an increased risk of falls, syncope, and organ hypoperfusion [^115fznvR] [^111Nzz19]. Even asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension is an independent risk factor for mortality and cardiovascular disease [^1144gFDE] [^113X16Sj]. Therefore, persistent low BP readings in this patient **warrant further assessment and intervention** [^112y5Hrs].

---

## Recommended immediate actions and assessments

Recommended **immediate actions and assessments** include:

- **Confirm accuracy of BP measurements**: Ensure proper cuff size, patient positioning, and calibration of equipment [^112y5Hrs].

- **Perform orthostatic vital signs**: Measure BP and heart rate after 5 minutes supine, immediately upon standing, and at 1 and 3 minutes post-standing [^112y5Hrs].

- **Conduct a focused clinical assessment**: Evaluate for symptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, weakness, fatigue, nausea, palpitations, or chest pain [^117KaY6h].

- **Review medication history**: Identify medications that may contribute to hypotension, such as antihypertensives, diuretics, antidepressants, or alpha-blockers [^113X16Sj] [^111JYUVe].

- **Assess for dehydration or volume depletion**: Check for signs of dehydration, recent illness, or inadequate fluid intake [^117KaY6h].

- **Evaluate for acute blood loss or internal bleeding**: Look for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, or other sources of blood loss [^117KaY6h].

## Clinical guidelines and protocols for managing persistent low blood pressure

Current clinical guidelines recommend the following **management strategies**:

- **Non-pharmacologic interventions**: Increase fluid and salt intake, use compression stockings, elevate the head of the bed, and implement physical counter-maneuvers [^11354SU4] [^116Nd1Z9].

- **Pharmacologic interventions**: Consider fludrocortisone or midodrine if non-pharmacologic measures are insufficient [^11354SU4] [^115UjaoT] [^113sJq7p].

- **Regular monitoring**: Monitor BP regularly and adjust treatment based on patient response and symptoms [^11354SU4] [^112DGX5e].

---

## Risks associated with persistent low blood pressure in elderly patients

Persistent low BP in elderly patients is associated with significant risks, notably, **increased falls and fractures** due to dizziness, syncope, and impaired balance [^1173kqJG] [^115fznvR]. It is also linked to cognitive impairment from chronic cerebral hypoperfusion [^114nQSqq], as well as cardiovascular complications, including higher rates of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and mortality [^1144gFDE].

---

## Recommended follow-up actions and monitoring strategies

Recommended **follow-up actions and monitoring strategies** include:

- **Regular BP monitoring**: Monitor BP regularly, including orthostatic measurements [^112y5Hrs].

- **Patient education**: Educate the patient and caregivers about symptoms of hypotension and when to seek medical attention [^116Nd1Z9].

- **Medication review and adjustment**: Regularly review and adjust medications that may contribute to hypotension [^11354SU4].

- **Referral to specialists**: Consider referral to cardiology, neurology, or endocrinology if underlying causes are suspected [^1173kqJG].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Persistent low BP readings in this patient **warrant further assessment and intervention** [^112DCV2o]. The ALF staff should **immediately reassess** the patient, confirm BP accuracy, perform orthostatic vital signs, and conduct a focused clinical assessment [^112y5Hrs]. In elderly patients, persistent low BP is clinically significant and associated with increased risks of falls, cognitive impairment, and cardiovascular complications [^115fznvR] [^1144gFDE]. Therefore, appropriate management, monitoring, and follow-up are essential for patient safety and to prevent adverse outcomes [^1173kqJG] [^11354SU4].

### Misconceptions and facts about orthostatic hypotension [^113X16Sj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent medical condition and an independent risk factor for falls and mortality. It reflects a condition in which autonomic reflexes are impaired or intravascular volume is depleted, causing a significant reduction in blood pressure upon standing. This disorder is frequently unrecognized until later in its clinical course. Symptoms like orthostatic dizziness do not reliably identify patients with orthostatic hypotension, who are often asymptomatic, further complicating the diagnosis. We summarize seven clinically important misconceptions about orthostatic hypotension.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, particularly concerning elderly patients, the ESH 2023 guidelines recommend assessing for orthostatic hypotension in older patients, even in the absence of symptoms. It is advised to consider down-titrating or discontinuing blood pressure-lowering drugs in patients with orthostatic hypotension.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: A global initiative [^1173kqJG]. Age and Ageing (2022). High credibility.

Unexplained falls are most likely associated with a cardiovascular cause. The most common cardiovascular causes of falls, in order of prevalence, are orthostatic hypotension, vasovagal syndrome, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, bradyarrhythmias, and atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The investigation — and subsequent management and specialist referral criteria — of syncope and, therefore, unexplained falls can be performed according to locally applicable guidelines, such as the 2018 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope.

If orthostatic hypotension is suspected but not detected using traditional methods such as an oscillometer or sphygmomanometer, referral for beat-to-beat orthostatic measurement is recommended, as the association of falls with orthostatic hypotension measured using beat-to-beat methods is more consistent. If vasovagal syncope or delayed orthostatic hypotension is suspected and diagnostic uncertainty remains, older adults should be referred for head-up tilt tests. If arrhythmias are suspected after clinical assessment, based on locally applicable guidelines, individuals should be referred for external or internal cardiac monitoring.

For assessment of orthostatic hypotension, individuals should be supine for at least 5 minutes before baseline blood pressure is recorded. Upon standing, blood pressure should be taken as soon as possible (40–60 seconds), followed by measurements at 1-minute intervals up to 3 minutes, or up to 5 minutes if symptoms suggest delayed orthostatic hypotension.

### EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of orthostatic hypotension [^113XSwHB]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Orthostatic (postural) hypotension (OH) is a common yet underdiagnosed disorder that may contribute to disability and even death. It can be the initial sign and lead to incapacitating symptoms in primary and secondary autonomic disorders. These range from visual disturbances and dizziness to loss of consciousness (syncope) after postural change. Evidence-based guidelines for the diagnostic workup and therapeutic management (non-pharmacological and pharmacological) are provided based on the EFNS guidance regulations. The final literature research was performed in March 2005.

For the diagnosis of OH, a structured history taking and measurement of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate in supine and upright positions are necessary. OH is defined as a fall in systolic BP below 20 mmHg and diastolic BP below 10 mmHg of baseline within 3 minutes in the upright position. Passive head-up tilt testing is recommended if the active standing test is negative, especially if the history suggests OH, or in patients with motor impairment.

Management initially consists of education, advice, and training on various factors influencing blood pressure. Increased water and salt ingestion effectively improve OH. Physical measures include leg crossing, squatting, elastic abdominal binders and stockings, and careful exercise. Fludrocortisone is a valuable starter drug. Second-line drugs include sympathomimetics, such as midodrine, ephedrine, or dihydroxyphenylserine. Supine hypertension has to be considered.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^117K1NdP]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Patients in each of these groups have a higher risk of OH/nOH when compared to the normal population.

For these five categories of patients, clinicians should ask about cardinal symptoms of OH, their frequency and severity, how long they can stand, and the effect of symptoms on their activities of daily living. Questions about symptoms should also note the time of day when the symptoms occur, as symptoms of OH/nOH are most likely to occur in the morning and after meals. A more complete list of questions to use when screening patients for OH/nOH is presented in Table 1. If a patient gives a positive response to one or more of the questions listed in Table 1, they should be considered as being at risk for OH/nOH, and a more complete evaluation, including orthostatic vital signs, needs to be conducted to confirm a diagnosis of OH/nOH.

From a practical standpoint, at the minimum, the patient should be asked a variation of question 10: "Do you have symptoms when you stand up or within 3–5 minutes of standing and get better when you sit or lay down?" Because falls are of such consequence to aging patients, a specific question about the circumstances of falls is appropriate. Clinicians must recognize that some patients are reluctant to admit symptoms of OH or falls, fearing that they may lose their autonomy due to family member insistence on enhancing their safety.

- **Screening questions for suspected OH/nOH**: Any positive response should prompt further investigation with orthostatic blood pressure measurements.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113sfH2Y]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Understanding the physiology underlying both neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) and supine hypertension, as well as their associated risks, is critical for clinicians managing patients with nOH. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is linked with the loss of baroreflex function, which normally buffers changes in blood pressure. Consequently, patients with autonomic nervous system dysfunction often exhibit both nOH and supine hypertension.

Many of the medications used to treat nOH can cause or exacerbate supine hypertension, as these conditions are hemodynamic opposites. Therefore, treating one can worsen the other, making it vital to evaluate patients with nOH for supine hypertension. Clinical practices differ among clinicians treating nOH. Some may avoid treating nOH to prevent exacerbating supine hypertension, whereas others may aggressively treat nOH and accept the resulting supine hypertension.

The risks of nOH are immediate and pose significant health threats, contrasting with the potential long-term consequences of hypertension in non-Parkinson's disease patients. Similar recommendations apply to multiple system atrophy, although data is less conclusive for individuals with pure autonomic failure.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^111S3hrU]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Assessing nOH treatment success involves a multifaceted approach that includes measuring symptomatic improvements alongside ongoing blood pressure measurements. It is critical that patients are educated about the various symptoms and instructed on maintaining a symptom diary. Patients should conduct a period of home monitoring of blood pressure after implementing new or additional non-pharmacologic measures, or following a change in treatment or dosage.

We recommend that patients check their blood pressures at home in the supine head-up position (at bedtime, prior to arising in the morning, and while in their normal head-up sleeping position). Patients taking pressor medications such as midodrine or droxidopa should avoid the supine position during the 4–5 hours following medication intake and check blood pressure after 3 minutes of standing. Morning blood pressure should be measured before taking any morning medications, when symptoms are present, and at bedtime over several days.

The blood pressure diary should be evaluated by the healthcare provider two weeks after any therapeutic change to determine the need for further adjustments. If blood pressure measurements have been stable, reducing the frequency of monitoring can be considered, but monitoring should be reinstituted if symptoms worsen or medications are changed. Lastly, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can be considered for comprehensive assessment.

### Timing of orthostatic hypotension and its relationship with falls in older adults [^115fznvR]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). High credibility.

There is inconsistent evidence on the optimal time after standing to assess for orthostatic hypotension. We determined the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension at different time points after standing in a population of older adults, as well as the fall risk and symptoms associated with orthostatic hypotension.

- **Methods**: We performed a secondary analysis of the Study to Understand Fall Reduction and Vitamin D in You (STURDY), a randomized clinical trial funded by the National Institute on Aging, testing the effect of differing vitamin D3 doses on fall risk in older adults. STURDY occurred between July 2015 and May 2019, with secondary analysis occurring in 2022. Participants were community-dwelling adults, 70 years or older. In the orthostatic hypotension assessment, participants stood upright from a supine position and underwent six standing blood pressure measurements (M1-M6) in two clusters of three measurements (immediately and 3 minutes after standing). Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the relationship between orthostatic hypotension at each measurement and subsequent falls. Participants were followed until the earlier of their 24-month visit or study completion.

- **Results**: Orthostatic hypotension occurred in 32% of assessments at M1 and only 16% at M5 and M6. Orthostatic hypotension from average immediate (M1–3) and average delayed (M4–6) measurements, respectively, predicted higher fall risk (M1–3 = 1.65 [1.08, 2.52]; M4–6 = 1.73 [1.03, 2.91]) (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]). However, among individual measurements, only orthostatic hypotension at M5 was significantly associated with increased fall risk.

### EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of orthostatic hypotension [^116Nd1Z9]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). High credibility.

Regarding patient education for orthostatic hypotension, specifically concerning physical and nutritional measures, the EFNS 2006 guidelines recommend counseling patients on the various factors that influence blood pressure. Patients should be informed about specific elements that must be avoided, including certain foods, habits, positions, and drugs.

### Orthostatic hypotension and risk of clinical and subclinical cardiovascular disease in middle-aged adults [^1144gFDE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

- **Clinical outcomes**: MI, HF, stroke, fatal CHD, any CHD, and death. Participants were followed up for CVD events and mortality through December 31, 2015. Details pertaining to the ascertainment and adjudication of these events have been detailed previously. In brief, these outcomes were ascertained through active surveillance of surrounding hospital records and annual telephone calls with participants or their proxies. Fatalities were also identified via state and national death indexes. Trained personnel abstracted hospital records related to possible CVD, which were reviewed and adjudicated by an expert panel.

Incident MI was defined as definite or probable MI based on adjudicator review. Incident HF was based on the first hospitalization or death related to HF using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes of 428.x or I50 (10th revision) in any position on the hospital discharge list or on a death certificate. All HF events were adjudicated after 2005. Incident stroke events were ascertained through a combination of active surveillance of hospitalizations, cohort follow-up, and linkage with death registries. All events were adjudicated by committee review. We included definite or probable stroke events in this study. Fatal CHD was defined by death related to CHD. Any CHD was based on a composite definition of definite or probable MI, fatal CHD, cardiac procedure, or silent MI based on ECG.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^112ctFpp]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

In patients with OH/nOH, normal sympathetic activity cannot compensate for blood pooling within the splanchnic circulation after eating. With nOH, sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve activity is deficient, leading many patients to become severely hypotensive within two hours of eating. It is important to recognize this problem because treatment of OH/nOH can diminish symptoms post-meal. Patients can be asked to measure their blood pressure before and 30 minutes following a high carbohydrate meal. In individuals with postprandial hypotension, smaller, more frequent meals are recommended. There is also some evidence that a low glycemic diet may have a beneficial effect on the symptoms of OH/nOH. Finally, postprandial hypotension can be reduced with caffeine or acarbose.

- **Anemia and vitamin/mineral deficiencies in the diet**: Anemia leads to decreased blood viscosity and oxygen carrying capacity and may worsen symptoms of OH/nOH. Vitamin B12 deficiency (< 250 pg/mL with elevated methylmalonic acid levels) may also be associated with postural instability and can cause OH. B12 deficiency and anemia should be corrected, and ongoing observation is necessary to prevent recurrence. Thus, changes in diet, as well as vitamin and iron supplementation, may be helpful for some patients with nOH.

- **Treating nOH — step 3: Initial pharmacologic treatment**: If the implementation of non-pharmacologic measures does not adequately improve the symptoms of nOH, then it becomes necessary to initiate pharmacotherapy. For patients who are experiencing syncope, near-syncope, or falls, the potential consequences are grave.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for syncope, specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria for orthostatic hypotension-induced syncope, the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend suspecting postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome when there is an orthostatic heart rate increase (> 30 bpm or > 120 bpm within 10 minutes of active standing) in the absence of orthostatic hypotension, reproducing spontaneous symptoms.

### EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of orthostatic hypotension [^111JYUVe]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). High credibility.

The EFNS 2006 guidelines provide recommendations on the diagnostic investigations for orthostatic hypotension (OH), particularly addressing the initial evaluation of patients suspected of having OH. The guidelines suggest obtaining the following evaluations:

- **Structured history taking**: This involves gathering comprehensive patient history to identify potential indicators of OH.

- **Detailed physical examination**: A thorough physical exam is essential to assess the patient's condition accurately.

- **Supine and upright blood pressure (BP) measurements**: These measurements are critical for detecting any abnormal BP changes between positions.

- **12-lead ECG recording**: Captures heart activity to identify any potential cardiac involvement.

- **Active standing or head-up tilt**: Ideally performed with continuous assessment of BP and heart rate (HR) for 3 minutes to observe physiological responses to positional changes.

### Defining the typical characteristics of orthostatic headache in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^112gfZ8Q]. Cephalalgia (2025). Low credibility.

Orthostatic headache (OH) is a common feature of various conditions, including spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH), but no precise definition currently exists outlining the typical OH characteristics. This ambiguity risks misdiagnosis with unnecessary investigations and delay in the institution of treatment. The present study aimed to carry out structured phenotyping of OH in patients with SIH with the aim of outlining its typical characteristics.

- **Methods**: Eligible patients with clinico-radiological confirmed SIH underwent a structured interview, after which a specialist interest group utilized the modified Delphi process to analyze the data and achieve consensus on defining the typical characteristics of OH in SIH.

- **Results**: In total, 137 patients were recruited. OH was present in 75.9%. Typical OH characteristics in SIH were defined as having a baseline severity (lying flat) on waking up of ≤ 3 (0–10, verbal response scale), headache onset-time of ≤ 4.5 hours on becoming upright, time to peak severity of ≤ 7.5 hours, and an offset to baseline severity within 1.5 hours of recumbency. Intra-individual consistency in the onset and offset-time was deemed a necessary characteristic.

- **Conclusions**: Defining typical OH characteristics has the potential of enhancing SIH diagnostics and management, at the same time as minimizing unwarranted invasive procedures.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^1132ZTDm]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Determination of the underlying mechanism of syncope is critical for choosing an appropriate treatment and management protocol. A proposed diagnostic algorithm should include a detailed patient history and physical examination, including supine and standing blood pressure (BP) measurements and an ECG [figure 1]. If determination of the mechanism of syncope is inconclusive after initial examinations, then autonomic function testing is warranted.

Figure 1 outlines the diagnostic algorithm and treatment options for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. Abbreviations used are: BP (blood pressure), CHF (congestive heart failure), DBP (diastolic BP), HR (heart rate), MI (myocardial infarction), nOH (neurogenic orthostatic hypotension), OH (orthostatic hypotension), and SBP (systolic BP).

The underlying causes of nOH can be varied, and there are multiple factors to consider in its management, especially in the presence of comorbid conditions. A case report identified amyloidosis as a potential cause in a patient who presented with autonomic nervous system impairment and OH, with systemic organ involvement, including gastrointestinal and kidney dysfunction. In two other case reports, patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and cardiac conditions presented with dizziness, lightheadedness, and fatigue, and were subsequently diagnosed with nOH. In one of these cases, the patient was initially suspected to have bradycardia due to symptom overlap with nOH and was referred for a pacemaker before nOH diagnostic testing was considered. Thus, it is imperative for clinicians to screen for nOH when patients present with non-specific symptoms.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope [^111kcQ1q]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

When screening and diagnosing syncope, particularly in relation to orthostatic hypotension-induced syncope, the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend suspecting syncope due to orthostatic hypotension under certain conditions. These include observing a symptomatic fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from a baseline value by ≥ 20 mmHg, or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decrease of ≥ 10 mmHg, or an SBP drop to < 90 mmHg. This is applicable even if not all historical features indicative of orthostatic hypotension are present.

### Evaluation and management of orthostatic hypotension [^117KaY6h]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg within three minutes of standing when compared with blood pressure from the sitting or supine position. It results from an inadequate physiologic response to postural changes in blood pressure. Orthostatic hypotension may be acute or chronic, as well as symptomatic or asymptomatic.

Common symptoms include dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision, weakness, fatigue, nausea, palpitations, and headache. Less common symptoms are syncope, dyspnea, chest pain, and neck and shoulder pain. The causes can include dehydration or blood loss; disorders of the neurologic, cardiovascular, or endocrine systems; and several classes of medications.

- **Evaluation and diagnosis**: Evaluation of suspected orthostatic hypotension begins by identifying reversible causes and underlying associated medical conditions. Head-up tilt-table testing can aid in confirming a diagnosis of suspected orthostatic hypotension when standard orthostatic vital signs are nondiagnostic, and it can also assist in assessing treatment response in patients with an autonomic disorder.

- **Goals of treatment and management**: Goals of treatment involve improving hypotension without excessive supine hypertension, relieving orthostatic symptoms, and improving standing time. Treatment includes correcting reversible causes and discontinuing responsible medications, when possible. Nonpharmacologic treatment should be offered to all patients. For patients who do not respond adequately to nonpharmacologic treatment, fludrocortisone, midodrine, and pyridostigmine are potential options.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syncope, specifically concerning orthostatic challenge (active standing), the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend suspecting syncope due to orthostatic hypotension when there is an asymptomatic fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline value ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 10 mmHg, or a decrease in SBP to < 90 mmHg, in the presence of symptoms from history that are less consistent with orthostatic hypotension.

### Vraylar [^112Vtr17]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Orthostatic hypotension and syncope**: Atypical antipsychotics cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope, with the greatest risk during initial dose titration and dose increases. In trials of VRAYLAR, symptomatic orthostatic hypotension was infrequent and not more frequent than with placebo. Syncope was not observed. It is advised to monitor orthostatic vital signs in patients vulnerable to hypotension, such as the elderly, those with dehydration or hypovolemia, those receiving concomitant antihypertensive medications, patients with known cardiovascular disease (e.g. history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), and patients with cerebrovascular disease. VRAYLAR has not been evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable cardiovascular disease, as these patients were excluded from pre-marketing clinical trials.

- **Falls**: Antipsychotics, including VRAYLAR, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, and motor and sensory instability, potentially leading to falls and consequent injuries such as fractures. For patients with conditions or medications that might exacerbate these effects, it is important to complete fall risk assessments upon initiating antipsychotic treatment and to reassess periodically for those on long-term therapy.

- **Seizures**: VRAYLAR, like other antipsychotic drugs, may induce seizures. This risk is heightened in patients with a history of seizures or conditions that lower the seizure threshold.

### Diagnosis and treatment of orthostatic hypotension [^114nQSqq]. The Lancet Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is an unusually large decrease in blood pressure on standing that increases the risk of adverse outcomes even when asymptomatic. Improvements in haemodynamic profiling with continuous blood pressure measurements have uncovered four major subtypes: initial orthostatic hypotension, delayed blood pressure recovery, classic orthostatic hypotension, and delayed orthostatic hypotension. Clinical presentations are varied and range from cognitive slowing with hypotensive unawareness or unexplained falls to classic presyncope and syncope. Establishing whether symptoms are due to orthostatic hypotension requires careful history taking, a thorough physical examination, and supine and upright blood pressure measurements. Management and prognosis vary according to the underlying cause, with the main distinction being whether orthostatic hypotension is neurogenic or non-neurogenic. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension might be the earliest clinical manifestation of Parkinson's disease or related synucleinopathies, and often coincides with supine hypertension. The emerging variety of clinical presentations advocates a stepwise, individualised, and primarily non-pharmacological approach to the management of orthostatic hypotension. Such an approach could include the cessation of blood pressure-lowering drugs, adoption of lifestyle measures (e.g. counterpressure manoeuvres), and treatment with pharmacological agents in selected cases.

### Orthostatic tachycardia-hypotensive syndrome: A novel form of orthostatic intolerance in the young [^117MG7yy]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Low credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS) are frequently observed causes of orthostatic intolerance (OI). Clinical experience reveals patients with overlapping symptoms of both. This observation led to the hypothesis of orthostatic tachycardia hypotensive syndrome (OTHS), a distinct OI variant that combines features of POTS and NCS. This study aims to define and characterize it.

A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients presenting with OI who underwent head-up tilt (HUT) between 2014 and 2020. Demographic data and findings during HUT, including heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), stroke volume (SV), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), syncope, cardiac asystole, and convulsions, were extracted. Subjects were divided into three groups: POTS, NCS, and OTHS. The study included patients with POTS (n = 90), NCS (n = 86), and OTHS (n = 101).

POTS patients exhibited a higher HR (baseline, recovery, minimum) compared to those with OTHS (p = 0.047), with an increase of 30–40 bpm followed by hypotension leading to syncope.

### Effects of intensive blood pressure treatment on orthostatic hypotension: A systematic review and individual participant-based meta-analysis [^113fpocK]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Although intensive blood pressure (BP)-lowering treatment reduces risk for cardiovascular disease, there are concerns that it might cause orthostatic hypotension (OH).

- **Purpose**: To examine the effects of intensive BP-lowering treatment on OH in hypertensive adults.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception through 7 October 2019, without language restrictions.

- **Study selection**: Randomized trials of BP pharmacologic treatment (more intensive BP goal or active agent) that involved more than 500 adults with hypertension or elevated BP and that were 6 months or longer in duration were selected. Trial comparisons were groups assigned to either less intensive BP goals or placebo, and the outcome was measured OH, defined as a decrease of 20 mm Hg or more in systolic BP or 10 mm Hg or more in diastolic BP after changing position from seated to standing.

- **Data extraction**: Two investigators independently abstracted articles and rated risk of bias.

- **Data synthesis**: Five trials examined BP treatment goals, and four examined active agents versus placebo. Trials examining BP treatment goals included 18,466 participants with 127,882 follow-up visits. Trials were open-label, with minimal heterogeneity of effects across trials. Intensive BP treatment lowered risk for OH (odds ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.86 to 0.99]). Effects did not differ by prerandomization OH (P for interaction = 0.80). In sensitivity analyses that included four additional placebo-controlled trials, overall and subgroup findings were unchanged.

- **Limitations**: Assessments of OH were done while participants were seated to standing.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^117EdaHs]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, little published literature is available on a "standardized approach" to the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with OH/nOH and associated supine hypertension. As such, the recommendations of this panel, which were based on the discussions and experiences of the panel along with evidence in the literature, should provide clinicians with a useful working approach to dealing with this complex condition.

The panel recommended that additional study in screening, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with OH/nOH and associated supine hypertension is necessary. In particular, additional studies of the treatment of nOH should be conducted to refine the diagnosis and treatment algorithms and to provide definitive evidence of efficacy and safety of medications that are currently used but not approved for the treatment of patients with nOH.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^115wghDQ]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Neurogenic vs. non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension**: If the diagnosis is orthostatic hypotension (OH) and not neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH), non-neurogenic causes are common. These frequently include the effects of medication — such as antihypertensive agents, antidepressants, and alpha-blockers — and factors like blood volume depletion or chronic illness with deconditioning. A comprehensive list of medications is provided in relevant tables, although not included here.

- **Differentiating OH from nOH**: It is important to differentiate between OH and nOH due to the significantly greater morbidity and mortality associated with nOH. The diagnosis and management points noted throughout this paper are useful for all individuals with OH. Readers are encouraged to refer to several comprehensive reviews for further information. A complete review of the diagnosis and management of non-neurogenic OH is beyond the scope of this paper.

- **Grading of nOH severity**: After diagnosing nOH, the consensus panel emphasizes establishing its severity. A grading scale for nOH is based on the total drop in systolic blood pressure, duration of standing time, and the number and severity of symptoms affecting daily activities. This grading scale helps clinicians decide whether to refer a patient to a specialist. For instance, patients with Grade 1 or 2 nOH may not necessitate referral, whereas those with Grade 3 or 4 nOH should be considered for referral, depending on the clinician's comfort level.

### Management of low blood pressure in ambulatory heart failure with reduced ejection fraction patients [^115WJT7e]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

A proposed five-step algorithm has been developed for the management of hypotension in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction.

The prerequisite is to identify settings in which hypotension is related to cardiogenic shock and reflects a drop in stroke volume. In this case, although patients may have signs or symptoms of hypotension, they will also show significant congestion and/or signs of hypoperfusion, possibly accompanied by severe worsening renal function. As specified in Figure 1, in such circumstances, an urgent admission should be considered, and if cardiogenic shock is confirmed, inotropes and/or mechanical support should be used. The subsequent steps focus solely on stable HFrEF patients.

- **Decision tree for a heart failure with reduced ejection fraction patient with low blood pressure (Step I and Step II)**: BP, blood pressure; HFrEF, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; SBP, systolic blood pressure.

- **Step I: Confirm low blood pressure and assess its link with symptoms**: Obviously, hemodynamic emergencies should lead to hospitalization. Given the importance of HFrEF drugs for prognosis, the link between symptoms suggestive of hypotension (such as dizziness and fatigue, especially when standing up and in an upright position) and low BP must be established. The measurement of supine BP should be supplemented by a standing BP evaluation. A decrease of 20 mmHg in SBP and/or 10 mmHg in DBP within the first 3 minutes after standing up suggests that symptoms are BP-related. In the absence of orthostatic hypotension, ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) may be considered.

### Antihypertensive drug effects on long-term blood pressure: an individual-level data meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials [^115SPTjv]. Heart (2022). High credibility.

Clinical guidelines for managing hypertension have invariably lowered the recommended blood pressure (BP) targets for patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease, informed by evidence from large-scale randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and their meta-analyses showing substantial reductions in cardiovascular risk with more intensive BP-lowering treatment, independent of baseline BP values. For most hypertensive patients, the lowered BP targets inevitably lead to a larger gap between their usual BP and the recommended target value, requiring more intensive pharmacological treatment.

Attributing changes to treatment based on repeated measures of BP of an individual patient can be unreliable since measurements are subject to random fluctuations, regression to the mean, non-pharmacological effects, and other sources of variability that can exceed true variability in treatment response. However, it would be useful to have reliable information about the expected effects of drug treatment on BP levels over time from randomised comparisons to help interpret BP readings, such as those obtained during clinical encounters. At the time of writing, randomised evidence on the effect of antihypertensive drugs on BP has come from efficacy trials with small numbers of highly selected participants and short follow-up durations. Pooled evidence from RCTs using information from individual participants' repeated BP measurements currently does not exist, which might explain why there is no guidance on the expected magnitudes of BP reduction with the various proposed treatment strategies and whether the…

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^112ZH7wi]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Exclude other causes of OH/nOH

If blood pressure and heart rate changes indicate OH/nOH, a complete history and physical examination, as well as electrocardiogram and laboratory testing, should focus on ruling out non-neurogenic causes of OH, including cardiogenic, vascular, or iatrogenic etiologies. Cardiac disorders (e.g. pacemakers, dysrhythmias, ablation, etc) can preclude heart rate augmentation; therefore, a cardiac history, an electrocardiogram, and medication review should consistently be performed. Due to variability among patients, including age, disease status, and medication usage, the absence of heart rate increase on standing may not always be an accurate indicator of nOH in patients with OH. It is essential that the clinical scenario and specific presentation are considered.

### Effects of blood pressure lowering on outcome incidence in hypertension: 2. Effects at different baseline and achieved blood pressure levels — overview and meta-analyses of randomized trials [^113FqzEG]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Relevant clinical questions not approached by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of blood pressure (BP)-lowering treatment can be explored by meta-analyses stratified by clinical criteria.

- **Objectives**: Investigating whether all grades of hypertension benefit from BP-lowering treatment and which are the target BP levels to maximize outcome reduction.

- **Methods**: Of the 68 RCTs of intentional and nonintentional BP-lowering, those without baseline antihypertensive drugs were stratified by the average baseline SBP and DBP (hypertension grades 1, 2, and 3). RCTs with or without baseline treatment were considered for investigating the effects of mean achieved SBP/DBP across three SBP cutoffs and two DBP cutoffs. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) (random-effects model), standardized to 10/5mmHg SBP/DBP reduction, and absolute risk reductions of seven fatal and nonfatal outcomes were calculated. Differences between relative and absolute risk reductions in the different strata of baseline or achieved SBP/DBP were evaluated by trend or heterogeneity analyses.

- **Results**: In 32 RCTs (104,359 individuals), significant outcome reductions were found independently of the hypertension grade, with no trend toward risk ratio changes with increasing baseline BP. A secondary analysis limited to RCTs on grade 1 hypertension at low-to-moderate risk showed significant outcome reductions [risk ratio: stroke 0.33 (0.11–0.98), coronary events 0.68 (0.48–0.95), and death 0.53 (0.35–0.80)]. In 32 RCTs (128,232 individuals), relative and absolute outcome reductions were significant.

### Orthostatic hypotension in hypertensive adults: Harry Goldblatt Award for early career investigators 2021 [^116gunid]. Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension affects roughly 10% of individuals with hypertension and is associated with several adverse health outcomes, including dementia, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and death. Among adults with hypertension, orthostatic hypotension has also been shown to predict patterns of blood pressure dysregulation that may not be appreciated in the office setting, including nocturnal nondipping. Individuals with uncontrolled hypertension are at particular risk of orthostatic hypotension and may meet diagnostic criteria for the condition with a smaller relative reduction in blood pressure compared with normotensive individuals. Antihypertensive medications are commonly de-prescribed to address orthostatic hypotension; however, this approach may worsen supine or seated hypertension, which may be an important driver of adverse events in this population.

There is significant variability between guidelines for the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension with regards to the timing and position of blood pressure measurements. Clinically relevant orthostatic hypotension may be missed when standing measurements are delayed or when taken following a seated rather than supine position. The treatment of orthostatic hypotension in patients with hypertension poses a significant management challenge for clinicians; however, recent evidence suggests that intensive blood pressure control may reduce the risk of orthostatic hypotension. A detailed characterization of blood pressure variability is essential to tailoring a treatment plan and can be accomplished using both in-office and out-of-office measurements.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^111jn2Ym]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

After screening to identify a patient as being at risk for orthostatic hypotension (OH), an accurate assessment of the underlying cause(s) is required to determine the appropriate treatment recommendation. A stepwise approach is recommended for the diagnosis of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH), specifically starting with the measurement of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate, followed by more detailed autonomic testing in select cases.

- **Blood pressure testing**: The hallmark test for OH is the measurement of change in blood pressure from supine, after at least 5 minutes of rest, to standing (or head-up tilt [HUT]). Guidelines define OH as a sustained fall of systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing (or HUT). However, in patients with supine hypertension (a supine systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg), a 30 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure or a 15-point fall in diastolic blood pressure may be a more appropriate criterion for patients with nOH, as the magnitude of blood pressure fall is dependent on the baseline blood pressure.

- **In-clinic monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate**: The recommended gold standard measurement of OH includes having patients rest in the supine position for at least 5 minutes and then stand for 3 minutes, with blood pressure measurements taken just prior to standing and at both 1-minute and 3-minute intervals post-standing.

### The incidence of cardiovascular instability in patients receiving various vasopressor strategies for peri-intubation hypotension [^113objHQ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Patients frequently experience hypotension in the peri-intubation period. This can be due to the underlying disease process, physiologic response to the intervention, or adverse effect from medications. With the heterogeneity in the cause of hypotension, the duration can also be short or prolonged. Initiation of vasopressors for peri-intubation hypotension includes various strategies using continuous infusion norepinephrine (NE) or push-dose phenylephrine (PDPE) to obtain goal mean arterial pressure. There is a paucity of data describing cardiovascular stability outcomes in patients receiving vasopressors for peri-intubation hypotension.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective cohort study including emergency department patients across three academic medical centers and smaller health system sites who received vasopressors for hypotension within 30 minutes of intubation. Patients were matched based on factors likely to influence vasopressor selection and were divided into groups if they received PDPE alone, continuous infusion NE alone, or PDPE followed by continuous infusion NE. The primary outcome was a composite of the incidence of hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg), bradycardia (HR < 60 beats per minute), and cardiac arrest within 2 hours following initiation of vasopressors.

- **Results**: Screening occurred for 2518 patients, with 105 patients undergoing matching. Mean time to vasopressor initiation was 10 minutes following intubation. The composite primary outcome was not statistically different between groups and occurred 88.6%, 80.0%, and 88.6% in the NE, PDPE, and…

### Combination non-pharmacologic intervention for orthostatic hypotension in older people: A phase 2 study [^1162bCra]. Age and Ageing (2020). Low credibility.

Baseline blood pressure (BP) was the average of the continuous BP values during the final 10 seconds of supine rest. An average BP was calculated for each 10 seconds of standing, with the lowest of these averages considered the nadir standing BP. The orthostatic drop was determined as the difference between the resting BP and the standing nadir BP.

An exact, single-stage phase 2 study design was employed. The study, based on the efficacy of the most efficacious single therapy (bolus water drinking at 56%), was powered to firstly reject interventions where response rates were ≤ 55% (i.e. no better than water alone) and secondly, consider an intervention superior if response rates were ≥ 75% (alpha 0.05, beta 0.8).

- **Statistical analysis**: Mean and standard deviation (SD) summarize normally distributed data, whereas the median with range is used for non-parametric data. Responses are described with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The paired t-test and Wilcoxon's signed rank test were used to compare secondary outcomes.

- **Approvals**: The study was approved by the UK National Research Ethics Service (Newcastle and North Tyneside 2; REC Reference 15/NE/0308). All participants provided written informed consent. Study registration ISRCTN15084870.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syncope, and more specifically with respect to orthostatic challenge (active standing), the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend considering the preference for continuous beat-to-beat noninvasive blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) measurement when short-lived BP variations are suspected, such as in initial orthostatic hypotension.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension [^1148paiZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

This is the first update of this review, initially published in 2009. When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors typically aim to achieve a specific target. This target represents the blood pressure value below which optimal clinical benefit is supposedly obtained. The "lower the better" approach, which had guided treatment for many years, was challenged over the last decade due to the lack of evidence from randomized trials supporting this strategy. Consequently, the standard blood pressure target in recent years has been set at less than 140/90 mm Hg for the general population with elevated blood pressure. However, new trials published recently have reintroduced the concept of aiming for lower blood pressure targets. Therefore, it is important to evaluate whether the benefits outweigh the harms when attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to determine if lower blood pressure targets (any target less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg) are associated with reductions in mortality and morbidity compared to standard blood pressure targets (less than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg) for treating patients with chronic arterial hypertension. The secondary objectives were to determine if there is a change in the mean achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) associated with "lower targets" as compared to "standard targets" in patients with chronic arterial hypertension, and to assess if there is a change in withdrawal rates.

### Orthostatic hypotension: A prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease [^116XRWvF]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

- **Assessment of orthostatic hypotension**: Blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were measured using an automatic recorder (Dinamap, Critikon). Baseline blood pressure was defined as the mean of two measurements on the upper right arm with the participant in the supine position after five minutes of rest. The measurements were repeated in a standing position after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 minutes. Orthostatic hypotension was measured once at baseline and was defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of at least 20 mm Hg or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of at least 10 mm Hg within three minutes after standing up from the supine position, in accordance with the consensus statement of the American Academy of Neurology.

- **Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension**: To define neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, we calculated the difference in HR and SBP in the supine position and after three minutes of standing. If the ratio between the difference in HR and SBP (ΔHR/ΔSBP) was lower than 0.5 in participants with orthostatic hypotension, we classified participants as having neurogenic orthostatic hypotension.

- **Exclusion of participants**: We excluded all participants with diabetes, cancer, renal failure (eGFR ≤ 15), and stroke as possible causes of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension.

- **Early and delayed orthostatic hypotension**: We studied early and delayed orthostatic hypotension, defined as orthostatic hypotension within one minute and between three and five minutes, respectively. Participants with orthostatic hypotension were divided into asymptomatic and symptomatic based on the question they were asked directly after the measurement whether they had felt unwell.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Alpha-adrenergic agonists as a class may impact blood pressure. Advise patients with cardiovascular disease, orthostatic hypotension, and/or uncontrolled hypertension or hypotension to seek medical care if their condition worsens. Use with caution in patients with cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, thromboangiitis obliterans, scleroderma, or Sjögren's syndrome and advise patients to seek medical care if signs and symptoms of potentiation of vascular insufficiency develop. Advise patients to seek immediate medical care if signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma develop.

- **Potential impacts on cardiovascular disease**: Alpha-adrenergic agonists may impact blood pressure. RHOFADE cream should be used with caution in patients with severe or unstable or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, orthostatic hypotension, and uncontrolled hypertension or hypotension. Advise patients with cardiovascular disease, orthostatic hypotension, and/or uncontrolled hypertension/hypotension to seek immediate medical care if their condition worsens.

- **Potentiation of vascular insufficiency**: RHOFADE cream should be used with caution in patients with cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, thromboangiitis obliterans, scleroderma, or Sjögren's syndrome. Advise patients to seek immediate medical care if signs and symptoms of potentiation of vascular insufficiency develop.

### Forteo [^114fcx6F]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Orthostatic hypotension**: FORTEO should be administered initially under circumstances in which the patient can sit or lie down if symptoms of orthostatic hypotension occur. In short-term clinical pharmacology studies of FORTEO in healthy volunteers, transient episodes of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension were observed in 5% of volunteers. Typically, these events began within 4 hours of dosing and resolved without treatment within a few minutes to a few hours. When transient orthostatic hypotension occurred, it happened within the first several doses, was relieved by placing the person in a reclining position, and did not preclude continued treatment.

- **Risk of digoxin toxicity**: Hypercalcemia may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity because FORTEO transiently increases serum calcium. Consider the potential onset of signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity when FORTEO is used in patients receiving digoxin [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Using data from nine randomized trials of over 30,000 participants, this individual-level meta-analysis shows that more intensive blood pressure treatment reduces the occurrence of orthostatic hypertension. Many of the included trials used first-line antihypertensive agents, suggesting that common approaches for seated hypertension may also be used to treat orthostatic hypertension. Although orthostatic hypertension is common among adults with hypertension, it may be treated using standard approaches recommended for seated hypertension.

### Hypotension during propofol sedation for colonoscopy: A retrospective exploratory analysis and meta-analysis [^111Nzz19]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). High credibility.

- **Editor's key points**:
	- Hypotension during procedural sedation is not well characterised. The authors aggregated individual patient data from five RCTs and a clinical database to explore this issue.
	- More than a third of subjects receiving propofol sedation suffered hypotension, with duration and magnitude comparable to those associated with harm during surgery.
	- Future research should attempt to confirm these findings with other data sources and to explore the relationship, if any, between hypotension and adverse outcomes.

Recently, intraoperative and postoperative hypotension have been identified as major correlates of adverse outcomes and a target for research and interventions. Gregory and colleagues commented, "We believe hypotension in the operating room is a serious public health issue, and should not be ignored in any age group. We suggest there is an urgent and currently unmet need for prospective interventional studies focused on its prevention". Brief (> 5 min) decreases from baseline of systolic BP by 41–50 mm Hg correlate with treble the odds of myocardial infarction. Five minutes with systolic BP < 90 mm Hg has been suggested as a threshold for associated myocardial and renal injury. Ten minutes or more with MAPs below 80 mm Hg is associated with increased mortality, and the risk increases with longer exposures and lower pressures.

### Safety of bolus-dose phenylephrine for hypotensive emergency department patients [^113skAbH]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Bolus-dose phenylephrine (BDPE) is routinely used to treat hypotension in the operating room. Its fast onset of action and ability to be administered peripherally have prompted calls for its use in the Emergency Department (ED). There are few published data on the safety of BDPE use in the ED. Primary concerns include BDPE's potential to cause dangerous hypertension or reflex bradycardia. We hypothesize that BDPE is a safe short-term vasopressor choice for hypotensive ED patients.

- **Methods**: We conducted a structured chart review for all patients who received BDPE from preloaded syringes over 42 months. We defined an adverse event (AE) as sBP > 180, dBP > 110, or HR < 60. We also classified any patient intervention required for complications as an AE.

- **Results**: Out of the cases reviewed, no patient experienced serious outcomes such as sBP > 180mmHg. The patients suffered no apparent harm. No patients had dBP > 110. Two patients developed bradycardia post-drug; in both cases, MAP improved despite bradycardia.

- **Conclusions**: BDPE does not appear to cause reflex bradycardia or hypertension requiring intervention among hypotensive ED patients. The apparent safety of BDPE should be confirmed in prospective trials.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^11547idc]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) is common in patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dementia with Lewy bodies, and peripheral neuropathies, including amyloid or diabetic neuropathy. Given the prevalence of nOH in the aging population, clinicians must be well informed about its diagnosis and management. At the time of writing, studies of nOH have used different outcome measures and various methods of diagnosis, thereby preventing the generation of evidence-based guidelines to direct clinicians towards 'best practices' when treating patients with nOH and associated supine hypertension.

To address these issues, the American Autonomic Society and the National Parkinson Foundation initiated a project to develop a statement of recommendations, beginning with a consensus panel meeting in Boston on November 7, 2015, with continued communications and contributions to the recommendations through October 2016. This paper summarizes the panel members' discussions held during the initial meeting, along with continued deliberations among the panel members, and provides essential recommendations based on the best available evidence, as well as expert opinion, for the:

- **Screening**: Clinicians should adopt standardized protocols to detect nOH in patients suspected of having the condition.
- **Diagnosis**: Diagnosis should be based on a comprehensive evaluation including medical history, symptom review, and measurement of blood pressure changes from lying down to standing.
- **Treatment of nOH**: Treatment options may include lifestyle modifications, pharmacologic therapies, and other interventions tailored to individual patient needs.
- **Diagnosis and treatment of associated supine hypertension**: Strategies should involve careful blood pressure monitoring and adjustment of treatment regimens to manage supine hypertension effectively.

These recommendations aim to provide clinicians with a foundation to advance the quality of care for individuals affected by nOH and associated conditions.

Defining supine hypertension in patients with nOH

According to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC8) hypertension guidelines, essential hypertension is defined as a blood pressure consistently ≥ 140/90 mmHg. Supine hypertension in nOH patients is arbitrarily defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg while in the supine position. General treatment guidelines recommend intervention for hypertension, but supine hypertension associated with nOH requires additional considerations.

In patients with autonomic failure causing nOH, supine hypertension is common and part of the underlying disease process, as these patients lack the normal blood pressure buffering mechanisms that offset hypertension. Additionally, frequent periods of OH may lead to chronic activation of the renin–angiotensin system. A supine systolic blood pressure of up to 160 mmHg should be monitored but does not generally warrant treatment, especially if the symptoms of nOH have improved. The long-term risks associated with supine hypertension need to be balanced with the short-term risks of OH.

Expert recommendations for the management of supine hypertension in the setting of nOH suggest that supine hypertension requires intervention if systolic blood pressure exceeds the range of 160–180 mmHg. However, it should be noted that individuals with the largest drops in blood pressure upon standing (> 80 mmHg drop) will require significantly higher supine blood pressures to achieve a standing position. Therefore, permissive supine hypertension may need to be considered.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope [^111h8M8F]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

The 2018 ESC guidelines address the screening and diagnosis of syncope, particularly focusing on diagnostic criteria for orthostatic hypotension-induced syncope. According to the guidelines, syncope due to orthostatic hypotension should be suspected when there is an asymptomatic fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from the baseline value by ≥ 20 mmHg or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by ≥ 10 mmHg. Additionally, a decrease in SBP to < 90 mmHg, accompanied by symptoms consistent with orthostatic hypotension noted in the patient's history, should prompt consideration of syncope due to orthostatic hypotension.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113VYy4o]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The American Autonomic Society and the National Parkinson Foundation jointly held an initial consensus panel meeting to address the issue of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) and associated supine hypertension. This meeting aimed to formulate essential recommendations into a working guideline for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of these conditions. Results of the discussions held during the meeting, along with continued deliberations among the panel participants, are presented here. Recommendations are provided for each of the topic areas.

Most patients with disorders typically associated with nOH are seen by cardiologists or neurologists, particularly movement disorder specialists. However, the first point of contact and the potential for identification of nOH often rest with primary care clinicians. Therefore, this consensus commentary is intended to provide guidance for all clinicians who might encounter and ultimately manage nOH.

### Lybalvi [^112vW2ym]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Orthostatic hypotension and syncope**: Atypical antipsychotics, such as Lybalvi, can cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. The risk is particularly high during initial dose titration and when increasing the dose. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled study analyzing vital signs data, the rates of orthostatic hypotension were less than 2% in patients treated with Lybalvi, placebo, or olanzapine. In a 24-week, olanzapine-controlled study, the rates of orthostatic hypotension in Lybalvi-treated patients were 3.7%, compared to 0.4% in olanzapine-treated patients. It is essential to monitor orthostatic vital signs in patients vulnerable to hypotension. This includes elderly patients, those with dehydration, hypovolemia, or concomitant treatment with antihypertensive medications or CNS depressants [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]. Patients with known cardiovascular disease — such as a history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities — and patients with cerebrovascular disease should also be monitored closely. Lybalvi has not been evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable cardiovascular disease, as such patients were excluded from the premarketing clinical trials.

- **Falls**: Antipsychotics, including Lybalvi, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, and motor and sensory instability, potentially leading to falls and consequent fractures or other injuries. For patients with underlying diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, it is crucial to conduct complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH), the SIH-SIG 2023 guidelines specifically recommend defining orthostatic headache based on the following criteria:

- **Absent or only mild**: (1–3 on verbal rating scale) on waking or after prolonged lying flat.
- **Onset within 2 hours**: of becoming upright.
- **Good improvement in severity**: (> 50% on verbal rating scale) within 2 hours after lying flat.
- **Consistent timing**: of onset and offset.

### Time point of blood pressure drop in patients with orthostatic hypotension in the emergency department [^115pi2N9]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to identify the time of blood pressure (BP) drop in the orthostatic hypotension test and to propose a realistic and appropriate duration for the test.

A total of 879 consecutive patients (average age 61 years, 44% women) with positive orthostatic hypotension tests in the emergency department were retrospectively reviewed. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a drop in standing systolic blood pressure (SBP) of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of at least 10 mmHg from their supine values after standing for 5 minutes. BP measurements were taken at 1, 3, and 5 minutes after standing.

- **Results**: Six hundred eighty-four (77.8%), 152 (17.3%), and 43 (4.9%) patients met the orthostatic hypotension criteria for BP drop at 1, 3, and 5 minutes, respectively. In multivariable analysis, older age (≥ 60 years) and higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (≥ 15.5 mg/dL) were independently associated with early BP drop at 1 minute. Younger age (< 40 years) was independently associated with a later BP drop at 5 minutes after controlling for potential confounders.

- **Conclusion**: To measure orthostatic BP for the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension in the emergency department, older patients (≥ 60 years) with high BUN (≥ 15.5 mg/dL) should be monitored carefully as BP can drop quickly within 1 minute. In contrast, in younger individuals (< 40 years), the BP drop occurred more slowly, after 3 minutes, suggesting that clinicians should measure BP for a longer duration.

### Orthostatic hypotension, cardiovascular outcomes, and adverse events: Results from SPRINT [^115WqAa5]. Hypertension (2020). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is frequently observed with hypertension treatment, but its contribution to adverse outcomes is unknown. The SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) was a randomized trial of adults aged ≥ 50 years at high risk for cardiovascular disease, with a seated systolic blood pressure (BP) of 130 to 180 mm Hg and a standing systolic BP ≥ 110 mm Hg. Participants were randomized to a systolic BP treatment goal of either < 120 or < 140 mm Hg. OH was defined as a drop in systolic BP ≥ 20 or diastolic BP ≥ 10 mm Hg one minute after standing from a seated position.

We used Cox models to examine the association of OH with cardiovascular disease or adverse study events by randomized BP goal. During the follow-up period (median 3 years), there were 1170 (5.7%) instances of OH among those assigned a standard BP goal and 1057 (5.0%) among those assigned the intensive BP goal. OH was not associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease events (primary outcome: hazard ratio 1.06 [95% CI, 0.78–1.44]). Moreover, OH was not associated with syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, injurious falls, or acute renal failure. However, OH was associated with hypotension-related hospitalizations or emergency department visits (hazard ratio 1.77 [95% CI, 1.11–2.82]) and bradycardia (hazard ratio 1.94 [95% CI, 1.19–3.15]), but these associations did not differ by BP treatment goal. OH was not associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease events, and the BP treatment goal had no effect on OH's association with hypotension and bradycardia. Symptomless OH during hypertension treatment remains significant for clinical outcomes.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^112y5Hrs]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertension, and more specifically with respect to office blood pressure (BP) measurement, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend assessing for orthostatic hypotension. This is defined as a drop of ≥ 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or ≥ 10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at 1 and/or 3 minutes after standing. This assessment should be performed at least at the initial diagnosis of elevated BP or hypertension (HTN) and thereafter if suggestive symptoms arise. The assessment should be conducted after the patient has been lying or sitting for 5 minutes.

### Orthostatic hypotension in an octogenarian — an unusual presentation [^1146vErx]. Age and Ageing (2005). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a common problem in older adults and can be associated with falls, dizziness, and syncope, along with their associated consequences. Therefore, it is important to recognize the condition and institute appropriate management. We report an elderly woman who presented with orthostatic hypotension and was found to have a rare, benign, yet potentially fatal condition.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^1156ADPY]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Syncope can have a variety of etiologies and may result in falls and associated injuries. It is defined as a sudden yet transient complete loss of consciousness in which the individual is unable to maintain postural tone, followed by rapid and spontaneous recovery.

Standing for 2 to 3 minutes is usually sufficient to observe the fall in blood pressure (BP) associated with syncope. However, in the case presented here, BP was measured after 5 minutes of standing. Determining the underlying cause of syncopal episodes is an important diagnostic step to appropriately guide management. A relatively common cause of syncope is orthostatic hypotension (OH), which is a drop in BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 10 mm Hg diastolic within a few minutes of standing.

- **Potential causes of syncope**: Neurogenic OH (nOH; that is, OH resulting from autonomic dysfunction) can be differentiated from non-neurogenic causes of OH (e.g. hypovolemia) clinically by autonomic function tests and by an insufficient compensatory heart rate (HR) increase on standing. Common clinical signs and symptoms of nOH include dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, and falls. Neurogenic OH is frequently comorbid with other disorders associated with autonomic dysfunction, including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dementia with Lewy bodies, and type 2 diabetes. Neurogenic OH increases the risk of falls, which in turn interfere with activities of daily living and increase the burden of symptoms for patients and their caregivers.

### Severe asymptomatic hypertension: Evaluation and treatment [^1126awxZ]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects one-third of Americans and is a significant modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, renal disease, and death. Severe asymptomatic hypertension is defined as severely elevated blood pressure (180 mm Hg or more systolic, or 110 mm Hg or more diastolic) without symptoms of acute target organ injury. The short-term risks of acute target organ injury and major adverse cardiovascular events are low in this population, whereas hypertensive emergencies manifest as acute target organ injury requiring immediate hospitalization. Individuals with severe asymptomatic hypertension often have preexisting poorly controlled hypertension and usually can be managed in the outpatient setting. Immediate diagnostic testing rarely alters short-term management, and blood pressure control is best achieved with initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive therapy. Aggressive lowering of blood pressure should be avoided, and the use of parenteral medications is not indicated. Recommendations are to gradually reduce blood pressure over several days to weeks. Patients with escalating blood pressure, manifestation of acute target organ injury, or lack of compliance with treatment should be considered for hospital admission.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113REeYF]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Appropriate testing of blood pressure may not identify all patients with orthostatic hypotension (OH), as variability in meals, hydration, time of day, and medications can influence the orthostatic change in blood pressure. Additionally, a subgroup of patients may exhibit symptoms of OH beyond the 3-minute interval. This condition is defined as delayed OH and may indicate early autonomic failure. Further discussion of this group is beyond the scope of this paper.

Upon standing from a supine or seated position, healthy individuals with normal volume typically experience a modest decline in systolic blood pressure, which is approximately 15 bpm within 3 minutes of standing. The heart rate information is acquired during the measurement of orthostatic vital signs as described. It is important to note that without a fall in blood pressure, the heart rate criteria for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) do not apply. Additionally, monitoring postural heart rate changes for diagnostic purposes requires appropriate parameters.

### Multidisciplinary consensus guideline for the diagnosis and management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^111RwECf]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

- **Guideline statements**:

	- **Q1: What key clinical features should lead to the diagnosis of SIH being considered?** SIH should be considered in any patient presenting with orthostatic headache (other than following iatrogenic dural puncture or major trauma); 'end of the day' or 'second half of the day' headache with improvement of the headache on lying flat; thunderclap headache followed by orthostatic headache; and new daily persistent headache with an initial orthostatic quality. The presence of associated symptoms should increase the suspicion of SIH.

		We recommend a working definition of orthostatic headache as a headache that meets the following criteria: absent or only mild (1–3/10 on verbal rating scale (VRS)) on waking or after prolonged lying flat; the onset of headache occurs within 2 hours of becoming upright; after lying flat, the headache should have a 'good' improvement in severity (> 50% on VRS) within 2 hours. The timing of headache onset and offset should be consistent.

	- **Q2: What differential diagnoses of SIH should be considered and how should the diagnoses be confirmed?** Differential diagnoses of SIH include postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS), orthostatic hypotension, cervicogenic headache, and migraine. PoTS and orthostatic hypotension are diagnosed from a detailed autonomic history and hemodynamic autonomic responses to formal standing tests to document objective evidence of postural tachycardia (increase in heart rate by > 30 beats per minute).

### Rexulti [^116TDEG4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics, such as Rexulti, cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. The risk is generally greatest during initial dose titration and when increasing the dose. In short-term, placebo-controlled clinical studies of Rexulti plus ADT in adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions in Rexulti plus ADT-treated patients compared to placebo plus ADT-treated patients included dizziness (2% versus 2%) and orthostatic hypotension (0.1% versus 0%).

In short-term, placebo-controlled clinical studies of Rexulti in adult patients with schizophrenia, the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions in Rexulti-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients included dizziness (2% versus 2%), orthostatic hypotension (0.4% versus 0.2%), and syncope (0.1% versus 0%).

In 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical studies of Rexulti in patients with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions in patients treated with Rexulti compared to those treated with placebo included dizziness (3% versus 3%), orthostatic hypotension (1% versus 1%), and syncope (0.2% versus 0.8%).

Orthostatic vital signs should be monitored in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension, such as elderly patients, those with dehydration, hypovolemia, or on concomitant antihypertensive medication, and patients with known cardiovascular disease (e.g. history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure).
