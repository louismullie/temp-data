## Question

What is the optimal timing of vancomycin administration in relation to hemodialysis sessions?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal timing of vancomycin administration in relation to hemodialysis sessions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetic impact of dialysis on vancomycin exposure. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines recommend for timing and dosing. Next, I will examine the evidence for intradialytic versus postdialytic strategies and quantify dialytic removal. After that, I need to consider special dialysis modalities like home hemodialysis and CRRT. Finally, I will integrate a practical, monitoring-driven approach and state a clear recommendation with caveats and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic foundation: vancomycin is a hydrophilic, moderately protein-bound glycopeptide with predominantly renal clearance, and in anuria the drug's elimination is dominated by non-renal pathways and extracorporeal clearance during dialysis, which is highly variable depending on membrane flux, blood and dialysate flows, and reuse practices, so timing relative to dialysis materially affects exposure and target attainment [^8c99d593] [^77845c45].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of dialytic removal before jumping to conclusions: contemporary high-flux hemodialysis removes roughly 20–40% of vancomycin per session, and administering the dose during dialysis increases intradialytic clearance, which is why larger maintenance doses are often needed if given intradialytically to offset this loss [^77845c45] [^c81f3638].

> I should confirm the guideline stance on timing. The 2020 ASHP/IDSA/SIDP consensus recommends administering vancomycin after hemodialysis to minimize dialytic removal and maintain therapeutic concentrations, with maintenance dosing aligned to each dialysis session and predialysis concentration monitoring to guide adjustments, which operationalizes a post-dialysis strategy as standard of care [^77845c45] [^04eb5525].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about intradialytic dosing being "wrong". I need to check whether intradialytic administration can still work if doses are adjusted upward. Indeed, protocols that give vancomycin during the final 60–90 minutes of dialysis with appropriately larger maintenance doses can maintain predialysis concentrations in many patients, but this approach requires higher doses and careful monitoring to avoid underexposure, and it is generally less efficient than post-dialysis dosing for achieving consistent targets [^4b6b3d68] [^c81f3638].

> Let me consider special dialysis modalities. In home hemodialysis with variable frequency and dialysate volumes, Monte Carlo simulations show that optimal regimens often require higher loading and maintenance doses and sometimes less frequent dosing to avoid accumulation, with pre-dialysis targets around 20–24 mg/L used to ensure AUC24 of 400–600 mg·h/L, underscoring that timing must be integrated with modality-specific PK and TDM rather than a one-size-fits-all rule [^fb63493f] [^d424a276] [^437d1a74].

> I should double-check the monitoring cadence and sampling timing because mis-timed levels mislead dosing. Predialysis concentrations should be measured at least weekly and not within 2 hours after dialysis due to rebound, and dose adjustments should be based on these predialysis values to keep concentrations in the 10–20 mg/L range, recognizing that in some HHD contexts a slightly higher pre-dialysis target may be needed to secure AUC goals [^04eb5525] [^bb4038ba] [^d424a276].

> But wait, what if the patient is on CRRT rather than intermittent HD. I need to ensure I don't conflate modalities: CRRT has continuous extracorporeal clearance and requires different loading and maintenance strategies, typically 20–25 mg/kg loading with 7.5–10 mg/kg every 12 hours, with early TDM to hit AUC/MIC targets, which is a different question than intermittent HD timing and should not be extrapolated to thrice-weekly schedules [^e7cdf8af] [^5f79e22d].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach: for standard thrice-weekly high-flux in-center HD, give a 20–25 mg/kg loading dose promptly when indicated, then administer 10–15 mg/kg after each dialysis session with predialysis level checks to titrate to 10–20 mg/L, increasing the Friday-to-Monday dose by about 25–30% to offset the longer interdialytic interval, while avoiding sampling within 2 hours post-dialysis and adjusting promptly if levels are subtherapeutic or supratherapeutic [^77845c45] [^5902af5e] [^bb4038ba].

> I should confirm the bottom line and state it clearly: the optimal timing is to administer vancomycin after hemodialysis, not during, to minimize dialytic removal and improve exposure consistency, with dosing individualized to dialysis modality, patient size, and TDM results, and intradialytic dosing reserved for operational constraints with larger, carefully monitored doses to compensate for predictable intradialytic losses [^77845c45] [^4b6b3d68] [^c81f3638].

---

Vancomycin should be given **after hemodialysis** to minimize dialytic removal and maintain therapeutic levels [^77845c45]. If a dose is missed, administer it as soon as possible after dialysis; if given during dialysis, expect 20–40% removal and adjust the dose accordingly [^c81f3638]. For home hemodialysis, tailor dosing to frequency and dialyzer characteristics, and use therapeutic drug monitoring to guide adjustments [^fb63493f] [^04eb5525].

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations

Vancomycin is a hydrophilic antibiotic with a volume of distribution approximating total body water and minimal protein binding, which facilitates dialytic removal [^8c99d593]. High-flux hemodialysis removes **20–40% of vancomycin per session**, depending on dialyzer characteristics and session length [^c81f3638] [^77845c45].

---

## Clinical evidence on timing

Multiple studies and guidelines consistently recommend administering vancomycin **after hemodialysis** to minimize dialytic removal and maintain therapeutic concentrations [^77845c45] [^4b6b3d68]. Intradialytic administration results in significant drug loss and subtherapeutic post-dialysis levels, increasing the risk of treatment failure and resistance [^c81f3638] [^8c99d593].

---

## Recommended dosing strategy

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended timing** | **Dosing strategy** |
|-|-|-|
| Standard high-flux hemodialysis | After dialysis | - Load: 20–25 mg/kg <br/> - Maintenance: 10–15 mg/kg after each dialysis session [^77845c45] [^8dcf3d89] |
| Home hemodialysis (variable frequency) | After dialysis | - Tailor to frequency and dialyzer characteristics <br/> - Use TDM to guide adjustments [^fb63493f] [^04eb5525] |
| Missed dose | As soon as possible after dialysis | Adjust based on pre-dialysis levels and clinical response [^04eb5525] |

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety

Administering vancomycin after dialysis improves the likelihood of maintaining therapeutic concentrations, reducing treatment failure and resistance risk [^77845c45]. It also minimizes accumulation and nephrotoxicity risk, although **monitoring is still essential** [^e6e69892].

---

## Special considerations

- **Home hemodialysis**: Dosing must be individualized based on dialysis frequency, duration, and dialyzer characteristics. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that higher doses may be needed for less frequent dialysis schedules [^fb63493f] [^909746cf].
- **Therapeutic drug monitoring**: Pre-dialysis levels should be monitored regularly, with target trough concentrations of 15–20 mg/L for serious infections [^04eb5525] [^77845c45].
- **Missed doses**: If a dose is missed, administer it as soon as possible after dialysis, and adjust subsequent dosing based on pre-dialysis levels [^04eb5525].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Administer vancomycin after hemodialysis** to minimize dialytic removal and maintain therapeutic levels [^77845c45].
- **Use weight-based dosing** with loading and maintenance doses tailored to dialysis schedule and patient factors [^8dcf3d89].
- **Monitor pre-dialysis levels** regularly and adjust dosing to maintain target concentrations [^04eb5525].
- **Individualize dosing for home hemodialysis** based on dialysis frequency, duration, and dialyzer characteristics [^fb63493f].

---

Vancomycin should be administered **after hemodialysis** to optimize exposure and outcomes, with dosing individualized and guided by therapeutic drug monitoring.

### Vancomycin dosing in patients on intermittent hemodialysis [^a536efe7]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Vancomycin has been a cornerstone antibiotic for the treatment of severe gram-positive infections in dialysis patients for decades. Whereas subtherapeutic vancomycin levels convey a risk of treatment failure and the further emergence of resistance in staphylococci, supratherapeutic vancomycin levels are associated with a dose-related incremental risk for nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Consequently, a narrow therapeutic range with a trough-level target between 15 and 20 μg/ml is recommended. Vancomycin dosing in hemodialysis patients is mainly influenced by the timing of administration (during or after dialysis), the type of filter used, and the duration of dialysis. Actual body weight, the interdialytic interval, and residual renal function are also considerations. As in patients with normal kidney function, a weight-based loading dose of 20–25 mg/kg should be used in dialysis patients. While most fixed-dose maintenance regimens fail to reach target levels in the majority of hemodialysis patients, straightforward evidence on optimal maintenance dosing is lacking.

Intermittent hemodialysis — vancomycin exposure targets and dosing frequency emphasize concentration- and AUC-based goals and intradialytic losses. Predialysis vancomycin concentration to MRSA MIC ratios of > 18.6 have been associated with improved bacteremia patient outcomes. Dosing to achieve predialysis concentrations of 10 to 20 mg/L results in a mean AUC24 ranging from 250 to 450 mg·h/L, and outcome studies validating the AUC24 goal of 400 to 600 mg·h/L used in other populations have not been conducted in the hemodialysis population, though this section aims to reach this AUC24 target (ie, 400–600 mg·h/L). For non-critically ill patients receiving hemodialysis, 2 or 3 days is the most common interdialytic period, and approximately 20% to 40% of an intradialytically administered dose is removed by simultaneous hemodialysis. Although the package insert states "In anuria, a dose of 1000 mg every 7 to 10 days has been recommended," far more frequent doses are needed to maintain therapeutic serum concentrations in patients receiving hemodialysis. Consequently, maintenance vancomycin doses are recommended to be administered with each hemodialysis session to ensure therapeutic serum concentrations throughout the dosing interval.

Hybrid hemodialysis dosing and monitoring — In patients receiving hybrid hemodialysis, loading doses of 20 to 25 mg/kg by actual body weight should be used, initial doses should not be delayed to wait for a dialysis treatment to end, and maintenance doses of 15 mg/kg should be given after hybrid hemodialysis ends or during the final 60 to 90 minutes of dialysis, as is done with standard hemodialysis (B-III); concentration monitoring should guide further maintenance doses.

### Initial vancomycin dosing protocol to achieve therapeutic serum concentrations in patients undergoing hemodialysis [^5be6248d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although recent consensus guidelines proposed more aggressive vancomycin troughs of > 10 or 15–20 mg/L for complicated Staphylococcus aureus infections, dosing information to achieve these targets in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) is scarce.

Methods

We used Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) methods with a previously published population-pharmacokinetic model and relevant patient demographics to evaluate and revise our existing vancomycin dosing protocol (1000-mg load followed by 500-mg maintenance dose, with doses infused during the last hour of dialysis). A new protocol (1000-mg load followed by 500-mg maintenance dose for patients < 70 kg, 1250-mg followed by 750-mg for those 70–100 kg, and 1500-mg followed by 1000-mg for those > 100 kg) was developed and prospectively validated to achieve therapeutic serum troughs in patients undergoing high-flux HD.

Results

MCSs predicted that our existing protocol would be suboptimal in more than one-third of patients. Simulations predicted that the new vancomycin dosing protocol would achieve maintenance (pre-HD) troughs of 10–20 mg/L in 86.0% of cases including 15–20 mg/L in 35.2%. In prospective validation, the observed postload trough (pre-HD session 2) was 13.5 ± 3.4 mg/L with 76.9% of levels (20 of 26) between 10 and 20 mg/L. The observed maintenance trough was 17.3 ± 4.0 mg/L with 65.5% (19 of 29) between 10 and 20 mg/L and 89.7% (26 of 29) within 10% of the upper limit (ie, 10–22 mg/L).

Conclusions

In this study, a practical vancomycin dosing protocol for patients undergoing HD was developed and prospectively validated to achieve therapeutic serum concentrations in the clinical setting.

Predialysis concentration targets and AUC relationship in hemodialysis — dosing to achieve predialysis vancomycin concentrations of 10 to 20 mg/L results in mean AUC0-24 values ranging from 250 to 563 mg·h/L, often below the AUC/MIC goals recommended in other populations.

### Vancomycin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics during short daily hemodialysis [^540266bb]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Short daily hemodialysis (SDHD) is an alternative to thrice-weekly HD because of its putative physiologic benefits. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of SDHD on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vancomycin.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Six noninfected adults who had anuria and were treated with SDHD were studied and received four dialysis sessions over 4 days. After completion of the first SDHD, each patient received vancomycin 15 mg/kg by intravenous infusion. Blood samples were collected over the ensuing 3 days during each subsequent inter- and intradialytic period. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined. Serum concentration-time profiles were simulated for four vancomycin regimens with maintenance doses administered after every other SDHD. Area under the serum-concentration time curve (AUC) from 0 to 48 hours, 48 to 96 hours, and 96 to 144 hours were calculated, and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine the probability of target attainment at an AUC/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio ≥ 800 for each 48-hour AUC at MICs ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 μg/ml.

Results

Median (range) systemic clearance was 7.2 ml/min (5.3 to 10.0 ml/min), and dialytic clearance was 104 ml/min (94 to 106 ml/min). The steady-state volume of distribution was 55.4 L (34.8 to 77.2 L). At MICs ≤ 1 μg/ml, probability of target attainment was > 90% for each 48-hour AUC when vancomycin was administered as a 20-mg/kg loading dose followed by 10 mg/kg after every other SDHD.

Conclusions

Vancomycin pharmacokinetic parameters in SDHD are consistent with data from thrice-weekly HD. A loading dose of 20 mg/kg followed by 10 mg/kg after every other SDHD provides adequate exposure for pathogens with MICs ≤ 1 μg/ml.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Vancomycin monitoring in intermittent hemodialysis — area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) guidance states that efficacy data are unavailable for AUC values of < 400 mg·h/L; monitoring based on predialysis serum concentrations and extrapolating these values to estimated AUC is most practical, maintaining predialysis concentrations between 15 and 20 mg/L to achieve the AUC of 400 to 600 mg·h/L in the previous 24 hours (C-III), and predialysis serum concentration monitoring should be performed not less than weekly and should drive subsequent dosing, with the recommended doses providing a useful starting point until serum concentrations have been determined (B-II).

### Vancomycin and daptomycin dosing recommendations in patients receiving home hemodialysis using monte carlo simulation [^909746cf]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

For vancomycin, HHD variables including the frequency, duration and dialysate flow rates influenced vancomycin exposure (AUC 24h) thereby altering the optimal dosing regimen with different HHD regimens, as shown in Tables 2 and 3. For example, 7-h HHD occurring 5 times a week (Mon-Tue-Wed-Thu-Fri) with Qd of 4.3 L/hr required 25 mg/kg LD, 5–5–5–7.5 mg/kg post-HHD to attain the PD target on each day for one week, while the same HHD with Qd of 8.6 L/hr necessitated 25 mg/kg LD, 5–5–5–10 mg/kg dosing to meet targets. The optimal vancomycin doses for 7-h HHD with Qd 4.3 L/hr was 25 mg/kg LD, 7.5 mg/kg post-HHD if occurring every other day, but 25 mg/kg LD, 5–5–5–7.5 mg/kg would be optimal if the same HHD session occurred 5 times a week (Mon-Tue-Wed-Thu-Fri), highlighting the impact of HHD frequency on required dosing regimens. In addition to efficacy/safety targets, practical dosing considerations were explored via MCS. For 3-h HHD with Qd 6.7 L/hr occurring 5 times a week, we determined that 25 mg/kg LD, 0–7.5–0–7.5 mg/kg post-HHD (ie. no dose given on Tue and Thur) would be better than 25 mg/kg LD, 5–5–5–7.5 mg/kg post-HHD (ie. 5–7.5 mg/kg given after each of all HHD sessions) because it reduced the dosing frequency with smaller total weekly doses while attaining the efficacy target with lower AUC 24h on each day compared to the latter regimen.

### Implementation of a dose calculator for vancomycin to achieve target trough levels of 15–20 microg / mL in persons undergoing hemodialysis [^db80f350]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

(See the article by Brown et al, on pages 164–166.)

Background

Vancomycin is a key antibiotic for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections in patients undergoing dialysis. Vancomycin has a narrow therapeutic range. Overdosing imposes a risk of nephro- and ototoxicity, wherease underdosing predisposes to treatment failure and the emergence of drug resistance. Trough levels of 15–20 μg/mL have been identified as the optimal target trough levels.

Methods

A multivariate model called the vancomycin dose calculator (VDC) was prospectively developed and validated to permit accurate vancomycin dosing in persons undergoing hemodialysis.

Results

The model identified 3 simple parameters that were responsible for 94.6% of the variance observed: predialysis vancomycin trough level, dry body weight, and period to the next dialysis session. Maintenance dosing was accurate in 77.9% of patients, whereas major over- and underdosing were avoided in the remaining patients. The mean measured trough level of 16.5 μg/mL was 5.6% lower than the mean predicted trough level of 17.5 μg/mL. With regard to loading doses, a fixed loading dose of 20 mg/kg led to subtherapeutic trough levels in one-half of patients.

Conclusions

The VDC permits accurate vancomycin maintenance dosing based on predialysis trough level, dry body weight, and period to the next dialysis session in the majority of patients undergoing hemodialysis. Higher loading doses that accounted for the period to the next dialysis may be more appropriate than fixed loading doses used in this study.

### Vancomycin and daptomycin dosing recommendations in patients receiving home hemodialysis using monte carlo simulation [^ee95525f]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Part I. Determination of optimal vancomycin and daptomycin dosing regimens

Tables 2 and 3 display PTA and predicted AUC 24h of simulated vancomycin dosing regimens in 10 different HHD settings. MCS analyses indicate that dialysis factors (ie. dialysate flow rate, dialysis treatment duration and interdialytic period) influenced the PTA of simulated vancomycin doses in HHD patients, necessitating different initial dosing regimens in different HHD settings. It is predicted that the vancomycin regimens consisting of a LD of 25 mg/kg post-HHD, followed by MD 5–10 mg/kg administered after each HHD would attain the desired PD target (AUC 24h ≥ 400 mg∙h/L) in ~ 90% of simulated patients on each day of the first week of vancomycin therapy with a mean AUC 24h of closest to 400–600 mg∙h/L. Notably, for 3-h HHD occurring 4 times per week (Mon-Tue-Thu-Fri) and 7-h HHD occurring 5 times per week (Mon-Tue-Wed-Thu-Fri), a 30–50% higher Friday MD was required to maintain sufficient drug exposure for 3-day interdialytic periods compared to a MD for 1–2-day interdialytic period. Five times per week 3-h HHD occurring (Mon-Tue-Wed-Thu-Fri) with a Qd of 6.7 L/hr or 10 L/hr resulted in lesser dialytic removal (13–17%) during each HHD session, allowing vancomycin administration to occur after HHD only on Mon, Wed and Fri.

### Vancomycin loading doses: a systematic review [^fc9c912d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically assess the literature to ascertain the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical efficacy and safety associated with administration of a vancomycin loading dose (LD).

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1948-December 31, 2014), EMBASE (1980-December 31, 2014), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-December 31, 2014), Google and Google Scholar, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched using the following terms: vancomycin, glycopeptides, loading dose, dose-response relationship.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and clinical efficacy studies using vancomycin LDs to achieve trough concentrations of 15 to 20 mg/L were included. Nonhuman, non-English, oral vancomycin, and dialysis patient studies were excluded. Abstracts were included. Study quality was ranked using US Preventative Services Task Force 1996 classification system. Data on study design, baseline characteristics, exclusion criteria, dosing, study outcomes, and conclusions were extracted.

Data Synthesis

A total of 8 studies (5 manuscripts [2 level I, 3 level II-3] and 3 abstracts) were cited. Of 6 adult studies, 4 concluded that administration of vancomycin LDs resulted in significantly more patients achieving troughs of 15 to 20 mg/L. Studies in children found that LDs did not lead to rapid attainment of vancomycin levels ≥ 15 mg/L. No studies assessed clinical or microbiological outcomes. Limitations included heterogeneity and inconsistent timing of concentration measurements.

Conclusions

High-quality data to guide the use of vancomycin LDs are lacking. LDs may more rapidly attain vancomycin troughs of 15 to 20 mg/L in adults, but information in pediatrics, obesity, and renal impairment is limited. Further studies are required to determine benefit of LDs on clinical and microbiological outcomes.

### Adequacy of a vancomycin dosing regimen in patients receiving high-flux hemodialysis [^c81f3638]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Some investigators have recommended the convenient practice of administering vancomycin doses during the last hour of the hemodialysis treatment. Accepting that a greater amount of vancomycin is lost to dialysis with this recent approach, the objective of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin and assess the adequacy of this dosing regimen in maintaining therapeutic predialysis concentrations.

Methods

A sampling of 22 consecutive patients administered intradialytic vancomycin, 1 g, intravenously (IV) and maintenance doses of 500 mg during the last hour of high-flux dialysis sessions was studied. A population-modeling program and Bayesian pharmacokinetic analysis were used to identify all global and unique pharmacokinetic parameters of interest based on measured vancomycin predialysis concentrations.

Results

For the 22 patients studied, this regimen achieved the targeted predialysis concentration range of 5 to 20 microg/mL for 96% of levels, whereas more narrowly within 5 to 15 microg/mL for 86% of levels. Average amount of vancomycin removed during a standardized 3- to 4-hour dialytic session ranged from 30% ± 7% to 38% ± 8%. Average elimination half-life of vancomycin on hemodialysis treatment was 5.4 hours (interquartile range, 5.0 to 5.9 hours). Patients showed an average predialysis plasma concentration of 11 ± 3 microg/mL for the first 7 days of therapy.

Conclusion

Our results indicate that intradialytic dosing with vancomycin using a 1-g IV load and 500 mg IV with subsequent high-flux dialysis sessions conveniently maintains adequate predialysis plasma concentrations. The lack of drug accumulation with this regimen provides convincing support for a limited blood sampling approach to plasma concentration determinations.

### Vancomycin [^deb203b6]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of vancomycin hydrochloride IV (also known as Vancocin) in patients with intermittent hemodialysis:

- Start at a dose of 0.5g. Maximal dose of 1g. Maximal frequency of q48-96h.
- Monitor serum concentrations.

### Exploring population pharmacokinetic models in patients treated with vancomycin during continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) [^40a5f158]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

For Regimen 4 (2 g loading, then 1.5 g at 12 h, then 24 hourly), the approximate probability of a level of 15 mg/L was > 80% at 12 h and 70–80% at 36 h. The approximate probability of a level of 20 mg/L < 20% at 12 and 36 h. Plots at 24 and 48 h were not applicable due to the dosing regimen.

The probability of a level of 25 mg/L was negligible at all investigated time points for each of the simulated dosage regimens.

As target vancomycin trough concentrations are 15–20 mg/L, the results suggest that a 2 g loading dose would be required to achieve adequate trough concentrations (> 15 mg/L) early in treatment. A maintenance dose of 750 mg 12 hourly results in a high probability of achieving at least 15 mg/L levels with approximately 20–30% of patients achieving a level of 20 mg/L and a very small percentage levels > 20 mg/L.

Additional file 1: Fig. S1 gives PTA plots for AUC/MIC of vancomycin at 24–48 h of treatment. This aligned with our advocated dose of 2 g vancomycin loading, followed by 750 mg 12 hourly, which resulted approximately in a 100% probability of attaining a target AUC of 400 mg/L * h for MIC 1 mg/L, in keeping with the recommended target AUC/MIC ratio for clinical efficacy from the guidelines. Additional file 1: Fig. S2 gives PTA plots for peak concentration after the 36 h dose, based on the timepoint (h) closest to when the peak would be measured in practice for each infusion. To mitigate risks of toxicity, it is recommended to avoid peaks in excess of 40 mg/L, and the simulated dosage regimens explored in the current work are not associated with a risk of toxic peak concentrations.

### Vancomycin dosing in patients on intermittent hemodialysis – A retrospective study [^6396ed6d]. Clinical Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine the incidence of therapeutic target attainment using a three-times per week protocol for vancomycin therapy given during the last hour of intermittent hemodialysis (HD).

Methods

A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted of patient medical records in a remote dialysis center from January 2017 to July 2023. Adult patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 on ≥ 3 months of intermittent HD who had received a course of vancomycin therapy with ≥ 1 serum vancomycin concentration recorded were included. Demographic and dosing data were collected. Clinician adherence with the dosing protocol and attainment of the therapeutic target (trough concentration within 15–20 mg/L) following the loading and maintenance doses were assessed. Factors associated with target nonattainment following the loading dose were analyzed, and the 48- and 72-h maintenance dosing intervals were analyzed for target nonattainment.

Findings

A total of 98 vancomycin courses (67 patients) were available for analysis. Only 38% of the loading doses were prescribed as per protocol. Following the loading dose, 25% of trough concentrations achieved the therapeutic target concentration (15–20 mg/L), 25% returned a supra-therapeutic concentration (> 20 mg/L) and 50% were sub-therapeutic (< 15 mg/L). When compared with those achieving target, sub-therapeutic concentrations were associated with a lower loading dose (median 16.6 vs 20.0 mg/kg, P < 0.002), and supra-therapeutic concentrations had a shorter dosing interval between the loading dose and first maintenance dose (median 31.5 vs 39.0 h, P = 0.06). Of the 201 maintenance trough concentrations collected, 65% were therapeutic, 21% were sub-therapeutic and 14% were supra-therapeutic, with an overall median trough concentration of 17.3 mg/L. As the treatment duration increased, an increase was seen in the number of dose adjustments required to achieve the target trough concentration. The 48-h dosing interval was associated with more supra-therapeutic concentrations and the 72-h interval was associated with more sub-therapeutic concentrations (df = 2, P = 0.022).

Implications

We have identified a high rate of target nonattainment for HD patients on a three times a week vancomycin dosing regimen. We recommend a loading dose of 20 to 25 mg/kg irrespective of the indication and a better-defined dosing interval after the loading dose. A higher maintenance dose should be prescribed when the time to next dialysis session is 72 h. Further pharmacokinetic studies are needed to assess factors influencing target concentration attainment following the maintenance doses and to determine an optimal dosing regimen.

### Vancomycin and daptomycin dosing recommendations in patients receiving home hemodialysis using monte carlo simulation [^fb63493f]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Few drug dosing recommendations for patients receiving home hemodialysis (HHD) have been published which has hindered the adoption of HHD. HHD regimens vary widely and differ considerably from conventional, thrice weekly, in-center hemodialysis in terms of treatment frequency, duration and blood and dialysate flow rates. Consequently, vancomycin and daptomycin clearances in HHD are also likely to be different, consequently HHD dosing regimens must be developed to ensure efficacy and minimize toxicity when these antibiotics are used. Many HHD regimens are used clinically, this study modeled ten common HHD regimens and determined optimal vancomycin and daptomycin dosing for each HHD regimen.

Methods

Monte Carlo simulations using pharmacokinetic data derived from the literature and demographic data from a large HHD program treating patients with end stage kidney disease were incorporated into a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model. Virtual vancomycin and daptomycin doses were administered post-HHD and drug exposures were determined in 5,000 virtual patients receiving ten different HHD regimens. Serum concentration monitoring with subsequent dose changes was incorporated into the vancomycin models. Pharmacodynamic target attainment rates were determined for each studied dose. The lowest possible doses that met predefined targets in virtual patients were chosen as optimal doses.

Results

HHD frequency, total dialysate volumes and HHD durations influenced drug exposure and led to different dosing regimens to meet targets. Antibiotic dosing regimens were identified that could meet targets for 3- and 7-h HHD regimens occurring every other day or 4–5 days/week. HHD regimens with 3-day interdialytic periods required higher doses prior to the 3-day period. The addition of vancomycin serum concentration monitoring allowed for calculation of necessary dosing changes which increased the number of virtual subjects meeting pharmacodynamic targets.

Conclusions

Doses of vancomycin and daptomycin that will meet desired pharmacodynamic targets in HHD are dependent on patient and HHD-specific factors. Doses used in conventional thrice weekly hemodialysis are unlikely to meet treatment goals. The antibiotic regimens paired with the HHD parameters studied in this analysis are likely to meet goals but require clinical validation.

### Vancomycin use in patients requiring hemodialysis: a literature review [^cd631cb2]. Seminars in Dialysis (2008). Low credibility.

Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, has remained a popular antimicrobial agent throughout the past five decades, and is often included in empiric antibiotic regimens. With gram-positive coverage, it has found a niche in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Although vancomycin has been in existence for many years, questions remain regarding its use. New technologies and practice pattern changes have occurred over the years that altered vancomycin dosing in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Examples of these changes include increased resistance of many organisms, development of high flux HD filters, and reprocessing practices. This review provides a summary of the several concerns that exist in the dosing of vancomycin in HD patients today, and provides a summary table of intradialytic dosing regimens.

### Recent changes in vancomycin use in renal failure [^cccea182]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is a key tool in the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections. A progressive increase in vancomycin resistance with consequent treatment failure has been observed in staphylococci. Therefore, new dosing guidelines advocating much higher vancomycin doses have been issued. Target trough levels of 15–20 microg/ml are proposed. Whether and how these targets can be achieved in patients with chronic kidney disease or those on dialysis are still under evaluation. The higher vancomycin doses to achieve these treatment targets carry a substantial risk for nephrotoxicity. This risk is incremental with higher trough levels and longer duration of vancomycin use. Critically ill patients, patients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic agents, and patients with already compromised renal function are particularly at risk for vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^8c99d593]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Appropriate dosing is especially problematic in patients receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT), whether by standard thrice‐weekly intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), 34 short daily IHD, 35 or continuous RRT (CRRT) in the ICU. 36 On the one hand, underdosing may foster resistance. In this regard, vancomycin‐resistant enterococci, vancomycin‐intermediate S. aureus (VISA), and vancomycin‐resistant S. aureus (VRSA) were all first isolated from hemodialysis patients. On the other hand, many patients receiving hemodialysis have significant residual renal function that contributes to their well‐being and should not be glibly sacrificed by overdosing.

Other factors besides residual renal function contribute to the variability of vancomycin pharmacokinetics during RRT. There may be a prolonged distribution phase, a rebound effect following termination of dialysis, and nonrenal clearance. 37 Using standard low‐flux dialysis membranes, there is minimal dialytic clearance, and once‐weekly dosing suffices. 34 Many patients, however, are now dialyzed on synthetic, high‐flux dialyzers using membranes that have a much larger pore size and do have significant vancomycin clearance. 38 These patients require supplemental doses following each dialysis. Vancomycin is often administered during the final hour of a dialysis session, which will result in additional clearance compared to pure postdialytic administration. Larger doses are required with this method of administration. In contrast, many patients are dialyzed on reused dialyzers, often up to 15 or more treatments. Such reprocessing results in reduced vancomycin clearance that could result in overdosing. 34 Finally, measurement of vancomycin levels with severe renal failure is problematic, depending on the method used. Inactive crystalline degradation products may accumulate and can be measured with the polyclonal fluorescence polarization immunoassay. 34

Various modalities of CRRT are available in the ICU setting, including continuous veno‐venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), hemofiltration (CVVHF), and hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). All use synthetic membranes, with significant vancomycin clearance determined primarily by the volume of effluent. 36 Clearances of 15–30 ml/min are possible with effluent volumes approaching 3,000 ml/h. A comprehensive discussion of the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin metabolism in various types of intermittent and continuous RRT is beyond the scope of this article. Suggestions for dosing with both IHD and continuous procedures are provided in Table 1.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) dosing and monitoring — For patients receiving CRRT at conventional, KDIGO-recommended effluent rates of 20 to 25 mL/kg/h, loading doses of 20 to 25 mg/kg by actual body weight should be used (B-III), and initial maintenance dosing for CRRT with effluent rates of 20 to 25 mL/kg/h should be 7.5 to 10 mg/kg every 12 hours (B-II). Maintenance dose and dosing interval should be based on serum concentration monitoring, which should be conducted within the first 24 hours to ensure AUC/MIC targets are met; in fluid overloaded patients, doses may be reduced as patients become euvolemic and Vd decreases, and the use of CI of vancomycin in patients receiving CRRT could be used in place of intermittent dosing especially when high CRRT ultrafiltrate/dialysate flow rates are employed (B-II).

### Exploring population pharmacokinetic models in patients treated with vancomycin during continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) [^b79d3ffc]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

In view of the challenges of antibiotic dosing in septic patients on renal replacement therapy and concerns around achieving optimal vancomycin concentrations in the context of increasing drug resistance, we undertook a PK analysis to support optimal therapeutic vancomycin dosing. Our aim was to develop a population PK model for intermittent infusion of vancomycin in critically ill patients receiving continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), to explore the influence of dialysis-related and selected patient covariates on the PK parameter estimates, and to use PTA plots to illustrate the trajectory of target vancomycin level attainment over time with different dosing regimens.

Probability of target attainment (PTA) plots

PTA plots were generated by performing Monte Carlo simulations (n = 1000) using the final (base) model. Four exploratory dosing regimens were considered for determination of initial therapeutic vancomycin dosing: 2 g loading dose followed by either 750 mg or 500 mg every 12 h, 2 g loading followed by 1.5 g at 12 h and then 1.5 g 24-hourly thereafter, or 1.5 g loading followed by 750 mg every 12 h. The investigated target was trough concentration every 12–24 h as relevant up to 48 h post-first-dose. Our unit vancomycin trough target range is 15–20 mg/L. We considered at least an 80% probability of achieving a trough of 15 mg/L from 12 h onwards to be clinically acceptable. To consider potentially toxic peak concentrations, PTA plots for peak concentrations of 20–40 mg/L after the 36 h dose were generated.

As an additional sensitivity analysis, we produced PTA plots for AUC/MIC (area under the curve/minimum inhibitory concentration) of vancomycin at 24–48 h treatment, given the recent change in guidelines which now recommends AUC-guided dosing and monitoring of vancomycin, though not yet adopted in our clinical practice.

### Determinants of vancomycin trough concentration in patients receiving continuous veno-venous hemodialysis [^21a1db45]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Vancomycin pharmacokinetics are altered in the critically ill and are further distorted by renal replacement therapy. Limited literature is available evaluating vancomycin dosing in continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD).

Objective

The goal of this analysis was to identify factors that affect vancomycin trough concentration in patients on CVVHD and to determine an appropriate dosing strategy.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study of adult inpatients admitted to the Cleveland Clinic from May 2016-December 2017. Patients in the intensive care unit who received ≥ 2 doses of vancomycin during CVVHD were included. Patients with interruptions of CVVHD inappropriately timed troughs, a change in dialysate rate, and those who received different vancomycin dosages were excluded. Multivariable linear regression including age, sex, weight, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, albumin, 24-hour urine output (UOP), dialysate rate, filter type, and vancomycin dose was run to determine predictors of vancomycin concentration.

Results

A total of 160 patients were included. The median vancomycin dose was 12.6 mg/kg with a trough of 24.6 mcg/mL. Weight, 24-hour UOP, vancomycin dose (mg/kg), and dialysate rate (mL/kg/h) were all determined to be independent predictors of vancomycin trough level. Patients who received < 10 mg/kg doses of vancomycin (N = 18) achieved a median trough of 21.5 mcg/mL, with 83% being therapuetic. In patients who received > 10mg/kg (N = 142), the median trough was 25.5 mcg/mL, with 47% being therapeutic.

Conclusion and Relevance

Vancomycin dose, dialysate rate, UOP, and weight are independently associated with vancomycin trough concentration. In CVVHD patients, vancomycin dosed at 10 mg/kg every 24 hours may be an appropriate recommendation.

### How I prescribe prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy [^fea2be02]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic and other medication dosing data in PIRRT are limited and, ideally, should be considered in conjunction with the input of a critical care or nephrology pharmacist. For medications cleared during RRT, augmented or additional dosing may be required. For example, intravenous vancomycin may need to be given immediately before and after a 10–12 h PIRRT session to ensure an adequate therapeutic level during and post-treatment. Table 2 provides additional details regarding dosing of selected antibiotics in patients receiving PIRRT, a topic that has been explored in greater detail by other reviews.

Table 2
Prescription of Selected Anti-infective Agents for Critically Ill Patients Receiving PIRRT

REFs, references; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; PIRRT, prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy; CRRT, continuous renal replacement therapy

*Suggested dosing is based on an assumption that PIRRT is provided as sustained low-efficiency dialysis using a dialyzer with a surface area of 0.7 m 2, Blood Flow Rate (Qb) of 200 ml/min, Dialyzate Flow Rate (Qd) of 300 ml/min and prescribed as 8-h sessions once daily. Dosing regimens should be adjusted according to the relative efficiency/clearance mode(s) of PIRRT being provided, residual kidney function and other standard dosing considerations (e.g. patient weight, volume of distribution, etc.). A more detailed summary of anti-infective dosing studies across various forms of PIRRT can be found in other reviews. We suggest that all anti-infective agents for critically ill patients receiving PIRRT are prescribed in conjunction with a critical care pharmacist and guided by directly measured levels, whenever possible

Dose/adequacy

Unlike dosing recommendations for CRRT and IHD (based on RENAL and ATN trials), there is no standard recommendation for dosing of PIRRT. Despite significant pitfalls in its use, urea kinetics remain the mainstay of determining adequacy of clearance during RRT, even in AKI. When prescribing PIRRT as a substitute for CRRT, a minimum weekly standard Kt/Vurea of 6 may be required. If using as a substitute for IHD or as a transition therapy, then lower flow rates or decreased frequency of treatments may suffice, as weekly standard Kt/Vurea recommendations for IHD is 2. It should be noted that volume overload is also an indication for RRT and frequency of PIRRT treatments ultimately will also depend on volume status and metabolic derangements such as hyperkalemia.

### Vancomycin and daptomycin dosing recommendations in patients receiving home hemodialysis using monte carlo simulation [^d03d9e4f]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first in silico study to determine the optimal initial dosing recommendations of vancomycin and daptomycin in patients receiving HHD in various dialysis regimens. The MCS techniques enabled us to assess the PTA of various vancomycin and daptomycin dosing regimens in each of ten different HHD settings and to predict the ones that are likely to attain the therapeutic targets in most patients. As expected, optimal vancomycin and daptomycin dosing regimens for HHD (Table 4) would differ from usual doses recommended for thrice weekly high-flux IHD (25 mg/kg LD, 10 mg/kg MD post-dialysis for vancomycin and 4–6 mg/kg post-dialysis for daptomycin).

### Factors associated with serum concentrations of vancomycin crystalline degradation product (CDP-1) among patients with chronic kidney disease [^2644fd5f]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

The G3 group demonstrated the highest mean trough CDP-1 concentration among all study groups. We hypothesize that this phenomenon may be attributable not only to prolonged vancomycin exposure but also to elevated serum vancomycin concentrations (mean 32.63 μg/mL) observed in the G3 group. However, it should be noted that the mean trough vancomycin concentration in the G3 group was nearly twice as high as the previously recommended trough range of 10–20 μg/mL. These results suggest that increasing the monitoring frequency of vancomycin may be beneficial for achieving optimal vancomycin exposure. If vancomycin exposure is managed early within an appropriate range, the effect of CDP-1 could be negligible in clinical decision-making regardless of renal function.

The time interval from the initial dose to the trough level was also selected as a significant factor associated with the CDP-1 concentration. On the basis of this result, we assumed that the time interval would account for the difference in overestimation observed in previous studies. For patients with CKD, the initial vancomycin trough level is recommended to be started after 72 hours of vancomycin therapy since the time to achieve a steady-state trough level is delayed compared with that in patients with normal renal function. On the other hand, the delayed timing of trough level sampling could contribute to increased CDP-1 levels and overestimation of vancomycin levels. Therefore, developing a precise strategy for the timing of vancomycin TDM in patients with CKD is necessary.

### What proportion of vancomycin trough levels are drawn too early? frequency and impact on clinical actions [^2f7f4069]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Vancomycin trough levels are recommended to predict vancomycin efficacy, and inaccurate levels may lead to inappropriate clinical actions. However, the frequency of timing errors and associated clinical impact is unknown. We retrospectively analyzed vancomycin levels (n = 2,597) measured during 13 months at a large academic medical center. Of the specimens, 41.3% were drawn too early. These samples yielded significantly higher average ± SD vancomycin concentrations than correctly timed samples (22.1 ± 11.7 mg/L vs 15.5 mg/L ± 8.6 mg/L; P < .001), and, consequently, clinicians were more likely to decrease, discontinue, or hold a patient's vancomycin dose (25.6% vs 21.4%; P < .02) or repeat the vancomycin level (29.2% vs 20.0%; P < .001). A substantial proportion of specimens collected to assess vancomycin efficacy were drawn too early, leading to overestimation of patients' true trough level and possible underdosing of vancomycin or a high rate of repeat tests for vancomycin.

Part II. Development of vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring strategy in patients with HHD

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is routinely performed for vancomycin therapy. Previously, we developed a technique to integrate TDM and subsequent vancomycin dose individualization into virtual patients receiving different types of renal replacement therapy. Using this technique, we modeled how TDM can be effectively utilized for HHD patients and attempted to develop a practical vancomycin dose adjustment protocol to guide clinicians. In the simulation, TDM in HHD patients used a single pre-dialysis concentration based on the current guideline recommendations and the initial vancomycin doses were adjusted to attain and/or maintain AUC 24h of 400–600 mg∙h/L.

The nomogram for dose adjustment protocol was developed based on the predicted vancomycin concentrations in virtual patients with HHD receiving one week of vancomycin dosing regimens recommended from Part I. A single pre-dialysis vancomycin concentration measured immediately prior to the last HHD session of the first week was used as the basis of TDM. The subsequent dose targeting to attain and/or maintain AUC 24h of 400–600 mg∙h/L were given after the first HHD of the second week. For example, in a setting where HHD occurs 5 times per week (Mon-Tue-Wed-Thu-Fri), a pre-dialysis concentration was measured prior to HHD session on Friday of the first week of vancomycin therapy, and the adjusted dose was given after the first HHD session of the following week. The decision to adjust the first dose of the next Monday was made for practical reasons. Patients receiving HHD at home would be unlikely to receive TDM results in a timely enough manner to adjust doses any faster. The virtual vancomycin assay results were assumed to be accurate and reflect the model-derived concentrations at that time point. Using the predicted pre-dialysis concentrations and pharmacokinetic profiles selected in the simulation of Part I, the second week of vancomycin concentrations with the adjusted dose was further constructed to estimate AUC 24h in each of 5,000 virtual patients. Finally, the equation was derived to individualize a subsequent dose achieving AUC 24h of 400–600 mg∙h/L in most patients.

### Vancomycin and daptomycin dosing recommendations in patients receiving home hemodialysis using monte carlo simulation [^ca7f9217]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

This study has several limitations to consider before clinicians apply the findings from the MCS analysis in practice. First, pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations were performed based on the assumption that patients are > 40 kg adults receiving HHD and were anuric. It was also assumed that no changes in pharmacokinetic parameters and HHD regimen occurred during the modeled period. Virtual patients were constructed based on demographic information from ESKD patients receiving HHD and pharmacokinetic characteristics with variances from the published studies conducted in ESKD patients receiving dialysis. It should be noted that we did not model all possible HHD scenarios, but only in ten common HHD Qd and treatment durations within a fixed schedule where antibiotic doses are initiated on Monday after HHD. Hence, our model-recommended doses should be applied to only anuric patients with similar demographic characteristics and HHD scenarios. If vancomycin therapy is initialed on Friday, we would recommend a 30% higher LD with a maximum dose of 3,000 mg for a 3-day interdialytic period. The recommended initial MD can be given for the following week and TDM can be performed on Friday of that same following week to determine the subsequent MD attaining the target for an individual patient. In contrast, daptomycin therapy started on Friday in patients receiving asymmetric HHD, 4 mg/kg dose can be given after HHD on Friday with a supplemental dose of 2 mg/kg on Sunday. Thereafter our model-recommended daptomycin doses can be followed for the following week. Secondly, we modeled vancomycin infusion rates to be 1 h for the doses ≤ 10 mg/kg, 2 h for the doses > 10 mg/kg and ≤ 20 mg/kg, and 3 h for the doses > 20 mg/kg with max doses of 3 g and 2 g for LD and MD respectively. This would result in faster infusion rates than typical practice (e.g. 1 g over 1 h or 2 g over 2 h) in larger virtual patients (ie. body weight > 100 kg). However, such standardization was necessary to simulate each vancomycin dosing in 5,000 patients simultaneously. Third, we primarily used the "efficacy" target (AUC 24h ≥ 400 mg∙h/L assuming the MRSA MIC of 1 mg/L) to select initial vancomycin dosing recommendation and the target pre-dialysis concentration for TDM. However, these selected doses and the target pre-dialysis concentration resulted in high drug exposure exceeding the toxicity threshold (AUC 24h ≥ 600 mg∙h/L) in some virtual patients. Vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity may be less of concern, but potentially increased risk of other vancomycin toxicity including ototoxicity should be noted. Thus, prior to the application of our model-recommended initial vancomycin dose, we recommend clinicians consider patient's body weight, HHD setting and clinical status to weigh the benefit vs. toxicity risk. TDM should be performed to further optimize individual patient's subsequent vancomycin dose. Finally, daptomycin dosing regimens were simulated only for 1 week to determine optimal dose in each of ten HHD settings in this present study. However, HHD patients may receive more than one week of daptomycin therapy. As patients continue our recommended initial daptomycin doses, drug accumulation may occur in some patients. Unfortunately, TDM with daptomycin therapy is not commonly available. Thus, we strongly recommend clinicians monitor CPK at least once a week to assess the increased risk of muscle toxicity, as well as the related symptoms such as myopathy or weakness of the extremities.

### Attainment of therapeutic vancomycin level within the first 24 h: authors' response [^a8aaa8bf]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

In sepsis, time is life. However, time is not the only variable of the complex equation of antibiotic therapy; the dose of antibiotic administered needs to be adequate. Subtherapeutic antibiotic concentrations potentially lead to decreased microbial killing, treatment failure, and emergence of resistance and/or increased mortality. Early therapeutic drug monitoring and timely dose optimization, ideally during the first 24 h, minimize the likelihood of subtherapeutic antibiotic concentrations and ineffective antibiotic therapy. Vancomycin remains a first-line option for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and other resistant Gram-positive bacteria. Of note, vancomycin is one of the antibiotics with the highest likelihood of under dosing. Continuous infusion (CI), after adequate loading dose (LD), seems to have pharmacological advantages in the critically ill and enables more consistent achievement of therapeutic exposures.

Conclusions

Our protocol seems to allow a rapid achievement of a target VSC particularly in patients with kidney dysfunction. In order to avoid subtherapeutic VSC, our algorithm should be implemented by the estimation of ARC, the presence of which implies an adjustment of the dose of vancomicyn, both in terms of loading and continuous infusion dose.

### Vancomycin and daptomycin dosing recommendations in patients receiving home hemodialysis using monte carlo simulation [^d424a276]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

This present study also used the previously developed "virtual TDM" technique to mimic the clinical situation and further guide the subsequent dosing for clinicians. The MCS analysis indicated that targeting pre-dialysis concentrations of 20–24 mg/L after one week of our recommended initial regimens would attain and/maintain an AUC 24h ≥ 400 mg∙h/L for the following week in most simulated patients with 10 different HHD (Fig. 3). Thus, virtual TDM was designed to target a pre-dialysis concentration of 24 mg/L to ensure the target attainment in virtual patients with all simulated HHD settings. This pre-dialysis concentration target may result in a slightly higher new MD than necessary in some HHD settings. For example, the adjusted MD after TDM using this target pre-dialysis concentration in 3-h HHD occurring 5 times a week resulted in the target (AUC 24h ≥ 400 mg∙h/L) attainment in almost all virtual patients, but a higher proportion of patients had AUC 24h ≥ 600 mg∙h/L. However, this pre-dialysis concentration of 24 mg/L was found to be the best predictor for attaining targets in all simulated HHD settings. This target pre-dialysis concentration of 24 mg/L is also higher than those (15–20 mg/L) recommended in patients receiving thrice weekly IHD in the vancomycin consensus guidelines. Of note, this guideline recommendation is based on another MCS study showing that pre-dialysis vancomycin concentrations of 10–20 mg/L would results in mean AUC 24h from 250 to 450 mg·h/L in patients receiving thrice IHD. The mean new TDM-based vancomycin MD in all HHD settings were not significantly different from the model-recommended initial MD in each HHD setting, but some virtual patients are predicted to need a new MD that was different from the initial dose to attain the target (Fig. 3). Based on these findings, we recommend weekly TDM to ensure all HHD patients to receive the optimal doses during prolonged vancomycin therapy. Any change in patient's clinical condition and/or HHD modification also warrant TDM to ensure target attainment in these patients.

### Assessment of vancomycin use in chronic haemodialysis patients: room for improvement [^3dd09940]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Vancomycin is frequently prescribed for the management of infections in haemodialysis patients. We evaluated the appropriateness of vancomycin use in our chronic haemodialysis population.

Methods

Charts of all chronic haemodialysis patients who received vancomycin between 1 March 2003 and 1 March 2004 were retrospectively reviewed. Indication was assessed according to the modified Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee guidelines for vancomycin prescription. The prescribed dosing regimens were evaluated.

Results

A total of 163 courses of vancomycin in 105 patients were assessed. Of all courses, 88% were considered to be initially appropriate, but this decreased to 63% once culture and sensitivity results were available. Use of vancomycin for the management of beta-lactam-sensitive organisms accounted for the majority of inappropriate use. The most common vancomycin-dosing regimen prescribed was 500 mg intravenously at each haemodialysis session (51%); however, considerable variability was observed.

Conclusions

Although the initial indication for vancomycin use was generally appropriate, inappropriate continuation of this antibiotic, failure to obtain proper cultures to guide therapy and potentially subtherapeutic dosing regimens were some of the challenges identified. Centres providing chronic haemodialysis should take steps to optimize vancomycin prescription to improve clinical outcomes and reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance.

Probability of target attainment plots

The PTA plots are presented in Fig. 2. Plots were generated for 48 h post-first dose as it is considered that after this time dosing would be guided by TDM.

For Regimen 1 (2 g loading then 750 mg every 12 h), the approximate probability of a level of 15 mg/L was > 80% at 12 h, > 90% at 24, 36 and 48 h. The approximate probability of a level of 20 mg/L was < 20% at 12 h, 20–30% at 24 h and 36 h and 40% at 48 h.

For Regimen 2 (2 g loading then 500 mg every 12 h), the approximate probability of a level of 15 mg/L was > 80% at 12 h, 70–80% at 24 h, 50% at 36 h and 40% at 48 h. The approximate probability of a level of 20 mg/L was < 20% at 12 h, and < 10% at 24, 36 and 48 h.

For Regimen 3 (1.5 g loading then 750 mg every 12 h) the approximate probability of a level of 15 mg/L was 10–20% at 12 h, 50% at 24 h, 70% at 36 h and > 80% at 48 h. The approximate probability of a level of 20 mg/L was negligible at 12 and 24 h, and 10% at 36 h and 20% at 48 h.

### Exploring population pharmacokinetic models in patients treated with vancomycin during continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) [^7730b17a]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

As target concentrations are 15–20 mg/L, our PTA plots suggest that a 2 g loading dose would be required to achieve adequate trough concentrations (> 15 mg/L) early in treatment. The unit policy of a 25 mg/kg loading dose would result in a patient of average body weight in this cohort (82 kg) receiving a dose of approximately 2 g. This suggests that patients below average body weight might be inadequately loaded. Although there may be clinical reticence to prescribe substantial vancomycin doses to patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) on CRRT, the average trough concentration of 15.7 mg/L noted in Table 2 suggests that there is scope to revisit the loading doses used in this cohort. Given that many patients receive the first vancomycin dose prior to entering ICU, with 18/24 (75%) patients in our study commencing vancomycin treatment prior to CVVHDF, these results suggest a need to focus on adequate loading doses to ensure therapeutic concentrations are achieved. The PTA plots suggest that a maintenance dose of 750 mg commencing 12 h post dose results in a high probability of achieving at least 15 mg/L pre-dose levels but is also associated with a higher probability of achieving potentially undesirably high concentrations, with approximately 20–30% of patients predicted to achieve concentrations of 20 mg/L. Notwithstanding this, the proportion of patients with predicted concentrations of 25 mg/L is low when using this high dose. Use of a 500 mg 12 hourly maintenance dose could be considered in instances where there is a toxicity concern; though the model predicts decreasing proportions will have successful concentrations with this maintenance dose from 12 to 48 h, despite the initial loading dose.

### Attainment of therapeutic vancomycin level within the first 24 h: authors' response [^8c934be0]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

A nomogram for dosing vancomycin can be easily used at the bedside of the patient, providing rapidly personalized dosing. One of the key factors facilitating the nomogram is the fact that renal clearance of vancomycin is strongly correlated with the measured urinary creatinine clearance (CL CR). Unfortunately, it is more common in clinical practice to use the less accurate mathematical estimates of renal function in unstable patients, instead of measured CL CR. Such an approach serves to compromise the reliability of the nomogram in the critical care setting.

We appreciate and read with interest the comments of Honoré et al. regarding our study in 2014, where we developed and validated a dosing nomogram for vancomycin in CI in a population of critically ill patients. Some clarifications, however, are needed. First, we never intended to compare CI with a LD of vancomycin; instead, we used, sequentially, LD (between 1 and 1.5 g) followed by CI (30 mg/kg/day). Later, with nomogram-guided dosing using an 8 h-CL CR, we achieved target vancomycin exposures in 84% of patients in the validation group in the first 24 h. Of these, 40% had demonstrated augmented renal clearance (8 h-CL CR > 130 mL/min/1.73m 2). Secondly, patients with compromised renal function or needing of renal replacement therapy were excluded in our study, meaning that our nomogram should not be considered applicable to this group of patients. Third, the volume of distribution and the half-life of vancomycin increases significantly in critically ill patients with renal insufficiency. On the other hand, vancomycin (medium molecular size molecule) is effectively cleared by continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT). Considering the large inter-study variability, there is no clear recommendation about the optimal vancomycin regimen during CRRT. A vancomycin loading dose of 15–20 mg/kg actual body weight would likely be more appropriate in CRRT patients. Finally, future studies confirming our dosing protocol are welcome; however, the chosen target population should be similar (with exclusion of patients under CRRT) so that the obtained results can be extrapolated to different contexts.

### Attainment of therapeutic vancomycin level within the first 24 H [^fd3a95ac]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Attaining adequate vancomycin levels among critically ill patients is an important issue. The early achievement of this target potentially avoids therapy failure, the emergence of multiresistant bacterial strains, and even possibly increased mortality. The primary goal of the study by Batista and colleagues, who used a creatinine clearance (ClCr)-based nomogram, was reaching the vancomycin target level with continuous infusion (CI) strategy. The authors reported no additional risk of nephrotoxicity and found CI to be superior to a loading dose of 35 mg/kg. Augmented renal clearance (ARC; creatinine clearance > 130 ml/min) was present in 40% of critically ill patients without acute kidney injury. The target vancomycin level of 20–30 mg/L at 24 h was achieved in 84% of patients. Cristillini et al. in a cohort with a 21% incidence of ARC, used a loading dose of 35 mg/kg in 4 h and achieved the same target vancomycin (at 24 h) trough levels in 54% of the patients. Vancomycin dosing during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is challenging and yet very important. Beumier et al. described that a 35-mg/kg loading dose during CRRT allows therapeutic vancomycin target level attainment in 63% of patients within 24 h. Unfortunately, dosing nomogram proposed by Batista et al. has not been assessed in patients treated with RRT. At this point, considering the lack of data, the loading vancomycin dose of 35 mg/kg remains the gold standard in CRRT patients. As there is a critical need to ascertain the most effective strategy to attain vancomycin therapeutic trough levels in patients treated with CRRT, future studies need to compare Batista et al. dosing protocol with the current standard of care.

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of vancomycin and meropenem in critically ill patients receiving sustained low-efficiency dialysis [^f442f867]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Antibiotic dosing is challenge in critically ill patients undergoing renal replacement therapy. Our aim was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) characteristics of meropenem and vancomycin in patients undergoing SLED.

Methods

Consecutive ICU patients undergoing SLED and receiving meropenem and/or vancomycin were prospectively evaluated. Serial blood samples were collected before, during, and at the end of SLED sessions. Antimicrobial concentrations were determined using a validated HPLC method. Noncompartmental PK analysis was performed. AUC was determined for vancomycin. For meropenem, time above MIC was calculated.

Findings

A total of 24 patients receiving vancomycin and 21 receiving meropenem were included; 170 plasma samples were obtained. Median serum vancomycin and meropenem concentrations before SLED were 24.5 and 28.0 μg/mL, respectively; after SLED, 14 and 6 μg/mL. Mean removal was 42% with vancomycin and 78% with meropenem. With vancomycin, 19 (83%), 16 (70%), and 15 (65%) patients would have achieved the target (AUC 0–24 > 400) considering MICs of 1, 2, and 4 mg/L, respectively. With meropenem, 17 (85%), 14 (70%), and 10 (50%) patients would have achieved the target (100% of time above MIC) if infected with isolates with MICs of 1, 4, and 8 mg/L, respectively.

Implications

SLED clearances of meropenem and vancomycin were 3-fold higher than the clearance described by continuous methods. Despite this finding, overall high PK/PD target attainments were obtained, except for at higher MICs. We suggest a maintenance dose of 1 g TID or BID of meropenem. With vancomycin, a more individualized approach using therapeutic drug monitoring should be used, as commercial assays are available.

### Vancomycin and daptomycin dosing recommendations in patients receiving home hemodialysis using monte carlo simulation [^48b520fc]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Recently, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services launched the Advancing American Kidney Health initiative to improve care for patients with kidney disease and set a goal to significantly increase access and uptake of HHD for ESKD patients. HHD presents an opportunity to reach more ESKD patients to receive dialysis treatment, but several barriers exist preventing its wide utilization. One of them is lack of drug dosing information for HHD patients. HHD regimens vary in frequency, duration and dialysate volume from patient to patient and all differ from thrice-weekly in-center hemodialysis treatments. Thus, optimal dosing of dialyzable drugs for HHD patients may differ from the dosing used in thrice-weekly in-center hemodialysis patients.

Infection remains the second leading cause of morbidity and mortality in ESKD patients. Vancomycin and daptomycin are two most commonly prescribed antibiotic agents to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in outpatient dialysis centers. The pharmacokinetics of vancomycin and daptomycin have been well characterized in ESKD patients receiving typical thrice-weekly intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), and both agents are cleared by high-flux dialyzers. No regulatory authorities mandate conducting clinical pharmacokinetic trials of marketed drugs in HHD patients. FDA guidance recommends that pharmacokinetics of drugs be investigated in ESKD patients receiving dialysis, but it primarily refers to thrice-weekly IHD, the most common dialysis modality in the U.S. Few clinical pharmacokinetic studies of commonly used antibiotics in HHD have been conducted. In lieu of such trials, modeling and simulation can predict the influence of HHD on drug exposure and support clinical dosing decisions. The purpose of the present study was to predict the optimal initial vancomycin and daptomycin dosing regimens in patients receiving common HHD settings using pharmacokinetic modeling and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Additionally, this study attempted to develop a therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) strategy to further individualize the subsequent vancomycin regimens in HHD patients because vancomycin serum concentration monitoring is readily available.

### Intradialytic administration of daptomycin in end stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis [^b511ee2d]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Infusion of intravenous antibiotics after hemodialysis (HD) may delay initiation of treatment for the next HD shift. Intradialytic administration of drugs such as vancomycin during the final hour of HD obviates these delays. Daptomycin has potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria, but the manufacturer recommends that the dose be infused after HD ends. This study determined the pharmacokinetics of intradialytically dosed daptomycin in patients with ESRD.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This prospective crossover study compared single-dose daptomycin (6 mg/kg, 30-min intravenous infusion) pharmacokinetics administered after HD versus during the last part of HD with high-permeability (HP) and low-permeability (LP) dialyzers to seven patients who had ESRD and were on thrice-weekly HD. Serial blood samples were collected to determine daptomycin serum concentrations and protein binding. Statistical analysis was done using linear mixed model analysis.

Results

The maximum serum concentration observed with a 6 mg/kg post-HD dose was 61.1 ± 7.6 microg/ml with a mean protein binding of 89.2%. Intradialytic daptomycin administration resulted in reduced maximum serum concentration and area under the curve values that were approximately 12 to 20% lower when administered during HD with LP dialyzers and approximately 35% lower with HP dialyzers.

Conclusions

Intradialytic daptomycin administration during the last 30 min of HD is feasible, provided that larger dosages are used to compensate for intradialytic drug loss. On the basis of our findings, intradialytic doses of approximately 7 mg/kg (LP) or approximately 9 mg/kg (HP) theoretically should be bioequivalent to 6 mg/kg infused after HD. The calculated dosages are mathematically driven and must be validated in prospective clinical trials.

### Vancomycin and daptomycin dosing recommendations in patients receiving home hemodialysis using monte carlo simulation [^437d1a74]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Part II. Vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring strategy in patients with HHD

MCS results suggested that TDM targeting a pre-dialysis concentration of 24 mg/L would ensure AUC 24h ≥ 400 mg∙h/L in ≥ 90% of virtual patients in all HHD settings, following the model-recommended initial doses for a week. Thus, the new MD was to be proportionally adjusted from the initial MD to attain a pre-dialysis concentration of 24 mg/L as the equation below. Of note, in HHD settings where a HHD occurs 4–5 times per week (Mon-Tue-Thu-Fri or Mon-Tue-Wed-Thu-Fri), a 30% higher Friday dose was necessary to maintain PTA ≥ 90% on the third day of a 3-day interdialytic period.

Figure 3 A-D illustrate the proportions of simulated patients (n = 5,000) attaining AUC 24h < 400, 400–600, and ≥ 600 mg∙h/L during 2 weeks of vancomycin therapy (ie. initial recommended regimens for the first week, followed by subsequently adjusted MD directed by TDM for the second week). Overall, the TDM-guided individualized dosing strategy with a target pre-dialysis concentration of 24 mg/L yielded a higher proportion of patients attaining AUC 24h 400–600 mg∙h/L, and decreased the proportions of those with sub-therapeutic (AUC 24h < 400 mg∙h/L) or excessive drug exposure (AUC 24h > 600 mg∙h/L), compared to those resulted from the initial regimens. The mean AUC 24h on each day after dose adjustment with TDM ranged from 400 to 600 mg∙h/L, with an exception of 3-h HHDs occurring 5 times per week (Mon-Tue-Wed-Thu-Fri). In this setting, the recommended dosing regimen needed to be given less frequently (i.e. Mon-Wed-Fri only), but a higher MD was necessary to ensure the target attainment on days when vancomycin was not given.

### Vancomycin and daptomycin dosing recommendations in patients receiving home hemodialysis using monte carlo simulation [^cd591850]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Monte Carlo simulations and prediction of optimal dosing regimen

Various weight-based vancomycin and daptomycin dosing regimens were evaluated in this analysis. All doses were simulated to be infused after HHD ended. Vancomycin infusion time was 1 h for the doses ≤ 10 mg/kg, 2 h for the doses > 10 mg/kg and ≤ 20 mg/kg, and 3 h for the doses > 20 mg/kg. The maximum loading dose (LD) and maintenance dose (MD) for vancomycin were capped as 3 g and 2 g respectively based on the guidelines. Daptomycin infusion time was consistent with 0.5 h for all doses. The maximum LD and MD for daptomycin were capped as 1.5 g. Monte Carlo simulation (MCS)(Crystal Ball Classroom Edition, Oracle) was performed to generate a week of plasma drug concentration–time profiles of 5,000 virtual patients for each tested vancomycin and daptomycin regimen in each of 10 different HHD settings for one week. The AUC 24h for each day of vancomycin and daptomycin therapy was computed using the linear trapezoidal rule.

For vancomycin, probability of target attainment (PTA) was calculated by summing up the number of virtual patients attaining the AUC 24h ≥ 400 mg∙h/L and dividing by the total number (n = 5,000) of virtual patients. Optimal vancomycin doses were defined as the smallest dose attaining a PTA ≥ 90% preferably with the mean AUC 24h 400–600 mg∙h/L in the simulated patients for each HHD setting. For daptomycin, a regimen is considered "optimal" if its resulted IQRs of AUC 24h in 5,000 simulated patients was within the target IQR of AUC 24h 465–1422 mg∙h/L in each HHD setting.

### Dosing and exposure of vancomycin with continuous infusion: a retrospective study [^8f01c2da]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin continuous infusion (CI) has suggested benefits over intermittent infusion: reduced nephrotoxicity, higher target attainment, and simpler therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Empiric dosing regimens range from 30-60mg/kg/day and it is unclear which regimen results in optimal exposure. This study evaluates whether a dosing regimen of 45mg/kg/day after a 20mg/kg loading dose for patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 50mL/min results in adequate exposure. We retrospectively analyzed plasma concentrations from patients treated with vancomycin CI as routine clinical care between February and October 2021. Patients under 18years old, with renal replacement therapy, reduced creatinine clearance (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration < 50mLmin/1.73m 2) or outpatient antibiotic therapy were excluded. Dose, renal function, and blood draw procedures were assessed for each measured vancomycin sample. Initially, 121 samples were included. Subsequently, 7 samples, 6 of which with concentrations ≥ 40mg/L, were verified to be incorrectly drawn and excluded. With doses of 40-50mg/kg/day concentrations ranged from 18.4–61.0mg/L. Only 25% were within the target window of 17-25mg/L and 15% were ≥ 40mg/L. Supratherapeutic concentrations were observed in 89% of samples from patients dosed 40-60mg/kg/day with eGFR 50-80mL/min. Concluding, an empiric dosing regimen of 45mg/kg results in too high vancomycin exposure and thus we recommend lower doses and differentiation according to renal function. Additionally, when measuring concentrations over 40mg/L incorrect sampling must be excluded before dose adjustment and the large variability in exposure between patients, warrants the need for swift TDM.

### Indications for vancomycin in dialysis patients [^2f664116]. Seminars in Dialysis (2000). Low credibility.

Resistance to vancomycin has emerged among Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), and enterococci, and this emergence has particular prevalence in dialysis units. It has therefore become imperative that physicians use vancomycin judiciously. General recommendations regarding the appropriate use of vancomycin have been developed. Although in theory implementation of these guidelines should not be difficult, the medical community may be unable or unwilling to make the necessary adjustments in practice. The onslaught of cost constraints and bureaucratic encumbrance has occurred simultaneously with the increase in vancomycin resistance among pathogens commonly isolated among the dialysis population. When a patient responds to empiric antibiotic therapy and susceptibility data indicate that an antibiotic other than vancomycin would be appropriate, the clinician far too often does not make the change to this alternative. Previously there was no biological imperative to change the antibiotic. That complacency has infected an entire generation of physicians, and especially nephrologists. Furthermore, there is an active movement against change, driven by concerns such as malpractice accusations and frank errors in the interpretation of medical facts.

### Performance of a divided-load intravenous vancomycin dosing strategy for critically ill patients [^f6e27cb2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend vancomycin trough concentrations 15 to 20 µg/mL in complicated infections and all trough concentrations above 10 µg/mL.

Objective

We assessed the performance of a novel divided-load protocol designed to attain target trough concentrations within 24 hours of initiation and prevent doses given at concentrations above the target range, in critically ill patients.

Methods

The protocol was evaluated in 79 critically ill patients through retrospective medical record review. Vancomycin serum concentrations were drawn before the third dose after initiation and after any dosing change. Steady-state concentrations were drawn before the fifth or sixth doses. Vancomycin concentrations before the second dose were predicted using a nonparametric expectation maximization algorithm.

Results

Sixty-nine of 79 patients received scheduled doses, and 62 (90%) of the scheduled-dose patients attained therapeutic target concentrations 12 to 24 hours after therapy initiation. Eight scheduled-dose patients weighed > 150% of ideal body weight (IBW) and were significantly more likely to exhibit supratherapeutic trough concentrations before the fifth or sixth doses (P = 0.0004) compared with patients weighing ≤ 150% of IBW. Ten of 79 patients (8 dialysis dependent and 2 experiencing acute kidney injury) were dosed in response to measured serum drug concentrations drawn according to the divided-load protocol. All the 8 dialysis-dependent patients (100%) attained therapeutic concentrations 12 hours after therapy initiation.

Conclusion

The divided-load vancomycin dosing strategy achieved measured trough concentrations 15 to 20 µg/mL for most critically ill patients within 24 hours of initial dosing, without allowing doses given during supratherapeutic concentrations.

### Exploring population pharmacokinetic models in patients treated with vancomycin during continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) [^e6fe275a]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent guidelines suggest that AUC/MIC ratios should be used rather than trough measurements for therapeutic dose monitoring of vancomycin. The evidence base for use of target AUC/MIC ratios on CRRT is not as strong but is still recommended at present. Given that a Bayesian dose adjustment is advocated for AUC-based TDM, using a PK model to inform the initial dose, we suggest that developing population PK models for initial vancomycin dosing in the CRRT population is a step towards facilitating AUC-based TDM in clinical practice.

The strengths of our study include use of detailed clinical, biochemical and machine data taken from the electronic health record. This allowed us to explore pharmacokinetic models which incorporated individual patient and CRRT therapy characteristics. Our use of PTA plots provided a method for informing clinical dosing in this patient cohort. There was little CRRT downtime during our vancomycin dosing intervals which allowed for a consistent assessment of the impact of CRRT on vancomycin clearance.

Study limitations include that this was a single-centre study with retrospective data collection, and prospective model validation is advised. The availability of peak and trough levels alone restricted our analysis to a one-compartment model. Unequal numbers of samples across patients with small patient numbers in a single-centre limited the data available for analysis. No comparative data were available for non-renal CL of vancomycin, nor the unbound/free vancomycin concentrations, which can affect PK parameters.

### Patterns of use and appropriateness of antibiotics prescribed to patients receiving haemodialysis: an observational study [^2a2e03ac]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Assessing appropriateness of antibiotics prescribed

Oral and IV antibiotic regimens prescribed were compared to the recommendations from the Australian national Therapeutic Guidelines (TG): Antibiotic Version 14 and 15, unless local hospital guidelines were available, as was the case for certain antibiotics, such as vancomycin. The TG: Antibiotic is widely available in hospitals and via the majority of general practice software in Australia. A new edition of the TG: Antibiotic was released in November 2014 which included minor changes to the dosing of certain antibiotics in the haemodialysis setting. Antibiotic regimens prescribed after November 2014 were compared with the TG: Antibiotic Version 15.

The TG: Antibiotic provides recommendations from an antibiotic expert group, all of whom are working in Australia, on the types of antibiotics, dose, frequency and duration of treatment, for a wide variety of infections seen in both the community and hospital setting. The evidence to support the recommendations are drawn from published literature (where available) and the experts' collective experiences. Antibiotic dosing guidelines in renal impairment and dialysis setting are provided as a table in an appendix in the TG: Antibiotic for all antibiotics available in Australia. This table includes dose adjustments and recommendations of when an antibiotic should be dosed in relation to haemodialysis if published data is available. This guideline is available to all health professionals in either a hard copy or electronic format.

The Renal Drug Handbook Third Edition was referred to in order to confirm the ideal dosing of the antibiotic regimen when it was not available in the TG: Antibiotic or hospital guidelines. Only dose adjustments for renal impairment and renal replacement therapy are provided in the Renal Drug Handbook.

Each antibiotic regimen prescribed was then reviewed by an expert multidisciplinary team to determine whether they were appropriate, inappropriate or not assessable based on the classifications utilised in the publically available National Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey (NAPS) (see Table 1). The information available for review was the documented indication, the antibiotic regimen, antibiotic allergy status and available M/C/S data. For antibiotic regimens which had M/C/S data available, if the organism(s) identified were non-susceptible to the prescribed antibiotic, these regimens were classified as inappropriate. Hospital guidelines were available for vancomycin. If vancomycin was not prescribed in accordance to the hospital guidelines or where there was no reference to TDM in the prescribed regimen, this was classified as inappropriate.

### Does contemporary vancomycin dosing achieve therapeutic targets in a heterogeneous clinical cohort of critically ill patients? Data from the multinational DALI study [^bb7d3eae]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Vancomycin blood samples were collected from 45 critically ill patients. Three patients were excluded as their samples were not viable. As such, the study sample consisted of 42 study subjects from 26 ICUs of eight countries (Andorra, Belgium, Spain, UK, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Turkey). Demographic data, disease severity, and renal function are described in Table 1. Data are presented for patients receiving intermittent versus continuous vancomycin therapy. Vancomycin was given empirically in 31 patients (73.8%). Therapy was targeted in only 11 patients. MICs for isolated Staphylococcus spp. were only reported in two cases (both MIC 1 mg/L).

### Exploring population pharmacokinetic models in patients treated with vancomycin during continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) [^5f79e22d]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Therapeutic antibiotic dose monitoring can be particularly challenging in septic patients requiring renal replacement therapy. Our aim was to conduct an exploratory population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis on PK of vancomycin following intermittent infusion in critically ill patients receiving continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF); focussing on the influence of dialysis-related covariates.

Methods

This was a retrospective single-centre tertiary level intensive care unit (ICU) study, which included patients treated concurrently with vancomycin and CVVHDF between January 2015 and July 2016. We extracted clinical, laboratory and dialysis data from the electronic healthcare record (EHR), using strict inclusion criteria. A population PK analysis was conducted with a one-compartment model using the PMetrics population PK modelling package. A base structural model was developed, with further analyses including clinical and dialysis-related data to improve model prediction through covariate inclusion. The final selected model simulated patient concentrations using probability of target attainment (PTA) plots to investigate the probability of different dosing regimens achieving target therapeutic concentrations.

Results

A total of 106 vancomycin dosing intervals (155 levels) in 24 patients were examined. An acceptable 1-compartment base model was produced (Plots of observed vs. population predicted concentrations (Obs–Pred) R 2 = 0.78). No continuous covariates explored resulted in a clear improvement over the base model. Inclusion of anticoagulation modality and vasopressor use as categorical covariates resulted in similar PK parameter estimates, with a trend towards lower parameter estimate variability when using regional citrate anti-coagulation or without vasopressor use. Simulations using PTA plots suggested that a 2 g loading dose followed by 750 mg 12 hourly as maintenance dose, commencing 12 h after loading, is required to achieve adequate early target trough concentrations of at least 15 mg/L.

Conclusions

PTA simulations suggest that acceptable trough vancomycin concentrations can be achieved early in treatment with a 2 g loading dose and maintenance dose of 750 mg 12 hourly for critically ill patients on CVVHDF.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Vancomycin loading dose administration and infusion parameters indicate that providing loading doses of 20 to 35 mg/kg based on actual body weight rapidly achieves targeted serum concentrations and reduces early subtherapeutic levels. Vancomycin should be administered in a dilute solution with concentrations of no more than 5 mg/mL and infused over not less than 60 minutes or at 10 to 15 mg/min, and an infusion rate of 10 mg/min or less is associated with fewer infusion-related events. Loading doses of 25 to 35 mg/kg will require infusion times of at least 2 to 3 hours, and after completion of the loading dose the maintenance dose should begin at the next dosing interval, for example starting 6 hours after the start of the loading dose when the interval is every 6 hours.

Dosing during extracorporeal therapies

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) can be delivered by diffusion (hemodialysis), convection (hemofiltration), or a combination of both (hemodiafiltration). It may be delivered continuously (CRRT) or intermittently. There are several papers on drug dosing during CRRT, but very few in critically ill patients receiving intermittent RRT. A specific issue for intermittent RRT is the inconsistent drug clearance likely to occur during a 24-hour period. Such inconsistent clearance is highly problematic for time-dependent antibiotics where unadjusted dosing in the presence of high drug clearance that alternates with no drug clearance will result in potentially very low and very high concentrations over the course of the day exposing the patient to risks of clinical failure and toxicity.

Drugs that are hydrophilic and usually subject to renal clearance are commonly cleared by dialysis. Large molecules (> 1000 Da), like vancomycin, are poorly cleared by hemodialysis, although the availability of high-flux filters has increased the clearance of these drugs somewhat. Smaller molecules, like the β-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics, are largely cleared by hemodialysis, although this clearance is typically lower than with normal renal function. Protein binding has important effects on drug clearance with highly protein-bound drugs, like teicoplanin, oxacillin and ceftriaxone, having low dialysis clearance because the protein-bound fraction cannot be cleared. Finally, for antibiotics with a larger Vd there is typically less antibiotic in the vascular compartment and so less is available for clearance. This is seen with the quinolones, which have a comparatively larger Vd than the β-lactams or aminoglycosides.

In the absence of clinical PK and dosing data for hemodialysis in critically ill patients, valuable mechanistic insights can be gained from in vitro RRT models. Such experiments have shown that dialysate flow rate is the most important factor associated with hemodialysis clearance of drugs. More data are needed to improve dosing in hemodialysis as the sub-optimal achievement of target concentrations seen in the early phase of therapy in critically ill patients receiving CRRT is likely to also be problematic with intermittent techniques.

Antibiotics are commonly required during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); however, few data are available regarding antibiotic PK during ECMO. The major changes in ECMO are increased Vd and decreased drug clearance, although the extent of such changes remains poorly characterized. Antibiotic concentrations may be further altered during ECMO because of the circuit itself (with associated drug sequestration) and/or the associated systemic inflammation (with vasodilation and capillary leak).

### Aminoglycosides in hemodialysis patients: is the current practice of post dialysis dosing appropriate? [^fb3c3a23]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

Aminoglycosides have been widely used in end-stage renal failure patients for the treatment of infections caused by gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus. Traditionally, these agents are administered post dialysis to avoid premature dialytic clearance, although no studies have been performed to confirm that this dosing strategy represents the optimal treatment regimen. In recent years, a more complete understanding of the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics of aminoglycosides has led to a global change in clinical practice from multiple to once-daily dosing in patients with normal renal function with the aim of providing intermittent pulses to maximize the peak concentration relative to overall drug exposure. These same considerations strongly support administration of aminoglycosides before, rather than after, hemodialysis. This study will review the key pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic considerations in aminoglycoside dosing, the relationship between serum aminoglycoside concentrations and efficacy/toxicity, the influence of renal function and hemodialysis on aminoglycoside pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and the mounting population pharmacokinetic and clinical study evidence supporting a paradigm shift in aminoglycoside dosing from post dialysis to predialysis.

### Evaluation of a protocol for vancomycin administration in critically patients with and without kidney dysfunction [^f2c77853]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Our algorithm is based on a continuous infusion of vancomycin that might have advantages over intermittent administration since this strategy appears to reduce renal toxicity. Despite previous studies comparing continuous and intermittent administration have reached conflicting results, others demonstrated that continuous infusion of vancomycin is less expensive and quicker in achieving target concentration, resulting in less variability in serum concentrations.

The presence of patients with a VSC > 30 mg/L implies that our algorithm should not be changed by increasing the daily dose of vancomycin in order to avoid a VSC under the desired range. This is suggested by the AUC/MIC ratio, which was even at the first VSC determination much higher than 400 (Table 2). This is of clinical relevance since Holmes et al have previously demonstrated a 12% lower mortality 30-day mortality in patients achieving a vancomycin AUC/MIC of > 373 within the first 96 h of vancomycin therapy compared to those who did not. Instead, we believe that our algorithm should take into account the presence of ARC, therefor increasing the dose only in patients that really need this adjustment of the therapy.

### Evaluation of a protocol for vancomycin administration in critically patients with and without kidney dysfunction [^b0821bf0]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main results of the present study are: 1) our protocol seems to consent to a fast achievement of a target VSC in patients with normal kidney function and in those with kidney dysfunction; 2) the presence of an augmented renal clearance was the main determinant of the difficulties in reaching a target VSC.

Early antibiotic administration should aim to reach adequate target VSC within a few hours from infusion. However, critically ill patients usually have a large volume of distribution which likely reflects significant capillary leakage. The latter, coupled with aggressive fluid loading, can expand the interstitial space. Hence hydrophilic antimicrobials — distributed exclusively in the extracellular compartment — are expected to be diluted. This shift of fluid may favour movement of drug into the interstitium and a decreased VSC is expected. Moreover, while critical illness might alter the volume of distribution, renal dysfunction additionally makes antibiotic pharmacokinetics even more unpredictable. As a consequence, patients with decreased renal function require vancomycin to be administered following dose adjustments. Hence our protocol was designed in order to avoid both a VSC under and over the target range, although we choose to favour the avoidance of a VSC under the range since its association with an increased in-hospital mortality. At the same time we felt that patients with kidney dysfunction should have had a specific protocol because of reduced renal clearance. Finally, target VSC may be difficult to achieve because of the presence of augmented renal clearance. ARC is characterised by an enhanced renal elimination of circulating solutes observed in critically ill patients. The presence of ARC might imply subtherapeutic levels of a given drug for substantial periods of the dosing interval resulting in treatment failure or selection of resistant organisms.

### Pharmacokinetics and total elimination of meropenem and vancomycin in intensive care unit patients undergoing extended daily dialysis [^c2d64a14]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Extended daily dialysis (EDD) combines the advantage of both intermittent hemodialysis and continuous renal replacement therapy: excellent detoxification accompanied by cardiovascular tolerability. The aim of this study was to evaluate pharmacokinetics of meropenem and vancomycin in critically ill patients with renal failure undergoing EDD.

Design

Prospective clinical study.

Setting

Surgical intensive care unit in a tertiary care center.

Patients

We studied intensive care patients with anuric acute renal failure being treated with EDD and receiving meropenem (n = 10) or vancomycin (n = 10) therapy.

Interventions

The antibiotics were administered 6 hrs (1.0 g meropenem) or 12 hrs (1.0 g vancomycin) before EDD was started in order to study the pharmacokinetics before and during EDD. In addition to the application of different methods to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters, the total dialysate concentration of both drugs was measured.

Results

Based on the amount of the drug recovered from the collected spent dialysate, the fraction of drug removed by one dialysis treatment was 18% for meropenem and 26% for vancomycin. Dosing regimes for intermittent hemodialysis and continuous renal replacement therapy cannot be used for critically ill patients treated with EDD.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that patients treated with EDD by means of a high-flux dialyzer (polysulphone; surface area, 1.3 m; blood and dialysate flow, 160 mL/min; EDD time, 480 mins) and current dosing regimens run the risk of being significantly underdosed, which may have detrimental effects on critically ill patients with life-threatening infections. The exact dose has to be tailored according to weight and severity of illness as well as the current minimal inhibitory concentration against the incriminated bacteria. Whenever possible, therapeutic drug monitoring should be performed.

Key messages

Augmented renal clearance appears to be quite common in sub-populations of critically ill patients and can lead to very low serum concentrations of vancomycin on the first day of treatment
Clinicians are used to adjusting the dosing of antibiotics according to renal failure; however the adjustment to elevated function of the kidneys appears important to ensure target concentrations are achieved
This study prospectively validated a new vancomycin dosing nomogram based on the 8-hours renal clearance of creatinine and demonstrated that it is possible to increase the likelihood of target attainment in the first 24 h of treatment, particularly in patients with augmented renal clearance
Adequate serum concentrations of vancomycin should be confirmed with therapeutic drug monitoring, particularly in patients with extreme renal function alteration

### Exploring population pharmacokinetic models in patients treated with vancomycin during continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) [^207eddd7]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this single-centre, retrospective population pharmacokinetic analysis of PK of vancomyin following intermittent infusion in critically ill patients receiving CVVHDF, PTA plots suggest that we could achieve acceptable trough concentrations early in treatment with a 2 g loading dose and maintenance dose of 750 mg 12 hourly for most patients. No continuous covariates explored resulted in a clinically significant improvement over the base pharmacokinetic model. Selection of vancomycin loading doses using a population PK model has been shown to result in better attainment of therapeutic concentrations than standard loading doses in critically ill patients, excluding those on hamodialysis. The results of the current study present an opportunity to employ a population model to inform dose selection in patients on CVVHDF.

We found that the predictive ability of the base structural pharmacokinetic model was higher than expected. This was possibly due to the strict inclusion criteria which used only dosing intervals where CVVHDF downtime was less than time on CVVHDF. Given the good predictive ability of the base model it was difficult to identify covariates in this current data set which resulted in a notable increase in model predictive ability. This finding shows that the detail available from EHR data can aid development of PK models representing more specific patient cohorts and clinical scenarios. Despite the lack of effluent data pertaining to drug removal via CVVHDF, our analyses illustrate the potential to identify relevant dialysis-related covariates for total drug CL from routine clinical information retrieved from the clinical information system. A statistically significant improvement was identified in several models incorporating dialysis-related continuous covariates, when they were explored individually. Q eff and Q b can be considered determinants of dialysis dose and it could be anticipated that the combination of these covariates might represent a covariate for CL. In the current work, the reduction in −2LL in the model with Q b as a CL covariate was minimal, and in fact there was a slight deterioration in predictive ability from goodness-of-fit plots (Additional file 1: Table S2). Possibly a difference in Q b prescription in the citrate versus non-citrate cohorts may have confounded this result, or the contribution of Q b may be less notable than that of Q eff. The lack of improvement of the model including Q b as a covariate over base model therefore did not warrant its investigation in combination with Q eff, however investigation of this combination in a single dialysis modality cohort may be more fruitful. The current work also resulted in a statistical improvement where there was inclusion of vasopressor use as a categorical covariate. Ultimately, the presence of these small significant effects suggests that these covariates warrant further prospective investigation with richer data. Such an investigation would also support better characterisation of distribution effects, which would facilitate more detailed exploration of albumin concentration, capillary leak index and fluid balance metrics as covariates.

### Vancomycin clearance in high-volume venovenous hemofiltration [^cb839b4a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of vancomycin in 4 patients undergoing high-volume continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).

Case Summary

Data from 4 patients prescribed high-volume CVVH for acute renal failure treated with vancomycin were analyzed. Vancomycin plasma concentrations were measured 4 and 24 hours after the end of a 1-hour vancomycin infusion. The mean therapy fluid rate on initiation of vancomycin was 56.2 mL/kg/h (range 48.0–65.5). The mean loading dose of vancomycin was 18.3 mg/kg (range 14.7–19.7). Median vancomycin concentration 4 hours after the dose was 18.1 mg/L (range 13.1–30.0). At 24 hours after the dose, only 1 patient had a detectable vancomycin concentration (5.2 mg/L).

Discussion

There was a large variability in the clearance of vancomycin in this patient population. Current strategies for dosing vancomycin may lead to subtherapeutic trough concentrations. Vancomycin dosing in this patient population should be based on a detailed assessment of the CVVH prescription, vancomycin concentrations, and clinical needs and response.

Conclusions

An initial vancomycin dose of 20–25 mg/kg with frequent monitoring and adjustment is recommended for patients receiving high-volume CVVH.

### Decreasing the time to achieve therapeutic vancomycin concentrations in critically ill patients: developing and testing of a dosing nomogram [^43825fed]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Clinicians are used to adjusting the dosing of antibiotics according to acute or chronic renal failure, however the adjustment to elevated function of the kidneys is considered to be quite rare, and there are no recommendations on this clinical issue. Moreover, the incidence of ARC (here defined as CL CR > 130 ml/minute/1.73 m 2) is probably high and ubiquitous in every ICU with an underestimated incidence. Indeed ARC is being increasingly described, with previously reported rates, varying widely between 18% to as high as 57% in critically ill patients without renal dysfunction.

In the context of severe infection, a major consequence of ARC is the high renal clearance of hydrophilic antibiotics leading to a risk of inducing sub-therapeutic concentrations, therapeutic failure, emergence of multi-resistant bacterial strains, and even potentially increased mortality. To date, different antibiotics have been studied in the presence of ARC and these reports have shown a strong association between ARC and sub-therapeutic concentrations. Importantly for vancomycin, low serum concentrations are associated with decreases in susceptibility and in treatment failure of patients with MRSA infections. A recent large-scale multicentre point-prevalence study revealed that a substantial proportion of critically ill patients treated with vancomycin did not achieve the target vancomycin concentration and showed high variability in pharmacokinetics parameters, supporting a re-evaluation of vancomycin dosing recommendations in this particular setting. Furthermore, a recent consensus review recommended more aggressive vancomycin dosing to ensure achievement of the pharmacodynamic index associated with efficacy. Though vancomycin is widely used in the ICU, there are relatively few studies focused on the early optimization of serum concentrations where CI is the prescribed mode of administration. Surprisingly, only three studies among these used measured renal clearance of creatinine, three used mathematical estimates of renal function and one study did not provide this information. Among those studies evaluating the serum vancomycin concentration on day 1 or day 2, the achievement of target concentrations of 20 to 30 mg/L ranged between 48 and 52%.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Continuous infusion versus intermittent infusion of vancomycin — administration by continuous infusion (CI) has been evaluated as an alternative to intermittent infusion (II) with potential advantages of earlier target attainment, less variability in serum concentrations, ease of drug level monitoring, and lower the potential risk of AKI. Most studies compared CI to II for the risk of AKI and attainment of target serum concentrations; only 4 studies included other outcome endpoints such as treatment failure and mortality, and measures of exposure reported include trough and average steady-state concentrations and AUCτ. In critically ill patients, a total of 7 studies compared CI vs II; in one randomized trial comparing CI (n = 61) and II (n = 58) in 119 patients, mean steady-state and trough concentrations were 24 mg/L and 15 mg/L for both groups, with AUCτ values comparable between groups and significantly less variability in the CI group (P = 0.026). Clinical failure rates were similar on day 10 (21% vs 26%) and at end of treatment (21% vs 19%), although the mean AUCτ was lower with CI than II (596 [SD, 159] mg·h/L vs 685 [SD, 260] mg·h/L, P < 0.05). Nephrotoxicity occurred in 18% overall with similar rates between CI and II (16% vs 19%), but dialysis was required more often with CI than II (6 of 10 patients vs 3 of 11 patients). Among critically ill burn patients, another study comparing CI (n = 90) with II (n = 81) reported mortality rates numerically higher for those receiving CI but not reaching statistical significance; when mortality was compared by treatment indications, those who received CI for non-gram-positive sepsis had significantly higher mortality (70% vs 16.7%, P = 0.001). Nephrotoxicity occurred numerically less frequently with CI than II based on increase in Scr of 0.5 mg/dL at end of therapy (6.7% vs 14.8%).

In sepsis, "continuous or extended infusions with loading doses, as opposed to intermittent dosing, may lead to improved outcomes in patients treated with beta-lactam antibiotics," and for vancomycin "continuous vancomycin infusions may be considered to achieve optimal concentrations in some patients." Drug-level guidance includes that "within 60 minutes before or after administration of aminoglycosides" measuring concentrations "to estimate the Cmin and Cmax… together with the MIC… can help to guide appropriate antimicrobial dosing." Dose optimization for concentration-dependent with time-dependent agents "involves adjusting the dosing interval rather than administered dose." The text highlights altered clearance with extracorporeal supports — "CRRT and ECMO both lead to profound alteration of antimicrobial clearance" — and that "Therapeutic drug monitoring, where available, can permit individualized antimicrobial dosing to achieve maximal effect while minimizing toxicity."

Vancomycin therapeutic monitoring for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections — adults and pediatrics: we recommend targeting an AUC/MICBMD ratio of 400 to 600 (assuming an MICBMD of 1 mg/L) for empiric dosing to maximize clinical efficacy and minimize AKI risk. Furthermore, the AUC should be therapeutically monitored using 1 or 2 postdose concentrations (ie, a peak concentration measured after the early vancomycin tissue distribution phase and a trough level measured prior to the next dose), preferably integrating the Bayesian approach. Future studies in all patient populations are necessary to address existing gaps, including efficacy data to support vancomycin use in specific patient populations (including immunocompromised and pediatric patients and patients with renal disease and obesity) and for other types of infections; efficacy data for specific pathogens, including coagulase-negative staphylococcus and Streptococcus species; robust pediatric efficacy data for MRSA and other gram-positive pathogens causing different types of serious infections; optimal loading and maintenance dosing regimens for patients with obesity and renal insufficiency; efficacy benefit and the need for a dosing algorithm (specifically incorporating a loading dose followed by maintenance infusion); and toxicodynamics of vancomycin CI in critically ill patients.

Methods

Study design, setting, patients and data collection

A retrospective study of vancomycin levels in patients on CVVHDF was performed in a single-centre tertiary level adult intensive care unit (ICU) on patient data recorded between 22nd January 2015 and July 2016. The study had local research ethics approval (St. James's Hospital/Tallaght University Hospital Joint Research Ethics Committee Reference: 2016–04 List 13 (13), 2015–09 Vice-chairman Action (7), 2019–02 List 5 (15)). Data collection was from the Electronic Health Record (EHR), (Intellispace Critical Care and Anaesthesia (ICCA, Phillips ®)).

The following data were collected from the EHR:
Vancomycin infusion dose and start time
Vancomycin concentration data
Clinical, physiological (APACHE II and SOFA scores) and laboratory data
Dialysis-related data.

Patients receiving vancomycin on CVVHDF were included if they had at least one peak and trough vancomycin level during one or more dose intervals, with CVVHDF in use for the majority of the dosing interval; Data were included from the longest period of consecutive dosage intervals for each patient. Patients commenced on vancomycin before admission to ICU were included only if a trough concentration was available prior to the first dosing interval on ICU used in the analysis.

Vancomycin therapy and TDM

The ICU policy was to give patients vancomycin loading doses of 25 mg/kg, followed by once-daily maintenance doses 15–20 mg/kg with guidance from levels, delivered by infusion pump at a rate of 10 mg/min. A trough and peak serum concentration of 15–20 mg/L and 20–40 mg/L were targeted, respectively. Peak levels were taken 60 min after the end of infusion and trough levels were taken immediately before the next dose. The 'Architect iVancomycin ® ' assay used an in vitro chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay to quantitatively measure serum vancomycin (mg/L).

### A multicenter study on the effect of continuous hemodiafiltration intensity on antibiotic pharmacokinetics [^21a1e67c]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Contribution of extracorporeal clearance to the total antibiotic clearance

Systemic CL and elimination half-life did not differ according to CRRT dose, and so the CRRT prescription may not be useful for guiding antibiotic prescribing. This has been observed previously. There is significant non-renal clearance of vancomycin early in the course of AKI, but this decreases with time, which may also contribute to the poor relationship. The contribution of extracorporeal CL to systemic CL was variable. This related to the combined effect of the variability in extracorporeal CL and inter-individual and inter-occasion (despite identical CRRT regimens) variability in systemic pharmacokinetics. In many cases, extracorporeal CL accounted for more than 30% of the observed systemic CL for that antibiotic, which is a suggested threshold for adjustment of the dosing regimen. Such variability in CL limits attempts to develop dosing guidelines.

Of note, CL HDF appeared to exceed CL s in some cases. The reason for this is not apparent from our data but may relate to an error with either of these calculated values. For example, it has been noted that the delivered effluent flow rate is frequently lower than the prescribed flow rate, and so the calculation of clearance based on the prescribed effluent rate may overstate the actual clearance.

### Vancomycin dosing strategy for the treatment of peritonitis in a child on automated peritoneal dialysis: a first pediatric case report [^afb20f6b]. Seminars in Dialysis (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacterial peritonitis is a common complication of peritoneal dialysis. In the absence of systemic signs of infection, adult guidelines recommend treatment with intraperitoneal vancomycin either as empiric coverage of gram-positive organisms or as targeted therapy. However, there is no guidance on how to administer vancomycin in children on automated peritoneal dialysis.

Case Report

We report vancomycin pharmacokinetics upon intraperitoneal administration for the treatment of a Staphylococcus hominis peritonitis in an 11-year-old patient on automated nocturnal intermittent peritoneal dialysis. While the patient was hospitalized, vancomycin was administered intraperitoneally as a continuous treatment. After hospital discharge, the nocturnal peritoneal dialysis was resumed. In the absence of treatment guidelines, intraperitoneal vancomycin was initially administered empirically only during the nocturnal dialysis exchanges which led to repetitive subtherapeutic vancomycin plasma concentrations and the persistence of S. hominis in dialysate cultures. Based on studies in adults, the dosing strategy was subsequently modified to administer vancomycin at a dosage of 15mgkg -1 in the dialysate with a 6-h dwell period prior to the nocturnal dialysis thereby allowing to reach optimal peak concentrations. The dosing interval was subsequently individualized using therapeutic drug monitoring to ensure residual vancomycin concentrations > 10mgL -1 thereby leading to clinical and microbiological recovery.

Conclusions

This case presents a dosing strategy based on a comprehensive review of the literature and highlights that a sufficient dwell period is critical when treating pediatric patients on automated peritoneal dialysis in order to allow vancomycin distribution and equilibration between the dialysate and the plasma.

### Vancomycin and home health care [^223a36da]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

HICPAC guidelines were developed to promote judicious use of vancomycin in an attempt to curtail the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and forestall the development of S. aureus with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides. Although these guidelines were initially applied to the inpatient setting, the OPAT guidelines have recommended that they also apply to outpatients receiving vancomycin. Apart from vancomycin, however, the OPAT guidelines lack information regarding choices of antimicrobial drugs for outpatients. In addition, they do not clearly prioritize conscientious use of antimicrobial drugs above other considerations, such as cost and dosing convenience, when choosing outpatient therapy. These issues need to be addressed as the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant gram-positive pathogens in the community continue to increase.

One in 1,000 patients in the United States is estimated to receive outpatient infusion of antimicrobial drugs each year. The trend toward increased inpatient acuity and shorter hospital stay will undoubtedly increase this practice. Our study on first-time referrals from 1 tertiary care hospital to its homecare agency represents only a subset of vancomycin use in the community. The propensity for readmissions and repeated referrals of these chronically ill patients must be considered when analyzing the impact of outpatient vancomycin use. In addition, vancomycin administered by other homecare agencies, extended care facilities, outpatient infusion centers, and outpatient dialysis centers all contribute to its burgeoning use outside the hospital. Our study indicates that further investigations into the consequences of this practice on individual persons and the community are warranted. Do the favorable pharmacokinetics and economic attributes of vancomycin that make it attractive for home infusion outweigh the potential consequences of unnecessarily broad-spectrum gram-positive coverage? Further studies are needed to address these issues if we are to understand the dynamics of resistant pathogens in the community and the overall emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance.

### Single UK centre experience on the treatment of PD peritonitis – antibiotic levels and outcomes [^93b48c38]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

There are few studies of the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin and gentamicin in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and the influence of antibiotic concentrations on treatment outcome. Concerns about resistance to ceftazidime and potential of aminoglycoside toxicity make the choice of empiric antibiotic difficult.

Methods

We retrospectively collected data from 613 patients on PD between 1 June 2002 and 31 December 2005. During this time, we adopted a protocol that minimized aminoglycoside exposure to patients with residual renal function and carefully monitored serum antibiotic concentrations.

Results

There were no statistical differences in mean day-5 vancomycin concentrations for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) vs automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) and for anuric vs not-anuric patients. However, low levels (< 12 mg/l) were recorded for 12.8% CAPD and 15% APD patients. These remained low at day 10 in 16% patients (25% if not anuric) despite incremental dosing. Vancomycin concentration did not predict cure or relapse of Gram-positive or culture-negative peritonitis. Gentamicin concentration (> 2 mg/l in > 50% patients) did not predict outcome of Gram-negative and culture-negative peritonitis. Moreover, cure rates were the same irrespective of whether gentamicin was continued for 14 days or was switched to ceftazidime after 5 days.

Conclusion

We have confirmed that the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) dosing guideline for vancomycin in CAPD and APD patients produces adequate serum concentrations of the antibiotics in the vast majority. However, large incremental dosing of vancomycin is needed if day-5 levels are low; especially for not-anuric patients. Whilst evidence of gentamicin toxicity in PD remains controversial, ISPD dosing regimen resulted in high levels for > 50% patients. High gentamicin concentrations did not correlate with treatment success, but switching gentamicin to ceftazidime at day 5 appeared safe and limited aminoglycoside exposure. Increasing vancomycin and gentamicin concentrations do not appear to improve cure rates and alternative strategies (such as combination treatment) should be considered for future research.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Vancomycin AUC-guided monitoring — Given the narrow vancomycin AUC range for therapeutic effect and minimal acute kidney injury (AKI) risk, the most accurate and optimal way to manage vancomycin dosing should be through AUC-guided dosing and monitoring (A-II). We recommend to accomplish this in one of two ways. One approach relies on the collection of 2 concentrations obtained near steady-state — a postdistributional peak concentration at 1 to 2 hours after infusion and a trough concentration at the end of the dosing interval — and utilizing first-order pharmacokinetic (PK) equations to estimate the AUC (A-II). It is also highly preferred that concentrations are collected near steady-state conditions.

RISK FACTORS

Numerous risk factors have been defined for developing VANT or AKI in patients receiving vancomycin (Table 4). Various measures of vancomycin exposure have been studied, including use of a loading dose, maximal dose, duration of therapy, method of administration (intermittent vs. continuous infusion), AUC, and trough level. Other risk factors include demographic features, associated medical conditions, severity of illness, preexisting kidney disease, and concurrent nephrotoxins.

### Decreasing the time to achieve therapeutic vancomycin concentrations in critically ill patients: developing and testing of a dosing nomogram [^9ca0315e]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Altogether, our study shows that it is possible to increase the likelihood of target attainment in the first 24 h of treatment with vancomycin, with potential benefits including better outcome and reduction of the development of bacterial resistance. Our study strengths lie in the considerable number of patients included in the retrospective cohort, the significant correlation obtained between measured 8 h CL CR and CL vanco (r 2 = 0.66, P < 0.001), and the wide range of 8 h CL CR exhibited by these patients (25 to 335 ml/minute/1.73 m 2). Therefore, this study is based on a representative cohort of septic critically ill patients, making it applicable in various levels of renal function, including patients with ARC - a sub-group with particular risk of under-treatment with vancomycin.

However, some limitations should be acknowledged. First, this was a single-center study, and therefore an extrapolation of the findings to other settings must be done with caution. Second, the second cohort (group 2) was smaller, giving less certainty to our conclusions. Third, 8 h CL CR cannot be accepted as a gold-standard method to assess kidney function: its determination requires creatinine concentrations to be at steady-state, which is a rarely reached condition in critically ill patients. Finally, pharmacokinetic studies require a constant physiological status, leading us again to the absence of physiological stability in the critical-care setting. In addition, it is possible that not all patients were at actual steady-state, given that 11% of patients in group 1 had an interval between commencement of vancomycin infusion and sampling for TDM less than 16 h.

Vancomycin monitoring in outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) should occur throughout treatment, as the guideline states that vancomycin levels should be monitored throughout the OPAT course and recommends drug levels be monitored not just during the initial phase; a widely followed statement recommends dose adjustments based on serum trough levels, and there is emerging consensus that area under the curve/minimum inhibitory concentration monitoring may allow more appropriate dosing, though this practice has not yet gained widespread adoption. An observational study found that nephrotoxicity is frequently noted more than 2 weeks into treatment, which informed the recommendation to monitor levels throughout OPAT.

### Implementing an antimicrobial stewardship program in out-patient dialysis units [^30d854de]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Rates of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO), including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, continue to rise among the population of chronic hemodialysis. Antimicrobial exposure is the main risk factor for MDRO emergence and dissemination. Up to 30% of antimicrobial doses administered in out-patient dialysis units may not be indicated. Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP) improve antimicrobial prescribing patterns. The purpose of this review is to highlight the key elements and interventions of ASP.

Recent Findings

The Infectious Disease Society of America and the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America have provided evidence-based guidelines for the development and implementation of an ASP. Many of their recommendations can be adapted to the out-patient dialysis setting.

Summary

Developing and implementing an ASP by following key elements and interventions in the out-patient dialysis setting can lead to reduced mortality, adverse events, costs, and improvement in antimicrobial susceptibility rates.

### Evaluation of a protocol for vancomycin administration in critically patients with and without kidney dysfunction [^2093a2ea]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Administration of vancomycin in critically ill patients needs close regulation. While subtherapeutical vancomycin serum concentration (VSC) is associated with increased mortality, accumulation is responsible for nephrotoxicity. Our study aimed to estimate the efficacy of a vancomycin-dosing protocol in reaching appropriate serum concentration in patients with and without kidney dysfunction.

Methods

This was a retrospective study in critically ill patients treated with continuous infusion of vancomycin. Patients with creatinine clearance > 50 ml/min (Group A) were compared to those with creatinine clearance ≤ 50 ml/min (Group B).

Results

348 patients were enrolled (210 in Group A, 138 in Group B). At first determination, patients with kidney dysfunction (Group B) had a statistically higher percentage of vancomycin in target range, while the percentage of patients with a VSC under the range was almost equal. These percentages differed at the subsequent measurements. The number of patients with low vancomycin concentration progressively decreased, except in those with augmented renal clearance; the percentage of patients with VSC over 30 mg/L was about 28%, irrespective of the presence or absence of kidney dysfunction. Patients who reached a subtherapeutic level at the first VSC measurement had a significant correlation with in-hospital mortality.

Conclusions

Our protocol seems to allow a rapid achievement of a target VSC particularly in patients with kidney dysfunction. In order to avoid subtherapeutical VSC, our algorithm should be implemented by the estimation of the presence of an augmented renal clearance.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^edbf6730]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric sepsis antimicrobial dosing — pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic optimization (BPS): We recommend using antimicrobial dosing strategies that have been optimized based on published pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic principles and with consideration of specific drug properties (BPS). Sepsis may alter the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimicrobials; in particular, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) both lead to profound alteration of antimicrobial clearance, requiring individual dose adaptation, and therapeutic drug monitoring, where available, can permit individualized antimicrobial dosing to achieve maximal effect while minimizing toxicity. Determinants of antimicrobial efficacy include the time concentration remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration (T > MIC), the peak concentration to MIC ratio (Cmax/MIC), and the ratio of the 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve divided by the MIC (AUC24/MIC). Time dependent antibiotics include beta-lactams and lincosamides; for concentration-dependent agents such as aminoglycosides and metronidazole, drug concentrations measured within 60 minutes before or after administration are used to estimate the Cmin and Cmax to help guide dosing, and these agents may require an altered dosing frequency to maximize bacterial killing by preserving the Cpeak/MIC. Glycopeptides, oxazolidinones, fluoroquinolones, polymixins, daptomycin, azithromycin, and tigecycline are examples of concentration-dependent with time-dependent antibiotics; for vancomycin, continuous infusions may be considered to achieve optimal concentrations in some patients, and for this class dose optimization involves adjusting the dosing interval rather than administered dose.
