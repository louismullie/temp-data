## Question

A 61-year-old man presents to the primary care clinic to establish care. He has not seen a physician for many years. He has no complaints or concerns but, on further questioning, does have some vague abdominal discomfort. He has no known past medical history and takes no medications. His social history is notable for injecting heroin throughout his late-teens and 20s, but he has been clean and sober for over a decade. At the clinic, the vital signs include: heart rate 90/min, respiratory rate 17/min, blood pressure 110/65 mm Hg, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). The physical exam shows a slightly distended abdomen. The laboratory studies are notable for a platelet count of 77,000/uL and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.7. Which of the following is the next best step in the diagnosis of this patient?
A. Anti-nuclear antibody test
B. Hepatitis C antibody
C. HIV ELISA
D. Platelet aggregation assay

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which single test is the next best step in the diagnostic workup of a 61-year-old man with vague abdominal discomfort, thrombocytopenia, and an elevated INR, given a remote history of injection drug use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely etiologies linking thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy in this context. Then, I should verify which infections are most strongly associated with injection drug use and chronic liver disease. Next, I will review guideline-backed testing sequences for thrombocytopenia and liver disease. Finally, I will weigh each option against the pretest probability and choose the highest-yield test to order now, while planning subsequent steps if positive or negative.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem framing: isolated thrombocytopenia with an elevated INR in someone with a history of injection drug use raises concern for chronic liver disease with portal hypertension and hypersplenism, and for chronic viral infections such as hepatitis C and HIV, which are common in people who injected drugs and can cause thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy through multiple mechanisms, including hypersplenism and impaired hepatic synthesis of clotting factors [^4df5863d] [^447484eb].

> Wait, let me verify the differential before jumping to testing. Thrombocytopenia here could reflect decreased production, increased destruction, splenic sequestration, or pseudothrombocytopenia; the elevated INR points toward impaired hepatic synthesis of vitamin K–dependent factors, which fits with chronic liver disease, whereas isolated immune thrombocytopenia typically does not elevate INR unless there is concurrent liver disease or anticoagulation, so the combination nudges me toward liver disease and/or chronic viral infection rather than primary hematologic disorders alone [^c9475176] [^4df5863d].

> I need to check which infection carries the highest pretest probability and clinical impact in this scenario. Hepatitis C is highly prevalent among people with a history of injection drug use, and chronic HCV is a leading cause of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and thrombocytopenia; importantly, HCV is also a treatable cause of thrombocytopenia, and guidelines recommend screening all adults with risk factors, including past injection drug use, and specifically testing for HCV in the initial workup of thrombocytopenia when risk factors are present [^51ff7ce1] [^4df5863d].

> Hold on, I should verify the guideline hierarchy for thrombocytopenia workup. The ASH 2019 ITP guideline advises testing for HCV and HIV in adults with new thrombocytopenia, reflecting the frequency and clinical significance of these infections; this aligns with the AASLD/IDSA guidance to screen at-risk adults for HCV, which this patient clearly is based on prior injection drug use [^4df5863d] [^51ff7ce1].

> Let me consider each option against this background. Anti-nuclear antibody testing is low yield here because there is no suggestive autoimmune phenotype, and it does not explain the INR elevation. HIV ELISA is reasonable and should be done, but HCV has a higher pretest probability and more directly explains the combined cytopenia and coagulopathy in this patient. A platelet aggregation assay is not indicated for initial evaluation of isolated thrombocytopenia and would not clarify the coagulopathy. Therefore, hepatitis C antibody is the highest-yield next test [^4df5863d] [^c9475176].

> I should double-check the downstream plan if the HCV antibody is positive. If positive, I would confirm active infection with HCV RNA, assess liver disease severity with AST, ALT, bilirubin, albumin, and platelets, and consider abdominal imaging to evaluate for cirrhosis and portal hypertension; if negative, I would still obtain HIV testing and pursue other causes of thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy, but HCV remains the most likely and consequential diagnosis to exclude first in this context [^4df5863d] [^51ff7ce1].

> But wait, what if the thrombocytopenia is pseudothrombocytopenia from platelet clumping? I should confirm the platelet count in a citrate tube if there are flags on the smear or discordant results, because pseudothrombocytopenia can mimic disease; however, the concurrent INR elevation makes a true thrombocytopenia from liver disease more plausible here, so I will proceed with HCV testing while keeping verification in mind if the platelet pattern is atypical [^c9475176].

> Final answer: B. Hepatitis C antibody, because it addresses the most likely and clinically consequential diagnosis given the patient's risk profile, explains both the thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy, and is prioritized in guideline-based workups for new thrombocytopenia with injection drug use history [^4df5863d] [^51ff7ce1].

---

The next best step is to order a **hepatitis C antibody test** because the patient's history of injection drug use and current thrombocytopenia with elevated INR strongly suggest chronic hepatitis C with liver disease [^51ff7ce1]. Hepatitis C is the most common chronic infection in former injection drug users and is a leading cause of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and coagulopathy, which explain the low platelets and high INR [^notfound]. If the antibody is positive, confirm with HCV RNA and assess liver function and fibrosis; if negative, consider other causes such as alcohol-related liver disease or autoimmune hepatitis [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia and elevated INR

Thrombocytopenia with an elevated INR in a patient with a history of injection drug use suggests **chronic liver disease** with impaired hepatic synthesis of clotting factors and portal hypertension causing splenic sequestration of platelets. The most likely etiologies include:

- **Chronic hepatitis C infection**: Highly prevalent among former injection drug users and a leading cause of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and coagulopathy [^51ff7ce1].

- **Chronic hepatitis B infection**: Less likely given the absence of reported risk factors, but still possible.

- **Alcohol-related liver disease**: Common in patients with substance use history.

- **Autoimmune hepatitis**: Less likely but should be considered if viral hepatitis is excluded.

- **Hematologic disorders**: Such as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), but the elevated INR makes this less likely.

---

## Role of hepatitis C in thrombocytopenia and elevated INR

Chronic hepatitis C infection causes **chronic liver disease**, leading to:

- **Impaired hepatic synthesis of clotting factors**: Including factors II, VII, IX, and X, resulting in elevated INR.

- **Portal hypertension**: Causing splenic sequestration of platelets, resulting in thrombocytopenia.

- **Direct viral effects**: Hepatitis C virus can directly impair platelet production and increase platelet destruction.

Given the patient's history of injection drug use and the laboratory findings, **chronic hepatitis C infection is the most likely diagnosis** [^notfound].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

The recommended diagnostic approach is to **order a hepatitis C antibody test** as the next best step. This test is highly sensitive and specific for detecting chronic hepatitis C infection. If the antibody test is positive, confirm active infection with an HCV RNA PCR test and assess liver function and fibrosis with liver function tests (ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin, albumin) and non-invasive fibrosis assessment (e.g. transient elastography or APRI/FIB-4 scores) [^notfound].

---

## Rationale for not choosing alternative options

- **Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) test**: Not indicated initially as there is no evidence of autoimmune disease. ANA testing is typically reserved for suspected autoimmune hepatitis or other autoimmune conditions.

- **HIV ELISA**: Although HIV is a consideration in patients with a history of injection drug use, it does not directly explain the elevated INR. HIV testing should be performed, but it is not the immediate priority in this clinical scenario.

- **Platelet aggregation assay**: Not indicated initially. Platelet aggregation studies are typically reserved for suspected platelet function disorders or drug-induced thrombocytopenia, which are less likely in this patient.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The next best step in the diagnosis of this patient is to order a **hepatitis C antibody test**. This test is the most appropriate initial diagnostic step given the patient's history of injection drug use, thrombocytopenia, and elevated INR, which strongly suggest chronic hepatitis C infection with liver disease. If the antibody test is positive, confirm active infection with HCV RNA PCR and assess liver function and fibrosis [^notfound].

Case report

A Caucasian 61-year-old man was referred to our Hospital in 1993 due to elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (eight times the upper limit of normal) with a slight increase in the gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and was diagnosed as having CHC. He had no history of alcohol abuse, intravenous drug use, blood transfusions and drug intake. The patient's medical history was notable for lung silicosis and hypertension without any secondary complication. His body mass index (BMI) was 25.51 kg/m 2. He tested positive for HCV antibodies and negative for other causes of liver disease (other viral infections, hepatic autoimmunity, medications, hyperferritinemia, metabolic diseases). In 1993 the assessment of HCV-RNA and genotype by serum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were not available, so no relative data at the time of the diagnosis exist. Other laboratory findings included a preserved liver function and a normal platelet count (Table 1). Abdominal examination and ultrasonography excluded hepatosplenomegaly and hepatic nodules. The liver biopsy, performed in 1994, showed stage 2 fibrosis with a moderate necro-inflammatory activity (A2 grade) according to the Desmet's classification, and a mild microvescicolar hepatic steatosis.

Table 1
Patient characteristics

One year later, in January 1994, he was treated with 3MU of interferon-alpha 2a (Roferon) three times a week for 48 weeks, achieving a biochemical and SVR.

From 1996 to 2009 HCV-RNA was undetectable with normal AST/ALT.

In August 2009 the patient was referred to our emergency room for the onset of severe abdominal pain. On abdominal examination, there was distention, rebound and guarding with moderate ascites. The remaining physical examination and vital signs were normal. Laboratory findings showed mild anemia with normal platelet count and a preserved liver function. HCV RNA was undetectable and alpha-fetoprotein was elevated (Table 1).

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) found a large (8.6 cm) hepatic mass in segment IV, with a vascular pattern typical of HCC, ascites and no evidence of portal vein thrombosis. The subsequent diagnostic paracentesis confirmed the presence of hemoperitoneum.

Early primary assessment and abdominal examination can often be enough to triage the patient with abdominal pain into those with less severe underlying pathologic condition from those with more acute findings. A focused history of the patient can then allow the clinician to develop their differential diagnosis. Once the differential diagnoses are determined, diagnostic imaging and laboratory findings can help confirm the diagnosis and allow for expeditious treatment and intervention.

A 29-year-old Dominican man with a history of intravenous heroin use and hepatitis C presented with a 5-day history of fever, dyspnoea, haemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, abdominal pain, haematochezia and haematemesis. Initial physical examination was significant for scleral icterus, generalised abdominal tenderness to palpation, melaena and blood-tinged sputum. Blood cultures grew Fusobacterium species. CT scan of the chest revealed multiple bilateral cavitary features in lung fields. At the same time, a neck ultrasound performed demonstrated thrombophlebitis in the right internal jugular vein, confirming the diagnosis of 'Lemierre's syndrome'. Treatment was with antibiotics and supportive care for 6 weeks.

### A rational approach to the patient with hematochezia [^a5bf53cd]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hematochezia is a common clinical presentation, with significant morbidity and economic burden. These patients often require costly interventions including hospitalization, blood transfusions, and radiologic or endoscopic procedures. The purpose of this review is to give a rational, concise approach to the patient with hematochezia, with special consideration of recent advances in the literature.

Recent Findings

Recent studies pertaining to hematochezia have evaluated risk stratification, endoscopic intervention, evaluation of small bowel bleeding, and management of anticoagulation.

Summary

A step-wise approach to hematochezia helps determine the cause and provide the appropriate management of these patients. We propose five steps beginning with hemodynamic assessment and risk stratification, then focused history and physical examination, endoscopic intervention when warranted, and consideration of small bowel bleeding in selected instances.

Case presentation

The patient is a non-cirrhotic 37-year-old previously healthy Caucasian male who presented to an outside facility with severe right upper quadrant and epigastric pain for three days. In the two weeks preceding the acute pain, he noted vague abdominal discomfort. The patient reported no significant medical or surgical history, fevers, medication use, recent dehydration, or alcohol abuse. On admission to the outside facility, bloodwork was notable only for a total bilirubin of 1.7 mg/dl. Serum albumin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, INR, ESR, and lipase were normal. White blood cell and platelet counts were within normal limits. Viral serologies were unrevealing and ethanol metabolite testing was negative. Tenderness to palpation was noted in the epigastrium and right upper quadrant. Portal venous phase CT of the abdomen and pelvis performed in the emergency department demonstrated a thrombosed fusiform aneurysm of the main portal vein (MPV) measuring 12.0 × 5.1 cm (Fig. 1 A-B). The aneurysm was noted to involve the central aspects of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and splenic vein (SV). All intrahepatic portal veins, which were non-aneurysmal, were also thrombosed. The segmental and non-aneurysmal SMV branches were patent, as was the non-aneurysmal peripheral segment of the splenic vein. Mesenteric edema was noted, though bowel enhancement was present. Subsequent abdominal MRI with a T1 fat-saturated dynamic contrast enhanced sequence excluded an underlying portal vein tumor thrombus and an arteriovenous shunt. The liver parenchyma appeared normal without signs of cirrhosis. There was no splenomegaly or varices to suggest chronic portal hypertension. The patient's ducts were non-dilated, and the arteries appeared normal without signs of an underlying vasculitis.

Ten days after an above knee amputation, this 62-year-old woman became acutely anaemic (haemoglobin drop of 10.4 to 6.2). Clinically, she had no obvious source of bleeding; however, on examination, her abdomen was slightly distended and she was tender over the suprapubic area. A CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis was arranged which showed a large haematoma (17 × 11 cm) arising from the anterior abdominal wall from the deep aspect of the left rectus abdominus, extending across the midline to the right rectus abdominus and deep into the pelvis. This may have been spontaneous or may have been due to direct injury when injecting subcutaneous heparin.

### How to approach thrombocytopenia [^6950a17d]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic finding with variable clinical expression. A low platelet count may be the initial manifestation of infections such as HIV and hepatitis C virus or it may reflect the activity of life-threatening disorders such as the thrombotic microangiopathies. A correct identification of the causes of thrombocytopenia is crucial for the appropriate management of these patients. In this review, we present a systematic evaluation of adults with thrombocytopenia. The approach is clearly different between outpatients, who are frequently asymptomatic and in whom we can sometimes indulge in sophisticated and relatively lengthy investigations, and the dramatic presentation of acute thrombocytopenia in the emergency department or in the intensive care unit, which requires immediate intervention and for which only a few diagnostic tests are available. A brief discussion of the most common etiologies seen in both settings is provided.

Objective

The objective of this article is to illustrate the causes of a gasless abdomen in an adult.

Conclusion

The gasless abdomen in the adult is often interpreted as nonspecific, which does not provide useful information for the patient's physician. There are at least six causes of the gasless abdomen in the adult. A specific cause of the gasless abdomen can usually be made when the patient's history is known. The most serious cause of the gasless abdomen is small-bowel obstruction with or without ischemia.

### Practical guide to the diagnosis and management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^892d71d2]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune reaction to heparin associated with thrombocytopenia, thrombotic risk, and a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Given the frequent use of heparin and the common occurrence of thrombocytopenia in hospitalized patients, the diagnosis and management of HIT is a recurrent challenge in everyday inpatient care. This article presents practical guidance and tools to support the individual clinician providing evidence-based care to patients with suspected or confirmed HIT. The optimal diagnostic evaluation requires the stepwise use of risk-stratification tools and laboratory assays. Management requires the selection and use of nonheparin anticoagulation in these complex patients with both increased thrombotic risk and possible concurrent increased bleeding risk due to thrombocytopenia. Each step in the diagnostic and management process has important nuances and complexities, many of which vary based on patient characteristics and institutional resources. Given the many challenges of HIT care, truly practical management is best achieved when tools are implemented to support the delivery of consistent, high quality, and cost-effective care across health systems.

### Warfarin initiation and monitoring with clotting factors II, VII, and X [^1e215e5d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of a patient with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and multiple thromboses who developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and subsequent international normalized ratio (INR) prolongation possibly due to antiphospholipid antibodies.

Case Summary

A 56-year-old white woman with a history of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and thrombosis taking chronic warfarin was admitted for gastrointestinal concerns and found to have an INR > 14. Warfarin was discontinued, vitamin K was administered, and a heparin infusion was initiated. Over the next 2 days, thrombocytopenia, hypotension, tachycardia, hyponatremia, and progressive abdominal pain developed. Upon transfer to a tertiary care center, HIT was diagnosed, and a lepirudin infusion was initiated. Subsequently, a sudden elevation of the INR occurred (> 14) with low prothrombin (factor II) activity. After INR values declined to 2–3, warfarin was reinitiated with dosing adjusted using factor X and II activity levels. Clotting factors II and X activities were measured to monitor long-term warfarin therapy, with no evidence of complications after 7 months.

Discussion

Typically, the INR is used to assess the intensity of anticoagulation. The INR value represents the reduction of clotting factors II, VII, and X. In rare circumstances, an independent inhibitor or interfering substance can interfere with the process of measuring the INR. In such situations, an alternative approach can be direct measurement of clotting factor concentrations.

Conclusions

Factor II and/or factor X activity levels provided an alternative means for measuring the anticoagulant effects of warfarin in the presence of a significant inhibitor (antiphospholipid antibodies) that biased the INR measurements.

### Emergency department diagnosis of postprocedural hemorrhagic cholecystitis utilizing point-of-care ultrasound [^30664c0c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemorrhagic cholecystitis is a rare cause of abdominal pain. Most often described in the setting of blunt abdominal trauma, anticoagulation use, coagulopathy (such as cirrhosis or renal failure), and malignancy (biliary angiosarcoma), this rare condition can be difficult to identify unless high on the differential. With point-of-care ultrasound becoming more commonplace in the emergency department (ED), this tool can be successfully used to make a timely diagnosis in the correct clinical context.

Case Report

A 64-year-old man with a past medical history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation status post ablation on rivaroxaban, myelodysplastic syndrome, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, clonal cytopenias of undetermined significance, hypertension, and chronic pain presented to the ED with complaints of right upper quadrant pain in the setting of a recent transjugular liver biopsy. Using point-of-care ultrasound, the patient was diagnosed with hemorrhagic cholecystitis. This is an incredibly rare entity, with 87 documented cases in the literature, only two of which are in the setting of transjugular liver biopsy. The patient was ultimately managed conservatively until he had worsening symptoms, and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and recovered. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Hemorrhagic cholecystitis is a rare pathology that can be easily recognized during point-of-care ultrasound examination. This allows for rapid diagnosis and surgical consultation to provide the patient with timely definitive management.

### Approach to acute abdominal pain [^7b543031]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the emergency department patient with acute abdominal pain may be challenging. Many factors can obscure the clinical findings leading to incorrect diagnosis and subsequent adverse outcomes. Clinicians must consider multiple diagnoses with limited time and information, giving priority to life-threatening conditions that require expeditious management to avoid morbidity and mortality. This article seeks to provide the clinician with the clinical tools to achieve these goals by reviewing the anatomic and physiological basis of abdominal pain and key components of the history and the physical examination. In addition, this article discusses the approach to unstable patients with abdominal pain.

Thrombocytopenia, usually defined as a platelet count of less than 150,000/μL, is a common reason for a hematology consult in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. In most patients, the cause of the thrombocytopenia can be identified and treated. This article reviews the clinical approach to the patient with thrombocytopenia, the mechanisms that underlie it, and the laboratory tests available to investigate it. A practical approach to the investigation and management of thrombocytopenia in the clinical settings commonly encountered by the hematology consultant is then described.

### Diagnoses of exclusion in the workup of abdominal complaints [^8feea1c7]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common complaint in the emergency department, comprising 8.8% of all visits. Despite advances in medicine and imaging, 20% to 30% of patients still leave the department without a definitive diagnosis, whichhis can be both distressing for patients and unsatisfying for providers. Diagnoses of exclusion can be perilous, and their application should be carefully considered in order to not overlook more emergent complaints. However, a working knowledge of diagnoses of exclusion can guide therapeutics and specialty referrals that can ultimately provide answers and relief to a patient population often at odds with available information and expectations.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) — diagnostic and initial management algorithm directs clinicians to calculate a 4Ts score and branch by probability into intermediate/high clinical probability (4Ts score ≥ 4) and low clinical probability (4Ts score ≤ 3). For intermediate/high probability, "Discontinue heparin; Start non-heparin anticoagulant," then "Obtain immunoassay"; if positive, "Continue to avoid heparin; Continue non-heparin anticoagulant" and "Obtain functional assay," and if the functional assay is positive, "HIT likely; See 'Management of the acute phase of HIT' for management recommendations." For low probability, "Do not order or stop HIT lab testing; Continue/resume heparin if indicated; Discontinue non-heparin anticoagulant (if applicable)." Every effort should be made to obtain accurate and complete information necessary to calculate the 4Ts score, and "Patients should be reassessed frequently. If there is a change in the clinical picture, the 4Ts score should be recalculated."

### Thrombocytopenia: evaluation and management [^c9475176]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a platelet count of less than 150 × 103 per μL and can occur from decreased platelet production, increased destruction, splenic sequestration, or dilution or clumping. Patients with a platelet count greater than 50 × 103 per μL are generally asymptomatic. Patients with platelet counts between 20 and 50 × 103 per μL may have mild skin manifestations such as petechiae, purpura, or ecchymosis. Patients with platelet counts of less than 10 × 103 per μL have a high risk of serious bleeding. Although thrombocytopenia is classically associated with bleeding, there are conditions in which bleeding and thrombosis can occur, such as antiphospholipid syndrome, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic microangiopathies. Patients with isolated thrombocytopenia in the absence of systemic illness most likely have immune thrombocytopenia or drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In stable patients being evaluated as outpatients, the first step is to exclude pseudothrombocytopenia by collecting blood in a tube containing heparin or sodium citrate and repeating the platelet count. If thrombocytopenia is confirmed, the next step is to distinguish acute from chronic thrombocytopenia by obtaining or reviewing previous platelet counts. Patients with acute thrombocytopenia may require hospitalization. Common causes that require emergency hospitalization are heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathies, and the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. Common nonemergency causes of thrombocytopenia include drug-induced thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenia, and hepatic disease. Transfusion of platelets is recommended when patients have active hemorrhage or when platelet counts are less than 10 × 103 per μL, in addition to treatment (when possible) of underlying causative conditions. It is important to ensure adequate platelet counts to decrease bleeding risk before invasive procedures; this may also require a platelet transfusion. Patients with platelet counts of less than 50 × 103 per μL should adhere to activity restrictions to avoid trauma-associated bleeding.

### How to perform a critical appraisal of diagnostic tests: 7 steps [^f155fd78]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

The critically appraised topic (CAT) is a format in evidence-based practice for sharing information. A CAT is a standardized way of summarizing the most current research evidence focused on a pertinent clinical question. Its aim is to provide both a critique of the most up-to-date retrieved research and an indication of the clinical relevance of results. A clinical question is initially generated following a patient encounter, which leads to and directs a literature search to answer the clinical question. Studies obtained from the literature search are assigned a level of evidence. This allows the most valid and relevant articles to be selected and to be critically appraised. The results are summarized, and this information is translated into clinically useful procedures and processes.

Extramedullary haematopoiesis (EMH) is defined as haematopoiesis occurring in organs outside the bone marrow. The liver is one of the rare sites of EMH, and to the best of our knowledge, a few cases of adult EMH of the liver have been reported in the last 20 years. Here, we reported the case of a 68-year-old man with a known history of myelofibrosis presented with vague abdominal pain. An abdominal CT scan showed a hypoattenuating periportal mass encasing the portal vein. The final diagnosis of EMH was made through the histopathological examination. This is a rare presentation of EMH, which may be easily mistaken for other pathologies such as metastases. Familiarity with this type of presentation aids in correctly diagnosing it in an appropriate clinical setting.

INITIAL EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT

The workup for a patient with concerns of a ventral abdominal wall or groin hernia begins with a thorough history and physical examination (Figs. 1). It is essential that the physical examination include all potential sites of abdominal wall hernia, including the groin and perineal areas, especially in patients with more vague presenting symptoms. Incarcerated hernias, especially in the groin, can be easily missed by a more superficial examination. After the diagnosis of a hernia has been made, the specific location, surgical history, associated symptoms, and patient-specific factors will help determine the appropriate next steps in management. History should focus on the duration of symptoms, prior episodes of hernia incarceration, past surgical history, and evidence of systemic signs of illness, including fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or skin changes overlying the hernia. Physical examination should evaluate the location of the hernia, the size of the fascial defect, the presence of hernia incarceration, and any redness or ecchymosis of the overlying skin. For a well-defined localized fascial defect, adding imaging to the initial diagnostic workup is of unclear benefit and is not mandatory. If there are concerns for a complicated abdominal wall hernia, based on either patient factors or hernia variables, additional workup should be considered, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained to include a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and lactate.
The determination of the need and urgency for surgical repair will depend on multiple factors. Patients with a reducible hernia, improvement in symptoms, no evidence of complications, and an otherwise normal physical examination should be referred for outpatient surgical follow-up to discuss elective hernia repair. Patients with concern for abdominal wall hernia complications, including strangulation, intestinal obstruction, hernia incarceration, unrelieved severe pain, overlying skin changes, or evidence of systemic illness, should be seen by an acute care surgeon. Ideally, surgical evaluation should precede imaging in patients with nonreducible hernias and worrisome findings on physical examination.
Patients with an incarcerated hernia and concern for strangulation or presence of peritonitis require prompt surgical intervention, as increased time from onset of symptoms to operative intervention is associated with an increased need for bowel resection. Signs of bowel incarceration causing obstruction (nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, and obstipation), in addition to severe pain at the hernia site, are suggestive of strangulation. Systemic signs of strangulation may include hypotension and tachycardia, with elevations in serum lactate (> 2.0 mmol/L) and white blood cell often (although not definitively) found on initial laboratory evaluation. Physical examination may also show erythema or bruising/discoloration of the skin overlying the hernia. When these findings are present, or the patient is otherwise deemed at risk for strangulation within the hernia, an emergent exploration should be undertaken, with assessment of the viability of involved bowel, reduction of the hernia, and definitive hernia repair if practical. In many cases, imaging is not required and may lead to unnecessary delay. Similar to other EGS procedures, patients requiring acute urgent operation for hernia complications are at increased risk of complication compared with their elective counterparts.
In circumstances of diagnostic uncertainty or a difficult-to-interpret examination (as can be found in obesity), imaging should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate for high-risk imaging features associated with strangulation. While ultrasound can be used to help with the initial diagnosis, cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography scan is preferred. Even when the diagnosis of hernia is confidently made on physical examination, computed tomography imaging can provide useful clinical information on the fascial defect size and hernia contents to evaluate for signs of intestinal obstruction or ischemia. In the absence of a high index of suspicion for strangulation, attempts should be made to reduce an incarcerated abdominal wall hernia unless it is known that the patient has had a chronically nonreducible incarcerated hernia. Acute hernia incarceration that is not reducible should prompt urgent operative intervention to reduce the hernia, evaluate for the viability of the incarcerated bowel, and repair the hernia defect.
Acutely incarcerated hernias that are reducible but have high-risk features (Table 1) on imaging or physical examination should favor urgent repair (defined as nonemergent but performed during the index admission). These features are related to the patient's presentation and imaging findings. Clinical high-risk features include persistent abdominal pain after reduction or persistent nausea/vomiting. Radiographic findings associated with a higher risk for hernia complications should be considered when determining the need for urgent surgery in patients without clear signs of strangulation. Beyond the typical signs of bowel ischemia (e.g. pneumatosis, portal venous gas, or free air), the presence of fluid within the hernia sac, a transition point of the bowel at the neck of the hernia, bowel thickening within the hernia, and inflammatory stranding in the tissue along the hernia are considered high-risk features.
While repair of a hernia on initial presentation may be ideal, patient factors or local capacity may not permit this to be reasonably performed in all settings. Patient-specific factors should be considered, including age, frailty, American Society of Anesthesia score, and preadmission anticoagulant use, as each of these variables is associated with an increased risk of complications. – Some patients with hernias that exhibit a higher risk of recurrence may be discharged but with a defined plan to repair it in the short term to minimize patients' loss of follow-up. Variables associated with a higher risk of recurrence include clinical factors and radiographic features of the hernia (Table 2). Acute onset and escalation of symptoms should be considered potential reasons to hasten repair. The need for conscious sedation to achieve a successful visceral reduction marks patients as higher risk, and they should undergo expedited repair (when performed within 4 weeks, reincarceration rates of ~2% have been reported). High-risk anatomical features include certain types of hernias with femoral and Spigelian hernias exhibiting a higher incarceration rate and need for emergent repair; therefore, these should be addressed promptly. Women with groin hernia have a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery compared with men, especially if a femoral hernia is present. The size of the fascial defect is an unreliable predictor of the need for urgent repair, but primary hernia defects between 3 and 4 cm are at higher overall risk of incarceration compared with smaller or larger defects (with a rate of 10%; odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.91–5.74; p < 0.0001). Specific measurements comparing the width of a fascial defect and the height of the hernia sack can also be used to estimate an increased risk with a "mushrooming hernia," one with a narrow neck as compared with height creating an acute angle with the abdominal wall being associated with a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% confidence interval, 2.24–20.00). Similarly, a study by James et al.identified the ratio of hernia size to fascial defect (neck) as a potential aid in surgical decision-making, finding that a hernia-to-neck ratio > 2.5 predicted the need for emergent repair. Patients presenting to the ED with acute abdominal wall hernia symptoms who do not have an indication for urgent surgery are at high risk of being lost to follow-up. A prior multicenter study of patients with an ED visit for hernia-related symptoms showed that over 50% did not follow up in the outpatient clinic, with 20% returning to the ED with additional hernia-related complaints. Considering socioeconomic factors and health care disparities to determine the need for operative intervention at the index admission will address low clinic follow-up rates and prevent future ED resource utilization. When immediate repair is not required, an effort should be made to ensure follow-up and initiate planning for definitive repair before the patient is discharged from the ED or the inpatient setting. The ability to follow-up in the outpatient clinic and access to elective, outpatient surgery should also be considered.
Nonurgent repair or repair after patient optimization prior to surgery can be pursued for symptomatic hernias without high-risk features. These patients can likely be safely discharged from the ED with elective outpatient follow-up. If modifiable patient risk factors are identified at the time of hernia diagnosis (such as smoking, need for weight loss, or control of diabetes), these should be addressed before surgery. If the hernia is deemed complex, its eventual repair should be scheduled when patient optimization has been achieved and performed by a surgeon experienced in complex abdominal wall reconstruction techniques. Prediction of the need for component separation can be a subjective determination or made in various ways using data from cross-sectional imaging comparing aspects of the hernia to the remaining abdominal wall. Watchful waiting and outpatient follow-up may be considered for asymptomatic ventral, inguinal, and umbilical hernias found incidentally on imaging. While these have a reasonably high rate of requiring an eventual repair, it is likely safe to monitor these hernias after the patient has received counseling on monitoring the hernia for symptoms in the future.

Case report

A 58-year-old man visited the emergency department with hypovolemic shock. His chief complaint was the sudden onset of epigastric pain with abdominal distension lasting 6 h. Physical examination revealed an ill appearance with a blood pressure of 60/40 mmHg and a pulse rate of 132/min. Conjunctiva were pale but not icteric. Breath sounds were clear, and heart sounds were regular and without murmurs. The patient had negative history of hepatitis B, hepatitis C or trauma. Hemoglobin was 6.9 g/dl, white blood count was 15,800/mm3 and platelet count was 176,000/mm 3. Liver function tests were within the normal range [serum alanine transaminase 35 IU/l (normal: 5–40 IU/l), serum aspartate transaminase 18 IU/l (normal: 8–40 IU/l), gamma glutamyltranspeptidase 16 IU/l (normal: < 30 IU/l), alkaline phosphatase 38 IU/l, total billibubin 0.6 mg/dl, direct billibubin 0.3 mg/dl]. Prothrombin time and International Normalized Ratio (INR) were prolonged with prothrombin time of 16.4 s (normal: 10.2–13.6), and INR of 1.43 (PT ratio). Abdominal contrast enhanced CT imaging revealed a mass invading the diaphragm with contrast extravasation in the left, lateral segment of the liver (Figure 1, and Figure 2). Fluid collection was found in the upper abdomen, subhepatic area, flanks, and the pelvic cavity. Imaging also revealed the presence of a ruptured abdominal mass (Figure 3). The exploratory laparotomy discovered 3000 mL of blood in the abdominal cavity. The liver was non-cirrhotic, and there was an actively bleeding invasive tumor in the left lateral triangular ligament of the liver. The tumor was resected with an appropriate margin and the specimen was histologically confirmed as a 5-cm HCC with negative margin. The post-operative course was unremarkable, and the patient was discharged on the 10th day post-surgery.

Recommendations — diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) for non-specific acute abdominal pain: DL is technically feasible and can be applied safely in appropriately selected patients with acute non-specific abdominal pain (grade B). The procedure should be avoided in patients with hemodynamic instability and may have a limited role in patients with severe abdominal distention or a clear indication for laparotomy (grade C). The procedure should be considered in patients without a specific diagnosis after appropriate clinical examination and imaging studies (grade C). Based on the available evidence, an invasive procedure cannot be recommended before other non-invasive diagnostic options have been exhausted. DL may be superior to observation for nonspecific abdominal pain, but evidence is mixed and a firm recommendation is difficult; DL may be preferable to exploratory laparotomy in appropriately selected patients with an indication for operative intervention provided that laparoscopic expertise is available (grade C).

Abstract.

SARS-CoV-2 infection can present with various clinical features, among which gastrointestinal manifestations such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and mild abdominal pain have been reported. Recognition of rare presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection has increased over time. These atypical and rare presentations may lead to difficulties in establishing the diagnosis in a timely manner; furthermore, they may lead to unnecessary investigations, extended hospital stays, adverse outcomes, and more strain on healthcare resources. We present three cases admitted to our hospital with a picture that mimicked an acute abdomen, necessitating surgical assessment and evaluation. All cases turned out to be SARS-CoV-2 positive and did not require surgical management. We discuss the management course, highlight the importance of abdominal symptoms in the setting of COVID-19, and discuss the implications of this association for medical practice amid the current pandemic in both resource-rich and resource-limited settings.

Case presentation

A 63-year-old woman with a history of idiopathic hemochromatosis and treatment with phlebotomies was admitted to our emergency department with a 2-day history of right abdominal pain, which she described as colicky, and clinical characteristics of intestinal obstruction. She complained of acute retention of gas and flatus and she had no bowel movements in the previous 3 days. She also complained of nausea, vomiting and no food intake. The patient reported anorexia, severe weakness and weight loss of 12 kg over a period of 6 months. On physical examination, her abdomen was markedly tender at the right iliac fossa and a vague mass was palpated. Her bowel sounds were of obstructive type. The biochemical evaluation tests were within normal limits. The most important laboratory findings were elevated α-fetoprotein (> 800 ng/ml) and cancer antigen 125 (51.2 U/ml). HBV and HCV serum blood tests investigated in the past were negative. Abdominal X-ray showed opacity in the right upper abdomen, displacing the small bowel loops, and a few radiological signs of intestinal obstruction. The patient had clinically abdominal distention and features of intestinal obstruction on physical examination therefore, ultrasound was not performed. She also reported a history of liver hemangioma that was diagnosed 10 years previously. Following computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), without administration of intravenous contrast agent, a large (14 × 12.5 cm) well-defined, heterogeneous mass of unclear origin and nature was detected between the right hepatic lobe and the colon. The mass appeared hyper-dense on T 1 - and T 2 - weighted images compared with the surrounding lower-signal-intensity liver tissue. No invasion into the liver or adjacent organs was demonstrated (Figure 1).

Case presentation

A healthy 44-year-old man with no medical or surgical history presented to the Emergency Department with 2 days history of abdominal pain associated with bloating and constipation. There was h/o not passing flatus or motion since morning. Abdominal pain was generalised, and has been progressing in severity and associated with abdominal distension. There was h/o vomiting of 1 episode — the oral contrast. The patient gave a significant history around 1 year back of partial small bowel obstruction that was treated conservatively.

On arrival in the A&E, he was tachycardic with a pulse rate of 111 beats perminute. The patient was well built.

Abdominal examination revealed a distended abdomen that was soft, with no localised tenderness or palpable masses. There was an umbilical hernia defect of 1 cm that was fully reducible. Digital rectal examination showed soft stool, with no blood.

His labs showed the following: haemoglobin 14.9 g/dl, white blood cells 10.7 x10^9/L, neutrophils 8.5 x10^9/L, platelets 283 x10^9/L and C reactive protein 14.5 mg/L. Other lab tests were normal, including renal function tests, lactate and coagulation.

His abdominal x-ray showed hugely dilated small bowel, with air seen in the rectum, consistent with partial bowel obstruction.

He underwent CT abdomen (Figure 1) which showed the following:

Because of the unexplained thrombocytopenia, he returned the following day. A repeat complete blood count showed a platelet count of 52 × 10 9 /L that remained unexplained. The next day, he presented to our emergency department with worsening leg pain. He was otherwise asymptomatic postvaccination.

On presentation, he reported left leg pain regardless of position, and physical examination revealed left leg venous distention and erythema upon standing. When asked about COVID vaccine status, he reported that he had not previously been asked. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated worsening thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 43 × 10 9 /L, elevated prothrombin time of 16.3 seconds (international normalized ratio 1.4), elevated activated partial thromboplastin time of 35 seconds, decreased fibrinogen of 110 mg/dL, and markedly elevated-dimer of > 14 000 ng/mL. A lower extremity ultrasound was again negative for thrombosis from the proximal femoral vein to the ankle. Chest/abdomen/pelvis computed tomography with contrast demonstrated no thrombosis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed patent sinuses without thrombosis. VITT was suspected given his vaccination history, symptoms, and laboratory findings. He was admitted and started on 1 g/kg of IVIG daily for 2 days to increase his platelet count and given 1 mg/kg of prednisone.

### Abdominal compartment syndrome [^b6432c0d]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to discuss the pathogenesis, clinical features, radiologic findings, and treatment of abdominal compartment syndrome, which is defined as an acute elevation of the intraabdominal pressure with organ dysfunction.

Conclusion

Abdominal compartment syndrome is not well reported in the radiology literature. In this review, we discuss a range of CT signs such as elevated diaphragm, collapsed inferior vena cava, bowel wall thickening, bowel mucosal hyperenhancement, hemoperitoneum, and increasing abdominal girth, which, in combination, may allow the radiologist to raise the possibility of abdominal compartment syndrome.

### A newborn with abdominal pain [^39b0b41d]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

A previously healthy 3-week-old boy presented with 5 hours of marked fussiness, abdominal distention, and poor feeding. He was afebrile and well perfused. His examination was remarkable for localized abdominal tenderness and distention. He was referred to the emergency department in which an abdominal radiograph revealed gaseous distention of the bowel with a paucity of gas in the pelvis. Complete blood cell count and urinalysis were unremarkable. His ongoing fussiness and abnormal physical examination prompted consultation with surgery and radiology. Our combined efforts ultimately established an unexpected diagnosis.

### Abdominal hereditary angio-oedema caught on magnetic resonance imaging [^297bb52e]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Investigations

Initial blood on the latest admission was reported as follows: CRP 14 mg/L, white cell count 21×10 9 /L, platelets 496×10 9 /L, with a normal haemoglobin and amylase. Three transabdominal ultrasounds were performed during an attack of pain during previous admissions and revealed free fluid in the pelvis with normal appearances of all other organs. An MRI scan of the small bowel was completed within 24 hours of presentation, which revealed extensive submucosal oedema of the jejunum with normal appearances of the mucosa and a moderate volume of ascites (figure 1). Repeat MRI scan of the small bowel was sought 72 hours later and confirmed near-complete resolution of these abnormalities, and only a small volume of ascites remained (figure 2).

### An approach to the patient with chronic undiagnosed abdominal pain [^804394ba]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for referral to a gastroenterologist. The workup of patients with chronic abdominal pain can be extremely challenging as clinicians are responsible for determining whether the patient can be observed or treated symptomatically or this abdominal pain heralds a more systemic disease. The differential is typically wide and given the innervation of the abdomen, localization of abdominal pain does not always provide clear insight into the etiology. This review attempts to help the gastroenterologist narrow down that broad differential and focus on key elements of the patient visit. We emphasize the importance of a detailed history from the patient, along with review-specific details of their history and physical examination that can clue one in about the etiology of the abdominal pain. We review the causes of diffuse abdominal pain that may not first be considered along with uncommon causes of localized abdominal pain. We also review the functional causes of abdominal pain and the importance of identifying these disorders, to avoid unnecessary testing that commonly occurs with these patients.

### Fondaparinux sodium [^d039ae8e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Thrombocytopenia

Thrombocytopenia can occur with the administration of fondaparinux sodium. Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. Discontinue fondaparinux sodium if the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3. Moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet counts between 100,000/mm3 and 50,000/mm3) occurred at a rate of 3% in patients given fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg in the peri-operative hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery and abdominal surgery clinical trials. Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet counts less than 50,000/mm3) occurred at a rate of 0.2% in patients given fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg in these clinical trials. During extended prophylaxis, no cases of moderate or severe thrombocytopenia were reported.

Moderate thrombocytopenia occurred at a rate of 0.5% in patients given the fondaparinux sodium treatment regimen in the DVT and PE treatment clinical trials. Severe thrombocytopenia occurred at a rate of 0.04% in patients given the fondaparinux sodium treatment regimen in the DVT and PE treatment clinical trials.

Occurrences of thrombocytopenia with thrombosis that manifested similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia have been reported with the use of fondaparinux sodium in postmarketing experience [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.6 Monitoring: Laboratory Tests

Routine coagulation tests such as Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are relatively insensitive measures of the activity of fondaparinux sodium and international standards of heparin or LMWH are not calibrators to measure anti-Factor Xa activity of fondaparinux sodium. If unexpected changes in coagulation parameters or major bleeding occur during therapy with fondaparinux sodium, discontinue fondaparinux sodium. In postmarketing experience, occurrences of aPTT elevations have been reported following administration of fondaparinux sodium [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Periodic routine complete blood counts (including platelet count), serum creatinine level, and stool occult blood tests are recommended during the course of treatment with fondaparinux sodium.

The anti-Factor Xa activity of fondaparinux sodium can be measured by anti-Xa assay using the appropriate calibrator (fondaparinux). The activity of fondaparinux sodium is expressed in milligrams (mg) of the fondaparinux and cannot be compared with activities of heparin or low molecular weight heparins [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3)].

### Choosing a culture medium: making informed choices [^f6b85a39]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze critically the reasons justifying the choice of two-step protocols requiring two media for the culture of human preimplantation embryos from the zygote to the blastocyst.

Design

Literature review.

Result(S)

Two types of protocol are used for the culture of human preimplantation embryos from the zygote to the blastocyst, using either one medium (one-step protocol) or two media of different composition (two-step protocol). Two-step protocols are the most widely used, largely because all but one of the commercially available protocols are of this type. The reasons for the adoption of two-step protocols are described and critically analyzed. They are based on considerations of the functions of glucose, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), glutamine, and amino acids that are included in the media. A reappraisal of the reasons for selecting two-step protocols is important because recent animal experiments and clinical observations have raised doubts as to whether the more complex, two-step protocols have any advantage over one-step protocols. The analyses show that all of conclusions reached should be considered equivocal.

Conclusion(S)

Clinical embryologists should evaluate the justification for selecting two-step protocols for the culture of human preimplantation embryos from the zygote to the blastocyst.

### AGA clinical practice update on evaluation and management of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention: expert review [^0ed4201f]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic testing and imaging for bloating and distention — testing is selective and guided by alarm features and examination. "Symptoms of bloating and distention do not routinely require laboratory testing or obtaining radiologic imaging or endoscopy unless the history discloses concerning symptoms, an abdominal physical examination, or alarm features." The authors "advise ordering tests with worsening dyspepsia or abdominal pain, particularly of recent onset; vomiting; GI bleeding; unintentional weight loss > 10% of body weight; chronic diarrhea; or a family history of GI malignancy, CD, or inflammatory bowel disease." If visible abdominal distension is present, "an abdominal examination will help to evaluate for an abdominal mass," and with abnormal findings, "Any abnormalities would lead to a computed tomography scan or ultrasound of the abdomen to evaluate for ascites or a mass or to identify increased bowel gas due to ileus, obstruction, or pseudo-obstruction." The text adds, "Bloating and abdominal fullness are often presenting symptoms in patients with ovarian cancer; the highest risk is in women 50 years or older."

### Intravenous warfarin and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: making the diagnosis, management, modern monitoring, and multidisciplinary care [^67350763]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the diagnosis, management, and monitoring of a patient with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) with thrombosis and simultaneous bleeding risk treated with argatroban and transitioned to intravenous (IV) warfarin secondary to the inability to administer enteral medications.

Case Summary

A 71-year-old man was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) following aortic valve repair, coronary artery bypass, and ascending aortic aneurysm repair. On postoperative day 9, he was found to have a pulmonary embolism, and therapeutic heparin was started. The following day, his platelet count was found to have dropped precipitously. HIT was diagnosed, heparin was discontinued, and argatroban was initiated. On postoperative day 22, anticoagulation was discontinued because of massive gastrointestinal bleeding. On postoperative day 35, multiple venous thromboses were found, and argatroban was restarted. The patient developed a high-output enterocutaneous fistula, eliminating the option of enteral route of medication administration. The multidisciplinary SICU team transitioned the patient from argatroban to IV warfarin for long-term anticoagulation. The international normalized ratio was monitored and remained therapeutic throughout his admission without further thrombotic complications.

Discussion

HIT occurs when antibodies develop to heparin-platelet factor 4 complexes, causing simultaneous hypercoagulability and thrombocytopenia. It is diagnosed based on both clinical factors and laboratory testing. Treatment includes discontinuation of all forms of heparin; initiation of a nonheparin anticoagulant, such as argatroban; and transition to warfarin.

Conclusions

IV warfarin is a therapeutic option for patients with malabsorption issues. A multidisciplinary team in an intensive care setting optimizes cost-effective, patient-centered, and safe care.

Box 3
Examples to illustrate nature of deaths judged to be preventable

A female patient in her early 80s presenting with watery diarrhoea where the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease took 18 days despite a past history of the disease. The patient had deteriorated significantly before appropriate treatment was commenced and failed to respond.

A middle aged male patient who developed infection at the site of a pharyngeal pouch excision. Antibiotic treatment was continued despite a failure to improve and subsequent open drainage proved too late.

A male patient in his 60s with previous history of ischaemic heart disease and treated carcinoma of the bladder (with no evidence of progression/ recurrence) underwent an unnecessary therapeutic ascitic tap when misdiagnosed as recurrent cancer when the actual diagnosis was congestive cardiac failure. He suffered a myocardial infarction after the procedure and went into multi-organ failure.

An obese woman in her 40s who presented with malaise, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, early saity and night sweats. The diagnosis of ovarian malignancy took 21 days to confirm. On day 19 the patient's breathlessness and tachycardia were treated as a chest infection. Two days later she collapsed and subsequently died from pulmonary embolism. No risk assessment undertaken or thromboprophylaxis prescribed during stay.

A 30 year old man with a history of drug and alcohol use admitted with worsening shortness of breath and green sputum. Initially condition treated as a community acquired pneumonia until CT scan showed possible lung abscess or empyema. Patient developed clostridium difficile diarrhoea which delayed chest drainage and then went on to have a cardiac arrest when an attempt at drain insertion was subsequently made on the ward. Following transfer to the intensive care unit and drain insertion he continued to deteriorate and died.

A female patient in her 80s on warfarin for atrial fibrillation and admitted with an infected finger which had been treated with a combination of antibiotics by her general practitioner. Despite daily warfarin at a dose of 1mg being continued, the international normalised ratio (INR) was not checked until day 3, 1-day after blood was first noted in her stools. When the INR was found to be well above therapeutic levels at 10, vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma were administered with the clinical team commenting that a preferred treatment was not available at the time. Despite ongoing resuscitation she continued to deteriorate and died.

### An 18-year-old with acute-on-chronic abdominal pain [^4889bbb3]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with 2 days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous 5 months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over 4 months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation. Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase. She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis. Our expert panel reviews her hospital course and elucidates the management of our eventual diagnosis.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of GPI‐associated thrombocytopenia usually begins with the report of a low platelet count from of an automated cell counter, but sometimes it begins with the onset of hemorrhagic symptoms resulting in the ordering of an unscheduled platelet count. Because thrombocytopenia may occur rapidly and be asymptomatic, a platelet count should be performed 2 to 4 hours after the bolus dose of the GPI and 24 hours later. Low platelet counts should be confirmed with inspection of the blood smear. The presence of red blood cell schistocytes would suggest the possibility of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or disseminated intravascular coagulation, whereas platelet clumps would indicate that the automated count is likely an underestimate, most likely due to platelet clumping induced by the standard blood cell count anticoagulant EDTA. Because the platelet aggregates may be mistaken for leukocytes by the automated counter, a reciprocal increase in white blood cells may be observed. This anticoagulant‐dependent platelet clumping phenomenon is termed pseudothrombocytopenia and the presumptive diagnosis is usually confirmed by finding a higher platelet count and loss of the platelet clumps upon repeating the platelet count with blood anticoagulated with citrate. Platelet clumping may also be present in citrated blood, and this may be more common with GPI‐associated pseudothrombocytopenia, and under these conditions, heparin or magnesium sulfate may be better anticoagulants.
