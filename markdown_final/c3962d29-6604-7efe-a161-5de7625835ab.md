## Question

How does the management of flash pulmonary edema in pregnancy differ from that in non-pregnant patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the management of flash pulmonary edema in pregnancy differs from that in non-pregnant patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining flash pulmonary edema and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the unique maternal physiology that alters risk and treatment thresholds in pregnancy. Next, I will compare immediate stabilization priorities, including oxygenation, ventilation, and hemodynamics. After that, I need to examine pharmacologic choices and what to avoid in pregnancy. I will then consider etiologic workup and when to deliver. Finally, I should review monitoring, multidisciplinary care, and summarize the key differences with supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Flash pulmonary edema is a rapid-onset, life-threatening form of acute decompensated heart failure characterized by abrupt respiratory failure with pulmonary congestion, often driven by a sympathetic surge, severe hypertension, or acute LV diastolic dysfunction, and it mandates immediate preload and afterload reduction with ventilatory support [^d83e5a4f] [^09feac56].

> Now, I need to check the pregnancy-specific physiology that changes the game. Pregnancy increases plasma volume, cardiac output, and heart rate while decreasing systemic vascular resistance and plasma oncotic pressure; these changes lower the threshold for pulmonary edema and magnify the risk from capillary leak, especially in preeclampsia where hypervolemia is absent and aggressive fluids can precipitate pulmonary edema, so I should be cautious about fluid administration and tailor hemodynamic targets to pregnancy norms [^c69d2736] [^fc64d488] [^983cfaae].

> Next, I should review immediate stabilization. Oxygenation and ventilation come first: I initially thought to avoid noninvasive ventilation in late pregnancy due to aspiration risk, but wait, let me verify that. The ERS/ATS guideline supports CPAP or bilevel NIV for cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and pregnancy-specific guidance allows NIV with appropriate precautions, so I should correct that assumption and use NIV when indicated while protecting the airway and monitoring closely [^387318a7] [^55ffe78b]. Positioning with left lateral tilt reduces aortocaval compression and improves venous return, which is a simple, high-yield maneuver in gravid patients [^55ffe78b].

> I will now examine hemodynamic management. In nonpregnant patients, IV nitrates, clevidipine, or nitroprusside are standard for afterload reduction in hypertensive pulmonary edema, and beta-blockers are generally avoided acutely; in pregnancy, I should confirm that nitroglycerin is preferred for preeclampsia-associated pulmonary edema and that ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and nitroprusside are contraindicated due to fetal risk, while hydralazine, labetalol, or nicardipine are appropriate for severe hypertension control in preeclampsia [^833ef130] [^e396b185] [^d613ad6a] [^ab5ccabd]. Hold on, I should verify the role of high-dose nitroglycerin protocols; although evidence is limited, case-based protocols for SCAPE endorse carefully titrated high-dose nitroglycerin to rapidly reduce preload and afterload, and this approach can be adapted in pregnancy with close monitoring for hypotension [^09feac56].

> Let me consider fluids and diuretics carefully. In preeclampsia, aggressive fluids worsen capillary leak and pulmonary edema, so I should restrict total fluids to about 80–100 mL/hr and replace only insensible and measured urinary losses, using diuretics judiciously for pulmonary congestion while watching for reduced uteroplacental perfusion; in nonpregnant patients, fluid restriction is also emphasized in cardiogenic pulmonary edema, but pregnancy adds the fetal perfusion constraint that requires tighter balance and frequent reassessment [^fc64d488] [^38fe0dda] [^f376f814].

> Next, I should review etiologic workup and when to deliver. In pregnancy, pulmonary edema is often preeclampsia-related, so I need to check for severe features and end-organ involvement and involve maternal-fetal medicine early; echocardiography helps distinguish peripartum cardiomyopathy from preeclampsia-related edema and guides therapy, and if pulmonary edema occurs with severe preeclampsia at or beyond 34 weeks, delivery after maternal stabilization is indicated, whereas before 34 weeks, individualized expectant management may be considered in tertiary centers [^1f982c23] [^83ec8196] [^cef2f448]. But wait, what if the edema is cardiogenic from valvular disease or ischemia? In that case, management follows standard cardiology principles with pregnancy-aware modifications and urgent specialty input [^f376f814].

> I should double-check monitoring and diagnostics. Point-of-care lung ultrasound can detect interstitial edema early and guide fluid decisions, and IVC ultrasound helps assess volume responsiveness in spontaneously breathing patients; in pregnancy, these tools are feasible and valuable to avoid both under-resuscitation and fluid overload, and they complement serial vitals, strict intake-output tracking, and frequent clinical reassessment [^0aed3b32] [^58766664] [^d9d80c38]. Continuous fetal monitoring is indicated once the mother is stabilized, and a multidisciplinary team including obstetrics, cardiology, anesthesia, and neonatology should coordinate care in an appropriate level setting [^f376f814].

> Let me summarize the key differences to ensure nothing is missed. In pregnancy, flash pulmonary edema management diverges from nonpregnant care in four principal ways: stricter fluid restriction due to capillary leak and low oncotic pressure in preeclampsia; preference for nitroglycerin when preeclampsia is implicated and avoidance of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and nitroprusside; earlier consideration of delivery when preeclampsia with severe features is present; and integration of maternal-fetal considerations such as left lateral positioning, fetal monitoring, and cardio-obstetrics team management, all while using NIV and diuretics with the same urgency but with pregnancy-specific cautions [^fc64d488] [^e396b185] [^83ec8196] [^387318a7] [^f376f814].

Flash pulmonary edema in pregnancy differs from non-pregnant patients in **etiology and fluid management**. In pregnancy, preeclampsia, peripartum cardiomyopathy, and tocolytic-induced fluid overload are common causes, whereas non-pregnant patients more often have ischemic or valvular disease [^654df1e8] [^d83e5a4f]. Management emphasizes **strict fluid restriction** (typically 80–100 mL/hr) [^38fe0dda] and **avoidance of aggressive diuresis** due to capillary leak and low oncotic pressure in preeclampsia [^fc64d488]; non-pregnant patients generally receive standard diuretic therapy without such restrictions [^aad6b1df]. IV nitroglycerin is preferred for afterload reduction in preeclampsia-related edema [^e396b185] [^d613ad6a], whereas non-pregnant patients may use nitroprusside or ACE inhibitors [^833ef130]. Delivery planning is essential in pregnancy, as delivery is indicated for severe preeclampsia with pulmonary edema [^83ec8196] [^931eda6a].

---

## Etiological differences

Pregnancy-specific causes include:

- **Preeclampsia**: Capillary leak, low oncotic pressure, and vasospasm increase pulmonary edema risk [^fc64d488] [^38fe0dda].

- **Peripartum cardiomyopathy**: Unique to pregnancy/postpartum, often presenting with acute heart failure and pulmonary edema [^141378ef].

- **Tocolytic-induced fluid overload**: Beta-agonists and magnesium sulfate cause fluid retention and pulmonary edema [^654df1e8].

Non-pregnant causes more commonly include **ischemic heart disease, valvular disease, and renal artery stenosis** [^d83e5a4f] [^51f9bad8].

---

## Physiological differences

Pregnancy alters cardiovascular physiology, increasing pulmonary edema risk:

- **Increased plasma volume and cardiac output**: Raises hydrostatic pressure and edema risk [^c69d2736].

- **Decreased colloid oncotic pressure**: Lowers the threshold for fluid extravasation [^0aed3b32].

- **Capillary leak syndrome**: Especially in preeclampsia, promoting interstitial fluid accumulation [^fc64d488].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

Diagnosis relies on **clinical assessment, imaging, and laboratory tests**, with pregnancy-specific nuances:

| **Diagnostic modality** | **Pregnancy-specific considerations** |
|-|-|
| Chest radiography | Shielding and limited use due to radiation; lung ultrasound is preferred [^notfound] |
| Echocardiography | Essential to exclude peripartum cardiomyopathy and valvular disease [^1f982c23] |
| Laboratory tests | - Assess for preeclampsia (proteinuria, liver enzymes, platelets) [^a7d9d51c] <br/> - Monitor renal function and electrolytes [^f8e7da37] |

---

## Management differences

### Fluid management

In pregnancy, **strict fluid restriction** (80–100 mL/hr) is recommended to prevent worsening edema [^38fe0dda], whereas in non-pregnant patients, fluid management is tailored to hemodynamics without such strict limits [^aad6b1df].

---

### Pharmacological management

- **Vasodilators**: IV nitroglycerin is preferred in preeclampsia-related edema; avoid nitroprusside and ACE inhibitors due to fetal risk [^e396b185] [^d613ad6a] [^833ef130].

- **Diuretics**: Use cautiously; aggressive diuresis can reduce placental perfusion and is avoided in preeclampsia [^fc64d488] [^f376f814].

- **Beta-blockers**: Labetalol is preferred for blood pressure control; avoid atenolol [^833ef130].

---

### Delivery planning

In pregnancy, **delivery is indicated** for severe preeclampsia with pulmonary edema, even if preterm, after maternal stabilization [^83ec8196] [^931eda6a]. In non-pregnant patients, management focuses on treating the underlying cardiac or renal cause without delivery considerations [^aad6b1df].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Pregnancy requires **continuous fetal monitoring**, frequent maternal vital assessment, and close postpartum follow-up for hypertensive complications [^931eda6a] [^983cfaae]. Non-pregnant patients are monitored per standard heart failure protocols without fetal considerations [^aad6b1df].

---

Flash pulmonary edema in pregnancy differs from non-pregnant patients in **etiology, physiology, and management**, particularly regarding fluid restriction, pharmacologic choices, and the need for delivery planning.

Acute pulmonary oedema in pregnant women is an uncommon but life-threatening event. The aims of this review are to address why pulmonary oedema occurs in pregnant women and to discuss immediate management. We performed a systematic literature search of electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, using the key words obstetrics, pregnancy, acute pulmonary oedema, pregnancy complications, maternal, cardiac function and haemodynamics. We present a simple clinical classification of acute pulmonary oedema in pregnancy into pulmonary oedema occurring in normotensive or hypotensive women (i.e. without hypertension), and acute pulmonary oedema occurring in hypertensive women, which allows focused management. Pre-eclampsia remains an important cause of hypertensive acute pulmonary oedema in pregnancy and preventive strategies include close clinical monitoring and restricted fluid administration. Immediate management of acute pulmonary oedema includes oxygenation, ventilation and circulation control with venodilators. Pregnancy-specific issues include consideration of the physiological changes of pregnancy, the risk of aspiration and difficult airway, reduced respiratory and metabolic reserve, avoidance of aortocaval compression and delivery of the fetus.

### Flash pulmonary edema [^d83e5a4f]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Flash pulmonary edema (FPE) is a general clinical term used to describe a particularly dramatic form of acute decompensated heart failure. Well-established risk factors for heart failure such as hypertension, coronary ischemia, valvular heart disease, and diastolic dysfunction are associated with acute decompensated heart failure as well as with FPE. However, endothelial dysfunction possibly secondary to an excessive activity of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, impaired nitric oxide synthesis, increased endothelin levels, and/or excessive circulating catecholamines may cause excessive pulmonary capillary permeability and facilitate FPE formation. Renal artery stenosis particularly when bilateral has been identified has a common cause of FPE. Lack of diurnal variation in blood pressure and a widened pulse pressure have been identified as risk factors for FPE. This review is an attempt to delineate clinical and pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for FPE and to distinguish pathophysiologic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects of FPE from those of acute decompensated heart failure.

### Hemodynamic assessment in a pregnant and peripartum patient [^c69d2736]. Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology

Critical care in obstetrics has many similarities in pathophysiology to the care of nonpregnant women. However, changes in the physiology of pregnant woman necessary to maintain homeostasis for both mother and fetus, especially during critical illness, result in complex pathophysiology. Understanding the normal physiologic changes during pregnancy, intrapartum, and postpartum is the key to managing critically ill obstetric patients with underlying medical diseases and pregnancy-related complications.

Hemodynamic Monitoring

When the pathophysiology of critically ill obstetric patients cannot be explained by noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring and the patient fails to respond to conservative medical management, invasive hemodynamic monitoring may be helpful in guiding management. Most important, the proper interpretation of hemodynamic data is predicated on knowledge of normal values during pregnancy and immediately postpartum. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring with pulmonary artery catherization has been used in the obstetric population, particularly in patients with severe preeclampsia associated with pulmonary edema and renal failure.

### Etiology, diagnosis and management of aortitis [^eca05110]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Aortitis includes conditions with infectious or non-infectious etiology, characterized by inflammatory changes in one or more layers in aortic wall. Age at onset, geographic predilections, distribution and pattern of involvement in aorta, its branches and pulmonary arteries, and systemic associations provide a clue to etiology. Clinical presentations are often non-specific. An integrated approach including clinical, laboratory and imaging assessment is essential to confirm diagnosis and plan treatment. Assessment of disease activity is the key as it influences timing and outcome of treatment. Markers of activity include clinical, laboratory and imaging. Medical management remains the first-line therapy. Revascularization is indicated in the presence of hemodynamically significant stenosis and inactive disease. In the presence of flash pulmonary edema, left ventricular dysfunction or hypertensive encephalopathy, revascularization is performed irrespective of disease activity. Endovascular management is favored over surgery due to its high success and low restenosis rates. Symptomatic aneurysmal disease is usually managed by surgery.

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to develop guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death) [^1f0fd97a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy and postpartum — ventricular arrhythmias: Palpitations are extremely common during pregnancy, and several studies have shown an increase in the symptoms of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) during pregnancy. While most palpitations are benign during pregnancy, new-onset ventricular tachycardia (VT) is of concern. In women presenting with new-onset VT during the last 6 wk of pregnancy or in the early postpartum period, the possibility of postpartum cardiomyopathy should be ruled out. In women with non–long QT-related sustained VT during pregnancy, antiarrhythmic therapy may be indicated. Amiodarone can have deleterious effects on the fetus, including hypothyroidism, growth retardation, and premature birth. Prophylactic therapy with a cardioselective beta blocker may be effective, and sotalol can be considered if beta-blocker therapy is ineffective. Potentially life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias should be terminated by electrical cardioversion. For women with known structural heart disease, pregnancy may present significant risk, and pulmonary edema, embolic stroke, or cardiac death can occur in up to 13% of such pregnancies. Independent predictors of risk in women with heart disease include prior history of arrhythmia, cyanosis, poor functional class, left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, and LV outflow obstruction.

### Venous thromboembolism management in pregnant patients [^74353309]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) in pregnancy accounts for 10% of maternal deaths in the United States. As maternal morbidity and mortality continue to increase, it is imperative for all specialties interfacing with pregnant patients to understand the current research and guidelines surrounding risk stratification, diagnosis, and treatments of PE in pregnancy. Given the complexity of high-risk pregnancy-associated PE (PA-PE), that is, which is associated with hemodynamic instability or collapse, and the rising popularity of new technologies to treat high-risk PA-PE in the nonpregnant population, this review aims to emphasize the differences in diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of the pregnant and nonpregnant PE patients. Furthermore, this review will cover treatment paradigms that include anticoagulation versus advanced therapies such as systemic thrombolysis, surgical embolectomy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and inferior vena cava disruption as well as the more novel therapies which fall under the umbrella term of catheter-based treatments. Finally, this review will include a case-based review of 2 patients with PA-PE requiring catheter-based therapies and their ultimate clinical outcomes.

### Peripartum HFpEF: identification of a novel phenotype and the Need for Cardio-obstetrics management [^737fdabe]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing and managing PPCM remains challenging, as it is often a diagnosis of exclusion despite the existence of several guidelines., The diverse range of presentations, varying from subtle signs to severe manifestations like acute HF, pulmonary edema, or cardiogenic shock, further complicates the management of PPCM. This emphasizes the critical need for increased awareness and physician education to allow for early recognition and accurate diagnosis to facilitate timely and appropriate interventions. ACOG recommends all pregnant or postpartum women who experience symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest discomfort, palpitations, arrhythmias, or fluid retention undergo evaluation for PPCM. Diagnostic testing for PPCM includes a combination of clinical assessment, laboratory tests, and imaging studies (Figure 1). Clinical evaluation involves a thorough medical history, physical examination, and assessment of symptoms. ESC recommends performing an electrocardiogram in all patients with suspected PPCM as it is a safe and cost-effective diagnostic tool that can aid in distinguishing PPCM from other causes of symptoms; however, it is important to note that there is no specific electrocardiogram pattern that is diagnostic of PPCM.

### The role of point-of-care ultrasound to monitor response of fluid replacement therapy in pregnancy [^0aed3b32]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Fluid management in obstetrical care is crucial because of the complex physiological conditions of pregnancy, which complicate clinical manifestations and fluid balance management. This expert review examined the use of point-of-care ultrasound to evaluate and monitor the response to fluid therapy in pregnant patients. Pregnancy induces substantial physiological changes, including increased cardiac output and glomerular filtration rate, decreased systemic vascular resistance, and decreased plasma oncotic pressure. Conditions, such as preeclampsia, further complicate fluid management because of decreased intravascular volume and increased capillary permeability. Traditional methods for assessing fluid volume status, such as physical examination and invasive monitoring, are often unreliable or inappropriate. Point-of-care ultrasound provides a noninvasive, rapid, and reliable means to assess fluid responsiveness, which is essential for managing fluid therapy in pregnant patients. This review details the various point-of-care ultrasound modalities used to measure dynamic changes in fluid status, focusing on the evaluation of the inferior vena cava, lung ultrasound, and left ventricular outflow tract. Inferior vena cava ultrasound in spontaneously breathing patients determines diameter variability, predicts fluid responsiveness, and is feasible even late in pregnancy. Lung ultrasound is crucial for detecting early signs of pulmonary edema before clinical symptoms arise and is more accurate than traditional radiography. The left ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral assesses stroke volume response to fluid challenges, providing a quantifiable measure of cardiac function, which is particularly beneficial in critical care settings where rapid and accurate fluid management is essential. This expert review synthesizes current evidence and practice guidelines, suggesting the integration of point-of-care ultrasound as a fundamental aspect of fluid management in obstetrics. It calls for ongoing research to enhance techniques and validate their use in broader clinical settings, aiming to improve outcomes for pregnant patients and their babies by preventing complications associated with both under- and overresuscitation.

### Management of hypertensive crisis for the obstetrician / gynecologist [^2ca566a9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are among the leading preventable contributors of maternal and fetal adverse outcomes, including maternal and fetal death. Blood pressure increase has a strong association with unfavorable pregnancy outcomes, including stroke and pulmonary edema. A persistent blood pressure measurement greater than or equal to 160/110 mm Hg lasting for more than 15 minutes, during pregnancy or postpartum, is considered an obstetric emergency and requires rapid appropriate treatment. Following evidence-based guidelines, implementing institutional polices, and understanding the classification and pathophysiology of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are essential and can significantly improve the rate of preventable complications.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 212: pregnancy and heart disease [^983cfaae]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Physiologic changes in pregnancy — postpartum hemodynamics and monitoring — Heart rate and blood pressure normally decrease within 48 hours postpartum, but blood pressure may increase again between days 3–6 due to fluid shifts; during this period, clinicians should monitor patients for hypertensive complications and those related to fluid overload. Increased hydrostatic pressure and decreased colloid osmotic pressure render women with cardiovascular disease susceptible to pulmonary edema at the time of delivery and immediately postpartum, and increased maternal plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels in the first week postpartum allow for postpartum diuresis. Maternal hemodynamics generally return to a prepregnancy state 3–6 months after delivery.

A woman aged 22years with a history of lupus presented in the 18th week of pregnancy with hypertensive emergency and flash pulmonary oedema. Bedside echocardiogram revealed severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with an ejection fraction (EF) of 25% and pericardial effusion. Laboratories revealed hypocomplementemia, proteinuria, elevated C reactive protein and anti-DS-DNA, raising concern for a lupus flare. Cardiac MRI showed an acute intramyocardial oedematous process, consistent with lupus carditis, and further worsening of LVEF to 13%. Shared-decision-making with the patient included discussion of maternal risks of continuation of pregnancy in the setting of worsening heart function and the fetal risks of definitive treatment with cyclophosphamide for a lupus flare and the patient decided to proceed with medical termination of pregnancy. Treatment with immunosuppressants, including cyclophosphamide, and steroids, was then initiated. 2 months after discharge, cardiac MRI showed marked improvement in LVEF to 50% and the patient remains clinically free of heart failure.

Hantavirus infection during pregnancy can influence both maternal and fetal outcomes. Here, we describe four cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in pregnant Chinese women. The HFRS put these women at increased risk for severe illness, despite the patients' symptomologies in the onset phase were similar to those observed in non-pregnant HFRS patients, such as fever, headache, nausea, and thrombocytopenia. Pregnant women appeared to have a more severe status, presenting with severe complications, such as hypervolemia and pulmonary edema. Nevertheless, with appropriate management, mothers with HFRS may carry to full-term and breastfeeding maybe safe and feasible.

### Cardiac asthma and acute pulmonary edema complicating toxemias of pregnancy… [^56b5fc67]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Recently we called attention to an interesting and dramatic symptom complex which occasionally complicates the severe nonconvulsive toxemias of pregnancy. 1 It is characterized by the sudden appearance in a previously comfortable patient of extreme orthopnea, dyspnea, cyanosis and cough productive of frothy and often pinkish sputum. Numerous crepitant rales appear with the onset of the attack, and they persist, at least in the lung bases, for a variable period thereafter. Attacks have usually occurred in patients while at rest in bed. They closely resemble severe attacks of cardiac asthma such as occur characteristically in nonpregnant persons with conditions that impose a burden on the left venticle, notably severe hypertensive disease, aortic insufficiency and nephritis with hypertension. We referred to this complication of nonconvulsive toxemias of pregnancy as "cardiac asthma and acute pulmonary edema. " It has been encountered only in patients with severe toxemia.

### Malaria in pregnancy: update on emergency management [^2b4af31e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Pregnancy complicates the diagnosis, treatment, and clinical course of malaria. This clinical problem may be encountered in emergency department patients due to international travel.

Case Report

A primigravida woman at 20 weeks gestation presented to the Emergency Department with episodic fever, chills, headache, and nausea after travel to India and Asia. She had not taken malaria prophylaxis. After hospitalization, she developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and required intensive care management. Although she ultimately recovered from severe infection with Plasmodium vivax, she was not able to sustain her pregnancy and suffered a miscarriage.

Conclusion

This case illustrates the serious nature of malaria in the pregnant patient. For this high-risk group, there is an increased incidence of severe anemia, as well as acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary edema. A guideline is presented for the initial choice of anti-malarial drug treatment for the pregnant patient.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^38fe0dda]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4.9.6

We recommend all clinicians are aware of the increased risk of pulmonary oedema in women with CKD and pre-eclampsia (1D).

Rationale

It is the experience of the guideline committee that fluid management for women with CKD is often complex and needs to be tailored to the individual. Women at risk of either volume depletion or fluid overload should be highlighted in advance of delivery to ensure that clinical review of fluid state is undertaken prior to being prescribed intravenous fluids, or the institution of a fluid restriction. On-going fluid balance review should then be performed during labour and in the immediate post-partum period with the aim of euvolaemia and the avoidance of both pulmonary oedema and superimposed kidney injury. Fluid balance assessment should be undertaken by a competent clinician with an understanding of the haemodynamic changes in pregnancy and the puerperium. This may include nephrologists, anaesthetists, obstetric physicians, and maternal medicine specialists.

The guideline committee endorses the NICE guideline on hypertension in pregnancy for the management of pre-eclampsia in pregnancy. The risk of pre-eclampsia is higher in all stages of CKD compared to women without CKD. Pre-eclampsia is complicated by capillary leak, reduced plasma oncotic pressure, and either reduced or increased cardiac output. The complexity and dynamic nature of pre-eclampsia mean that there should be a plan in place for regular fluid balance review by a competent clinician with expertise in CKD and pre-eclampsia. The aim of fluid balance in pre-eclamspia is euvolaemia. Insensible losses should then be replaced (30 ml/hr) along with anticipated urinary losses (0.5–1 ml/kg/hr), whilst limiting overall fluid intake to 80–100 ml/hr. to avoid the risk of pulmonary oedema.

### A proposed plan for prenatal care to minimize risks of COVID-19 to patients and providers: focus on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [^f8e7da37]. American Journal of Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders are the most common medical complications of pregnancy and a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and death. The detection of elevated blood pressure during pregnancy is one of the cardinal aspects of optimal antenatal care. With the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the risk for person-to-person spread of the virus, there is a desire to minimize unnecessary visits to health care facilities. Women should be classified as low risk or high risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and adjustments can be accordingly made in the frequency of maternal and fetal surveillance. During this pandemic, all pregnant women should be encouraged to obtain a sphygmomanometer. Patients monitored for hypertension as an outpatient should receive written instructions on the important signs and symptoms of disease progression and provided contact information to report the development of any concern for change in status. As the clinical management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia is the same, assessment of urinary protein is unnecessary in the management once a diagnosis of a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy is made. Pregnant women with suspected hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and signs and symptoms associated with the severe end of the disease spectrum (e.g., headaches, visual symptoms, epigastric pain, and pulmonary edema) should have an evaluation including complete blood count, serum creatinine level, and liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase). Further, if there is any evidence of disease progression or if acute severe hypertension develops, prompt hospitalization is suggested. Current guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) for management of preeclampsia with severe features suggest delivery after 34 0/7 weeks of gestation. With the outbreak of COVID-19, however, adjustments to this algorithm should be considered including delivery by 30 0/7 weeks of gestation in the setting of preeclampsia with severe features. KEY POINTS: · Outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) warrants fewer office visits. · Women should be classified for hypertension risk in pregnancy. · Earlier delivery suggested with COVID-19 and hypertensive disorder.

### Pregnancy-related differences in cardiogenic shock: a national analysis of etiology, risk factors, and outcomes [^5238d1de]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

In terms of management of cardiogenic shock, we found no differences in the overall rates of procedures, such as echo or right heart catheterization, IABP, or pLVAD utilization between groups. Prior studies have found increasing rates of MCS utilization in pregnant patients in line with increases seen in the general population, which is supported by the American College of Cardiology guidelines encouraging invasive hemodynamic monitoring in pregnant patients with cardiopulmonary decompensation and MCS utilization based on the degree of hemodynamic support needed. We noted significantly higher rates of ECMO utilization, predominantly venoarterial, in hospitalizations of pregnant patients with cardiogenic shock compared to those of nonpregnant women; however, we did not observe any trends in ECMO utilization by year (Supplemental Table 5). Higher rates of ECMO utilization among pregnant patients may be due to additional obstetrical complications such as eclampsia, which can lead to pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and fetal distress due to inadequate maternal perfusion, necessitating a high degree of cardiopulmonary support, as well as prior studies demonstrating the safety of ECMO in pregnancy. Importantly, we also found no differences in the frequency of same-day interventions for cardiogenic shock, with around 9% of hospitalizations of pregnant and nonpregnant patients alike receiving MCS on the same day of cardiogenic shock diagnosis. The low rates of early MCS use in women of childbearing age overall may be attributed to systemic issues of sex differences in cardiogenic shock management, with a recent paper noting women being 0.76 times less likely to receive MCS use for cardiogenic shock than men. A prior study of cardiogenic shock among pregnant patients using the NIS found that initiation of MCS within ≤ 6 days of diagnosis was associated with significantly decreased mortality compared to patients who underwent MCS initiation late, but, as evidenced by low same-day procedure rates, early MCS use has yet to be adopted in routine management of cardiogenic shock in pregnancy. Also, despite ischemic disease accounting for the etiology of cardiogenic shock in 12.4% of hospitalizations of pregnant patients, only 1.78% of these hospitalizations involved revascularization. The causes of pregnancy-associated myocardial infarction are heterogeneous, with higher rates of spontaneous coronary artery dissection and acute thrombosis due to the hypercoagulable state of pregnancy. Conservative management is preferred over PCI in cases of spontaneous coronary artery dissection with adequate coronary flow due to lower procedural success rates and risk of dissection propagation, while aspiration thrombectomy is preferred in cases of thromboembolism in the absence of atherosclerotic disease. These nuances may explain the low observed rates of revascularization in pregnancy. These nuances may explain the low observed rates of revascularization in pregnancy.

### Catheter-based therapy for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis [^a86ddefe]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) is more common than was previously thought, particularly in patients with known coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular atherosclerosis. Clinical subsets in which RAS is more common include patients with uncontrolled hypertension, renal insufficiency, and/or sudden onset ("flash") pulmonary edema. Renal artery atherosclerosis progresses over time and is associated with loss of renal function regardless of medical therapy. Patients with symptomatic (hypertension, renal insufficiency, or flash pulmonary edema) and hemodynamically significant RAS are potential candidates for revascularization. The current standard of care is stent placement for aorto-ostial atherosclerotic lesions. Procedure success rates are very high (≥ 95%), with infrequent major complication rates. Five-year primary patency rates are 80% to 85%, and secondary patency rates exceed 90%. The key element in managing patients with RAS is selecting those most likely to benefit, that is, those with blood pressure control, preservation or improvement of renal function, and control of flash pulmonary edema from renal revascularization. This article will highlight the anatomical features, physiologic parameters, and biomarkers that may be helpful in optimally selecting patients for renal artery revascularization.

### Tight vs liberal control of mild postpartum hypertension: a randomized controlled trial [^605a4b47]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

High-quality evidence to inform the management of postpartum hypertension, including the optimal blood pressure threshold to initiate therapy, is lacking. Randomized trials have been conducted in pregnancy, but there are no published trials to guide management in the postpartum period.

Objective

This study aimed to test the hypothesis that initiating antihypertensive therapy in the postpartum period at a threshold of 140/90 mm Hg would result in less maternal morbidity than initiating therapy at a threshold of 150/95 mm Hg.

Study Design

We performed a pragmatic multicenter randomized controlled trial of patients aged 18 to 55 years with postpartum hypertension. Patients with chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia without severe features were randomized to 1 of 2 blood pressure thresholds to initiate treatment: persistent blood pressure of ≥ 150/95 mm Hg (institutional standard or "liberal control" group) or ≥ 140/90 mm Hg (intervention or "tight control" group). Our primary outcome was composite maternal morbidity defined as: severe hypertension (blood pressure ≥ 160/110 mm Hg) or preeclampsia with severe features, the need for a second antihypertensive agent, postpartum hospitalization > 4 days, and maternal adverse outcome secondary to hypertension as evidenced by pulmonary edema, acute kidney injury (creatinine level ≥ 1.1 mg/dL), cardiac dysfunction (eg, elevated brain natriuretic peptide level) or cardiomyopathy, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, cerebrovascular accident, or admission to an intensive care unit. Secondary outcomes included hospital readmission for hypertension, persistence of hypertension beyond 14 days, medication side effects, and time to blood pressure control. We calculated that 256 women would provide 90% power to detect a relative 50% reduction in the primary outcome from 36% in the standard blood pressure threshold group to 18%, with a 2-sided alpha set at 0.05 for significance. Data were analyzed using R statistical software.

Results

A total of 256 patients were randomized, including 128 to the "tight control" group (140/90 mm Hg) and 128 to the "liberal control" group (150/95 mm Hg). Patients in the "tight control" group had a higher body mass index at delivery (37.1 ± 9.4 vs 34.9 ± 8.1; P = 0.04); other demographic and obstetrical characteristics were similar between groups. The rate of the primary outcome was similar between groups (8.6% vs 11.7%; P = 0.41; relative risk, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.35–1.53). The rates of all secondary outcomes and the individual components of the primary and secondary outcome measures were also similar between groups.

Conclusion

In the postpartum period, initiation of antihypertensive therapy at a lower blood pressure threshold of 140/90 mm Hg did not decrease maternal morbidity or improve outcomes compared with a threshold of 150/95 mm Hg.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Preeclampsia — diagnostic criteria and thresholds — require elevated blood pressure plus proteinuria or specific end-organ findings. Blood pressure criteria are SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg on 2 occasions ≥ 4 h apart after 20 wk of gestation in a previously normotensive woman, or SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg. Proteinuria can be ≥ 300 mg per 24 h, Protein/ creatinine ratio ≥ 0.3, or dipstick 2+. In the absence of proteinuria, criteria include thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100 x 10^9/L), renal insufficiency (serum creatinine concentrations > 1.1 mg/dL or a doubling of serum creatinine concentration), impaired liver function (elevated transaminases to twice normal concentration), pulmonary edema, or new‑onset headache unresponsive to medication and not accounted for by alternative diagnoses or visual symptoms.

### Management of hypertensive crisis: British and Irish hypertension society position document [^e2b3aea4]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary oedema

Heart failure associated with raised BP may present as hypertensive crisis. Typically, shortness of breath, cough, orthopnoea, with compatible signs on CXR points towards heart failure. Underlying conditions like ischaemic heart disease or bilateral renal artery stenosis may predispose to heart failure.

Treatment should be directed toward the underlying cause and the associated pathophysiology. Patient may not always present with florid symptoms of pulmonary oedema. Flash pulmonary oedema, which occurs with elevated left ventricular filling pressures may be the first presentation albeit rarely.

Patients with acute hypertensive heart failure have been under-represented in acute heart failure trials. The best available evidence for treatment of heart failure is for use of diuretics particularly loop diuretics such as furosemide or bumetanide. Treatment aiming for a decrease in BP (fall in MAP by 20–25%) over a few hours has been mentioned in most guidelines. AHA guidelines recommend treatment of pulmonary oedema with clevidipine, nitro-glycerine, nitroprusside or enalaprilat. ESC guidelines, recommend treating BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg in patients with heart failure, to SBP < 140 mmHg.

GTN is the most commonly used therapy in hypertensive heart failure, administered by continuous infusion. However, the evidence comes from small, retrospective, and non-randomised clinical trials. The advantage is a quick reduction in preload and afterload. The use of higher doses of nitrates in patients with pulmonary oedema associated with myocardial infarction is supported by a few older studies. Small doses of opioids for vasodilatory and anxiolytic effect must be considered. Use of parenteral ACEi such as enalaprilat is supported by two studies particularly, one relatively large (n = 103) retrospective study of IV enalaprilat prescribed in the setting of acute heart failure and another small (n = 20) double blinded RCT comparing IV enalaprilat versus placebo in patients with congestive heart failure. However, IV enalaprilat is not routinely available. Nitroprusside may be an acceptable treatment strategy, while being cautious in patients with concomitant renal and liver failure. Clevidipine has been used safely in small studies. β blockers are contraindicated in acute pulmonary oedema (Table 11).

Both pulmonary oedema and ACS can be accompanied by an acute rise in BP with multiple confounding factors including pain and anxiety. Clinical discretion is required to differentiate if HTN is the causative factor, or a mere bystander similar to AIS and SAH.

### Pregnancy-related differences in cardiogenic shock: a national analysis of etiology, risk factors, and outcomes [^0113d7d9]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiogenic shock is associated with high rates of mortality in pregnancy but remains understudied.

Objectives

We aim to understand the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of cardiogenic shock in women of childbearing age and identify whether there are pregnancy-related differences in procedural utilization.

Methods

We analyzed all delivery, pregnancy, and cardiogenic shock-related hospitalizations in reproductive-aged women (aged 18–45) using the National Inpatient Sample database (years 2016–2021).

Results

Pregnant women with vs without cardiogenic shock had higher rates of cardiovascular comorbidities and were more likely to have preeclampsia (21.3% vs 6.5%), placental hemorrhage (26.6% vs 4.3%), fetal death (10.0% vs 0.51%), and maternal death (17.8% vs 0.01%). Comparing pregnant vs nonpregnant women with cardiogenic shock, pregnant women had lower comorbidity burden and rates of multiorgan failure but higher rates of pulmonary edema (8.9% vs 4.7%). Pregnant women with cardiogenic shock were more likely to undergo extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (adjusted OR: 1.67 [95% CI: 1.07–2.65]) and less likely to die during admission (adjusted OR: 0.43 [95% CI: 0.28–0.66]). Nonpregnant women had higher frequencies of cardiogenic shock from ischemic cardiomyopathy (CM) (25.4% vs 12.4%) and congenital heart disease (5.6% vs 1.8%), while most pregnant women had cardiogenic shock related to nonischemic CM, specifically peripartum CM (30.8%).

Conclusions

There are differences in cardiogenic shock etiology, comorbidities, and clinical complications among pregnant vs nonpregnant women. Findings suggest that unique pregnancy-specific factors may contribute to cardiogenic shock in pregnancy.

### Management of heart failure in the emergency department setting: an evidence-based review of the literature [^aad6b1df]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute heart failure (AHF) is a common presentation to the emergency department (ED), with the potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality. It is important to tailor treatments to the appropriate type of heart failure.

Objectives

This review provides an evidence-based summary of the current ED management of acute heart failure.

Discussion

Heart failure can present along a spectrum, especially in acute exacerbation. Treatment should focus on the underlying disease process, with guidelines focusing primarily on blood pressure and hemodynamic status. Treatment of patients with mild AHF exacerbations often focuses on intravenous diuretics. Patients with AHF with flash pulmonary edema should receive nitroglycerin and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, with consideration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, while monitoring for hypotension. Patients with hypotensive AHF should receive emergent specialty consultation and an initial fluid bolus of 250–500 mL, followed by initiation of inotropic agents with or without vasopressors. Dobutamine is the inotrope of choice in these patients, with norepinephrine recommended if blood pressure support is needed. If noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is required, providers should monitor closely for acute decompensation. Mechanical circulatory support devices may be considered as a bridge to further therapeutic intervention. High-output heart failure can be managed acutely with vasoconstricting agents, with focus on treating the underlying etiology. Disposition is not always straightforward, and several risk scores may assist in this decision.

Conclusion

AHF is a condition that requires rapid assessment and management. Understanding the appropriate management strategy can allow for more targeted treatment and improved outcomes.

3.3 Maternal outcomes

The impact of antihypertensive therapy on maternal outcomes in pregnant patients diagnosed with mild to moderate hypertension was investigated (Figure 2). Antihypertensive therapy of mild to moderate hypertension was associated with lower risks of developing severe hypertension (16% vs. 29%; RR = 0.53; 95% CI = [0.38; 0.75]) (Figure 3A), preeclampsia (24% vs. 27%; RR = 0.71; 95% CI = [0.54; 0.93]) (Figure 3B), placental abruption (3% vs. 5%; RR = 0.48; 95% CI = [0.26; 0.87]) (Figure 3D), changes in ECG (24% vs. 56%; RR = 0.43; 95% CI = [0.25; 0.72]) (Figure 3F), renal impairment (6% vs. 15%; RR = 0.42; 95% CI = [0.34; 0.51]) (Figure 3C), and pulmonary edema (1% vs. 2%; RR = 0.46; 95% CI = [0.25; 0.84]) (Figure 3E) compared to the control group receiving either no treatment or placebo. The pooled analysis showed that antihypertensive medications had no statistically significant impact on proteinuria (16% vs. 18%; RR = 0.85; 95% CI = [0.54; 1.34]), preterm delivery (20% vs. 25%; RR = 0.82; 95% CI = [0.63; 1.07]), hospital admission (19% vs. 45%; RR = 0.43; 95% CI = [0.12; 1.56]), maternal mortality (0% vs. 0%; RR = 0.34; 95% CI = [0.00; 241.74]), hepatic impairment (23% vs. 29%; RR = 0.79; 95% CI = [0.54; 1.17]), heart failure (0% vs. 0%; RR = 1.54; 95% CI = [0.00; 693.85]), and venous thromboembolism (2% vs. 4%; RR = 0.64; 95% CI = [0.31; 1.33]) when compared to the control group receiving no treatment or placebo for nonsevere hypertension (Figure 2) (the pooled estimates of maternal mortality and heart failure is not presented in Figure 2 due to having very wide CIs and their forest plots are presented in the Supporting Information: Material).

In the absence of proteinuria, new-onset hypertension with any of the following qualifies: platelet count < 100 x 10^9/L, serum creatinine concentrations > 1.1 mg/dL or doubling of creatinine without other renal disease, elevated liver transaminases to twice normal, pulmonary edema, or new-onset headache unresponsive to medication and not explained by other diagnoses or visual symptoms.

### Pregnancy-related differences in cardiogenic shock: a national analysis of etiology, risk factors, and outcomes [^9a9b9bef]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Hospitalizations of pregnant women with cardiogenic shock have significantly higher rates of cardiovascular comorbidities compared to those of pregnant women without cardiogenic shock. Pregnancy is a profound physiologic and hemodynamic stressor that can cause cardiac disease in women with modestly elevated cardiac risk profiles. Differences in presentation of cardiogenic shock exist among pregnant vs nonpregnant groups. Hospitalizations of pregnant women were more likely to involve pulmonary edema, while those of nonpregnant women had higher rates of multiorgan failure. The most common cause of cardiogenic shock in pregnancy-related hospitalizations was nonischemic cardiomyopathy, particularly PPCM, while hospitalizations among nonpregnant women experienced higher frequencies of cardiogenic shock from ischemic and valvular heart disease. While there were no differences in the overall MCS utilization between groups, pregnant women were more likely to undergo ECMO. These findings underscore the importance of optimizing patients' cardiovascular risk profiles prior to pregnancy and the need for close monitoring of high-risk patients during pregnancy to screen for developing cardiovascular complications. Further studies could examine outcomes in specific high-risk conditions, such as different subtypes of cardiomyopathies and concomitant preeclampsia and PPCM, to better understand peripartum risk in these groups.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: This paper highlights the importance of optimizing patients' cardiovascular risk profiles prior to pregnancy. It also highlights differences in cardiogenic shock presentation among pregnant and nonpregnant individuals, which could be beneficial to clinicians caring for critically ill patients. It addresses 2 domains of the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education and the American Board of Internal Medicine, which are medical knowledge and patient care/procedural skills.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Current pregnancy risk stratification tools for cardiac complications are highly focused on women with congenital heart disease. However, our findings suggest that these tools may not be adequate in assessing the risk of cardiogenic shock in women without congenital heart disease. Future studies warrant creating risk profiles for pregnant women without congenital heart disease. Our study also advocates for early utilization of MCS in pregnancy.

### Flash pulmonary edema in multiple sclerosis [^9ea7dff8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) occurs in the setting of an acute neurological insult and in the absence of a primary cardiopulmonary cause. No unifying theory on NPE pathogenesis exists. NPE triggered by a discrete neurological lesion is rare, but such cases offer valuable insight into NPE pathogenesis.

Objective

To describe an unusual and instructive case of NPE in multiple sclerosis.

Case Report

A young woman with multiple sclerosis presented to the Emergency Department in acute respiratory failure. She was cyanotic centrally, hypertensive, and tachycardic. The chest X-ray study suggested pulmonary edema. She required non-invasive mechanical ventilation for 12 h. Echocardiography revealed left ventricular hypokinesis. The asymmetrical pulmonary infiltrate raised the suspicion of pneumonia; she was given intravenous antibiotics. By 36 h, she had persistent dyspnea, paroxysmal tachycardia, nausea, and facial flushing; carcinoid syndrome was excluded. By 48 h, she had facial numbness and ataxia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a demyelinating lesion at the rostromedial medulla. Her symptoms promptly resolved with intravenous steroids, as did the perilesional edema on follow-up MRI.

Conclusion

Life-threatening pulmonary edema can complicate medullary demyelination. Lack of awareness of this diagnostic possibility and an asymmetrical pulmonary infiltrate culminated in diagnostic delay in this case. The case provides clinico-radiological evidence of the pathogenic link between medullary lesions and NPE. The pathogenesis is likely to rely on lesion involvement of the nucleus tractus solitarius or its immediate pathways. Non-uniform vasoconstriction of the pulmonary arterial bed might account for the other peculiarity of this case: the asymmetrical pulmonary infiltrate. Timely diagnosis of NPE is essential because the condition is best managed by nullifying the "neurogenic" trigger.

### High-risk clinical presentations in atherosclerotic renovascular disease: prognosis and response to renal artery revascularization [^6b064f8f]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Current trial data may not be directly applicable to patients with the highest risk presentations of atherosclerotic renovascular disease, including flash pulmonary edema, rapidly declining kidney function, and refractory hypertension. We consider the prognostic implications of these presentations and response to percutaneous revascularization.

Study Design

Single-center prospective cohort study; retrospectively analyzed.

Setting & Participants

467 patients with renal artery stenosis ≥ 50%, managed according to clinical presentation and physician/patient preference.

Predictors

Presentation with flash pulmonary edema (n = 37 [7.8%]), refractory hypertension (n = 116 [24.3%]), or rapidly declining kidney function (n = 46 [9.7%]) compared to low-risk presentation with none of these phenotypes (n = 230 [49%]). Percutaneous revascularization (performed in 32% of flash pulmonary edema, 28% of rapidly declining kidney function, and 28% of refractory hypertension patients) compared to medical management.

Outcomes

Death, cardiovascular (CV) event, end-stage kidney disease.

Results

During a median follow-up of 3.8 (IQR, 1.8–5.8) years, 55% died, 33% had a CV event, and 18% reached end-stage kidney disease. In medically treated patients, flash pulmonary edema was associated with increased risk of death (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4–3.5; P < 0.001) and CV event (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.7–5.5; P < 0.001), but not end-stage kidney disease, compared to the low-risk phenotype. No increased risk for any end point was observed in patients presenting with rapidly declining kidney function or refractory hypertension. Compared to medical treatment, revascularization was associated with reduced risk for death (HR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2–0.9; P = 0.01), but not CV event or end-stage kidney disease, in patients presenting with flash pulmonary edema. Revascularization was not associated significantly with reduced risk for any end point in rapidly declining kidney function or refractory hypertension. When these presentations were present in combination (n = 31), revascularization was associated with reduced risk for death (HR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.02–0.9; P = 0.04) and CV event (HR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.1–0.6; P = 0.02).

Limitations

Observational study; retrospective analysis; potential treatment bias.

Conclusions

This analysis supports guidelines citing flash pulmonary edema as an indication for renal artery revascularization in atherosclerotic renovascular disease. Patients presenting with a combination of rapidly declining kidney function and refractory hypertension also may benefit from revascularization and may represent a subgroup worthy of further investigation in more robust trials.

### Recognition of sympathetic crashing acute pulmonary edema (SCAPE) and use of high-dose nitroglycerin infusion [^09feac56]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Sympathetic Crashing Acute Pulmonary Edema (SCAPE), or flash pulmonary edema, is the extreme end of the acute pulmonary edema spectrum. A sympathetic surge occurs as a result of decreased systemic perfusion resulting in further increases in afterload, causing the patient to decompensate. Patients can decompensate quickly, therefore patients require rapid interventions. The use of high-dose nitroglycerin (HDN) has been a topic of interest as it is believed to achieve preload and afterload reduction. However, its use continues to be controversial due to concerns of drug induced hypotension, syncope or paresthesia. Although there are Free Open Access Medical Education (FOAM) based podcasts as well as few studies to suggest the use of HDN, the evidence is limited by statistical flaws, incomplete dosing parameters and inconsistent methods of administration. In order to address these limitations, a protocol at our ED was created to ensure the safe and effective use of HDN. Here, we present a case of HDN use for the management of SCAPE based on this protocol.

### Hypertensive pregnancy disorder, an under-recognized women specific risk factor for heart failure? [^80e6315d]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Definition and classification of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy

During pregnancy, hypertension is defined as systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg. Severe hypertension is defined as systolic BP ≥ 160 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 110 mmHg. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have endorsed a lower threshold for diagnosing hypertension in non‐pregnant patients (systolic BP ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 80 mmHg). Some have suggested that this definition may also be appropriate for pregnant patients. However, use of the lower threshold has not been widely studied, would increase the incidence of hypertension in pregnancy by about 10%, and could increase potentially unnecessary testing, hospitalization, and intervention in the absence of a proven benefit. The clinical importance of distinguishing preeclampsia from other HDP, namely, chronic and gestational hypertension, relates to its greater risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.

Traditional and revised definition of preeclampsia

The traditional definition of preeclampsia refers to the new onset of hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation or postpartum., However, it is well recognized that many women with chronic or gestational hypertension still suffer from complications associated with preeclampsia such as pulmonary oedema, placental abruption, preterm delivery, perinatal death, small‐for‐gestational‐age infants, and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.

To better reflect the risk of adverse pregnancy complications among women with a HDP, the definition of preeclampsia has been revised to include cases without proteinuria but with evidence of maternal end‐organ or uteroplacental dysfunction. This 'broad' definition has now been adopted by most national and international clinical practice guidelines., Several subtypes of preeclampsia exist (Table 1), with a variety of pathophysiological pathways leading to maternal and foetal mortality and morbidity. The clinical features overlap, but the spectrum of disease and outcomes differ: early‐onset disease has been associated with poorer severe placental and maternal/foetal outcomes.

### Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [^747ac891]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The 4 categories of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia-eclampsia, and chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia. These disorders are among the leading causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Proper diagnosis in the emergency department is crucial in order to initiate appropriate treatment to reduce the potential harm to the mother and the fetus. Prompt management should be undertaken when the blood pressure is greater than 160/110 mm Hg or there are other severe features such as acute kidney injury, elevated liver function tests, severe abdominal pain, pulmonary edema, and central nervous system disturbances.

### Maternal heart failure [^f376f814]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Therapeutics and Principles of Management

When a pregnant or postpartum woman presents in acute HF, initial goals should be to stabilize the patient, confirm the diagnosis, assess the severity of HF, assess fetal status and viability, and contact members of an interdisciplinary cardio‐obstetrics care team. Any reversible factors that may have contributed to the patient's presentation, such as anemia, thyroid dysfunction, pulmonary embolism, preeclampsia/eclampsia, or infection, should be addressed. The last initial step is to assess fetal viability as well as stability. Steroids can be considered if there is concern for poor fetal lung maturity.

Treatment will vary depending on whether a woman is pregnant or postpartum, as once mothers have delivered there is no longer a concern about fetal stability/maturity or teratogenicity of medications and more standard HF therapies can be initiated (Figure 6)., An extensive review of the medication use in pregnancy is beyond the scope of this article but has been reviewed recently. In patients with stable HF, medical treatment approach parallels that of nonpregnant patients; however, there is a need to avoid teratogenic drugs (angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, atenolol, direct factor Xa inhibitors). Mainstays of treatment include hydralazine, nitrates, and β‐blockers. Diuretics should be used in those patients with signs or symptoms of pulmonary edema; however, caution must be exercised as they have the potential to reduce placental perfusion. In patients who have already delivered, treatment with standard HF therapy should be the highest priority, focusing on angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, β‐blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, as they are known to provide a mortality and treatment benefit to HF patients. For patients with cardiogenic shock or severe HF, transfer to a tertiary center where mechanical support can be provided should be pursued immediately. Treatment in these patients must aim to optimize preload (consider diuretics) and oxygenation, use inotropes/vasopressors, consider adding PPCM‐specific therapies, and if the patient is pregnant plan for urgent cesarean section.

### Caring for two: management of the critically ill cardiac patient during pregnancy [^ec1d8bdf]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 4
Summary of the Management of Valvular Heart Disease in Pregnancy

Patients with pre-existing valvular disease should undergo comprehensive risk assessment prior to conception, including echocardiographic evaluation of valvular severity, ventricular function, and pulmonary pressures. Contraceptive counseling and timing of valve intervention are crucial elements of preconception care. However, in the context of cardiac intensive care unit (CICU)-level management, the focus shifts to acute stabilization and emergent intervention during pregnancy, particularly in patients who present without prior optimization.

Mitral stenosis is the most clinically significant valvular lesion encountered during pregnancy, conferring a high risk of heart failure in those with valve area of < 1.5 cm 2. Patients with severe mitral stenosis are at risk of pulmonary edema, especially in the third trimester and peripartum period. CICU management includes noninvasive ventilation for pulmonary edema, intravenous diuretics for volume control, and beta-1 selective blockers for heart rate control. In cases of hemodynamic compromise, cautious afterload reduction with agents like hydralazine may be necessary. If medical therapy fails, percutaneous balloon mitral valvotomy may be considered, preferably after 20 weeks' gestation, at an experienced center, and with fetal shielding. Delivery planning in severe mitral stenosis should anticipate the risk of decompensation (ie, heart failure symptoms or hemodynamic instability); assisted second-stage vaginal delivery is generally preferred, but cesarean delivery may be warranted in unstable patients.

Protamine for anticoagulant reversal is characterized by partial effectiveness for low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and full for unfractionated heparin (UFH), with limited pregnancy data and potential neonatal risk: "Protamine sulfate can result in full reversal of UFH and 60%–80% reversal of LMWH," yet "its use in pregnancy to facilitate neuraxial anesthesia has not been studied," and "a single case study after a maternal 25 mg intravenous (IV) protamine dose before delivery reported severe neonatal respiratory depression, although a causal relationship was not established." Dosing guidance notes "Each 1 mg IV protamine can neutralize 100 IU of IV heparin," and "Reversal of SQ heparin may require repeated doses of IV protamine (half-life approximately 7 minutes)," and maternal adverse effects are listed, including "hypotension from histamine release, hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylaxis, pulmonary hypertension, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, coagulation disturbance related to thrombocytopenia, platelet defect aggregation, fibrinogen precipitation, and reduced thrombin effect."

### Nuts and bolts of lung ultrasound: utility, scanning techniques, protocols, and findings in common pathologies [^d9d80c38]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

A potential theoretical application of LUS is in fluid resuscitation of patients in shock, where the appearance of B-lines may signify the development of pulmonary edema. This assessment may be helpful in characterizing the benefit-to-risk ratio of additional fluids administration, as proposed in the FALLS protocol by Lichenstein et al. However, it is crucial to note that there is no rigorous data directly linking the occurrence of B-lines with worsening respiratory status following fluid administration. It is important to note the limitations of using pathologic bilateral B-lines to guide fluid resuscitation as they are non-specific for pulmonary edema and can also be seen in viral pneumonia (such as COVID-19), ARDS, and interstitial lung disease; and bilateral B-lines present more often with bilateral pleural effusions in the setting of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. While B-lines may suggest an increase in interstitial fluid, it is critical to interpret these findings in the patients' broader clinical context and that B-lines should be evaluated alongside other clinical indicators of volume status and cardiac function to effectively guide fluid management decisions. In patients presenting with pathologic bilateral B-lines that may not be secondary to cardiogenic pulmonary edema, dynamic indices of volume responsiveness may be helpful for guiding fluid management while weighing the risks and benefits of fluid administration in the patients' broader clinical context. It is important to note that even in cases of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, hypotensive patients may be hypovolemic and benefit from fluid administration as previously described by Figueras and Weil et al. For example, patients experiencing cardiogenic shock may require fluids, as acute pulmonary edema such as in the case of flash pulmonary edema from impaired left ventricular diastolic dysfunction can lead to a reduction in the effective circulating blood volume. Echocardiography and hemodynamic monitoring are valuable tools for assessing systolic and diastolic function, as well as dynamic measures of volume responsiveness, to optimize cardiac performance and guide therapies such as inotropes, vasodilator, vasopressor, fluid, and diuretic use to improve patient care while preventing further pulmonary edema within the patients' broader clinical context.

### Lung ultrasound-guided management of acute breathlessness during pregnancy [^0e30216c]. Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Lung ultrasonography is a standard tool in the intensive care unit and in emergency medicine, but has not been described in the particular setting of the labour ward. During pregnancy, acute respiratory failure and pulmonary oedema are not uncommon life-threatening events. We present two case reports outlining the potential of lung ultrasonography in parturients. In case 1, lung ultrasonography allowed early diagnosis and treatment of acute dyspnoea in a parturient admitted for suspected asthma exacerbation. Lung ultrasonography revealed a 'B-pattern' of vertical lines radiating into the lung tissue, indicating severe pulmonary oedema complicating previously undiagnosed pre-eclampsia. In case 2, a pre-eclamptic patient was managed with combined transthoracic echocardiography and lung ultrasonography. The accuracy of lung ultrasonography in detecting interstitial oedema at a pre-clinical stage allowed adequate fluid resuscitation in this patient who had a high risk of alveolar pulmonary oedema. We believe that these cases strongly support the prospective validation of lung ultrasound for management of lung disorders in pregnant women.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^83ec8196]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin — chronic hypertension in pregnancy delivery timing and management: delivery before 38 0/7 weeks of gestation is not recommended if not prescribed maintenance antihypertensive medications, and delivery before 37 0/7 weeks of gestation is not recommended if prescribed maintenance antihypertensive medications. Women with severe acute hypertension not controlled with traditional regimens or with superimposed preeclampsia with severe features should be delivered upon diagnosis at 34 0/7 weeks of gestation or more. Immediate delivery after maternal stabilization is recommended if any of the following are present at any gestational age in women with superimposed preeclampsia: uncontrollable severe hypertension, eclampsia, pulmonary edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, new or increasing renal insufficiency, placental abruption, or abnormal fetal testing. Women with superimposed preeclampsia with severe features before 34 0/7 weeks may be candidates for expectant management under certain circumstances, although expectant management is not recommended beyond 34 0/7 weeks of gestation, and in these cases, inpatient management is recommended at facilities with adequate maternal and neonatal intensive care resources. In women with superimposed preeclampsia without severe features and with stable maternal and fetal conditions, expectant management until 37 0/7 weeks of gestation with close maternal and fetal surveillance is suggested.

As guidelines state with a class of recommendation I to II a, level of evidence B, revascularization is the treatment of choice (PTRA + stent placement) for adult patients with ARAS in whom medical management fails to control hypertension, improve worsening renal function, or resolve heart failure. Pulmonary edema occurring swiftly and repeatedly (flash pulmonary edema), the key presentation of the Pickering syndrome, should be explicitly added to this list, as mentioned in the last Canadian Hypertension Guidelines, along with predialytic/dialytic CKD, especially if renal function decline has occurred in a short time after exposing the patients to an RAAS blocker (Table 2).

Recommendations to Revascularization With PTRAS in Patients With Hemodynamically Relevant ARAS

The anecdotal nature of our cases might be perceived as a limitation of this study. However, this is compensated by the amazing results obtained, which speak for themselves: revascularization saved our patients from hemodialysis and from an otherwise certain poor outcome in the short‐term; in some, it provided a long event‐free survival, which was even more impressive considering their age and clinical condition at presentation.

Results

Demographics

Among a total of 37,209,971 hospitalizations of women of reproductive age (18–45 years), 22,705,962 were pregnancy hospitalizations with no diagnosis of cardiogenic shock, while 845 were of pregnancies complicated by cardiogenic shock. Of nonpregnant women, 31,935 hospitalizations with cardiogenic shock were also included for comparison. Hospitalizations of pregnant women with cardiogenic shock involved, on average, an older cohort, longer lengths of stay, and higher costs compared to those of pregnant women without cardiogenic shock (Supplemental Table 2). When comparing the racial breakdown of hospitalizations of pregnant women with and without cardiogenic shock, cardiogenic shock in pregnancy was more prevalent in Black patients but less common in patients from White non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and Asian or Pacific Islander backgrounds. Hospitalizations of nonpregnant women with cardiogenic shock occurred in an older population and involved similar lengths of stay and hospitalization costs compared to those of pregnant women with cardiogenic shock (Table 1).

Comorbidities and complications

Hospitalizations of pregnant women with cardiogenic shock had higher prevalences of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, obesity, congenital heart disease, chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease, valvular disease, and pulmonary hypertension than those of pregnant women without cardiogenic shock (Central illustration B). Hospitalizations of pregnant women with cardiogenic shock also had a higher incidence of complications, including pulmonary edema (8.9% vs 0.07%, P < 0.001), cardiac arrest (13.6% vs 0.01%, P < 0.001), in-hospital mortality (17.8% vs 0.01%, P < 0.001), acute renal failure, liver failure, ischemic heart disease, and acute congestive heart failure than those of pregnant women without cardiogenic shock in both unadjusted and adjusted models (Supplemental Tables 2 and 3).

### Detecting pulmonary edema in obstetric patients through point-of-care lung ultrasonography [^58766664]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Point-of-care lung ultrasonography is used in critical care settings for evaluating respiratory symptoms. Lung ultrasonography is sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of pulmonary edema in nonpregnant patients but is not well-studied in pregnancy.

Technique

Lung ultrasonography was performed using a portable ultrasound machine with a 2- to 5-MHz curvilinear probe that is available on many labor and delivery units.

Experience

Lung ultrasonography guided management decisions in a case of shortness of breath after induction of labor for preeclampsia and a case of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome complicated by pulmonary edema. Findings expedited diagnosis and treatment in both cases.

Conclusion

Lung ultrasonography has potential to be used in obstetrics for detecting pulmonary edema in preeclampsia. It is a well-established tool in critical care settings and use in obstetric patients should be studied given the availability of ultrasonography on labor and delivery and the importance of timely care for critically ill pregnant patients. It is a safe modality to evaluate pregnant women with respiratory symptoms and the necessary skills can be easily acquired by obstetric practitioners familiar with obstetric ultrasonography. Training of obstetric practitioners in this application of ultrasonography is needed.

### Betamethasone use and risk factors for pulmonary edema during the perinatal period: a single-center retrospective cohort study in Japan [^cbe19022]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and population

This was a single-center retrospective cohort study using medical records and conducted at Kurashiki Central Hospital, which is a tertiary perinatal center in Kurashiki, Japan. The study subjects were patients who had been admitted to our hospital for perinatal management including pregnancy, delivery and puerperium between January 2017 and December 2020. We regarded different pregnancies in the same woman as different cases. In addition, even if the patient was hospitalized multiple times during the same pregnancy, the treatment during each hospitalization such as pregnancy and delivery management was counted separately, and analysis was performed on a case basis.

Data collection

We reviewed subjects' medical records and collected the following items: maternal age, weeks of gestation, body mass index, parity, and number of fetuses on admission, occurrence of delivery, duration of hospitalization, and obstetric complication (heart disease including arrhythmia and valvular disease, hypertensive disorder in pregnancy including preeclampsia, preterm rupture of membrane, and gestational diabetes mellitus). Moreover, the use of tocolytic agents (ritodrine hydrochloride and magnesium sulfate) and that of betamethasone as an antenatal corticosteroid, the incidence of PE, and period from admission or administration of these agents to occurrence of PE or discharge, and admission to the ICU were assessed.

Published randomized trials and observational studies regarding management of severe preeclampsia occurring < 34 weeks of gestation suggest that expectant management of selected patients can improve neonatal outcomes but that delivery is often required for worsening maternal or fetal condition. Patients who are not candidates for expectant management include women with eclampsia, pulmonary edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal insufficiency, abruptio placentae, abnormal fetal testing, HELLP syndrome, or persistent symptoms of severe preeclampsia. For women with severe preeclampsia before the limit of viability, expectant management has been associated with frequent maternal morbidity with minimal or no benefits to the newborn. Expectant management of a select group of women with severe preeclampsia occurring < 34 weeks' gestation may improve newborn outcomes but requires careful in-hospital maternal and fetal surveillance.

### Acute pulmonary edema in pregnancy [^654df1e8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the incidence, predisposing conditions, and inciting factors culminating in pulmonary edema in the pregnant patient.

Methods

A review of 62,917 consecutive pregnancies delivered at our institution from January 1, 1989 to June 1, 1999 was undertaken for the diagnosis of pulmonary edema. Each chart was reviewed for maternal demographics, admission diagnoses, medication use, gestational age at diagnosis, fluid balance, coexisting maternal illness, tocolytic use, evidence of preeclampsia, and diagnostic criteria. After careful review of the records, the most likely cause of pulmonary edema was assigned.

Results

Fifty-one women (0.08%) were diagnosed with acute pulmonary edema during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. The mean patient age at the time of diagnosis was 27.6 ± 6.4 years. The mean gestational age at the time of diagnosis was 31.5 ± 6.8 weeks. The diagnosis of pulmonary edema was made during the antepartum period in 24 patients (47%), the intrapartum period in seven (14%), and the postpartum period in 20 (39%). The most common attributable causes were tocolytic use (13 patients [25.5%]), cardiac disease (13 patients [25.5%]), fluid overload (11 patients [21.5%]), and preeclampsia (nine patients [18%]). Those with fluid overload identified as the likely etiology had a significantly greater mean positive fluid balance (6022 ± 3340 mL). All patients whose pulmonary edema was secondary to tocolytic use received multiple simultaneous tocolytic agents; the most common combination was intravenous magnesium sulfate and subcutaneous terbutaline. Six of the 13 women with cardiac disease were found to have previously undiagnosed structural heart disease.

Conclusion

The most common causes of pulmonary edema are the use of tocolytic agents, underlying cardiac disease, fluid overload, and preeclampsia.

### Critical illness in pregnancy: part II: common medical conditions complicating pregnancy and puerperium [^6c77c58c]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

The first of this two-part series on critical illness in pregnancy dealt with obstetric disorders. In Part II, medical conditions that commonly affect pregnant women or worsen during pregnancy are discussed. ARDS occurs more frequently in pregnancy. Strategies commonly used in nonpregnant patients, including permissive hypercapnia, limits for plateau pressure, and prone positioning, may not be acceptable, especially in late pregnancy. Genital tract infections unique to pregnancy include chorioamnionitis, group A streptococcal infection causing toxic shock syndrome, and polymicrobial infection with streptococci, staphylococci, and Clostridium perfringens causing necrotizing vulvitis or fasciitis. Pregnancy predisposes to VTE; D-dimer levels have low specificity in pregnancy. A ventilation-perfusion scan is preferred over CT pulmonary angiography in some situations to reduce radiation to the mother's breasts. Low-molecular-weight or unfractionated heparins form the mainstay of treatment; vitamin K antagonists, oral factor Xa inhibitors, and direct thrombin inhibitors are not recommended in pregnancy. The physiologic hyperdynamic circulation in pregnancy worsens many cardiovascular disorders. It increases risk of pulmonary edema or arrhythmias in mitral stenosis, heart failure in pulmonary hypertension or aortic stenosis, aortic dissection in Marfan syndrome, or valve thrombosis in mechanical heart valves. Common neurologic problems in pregnancy include seizures, altered mental status, visual symptoms, and strokes. Other common conditions discussed are aspiration of gastric contents, OSA, thyroid disorders, diabetic ketoacidosis, and cardiopulmonary arrest in pregnancy. Studies confined to pregnant women are available for only a few of these conditions. We have, therefore, reviewed pregnancy-specific adjustments in the management of these disorders.

### Biomarkers and point of care screening approaches for the management of preeclampsia [^65fceac7]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Current methods for detecting and treating preeclampsia

Based on the guidelines from various global organizations, preeclampsia is generally defined as a condition that occurs in pregnancy or the postpartum period, characterized primarily by new-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension accompanied by evidence of end-organ injury. Specifically, the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP)defines preeclampsia as gestational hypertension accompanied by proteinuria or other maternal end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks of gestation. This includes neurological complications, pulmonary edema, hematological complications, acute kidney injury (AKI), liver involvement, and uteroplacental dysfunction. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)identifies preeclampsia as new-onset hypertension after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with either proteinuria or other maternal organ dysfunction. This includes renal insufficiency, liver involvement, neurological complications, hematological complications, and uteroplacental dysfunction. In contrast, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)no longer considers proteinuria a necessary sign for diagnosing preeclampsia. ACOG's guidelines focus on elevated blood pressure with either proteinuria or other complications such as thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, impaired liver function, pulmonary edema, or cerebral/visual symptoms.

While definitions of preeclampsia historically focused primarily on the combination of high blood pressure and proteinuria, modern guidelines recognize a broader spectrum of symptoms and complications. These include, but are not limited to, organ dysfunction (such as renal, liver, or neurological complications), hematological issues such as HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelets) syndrome, and uteroplacental dysfunction. This evolution in the definition allows for a more comprehensive and sensitive approach to diagnosing and managing preeclampsia, with the ultimate aim of improving outcomes for both pregnant people and their neonates.

Most interventions for PE primarily address advanced presentations, incorporating the use of antihypertensive drugs to control severe hypertension and prevent maternal morbidity, corticosteroids to prevent neonatal morbidity, and preterm delivery if evidence of HELLP syndrome or other end-organ dysfunction arises –. Several preventive strategies with mixed efficacy, among them the administration of aspirin prior to 16-weeks' gestation, have been suggested to potentially mitigate PE risk. However, the effectiveness of these strategies hinges on the availability of screening technologies capable of detecting PE biomarkers at the earliest gestational stages, thereby enabling timely intervention.

### Betamethasone use and risk factors for pulmonary edema during the perinatal period: a single-center retrospective cohort study in Japan [^a73a066f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Another finding of this study was that the preeclampsia and multiple pregnancies were significantly more common in PE cases than in non-PE cases, as well as the usage of tocolytic agents and betamethasone. Also, multivariate analysis revealed that preeclampsia was a risk factor for PE. Preeclampsia is known to the cause of noncardiogenic PE, which is consistent with the result of previous studies. On the other hand, multiple pregnancies themselves were not the independent risk of PE. Maternal cardio output in multiple pregnancies increased by about 20% compared to single pregnancy, suggesting that multiple pregnancies are associated with the risk of PE, whereas, there is a report documenting that multiple pregnancies in combination with the use of tocolytic agents increase the risk of PE. Thus, the result of this study revealed that multiple pregnancies were not a risk factor for PE. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in body mass index and pregnancy with heart disease between PE and non-PE cases. Regarding obesity, although it has been pointed out that obesity is a risk factor for PE, there is a study showing that no significant difference was observed in the incidence of PE between obese pregnant women complicated with preeclampsia and non-obese pregnant women, which supports the results of this study. Regarding pregnancy with heart disease, this may be related to the fact that there were no pregnant women with high-risk heart disease in this study, such as a history of NYHA 3 or higher heart failure, which increases the risk of PE, and that the incidence of PE in pregnant women with heart disease has been reported to be on the decline.

Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia — vascular changes — women with preeclampsia or eclampsia typically lack pregnancy-associated hypervolemia with hemoconcentration, and vasoactive mediator imbalance produces intense vasospasm; attempts to expand intravascular volume with vigorous fluids are likely ineffective and can be dangerous due to capillary leak and low oncotic pressure, with aggressive fluids elevating pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and increasing pulmonary edema risk; before fluids, hyperdynamic ventricular function with low wedge pressure has been noted, whereas after aggressive fluids wedge pressure increased significantly above normal with increased pulmonary edema risk.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Intravenous antihypertensive drugs for hypertensive emergencies — selected comorbidities and key directives: For acute aortic dissection, preferred drugs are esmolol and labetalol and management requires rapid lowering of SBP to ≤ 120 mm Hg with beta blockade preceding vasodilator administration if needed; SBP ≤ 120 mm Hg should be achieved within 20 min. For acute pulmonary edema, preferred drugs are clevidipine, nitroglycerin, and nitroprusside, and beta blockers are contraindicated. In acute coronary syndromes, preferred drugs are esmolol, labetalol, nicardipine, and nitroglycerin; nitrates given in the presence of PDE-5 inhibitors may induce profound hypotension, and beta-blocker contraindications include bradycardia (< 60 beats/min) and hypotension (SBP < 100 mm Hg). For perioperative hypertension (BP ≥ 160/90 mm Hg or SBP elevation ≥ 20% of the preoperative value that persists ≥ 15 min), preferred drugs include clevidipine, esmolol, nicardipine, and nitroglycerin, and intraoperative hypertension is most frequently seen during anesthesia induction and airway manipulation. For eclampsia or preeclampsia, preferred drugs are hydralazine, labetalol, nicardipine, and nifedipine, and this condition requires rapid BP lowering with ACE inhibitors, ARB, renin inhibitors, and nitroprusside contraindicated.

### Betamethasone use and risk factors for pulmonary edema during the perinatal period: a single-center retrospective cohort study in Japan [^23374ffc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes

During the study period, 4919 cases were hospitalized. Table 1 shows the baseline patient characteristics and clinical outcomes by the presence or absence of PE. There were 16 PE cases (0.3%). As complications, hypertensive disorder in pregnancy including preeclampsia, multiple pregnancies were significantly more common in the PE group than in the non-PE group. Of 16 PE cases, there were 9 cases with hypertensive disorder in pregnancy, 8 of which had preeclampsia. Four cases were multiple pregnancies, all of which were twin pregnancies. The usage rates of betamethasone, ritodrine hydrochloride, and magnesium sulfate, and the rate of admission to the ICU were significantly higher in the PE group than in the non-PE group. In the PE group, ritodrine hydrochloride was administrated to 5, magnesium sulfate to 12, and betamethasone to 10. There were no significant differences in age and body mass index, parity on admission, preterm rupture of membrane, and gestational diabetes mellitus.

Table 2 shows the characteristics of the16 PE cases. Eight cases complicated preeclampsia. Although none of the 16 cases had a history of heart disease, 2 cases developed cardiogenic PE; one was caused by perinatal cardiomyopathy and the other by mitral regurgitation due to mitral valve prolapse during pregnancy. Of 16 cases, 14 cases developed PE during pregnancy and 2 case after delivery. The median week of gestation at the onset of PE was 31 + 2 weeks. Eleven cases underwent termination of pregnancy within 1 day of the onset of PE, while 3 cases were treated conservatively. In the 16 PE cases, there were no PE cases due to betamethasone use alone, but there were 10 PE cases due to the use of tocolytic agents + betamethasone. The median time from the start of ritodrine hydrochloride and magnesium sulfate to the onset of PE was 4 days and 2 days, respectively, and that from the last dose of betamethasone to the onset of PE was 0 days.

### Effect of furosemide in the treatment of high-altitude pulmonary edema [^acbc5735]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study subjects

We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with HAPE admitted to the People's Hospital of Shigatse City from January 2018 to September 2023. Inclusion criteria were age greater than or equal to 18 years and onset of symptoms within one week of arrival in high-altitude areas. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy or lactation, average arterial pressure < 65mmHg on admission, hospitalized for less than 3 days, and incomplete data (patients who did not undergo lung Computed Tomography (CT) assessments before and after treatment). The follow-up period extended from the time of admission to discharge. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the People's Hospital of Shigatse City, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient or their family members (2023RKZRMYY12M008).

Patient management

During the emergency department visit, all patients underwent lung CT scans to confirm the presence of pulmonary edema. Upon admission, all patients received supplemental oxygen and bed rest. Symptomatic supportive treatment, including appropriate anti-infection and antihypertensive therapy, was administered based on the presence of complications such as respiratory tract infections and hypertension. The use of diuretics was determined by the attending physician's experience. All patients completed lung CT examination three days after treatment. Patients were divided into a furosemide group and a control group based on whether furosemide was used on the day of admission. Subgroup analysis was further conducted based on the dosage and duration of furosemide use.

### Malignant pulmonary edema in a pregnant woman caused by cor triatriatum [^cbdc5084]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Undiagnosed maternal congenital heart disease can result in significant risks to both mother and fetus. When maternal symptoms and signs are atypical of preeclampsia, broadening the differential diagnosis and multidisciplinary consultation can lead to improved outcomes.

Case

A 24-year-old primiparous woman with a pregnancy complicated by elevated blood pressure and proteinuria presented at term with symptoms of decreased fetal movement, increasing dyspnea, and cough. Her symptoms progressively worsened until she experienced cardiorespiratory arrest during attempted intubation. Emergency cesarean delivery was performed after 5 minutes of resuscitation efforts. Echocardiogram performed after delivery revealed cor triatriatum requiring surgical excision.

Conclusion

A complete differential diagnosis for edema, hypertension, and dyspnea near term will allow for recognition of more rare conditions. Referral to cardiology in cases in which work-up is negative for preeclampsia may aid in earlier diagnosis and management. A team approach to management involving obstetrics and medicine will improve the rapidity with which rare conditions can be managed effectively.

Delivery plans for women with confirmed pre‐eclampsia: delivery for pre‐eclampsia at any gestational age is recommended when there is one or more of the following conditions: abnormal neurological features such as severe intractable headache, repeated visual scotomata, eclampsia, or stroke; repeated episodes of severe hypertension despite maintenance treatment with three classes of antihypertensive agents; pulmonary edema or oxygen saturation < 90%; progressive thrombocytopenia (particularly < 50 × 10 9 /L or need for transfusion); abnormal and rising serum creatinine; abruption with evidence of maternal or fetal compromise; nonreassuring fetal status (including intrauterine fetal death). Mode of delivery is determined by several factors that include gestational age, fetal condition, and other concurrent obstetrics factors such as previous cesarean section.

Postpartum care: blood pressure should continue to be monitored after delivery until 6 days after birth, as it is likely to be highest 3–6 days after birth. Antihypertensive therapy that has been administered before birth should be continued after birth for as long as required to maintain blood pressure control. Consideration should be given to administering antihypertensive therapy for any hypertension diagnosed up to 6 days after delivery. Hypertensive pregnancy disorders should be acknowledged as predictors of long‐term maternal cardiovascular morbidity. The following measures should be implemented at 6–12 weeks after birth, and periodically thereafter, preferably yearly, following a pregnancy complicated by hypertensive disorders: history and physical examination, blood pressure measurements, and consideration of screening for other cardiovascular risk factors and for diabetes according to additional risk factors.

Automated blood pressure devices: Only automated blood pressure devices that have been shown to be accurate in pregnancy and pre‐eclampsia should be used.

6.1.2 Soluble fms‐like tyrosine kinase 1 to placental growth factor ratio

The role of the sFlt‐1/PLGF ratio to predict adverse outcomes related to pre‐eclampsia was investigated in a prospective study with 616 women presenting with signs and symptoms of the disease. Women were eligible for enrolment when they presented with either elevated blood pressure or proteinuria and/or symptoms such as headache, visual symptoms, right upper quadrant pain, or edema. The primary endpoint was the development of maternal and/or fetal adverse events related to pre‐eclampsia within 2 weeks. Maternal adverse events were defined as a combination of hypertension and abnormal liver function tests, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pulmonary edema, or eclampsia. Fetal adverse events included indicated delivery, fetal growth restriction, or fetal or neonatal death. Adverse events occurred in 43.5% of all patients (n = 268) and in 33.5% of women presenting at less than 34 weeks of gestation (n = 59). Women who had an adverse event related to pre‐eclampsia had a significantly elevated sFlt‐1/PLGF ratio compared with those who did not (47.0, interquartile range [IQR] 15.5–112.2 vs 10.8, IQR 4.1–28.6; P < 0.001). In women who presented at less than 34 weeks of gestation (n = 176), the results were more striking (226.6, IQR 50.4–547.3 vs 4.5, IQR 2.0–13.5; P < 0.001). For women who presented before 34 weeks of gestation, the addition of the sFlt‐1/PLGF ratio to hypertension and proteinuria significantly improved the prediction for subsequent adverse outcomes (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.93 for hypertension, proteinuria, and sFlt‐1/PLGF ratio versus 0.84 for hypertension and proteinuria alone; P < 0.001). Delivery occurred within 2 weeks of presentation in 86.0% of women with an sFlt‐1/PLGF ratio greater than 85 compared with 15.8% of women with an sFlt‐1/PLGF ratio less than 85 (hazard ratio, 15.2; 95% CI, 8.0–28.7).

### Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and the recent increase in obstetric acute renal failure in Canada: population based retrospective cohort study [^1a7f9836]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and clinical implications

In conclusion, we observed a significant increase in obstetric acute renal failure in Canada that was restricted to women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and was particularly evident among those with gestational hypertension with significant proteinuria. Further studies are required to confirm our findings, including those related to temporal trends in pulmonary oedema, and to determine the specific aspect of pre-eclampsia management (fluid restriction, antihypertensive and other drug use) that may be increasing the risk of pregnancy related kidney injury. In addition, the long term impact of pregnancy related kidney injury requires further study. Meanwhile, clinicians managing women with pre-eclampsia should carefully monitor them for signs of impending renal failure and take appropriate steps to mitigate the risk of further kidney injury.

### Assessment and prediction of cardiovascular contributions to severe maternal morbidity [^141378ef]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary edema/acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock

Acute pulmonary edema/heart failure occurred in 2.4 cases per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations in the United States in 2014. In severe cases mechanical ventilation may be necessary, which itself is an indicator of severe maternal morbidity. Certain conditions are well known to increase the risk of symptomatic heart failure during pregnancy, including known preexisting dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or valvular diseases such as mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, or mitral or aortic insufficiency, or ventricular dysfunction of any cause. One case report shows the development of stress cardiomyopathy prompted by emergency cesarean section. Other factors associated with heart failure include use of tocolytic agents, severe preeclampsia, and iatrogenic hypervolemia., Some forms of congenital heart disease also increase the risk of developing heart failure or arrhythmia during pregnancy.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy is defined as clinical heart failure in the absence of any other identifiable causes with evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction < 45% with or without left ventricular dilatation. Peripartum cardiomyopathy occurs in the last month or within 5 months postdelivery. As many as 60% of patients present postpartum. It can progress to overt shock, which complicated 3 per every 10,000 delivery hospitalizations in the United States in 2014.

Valvular heart disease

In women with significant mitral stenosis, the increased intravascular volume and heart rate during pregnancy can precipitate arrhythmia and pulmonary edema. The etiology of mitral stenosis is commonly rheumatic, and in many women, the initial diagnosis is not made until cardiovascular decompensation occurs as a result of pregnancy. Patients with severe aortic stenosis have a reduced ability to accommodate increased intravascular volume due to a fixed outflow tract obstruction, and thus may develop pulmonary edema, peripheral edema, or AF or other SVT., Aortic stenosis in women is often due to a bicuspid aortic valve and may be known prior to pregnancy. Isolated mild-to-moderate left-sided valvular insufficiency with normal ventricular function generally does not markedly increase heart failure risk during pregnancy, as the decreased systemic vascular resistance during pregnancy favors forward flow.

Aortic dissection

Aortic dissection is a major cause of cardiovascular maternal mortality and morbidity, accounting for 11% of cardiac maternal deaths in the United Kingdom. Most cases occur in women with heritable aortopathy such as Marfan or Loeys-Dietz syndromes; although cases have been reported with bicuspid aortic valve as well. Delayed diagnosis is a significant contributor to poor outcomes and therefore a high index of suspicion is required to diagnose and treat this condition in a timely manner.
