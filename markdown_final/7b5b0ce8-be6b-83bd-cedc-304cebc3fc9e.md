## Question

I have a pt whose diabetes is not managed oh long acting insulin and a low intensity sliding scale which should I adjust

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which insulin regimen to adjust for a hospitalized patient with diabetes who is currently on long-acting insulin plus a low-intensity sliding scale and is not achieving glycemic targets. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current regimen and why it is failing. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for inpatient non-ICU management. Next, I will examine the evidence comparing basal-bolus versus sliding scale and consider alternatives like basal-plus. After that, I need to check dosing strategies, including weight-based calculations and adjustments for age, renal function, and nutrition. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise plan with monitoring, hypoglycemia mitigation, and discharge considerations, and I will confirm whether any exceptions apply to this case.

> Let me first confirm the problem with the current regimen. Long-acting basal insulin alone addresses fasting and interprandial hepatic glucose production but does not cover meal-related excursions, and relying on low-intensity sliding scale insulin as the only prandial strategy is reactive, treats hyperglycemia after it occurs, and is associated with worse glycemic control and more complications than scheduled prandial insulin, so the regimen is fundamentally incomplete for most inpatients with adequate intake [^f79fc0da] [^da90ce27] [^c8ad0911].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance before jumping to changes. The ADA and AACE recommend scheduled subcutaneous insulin with basal, prandial, and correction components for non-critically ill inpatients with adequate nutrition, and they advise against using correction insulin alone without basal insulin; importantly, they also caution against prolonged use of sliding scale insulin as the sole method of control, which aligns with the evidence that SSI monotherapy is inferior and potentially harmful in type 1 diabetes and many type 2 scenarios [^f8c67e87] [^f0feb6c5] [^da90ce27] [^fb8878e9].

> I will now examine the comparative evidence. Randomized trials and meta-analyses show that basal-bolus regimens improve glycemic control and reduce treatment failure compared with sliding scale alone, though they may increase mild hypoglycemia; for example, RABBIT 2 showed more patients achieving mean glucose less than 140 mg/dL with basal-bolus versus SSI, and the Cochrane review found lower mean glucose with basal-bolus at the expense of more hypoglycemia, underscoring the need for protocolized dosing and monitoring [^db71bef3] [^c8ad0911]. Hold on, I should also consider a less intensive alternative: basal-plus (basal once daily plus correction before meals) can achieve control comparable to full basal-bolus in some studies and may be reasonable when meal intake is unpredictable or staffing is constrained, though it still requires scheduled basal and correction rather than SSI alone [^b6d19b83] [^33462c33].

> Next, I should review dosing strategy. For most non-critically ill adults with adequate intake, a total daily insulin dose of about 0.3–0.5 units/kg is reasonable, with roughly 50% as basal and 50% divided among premeal boluses; in older adults or those with eGFR less than 60 mL/min, I need to start lower, around 0.2–0.25 units/kg/day, and titrate cautiously to a fasting target of 140–180 mg/dL, balancing hypoglycemia risk [^da90ce27] [^ffaa2cda]. Let me double-check: yes, ADA/AACE endorse this split and recommend basal analogs with rapid-acting mealtime insulin for inpatient basal-bolus, with dose adjustments based on premeal glucose and clinical status [^da90ce27] [^fb8878e9].

> But wait, what if the patient has poor or inconsistent oral intake? In that scenario, basal-only or basal plus correction is preferred, and prandial insulin should be held or reduced to mitigate hypoglycemia; I should confirm that basal is not withheld even if the patient is NPO, because hepatic glucose production continues and omission risks rebound hyperglycemia or ketosis in susceptible patients [^da90ce27] [^ffaa2cda]. I need to ensure the plan is reassessed daily as intake changes to avoid both hyper- and hypoglycemia [^da90ce27].

> I should confirm the practical steps to convert the regimen. First, calculate the total daily dose using 0.3–0.5 units/kg (or 0.2–0.25 units/kg if elderly or CKD), then divide 50% to basal glargine or degludec once daily and 50% to rapid-acting insulin (aspart, lispro, or glulisine) before each meal; if using basal-plus, give the full basal dose and add correction doses before meals using a standardized scale, with a low threshold to escalate to full basal-bolus if persistent hyperglycemia occurs [^da90ce27] [^b6d19b83]. Hold on, I should verify that correction insulin is layered on top of scheduled doses, not used alone; that is the key distinction from sliding scale monotherapy and is explicitly recommended by ADA/AACE [^f8c67e87] [^da90ce27].

> Next, I should review titration and monitoring. I need to order premeal and bedtime glucose checks, then titrate basal every 2–3 days to a fasting target of 140–180 mg/dL, and titrate prandial doses every 2–3 days based on premeal values, increasing by about 10–20% if above target and decreasing by 10–20% if hypoglycemia occurs; this cadence balances efficacy and safety in the hospital [^da90ce27] [^45de8d8e]. Let me reconsider whether less frequent checks suffice; no, for basal-bolus therapy, premeal and bedtime monitoring is standard to guide both basal and bolus adjustments and to detect nocturnal hypoglycemia [^da90ce27].

> I need to ensure hypoglycemia mitigation is built in. Define hypoglycemia as less than 70 mg/dL, treat with 15 g dextrose, and if it recurs, reduce the responsible insulin component by 10–20%; in older adults or those with high risk, I should individualize targets upward and consider less aggressive titration to avoid falls and cognitive injury from hypoglycemia [^da90ce27] [^8e236907]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with geriatric guidance; yes, AGS and endocrine society emphasize avoiding hypoglycemia and simplifying regimens in older adults, which supports cautious inpatient titration and discharge planning [^8e236907] [^84c561d1].

> Let me think about discharge and transitions. I should reconcile home medications, review A1C if unknown, and simplify to a regimen the patient can manage, often basal-only or basal-plus if intake is uncertain, with clear hypoglycemia education and follow-up; I should avoid carrying forward complex inpatient basal-bolus regimens unless the patient has the capacity and support to sustain them [^da90ce27] [^58a7e294]. I should double-check that this approach reduces overtreatment risk, which is well documented in older adults discharged on new insulins after transient inpatient hyperglycemia [^5987cf40].

> Hmm, wait a minute, are there any exceptions where SSI alone might be acceptable here? Observational data suggest that patients with mild hyperglycemia at admission (less than 180 mg/dL) may occasionally do okay with SSI alone, but that is not the scenario described, and guidelines still discourage SSI monotherapy; thus, I should not rely on that exception in this case [^71d4c17c] [^f8c67e87]. I should confirm that the balance of evidence and recommendations supports moving to scheduled basal-bolus or basal-plus rather than persisting with basal plus low-intensity SSI, which it does [^da90ce27] [^c8ad0911].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is to intensify from basal plus low-intensity sliding scale to a scheduled basal-bolus regimen using 0.3–0.5 units/kg/day total, 50% basal and 50% divided among premeal rapid-acting insulin, with premeal and bedtime glucose checks and protocolized titration every 2–3 days; if meal intake is unpredictable, a basal-plus approach with correction only is reasonable, but I should monitor closely and escalate to full basal-bolus if hyperglycemia persists [^da90ce27] [^b6d19b83]. I should confirm that this plan aligns with ADA/AACE guidance and the evidence base, which it does, and I will reassess daily for changes in intake, renal function, and hypoglycemia risk to adjust dosing accordingly [^f8c67e87] [^da90ce27].

Stop the sliding scale and **start basal-bolus insulin** with a long-acting basal (e.g. glargine) and rapid-acting bolus before meals, plus correction doses [^f8c67e87] [^da90ce27]. Sliding scale alone is reactive, causes glycemic swings, and is linked to more complications and longer stays [^c8ad0911] [^8e236907]. Use **0.4–0.5 units/kg/day total**, split 50% basal and 50% prandial, and titrate every 2–3 days to 140–180 mg/dL [^da90ce27] [^ffaa2cda]. If intake is poor, use basal plus correction; if persistent hyperglycemia occurs, add prandial insulin [^da90ce27] [^b6d19b83]. Monitor premeal and bedtime glucose, and adjust based on trends to reduce hypoglycemia and variability [^da90ce27] [^8e236907].

---

## Rationale for changing the insulin regimen

Sliding scale insulin (SSI) is reactive, treating hyperglycemia after it occurs, and is associated with:

- **Increased hyperglycemia and glycemic variability**: SSI alone is inferior to basal-bolus for control and variability [^c8ad0911] [^54d0347f].
- **Higher risk of complications**: SSI alone is linked to more infections, longer stays, and higher costs [^75ea783c] [^ae5cf092].
- **Increased hypoglycemia risk**: Especially in older adults, SSI increases hypoglycemia without improving control [^d9839a82] [^a1be4b87].

---

## Recommended insulin regimen adjustment

Transition to a **basal-bolus regimen** with scheduled basal, prandial, and correction insulin [^f8c67e87] [^da90ce27]:

| **Component** | **Insulin type** | **Dose calculation** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Basal insulin | Long-acting (glargine, detemir, degludec) | 0.2–0.3 units/kg/day | Once daily at bedtime or same time each day |
| Prandial insulin | Rapid-acting (aspart, lispro, glulisine) | 0.1–0.2 units/kg/meal | 15 minutes before meals |
| Correction insulin | Rapid-acting | Based on insulin sensitivity factor (ISF) | Before meals and at bedtime if glucose > 180 mg/dL |

---

Total daily insulin: **0.4–0.5 units/kg/day**, split 50% basal and 50% prandial; adjust every 2–3 days to 140–180 mg/dL [^da90ce27] [^ffaa2cda].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting basal-bolus insulin

Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show basal-bolus improves control and reduces complications versus SSI alone:

- **RABBIT-2 trial**: Basal-bolus achieved target glucose more often than SSI (66% vs 38%) without more hypoglycemia [^db71bef3].
- **Basal-plus trial**: Basal plus correction beat SSI for control and reduced treatment failure [^b6d19b83].
- **Cochrane review**: Basal-bolus lowers mean glucose vs SSI but may increase mild hypoglycemia; overall outcomes favor basal-bolus [^c8ad0911].

---

## Monitoring and titration strategy

- **Glucose monitoring**: Check premeal and bedtime glucose daily.
- **Titration**: Adjust basal and prandial doses every 2–3 days to 140–180 mg/dL; modify correction scale to the patient's sensitivity [^da90ce27] [^45de8d8e].
- **Hypoglycemia management**: Treat < 70 mg/dL with 15 g dextrose and reduce insulin by 10–20% if recurrent [^da90ce27] [^45de8d8e].

---

## Special considerations

- **Poor oral intake**: Use basal plus correction; avoid prandial insulin if not eating [^da90ce27] [^ffaa2cda].
- **Renal impairment**: Start at 0.2–0.25 units/kg/day and titrate cautiously [^da90ce27] [^ffaa2cda].
- **Older adults**: Individualize targets, prioritize avoiding hypoglycemia, and simplify regimens [^8e236907] [^84c561d1].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Stop sliding scale insulin**: Discontinue SSI as sole therapy [^f8c67e87] [^da90ce27].
- **Start basal-bolus insulin**: Basal (long-acting) plus prandial (rapid-acting) with correction doses [^f8c67e87] [^da90ce27].
- **Calculate total daily dose**: 0.4–0.5 units/kg/day, 50% basal, 50% prandial [^da90ce27] [^ffaa2cda].
- **Titrate regularly**: Adjust every 2–3 days to 140–180 mg/dL [^da90ce27] [^ffaa2cda].
- **Monitor closely**: Premeal and bedtime glucose; adjust based on trends and hypoglycemia [^da90ce27] [^8e236907].

Switching from sliding scale to basal-bolus insulin improves control, reduces complications, and is the **standard of care** for hospitalized patients with diabetes [^f8c67e87] [^da90ce27].

Inpatient hyperglycemia in people with or without diabetes is associated with an increased risk of complications and mortality, a longer hospital stay, a higher admission rate to the intensive care unit, and higher hospitalization costs. Despite increasing evidence that supports intensive glycemic control in hospitalized patients, blood glucose control continues to be challenging, and sliding scale insulin coverage, a practice associated with limited therapeutic success, continues to be the most frequent insulin regimen in hospitalized patients. Sliding scale insulin has been in use for more than 80 years without much evidence to support its use as the standard of care. Several studies have revealed evidence of poor glycemic control and deleterious effects in sliding scale insulin use. To understand its wide use and acceptance, we reviewed the origin, advantages, and disadvantages of sliding scale insulin in the inpatient setting.

### Hypoglycemia and diabetes: a report of a workgroup of the American diabetes association and the endocrine society [^a1be4b87]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Older adults with diabetes have a disproportionately high number of clinical complications and comorbidities, all of which can be exacerbated by and sometimes contribute to episodes of hypoglycemia. Older adults with diabetes are at much higher risk for the geriatric syndrome, which includes falls, incontinence, frailty, cognitive impairment, and depressive symptoms. The cognitive and executive dysfunction associated with the geriatric syndrome interferes with the patient's ability to perform self-care activities appropriately and follow the treatment regimen.

To minimize the risk of hypoglycemia in the elderly, careful education regarding the symptoms and treatment of hypoglycemia, with regular reinforcement, is extremely important because of the recognized gaps in the knowledge base of these individuals. In addition, it is important to assess the elderly for functional status as part of the overall clinical assessment in order to properly apply individualized glycemic control goals. Arbitrary short-acting insulin sliding scales, which are used much too often in long-term care facilities, should be avoided, and glyburide should be discontinued in favor of shorter-acting insulin secretagogues or medications that do not cause hypoglycemia. The recently published 2012 Beers list of prohibited medications in long-term care facilities specifically lists insulin sliding scales and glyburide as treatment modalities that should be avoided. Complex regimens requiring multiple decision points should be simplified, especially for patients with decreased functional status. In addition, caregivers and staff in long-term care facilities need to be educated on the causes and risks of hypoglycemia and the proper surveillance and treatment of this condition.

Inpatient diabetes management — noncritically ill targets and insulin therapy: For most noncritically ill persons in the hospital setting, a glucose target of 140 to 180 mg/dL is recommended; a lower target range (100 to 140 mg/dL) may be reasonable when glycemic control can be achieved without hypoglycemia, whereas less stringent targets are appropriate for those with high clinical complexity, terminal illness, limited life expectancy, or high risk for hypoglycemia. Insulin therapy following approved protocols is recommended as the preferred therapy for managing hyperglycemia in the hospital, and for noncritically ill persons with T2D, an individualized approach is recommended and may include consideration of noninsulin agents alone or in combination with insulin. For hospitalized persons with satisfactory oral intake, the insulin regimen should include basal, prandial, and correction doses; for those without adequate food intake, basal, prandial, and correction doses should be used as necessary, and extensive use of "sliding-scale" insulin should only be used for those whose glucose are in the target range most of the time, and only occasionally exceed it.

Background

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, function, or both. Hyperglycaemia in non-critically ill hospitalised people is associated with poor clinical outcomes (infections, prolonged hospital stay, poor wound healing, higher morbidity and mortality). In the hospital setting people diagnosed with diabetes receive insulin therapy as part of their treatment in order to achieve metabolic control. However, insulin therapy can be provided by different strategies (sliding scale insulin (SSI), basal-bolus insulin, and other modalities). Sliding scale insulin is currently the most commonly used method, however there is uncertainty about which strategy provides the best patient outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the effects of SSI for non-critically ill hospitalised adults with diabetes mellitus.

Search Methods

We identified eligible trials by searching MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and the Cochrane Library. We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov trial registers. The date of the last search for all databases was December 2017. We also examined reference lists of identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews, and contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing SSI with other strategies for glycaemic control in non-critically ill hospitalised adult participants of any sex with diabetes mellitus.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed trials for risk of bias, and evaluated the overall certainty of evidence utilising the GRADE instrument. We synthesised data using a random-effects model meta-analysis with 95% prediction intervals, if possible, or descriptive analysis, as appropriate.

Main Results

Of 720 records screened, we included eight trials that randomised 1048 participants with type 2 diabetes (387 SSI participants and 615 participants in comparator groups were available for final analysis). We included non-critically ill medical and surgical adults with the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. The mean follow-up time was measured by the mean length of hospital stay and ranged between five and 24 days. The mean age of participants was 44.5 years to 71 years. Overall, we judged the risk of bias on the trial level as unclear for selection bias, high for outcome-related performance and detection bias with regard to hypoglycaemic episodes, other adverse events, and mean glucose levels, and low for all-cause mortality and length of hospital stay. Attrition bias was low for all outcome measures. Six trials compared SSI with a basal-bolus insulin scheme, three of which investigating 64% of all participants in this category also applying an SSI approach in the bolus comparator part. One trial had a basal insulin-only comparator arm, and the remaining trial used continuous insulin infusion as the comparator. For our main comparison of SSI versus basal-bolus insulin, the results were as follows. Four trials reported mortality data. One out of 268 participants in the SSI group (0.3%) compared with two out of 334 participants in the basal-bolus group (0.6%) died (low-certainty evidence). Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, defined as blood glucose levels below 40 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L), showed a risk ratio (RR) of 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 1.00; P = 0.05; 5 trials; 667 participants; very low-certainty evidence. The 95% prediction interval ranged between 0.02 and 2.57. All nine severe hypoglycaemic episodes were observed among the 369 participants on basal-bolus insulin (2.4%). The mean length of hospital stay was 0.5 days longer for the SSI group, 95% CI -0.5 to 1.4; P = 0.32; 6 trials; 717 participants; very low-certainty evidence. The 95% prediction interval ranged between -1.7 days and 2.7 days. Adverse events other than hypoglycaemic episodes, such as postoperative infections, showed a RR of 1.16, 95% CI 0.25 to 5.37; P = 0.85; 3 trials; 481 participants; very low-certainty evidence. The mean blood glucose levels ranged across basal-bolus groups from 156 mg/dL (8.7 mmol/L) to 221 mg/dL (12.3 mmol/L). The mean blood glucose level in the SSI groups was 14.8 mg/dL (0.8 mmol/L) higher (95% CI 7.8 (0.4) to 21.8 (1.2); P < 0.001; 6 trials; 717 participants; low-certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between -3.6 mg/dL (-0.2 mmol/L) and 33.2 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L). No trial reported on diabetes-related mortality or socioeconomic effects.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain which insulin strategy (SSI or basal-bolus insulin) is best for non-critically hospitalised adults with diabetes mellitus. A basal-bolus insulin strategy in these patients might result in better short-term glycaemic control but could increase the risk for severe hypoglycaemic episodes. The certainty of the body of evidence comparing SSI with basal-bolus insulin was low to very low and needs to be improved by adequately performed, well-powered RCTs in different hospital environments with well-educated medical staff using identical short-acting insulins in both intervention and comparator arms to compare the rigid SSI approach with flexible insulin application strategies.

Hospitalized adults — non-ICU insulin therapy — scheduled subcutaneous insulin regimens with a combination of basal, nutritional, and correction components is recommended, and prolonged use of "sliding" scale insulin as the sole method of glucose control is strongly discouraged; clinicians should only consider using "sliding" scale insulin for persons whose glucoses are in the target range most of the time; RCTs have shown that treatment with a basal prandial regimen with insulin analogs improved glycemic control compared with sliding-scale regular insulin alone, and persons with T1D should be treated with basal-prandial insulin regimens to avoid severe hyperglycemia and DKA; in insulin-naïve persons with T2D, a starting insulin TDD between 0.3 and 0.5 units/kg/day is effective and safe, while in elderly persons with impaired kidney function a lower starting insulin TDD of 0.20 to 0.25 units/kg are recommended; for those whose glucose is controlled with insulin prior to admission, reducing the insulin TDD by 20% to 25% is recommended when caloric intake is poor, and persons with T2D receiving insulin therapy before admission are at risk for severe hyperglycemia in the hospital if insulin therapy is discontinued; in a single-center RCT, correctional insulin sliding scales did not improve glycemic control in persons with T2D.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^d2c12d25]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO guideline update — Diabetes insulin therapy considerations during ICPi treatment note that insulin therapy should be used in any case with significant hyperglycemia pending additional diagnostic workup if mechanism of diabetes mellitus is not known, and long-acting insulin therapy alone is not sufficient for CIADM. Starting total daily requirement can be estimated at 0.3–0.4 units/kg/d, with half of daily requirements given as prandial coverage and half administered as a once-daily long-acting agent, requiring self-monitoring 4 or more times daily or the use of a continuous glucose monitor. Sliding scale insulin can be used with multiple daily injection regimens; decreased requirements after the initial acute admission for DKA are commonly seen in the so-called honeymoon period. Education is critical, early endocrinology consultation is a high priority for all patients, and steroids can exacerbate postprandial hyperglycemia so endocrinology consult should be considered for initiating or managing insulin in patients with T2DM being started on high-dose steroids, with insulin doses generally needing adjustment as steroids are tapered down.

b. Insulin

i. Subcutaneous insulin therapy.

Subcutaneous insulin therapy may be used to attain glucose control in most hospitalized patients with diabetes outside of the critical care arena. The components of the daily insulin dose requirement can be met by a variety of insulins, depending on the particular hospital situation. Subcutaneous insulin therapy should cover both basal and nutritional needs and is subdivided into scheduled insulin and supplemental, or correction-dose, insulin. Correction-dose insulin therapy is an important adjunct to scheduled insulin, both as a dose-finding strategy and as a supplement when rapid changes in insulin requirements lead to hyperglycemia. If correction doses are frequently required, the appropriate scheduled insulin doses should be increased to accommodate the increased insulin needs. There are currently no published studies comparing human regular insulin with rapid-acting analogs for use as correction-dose insulin.

The traditional "sliding-scale" insulin regimens, usually consisting of regular insulin without any intermediate or long-acting insulins, have been shown to be ineffective when used as monotherapy in patients with an established insulin requirement. Problems with sliding-scale insulin regimens include the fact that the sliding-scale regimen prescribed on admission is likely to be used throughout the hospital stay without modification, even when control remains poor. Additionally, sliding-scale insulin therapy treats hyperglycemia after it has already occurred, instead of preventing the occurrence of hyperglycemia. This "reactive" approach can lead to rapid changes in blood glucose levels, which may exacerbate both hyper- and hypoglycemia.

A recent study demonstrated the safety and efficacy of using basal-bolus insulin therapy utilizing weight-based dosing in insulin-naïve hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes. Glycemic control, defined as a mean blood glucose < 140 mg/dl, was achieved in 68% of patients receiving basal-bolus insulin versus only 38% of those receiving sliding-scale insulin alone. There were no differences in hypoglycemia between the two groups. It is important to note that the patients in this study were obese, and the doses used in this study (0.4 to 0.5 units · kg · day − 1) are higher than what may be required in patients who are more sensitive to insulin, such as those who are lean or who have type 1 diabetes.

a. Intravenous insulin infusions.

In the critical care setting, continuous intravenous insulin infusion has been shown to be the most effective method for achieving specific glycemic targets. Because of the very short half-life of circulating insulin, intravenous delivery allows rapid dosing adjustments to address alterations in patients' status.

Intravenous insulin is ideally administered via validated written or computerized protocols that allow for predefined adjustments to the insulin infusion rate according to glycemic fluctuations and insulin dose. An extensive review of the merits and deficiencies of published protocols is beyond the intent of this statement, and the reader is referred to several available reports and reviews. Continued education of staff with periodic ongoing review of patient data are critical for successful implementation of any insulin protocol.

Patients who receive intravenous insulin infusion will usually require transition to subcutaneous insulin when they begin eating regular meals or are transferred to lower intensity care. Typically, a percentage (usually 75–80%) of the total daily intravenous infusion dose is proportionately divided into basal and prandial components (see below). Importantly, subcutaneous insulin must be given 1–4 h prior to discontinuation of intravenous insulin to prevent hyperglycemia.

b. Subcutaneous insulin.

Scheduled subcutaneous insulin is the preferred method for achieving and maintaining glucose control in non-ICU patients with diabetes or stress hyperglycemia. The recommended components of inpatient subcutaneous insulin regimens include a basal, nutritional, and supplemental (correction) component. Each component can be met by one of several available insulin products, depending on the particular hospital situation. The reader is referred to several recent publications and reviews that describe currently available insulin preparations and protocols.

A topic that deserves particular attention is the persistent overuse of what has been branded as sliding scale insulin (SSI) for management of hyperglycemia. The term "correction insulin", which refers to the use of additional short or rapid-acting insulin with scheduled insulin doses to treat blood glucose above desired targets, is preferred. Prolonged therapy with SSI as the sole regimen is ineffective in the majority of patients (and potentially dangerous in type 1 diabetes).

### Is incretin-based therapy ready for the care of hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes? insulin therapy has proven itself and is considered the mainstay of treatment [^9fe263c0]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Hyperglycemia is reported in one-third of general medicine and surgery patients with and without a known history of diabetes. The prevalence is even higher in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and following cardiac surgery, occurring in up to 80% of patients. While previously thought to be an epiphenomenon related to the acute underlying illness of the hospitalization itself, hyperglycemia is now recognized as a contributor to adverse outcomes in critical and noncritically ill patients, with higher mortality and disease-specific morbidity.

Protocols using insulin to maintain glycemia within a reasonable range reduces both mortality and morbidity. In critically ill patients in ICU settings, intravenously (IV) administered insulin is the preferred method of achieving recommended glycemic targets. The short half-life of IV insulin permits rapid dosing adjustments in response to alterations in insulin sensitivity observed during critical illness. For the majority of ICU patients, insulin infusion is started at a threshold of no higher than 10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL). Once IV insulin is started, glucose levels should be maintained between 6.1 and 10.0 mmol/L (110 and 180 mg/dL). For patients in non-ICU settings, recent guidelines recommend the use of subcutaneous (SC) insulin as the preferred therapy. Scheduled basal-bolus SC insulin therapy consisting of long- or intermediate-acting preparations in combination with short- or rapid-acting analogs has been proven to be safe and effective for glycemic management and to reduce hospital complications including wound infections, pneumonia, bacteremia, and acute renal and respiratory failure when compared with the use of sliding-scale insulin alone in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Improved glycemic control with insulin therapy is associated with amelioration of the hormonal and proinflammatory aberrations associated with stress hyperglycemia. These include reductions in counterregulatory hormones and proinflammatory transcription factors, and potentially the formation of reactive oxygen species. Insulin therapy induces vasodilatation by stimulating nitric oxide release and inducing expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Insulin-mediated inhibition of lipolysis reduces circulating free fatty acid levels with improved insulin sensitivity, while inhibition of platelet aggregation reduces thrombosis. The major concern raised with the use of insulin therapy in the hospital is hypoglycemia, which has been observed primarily in studies targeting near normal glucose ranges of 80–110 mg/dL. This concern has prompted a search for alternative methods of inpatient glycemic management that are not known to cause hypoglycemia.

'Sliding scale' insulin

Sliding scale insulin regimes involve s.c. administration of soluble insulin when hyperglycaemia is detected. As this regimen is reactive to elevated blood sugars, 'sliding scale' insulin does not provide good glycaemic control. When compared with basal-bolus regimes, it is associated with higher mean blood glucose concentrations and a higher incidence of hyperglycaemic events. There is some evidence that it associated with greater morbidity. Consequently, 'sliding scale' insulin for perioperative glycaemic control is increasingly discouraged.

Correction doses

The concept of correction doses is to provide a 'one-off' dose of a fast-acting insulin to correct a single incidence of elevated blood sugar, in a patient on background treatment. For adult patients, UK guidance suggests giving a dose of 2–6 units of s.c. rapid-acting, analogue insulin for blood glucose concentrations > 12 mM with no evidence of DKA or hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS). This is for people with T1DM, where 1 unit will generally reduce the CBG by 3 mM. Wherever possible, people with T1DM should be asked what their own correction factor is. People with T2DM should be asked what they normally do, but if this is unknown or for those who are not previously treated with insulin, they should be given 0.1 units kg −1.

Repeated administration of correction doses would be akin to the sliding scale insulin regimen and therefore cannot be advocated. If an individual requires more than two correction doses, they should be reviewed by the medical team, and the need for an increase in the pumped or basal insulin dose considered.

Basal-only insulin regimen for inpatient glycaemic control

Basal-only regimes for inpatient glycaemic control are essentially a form of modification of the dose of the patient's normal long-acting insulin. Administration of ∼75–80% of the patient's usual insulin glargine dose the night before surgery is associated with optimal glycaemic control and minimal risk of hypoglycaemia. Basal insulin also controls hepatic and adipose tissue metabolism in the fasted state.

There is some evidence that using long-acting insulins with an extra-long duration of action may have lower within-day variability and reduced rates of hypoglycaemia.

### Glycemic control in hospitalized patients not in intensive care: beyond sliding-scale insulin [^5f436b63]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Glycemic control in hospitalized patients who are not in intensive care remains unsatisfactory. Despite persistent expert recommendations urging its abandonment, the use of sliding-scale insulin remains pervasive in U.S. hospitals. Evidence for the effectiveness of sliding-scale insulin is lacking after more than 40 years of use. New physiologic subcutaneous insulin protocols use basal, nutritional, and correctional insulin. The initial total daily dose of subcutaneous insulin is calculated using a factor of 0.3 to 0.6 units per kg body weight, with one half given as long-acting insulin (the basal insulin dose), and the other one half divided daily over three meals as short-acting insulin doses (nutritional insulin doses). A correctional insulin dose provides a final insulin adjustment based on the preprandial glucose value. This correctional dose resembles a sliding scale, but is only a small fine-tuning of therapy, as opposed to traditional sliding-scale insulin alone. Insulin sensitivity, nutritional intake, and total daily dosing review can alter the physiologic insulin-dosing schedule. Prospective trials have demonstrated reductions in hyperglycemic measurements, hypoglycemia, and adjusted hospital length of stay when physiologic subcutaneous insulin protocols are used. Transitions in care require special considerations and attention to glycemic control medications. Changing the sliding-scale insulin culture requires a multidisciplinary effort to improve patient safety and outcomes.

Recommendations

All patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital should have their diabetes clearly identified in the medical record. (E)
All patients with diabetes should have an order for blood glucose monitoring, with results available to all members of the health care team. (E)
Goals for blood glucose levels: Critically ill surgical patients' blood glucose levels should be kept as close to 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) as possible and generally < 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l). (A) These patients require an intravenous insulin protocol that has demonstrated efficacy and safety in achieving the desired glucose range without increasing risk for severe hypoglycemia. (E) Critically ill nonsurgical patients' glycemic targets are less well defined. Intravenous insulin infusion protocols targeting blood glucose levels < 110–140 mg/dl have been shown to reduced morbidity and mortality in some, but not all studies. Intravenous insulin infusion protocols that effectively and safely keep blood glucose < 140 mg/dl are recommended. (C) For non–critically ill patients, there is no clear evidence for specific blood glucose goals. Since cohort data suggest that outcomes are better in hospitalized patients with fasting glucose < 126 mg/dl and all random glucoses < 180–200, these goals are reasonable if they can be safely achieved. Insulin is the preferred drug to treat hyperglycemia in most cases. (E) Due to concerns regarding the risk of hypoglycemia, some institutions may consider these blood glucose levels to be overly aggressive for initial targets. Through quality improvement, glycemic goals should systematically be reduced to the recommended levels. (E)
Scheduled prandial insulin doses should be appropriately timed in relation to meals and should be adjusted according to point-of-care glucose levels. The traditional sliding-scale insulin regimens are ineffective as monotherapy and are generally not recommended. (C)
Using correction dose or "supplemental" insulin to correct premeal hyperglycemia in addition to scheduled prandial and basal insulin is recommended. (E)
Glucose monitoring with orders for correction insulin should be initiated in any patient not known to be diabetic who receives therapy associated with high risk for hyperglycemia, including high-dose glucocorticoids therapy, initiation of enteral or parenteral nutrition, or other medications such as octreotide or immunosuppressive medications. (B) If hyperglycemia is documented and persistent, initiation of basal/bolus insulin therapy may be necessary. Such patients should be treated to the same glycemic goals as patients with known diabetes. (E)
A plan for treating hypoglycemia should be established for each patient. Episodes of hypoglycemia in the hospital should be tracked. (E)
All patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital should have an A1C obtained if the result of testing in the previous 2–3 months is not available. (E)
A diabetes education plan including "survival skills education" and follow-up should be developed for each patient. (E)
Patients with hyperglycemia in the hospital who do not have a diagnosis of diabetes should have appropriate plans for follow-up testing and care documented at discharge. (E)

### Glycemic control in hospitalized patients not in intensive care… [^7633d0af]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

15 Patients treated with sliding-scale insulin alone had blood glucose levels greater than 300 mg per dL three times more often than patients treated with other glucose-lowering therapies. Most patients treated with sliding-scale insulin in this study never had their regimens adjusted, despite poor glycemic control. The authors concluded that although sliding-scale insulin regimens were prescribed for the majority of general medical inpatients with diabetes, they appeared to provide no benefit and, when used without a standing dose of long- or intermediate-acting insulin, were associated with an increased rate of hyperglycemic episodes.
15. Traditional sliding-scale insulin regimens measure blood glucose taken preprandially and at bedtime if the patient is eating, or on a schedule of every six hours if the patient is taking nothing by mouth. The amount of regular insulin given is based on the fingerstick glucose level.

Sliding-scale insulin does not take into account basal insulin needs, diet, and personal characteristics or insulin history. Sliding-scale insulin is a reactive approach to glucose elevation control. It is not a proactive strategy to prevent hyperglycemic states. 16, 17 Using sliding-scale insulin is playing catch-up with the glucose reading, and it usually does not treat sufficiently or aggressively enough to maintain glucose levels in a normal range. In most sliding-scale insulin regimens, the physician is only notified of extremes of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Using sliding-scale insulin creates the possibility of insulin stacking, with the pharmacokinetics of regular insulin given every six hours.

13 The sliding-scale insulin regimen has no way to anticipate nutritional status or illness-related changes in glucose levels, further leading to insulin inadequacies. These flaws in traditional sliding-scale insulin put patients on a roller coaster of fluctuations in blood glucose, which could be harmful. 13, 14 Variations in blood glucose and insulin levels create oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and increased markers of inflammation, which can contribute to poor patient outcomes.
5. Although nurses find the traditional sliding-scale insulin regimen easy to use, the entire care team must prioritize the necessity for optimal glycemic control. The time has come to challenge clinical inertia and no longer accept the poor outcomes of this regimen. 12.

2022 American diabetes association updates

In 2023, the American Diabetes Association updated its standards of care to align with the Endocrine Society's recommendations, adopting a glycemic target range of 100–180 mg/dL for non-critical hospitalized patients. This change reflects evolving evidence and a broader consensus on optimal glycemic management in this patient population.

Treatment of hospital hyperglycemia (Tables 2, 3, 4) (Fig. 2)

Summary of evidence

Sliding scale insulin

All studies comparing the sliding scale insulin (SSI) regimen with other regimens have shown the inferiority and ineffectiveness of the sliding scale in controlling hyperglycemia. Therefore, when hospitalized patients present with more than two blood glucose levels above 180 mg/dL in 24 h, any hyperglycemia above 250 mg/dL, or are already using insulin at home, an effective hyperglycemia treatment should be implemented. Using the sliding scale alone is contraindicated. There are no studies comparing the efficacy of different types of correction scales. Table 4 presents the authors' suggestion for a supplemental insulin correction table. The chosen scale should be standardized by the institution and adjusted to effectively lower blood glucose levels without causing hypercorrection.

Basal-plus insulin therapy

Umpierrez et al. conducted a multicenter randomized study with 375 patients divided into three groups: basal-bolus, basal combined with correction scale (referred to as basal-plus in the study), and SSI alone. The study included hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, using oral medications or insulin up to a dose of 0.4 IU/kg/day. The basal-bolus and basal-plus groups achieved similar results, with less hyperglycemia and lower average daily blood glucose levels than the SSI group, without an increase in severe hypoglycemia. However, both basal groups experienced an increase in mild hypoglycemia compared to the SSI group.
Pasquel et al. evaluated a group of 279 hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes, using oral medications or insulin up to a total dose of 0.6 IU/kg/day and blood glucose levels below 400 mg/dL, in a multicenter randomized study. They compared a group receiving basal insulin combined with sitagliptin to a group on basal-bolus insulin therapy. The outcomes were not inferior in terms of average daily blood glucose levels (171 ± 48.6 vs. 169.2 ± 48.6 mg/dL), hypoglycemia (9 vs. 12%), and treatment failure (16 vs. 19%) for the sitagliptin + basal group vs. the basal-bolus group, respectively.

### Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy: implications for obstetric anesthesia [^b1462217]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The amount of insulin given in response to hyperglycemia is based on the patient's insulin sensitivity. To simplify correction in the hospital, sliding-scale short-acting insulin is prescribed premeal (or at regular 4-h intervals for patients who are fasting) with predefined or protocolized sliding scales. So-called low-, medium-, high-, or very high-intensity sliding scales are typical of most hospitals, with insulin sensitivity often empirically judged based on a patient's response to a chosen sliding scale. However, insulin sensitivity can also be calculated as an "insulin sensitivity factor" for each patient based on their total daily dose of insulin. Table 5 includes an example of calculating insulin sensitivity in this fashion. Additional insulin should be administered if betamethasone or dexamethasone is given during admission to accelerate fetal lung maturity, as glucocorticosteroids (and also beta-agonists such as terbutaline) can exacerbate maternal hyperglycemia and precipitate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Among individuals with diabetes receiving betamethasone, glucose values are expected to rise at approximately 12 h after administration and peak 48 h after administration before returning to baseline levels approximately 1 week later. A recent RCT evaluating maternal glucose after betamethasone exposure showed that at least 80% of individuals without preexisting diabetes had evidence of hyperglycemia based on fasting or postprandial point-of-care testing. Interestingly, routine monitoring and treatment in this population do not change rates of neonatal hypoglycemia. Protocols have been proposed to guide empiric adjustment of subcutaneous insulin after betamethasone. Once active labor is achieved, transition to an IV insulin infusion is often made with guidance by preestablished hospital-specific protocols. Recent work demonstrates that the use of standard protocols improves maternal glucose control intrapartum (though such protocols may be associated with increases in neonatal hypoglycemia).

### The transition from insulin infusions to long-term diabetes therapy: the argument for insulin analogs [^9b7aed92]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

After cardiac surgery, it is medical mismanagement to place an order for sliding scale insulin at the time of transitioning from intravenous insulin. Use of basal-prandial-correction therapy with insulin analogs constitutes a suitable transitioning regimen for inpatient management of hyperglycemia after heart surgery, to be ordered before interruption of intravenous insulin infusion, in conjunction with a program of blood glucose monitoring before meals, at bedtime, and midsleep. In the ambulatory setting, in comparison to neutral protamine Hagedorn, long-acting insulin analogs reduce hypoglycemia. In comparison to regular insulin, rapid-acting insulin analogs reduce hypoglycemia and improve postprandial control. A standardized approach to order entry for basal-prandial-correction therapy enhances safety and staff familiarity while preserving individualization of patient care. Proposed predictors of successful transition are described. Dose requirements during intravenous insulin infusion can be used to guide initial dose assignments of basal insulin therapy. As the patient approaches discharge, the total daily doses of subcutaneous insulin and basal insulin dose are decreased, and the proportion of prandial insulin approaches or exceeds 50% of the total daily dose as the absolute amount of prandial insulin increases. Before discharge, hyperglycemic patients not known to have diabetes should be advised of the need for outpatient reassessment, and those known to have diabetes but requiring intensification of therapy should participate in decision-making concerning their options for intensified treatment.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^8e236907]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Inpatient diabetes management in older adults — during continuous enteral or parenteral nutrition, glycemic targets are between 140 and 180 mg/dL (7.7 to 10 mmol/L), and aiming at glycemia targets below this range is dangerous; point-of-care glucose monitoring is helpful only when it is performed frequently with knowledgeable review and adjustments, and most hospitalized patients with diabetes are treated with insulin. Moderate (41 to 70 mg/dL) and severe (< 40 mg/dL) hypoglycemia is common in hospitalized patients with diabetes, including older patients, and hypoglycemia increases length of hospital stay and mortality. In older patients with T2D in LTCFs, an RCT found similar hypoglycemia frequency between oral agents and basal insulin, suggesting a low daily basal insulin dose is sufficient to achieve reasonable and safe glycemia, and patients with T1D in institutional settings should never be left without insulin. In general surgery patients with T2D, a randomized multicenter trial comparing basal-bolus insulin with glargine once daily and glulisine before meals (n = 104) to sliding scale regular insulin four times daily (n = 107) showed basal-bolus insulin improved glycemic control and significantly reduced hospital complications.

### Inpatient glycemic control with sliding scale insulin in noncritical patients with type 2 diabetes: who can slide? [^71d4c17c]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Despite clinical guideline recommendations, sliding scale insulin (SSI) is widely used for the hospital management of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We aimed to determine which patients with T2D can be appropriately managed with SSI in non-critical care settings.

Methods

We used electronic health records to assess inpatient glycemic control in medicine and surgical patients treated with SSI according to admission blood glucose (BG) concentration between June 2010 and June 2018. Primary outcome was the percentage of patients with T2D achieving target glycemic control, defined as mean hospital BG 70 to 180 mg/dL without hypoglycemia < 70 mg/dL during SSI therapy.

Results

Among 25,813 adult patients with T2D, 8,095 patients (31.4%) were treated with SSI. Among patients with admission BG < 140 mg/dL and BG 140 to 180 mg/dL, 86% and 83%, respectively, achieved target control without hypoglycemia, as compared with only 18% of those with admission BG ≥ 250 mg/dL (P < .001). After adjusting for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), race, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, and setting, the odds of poor glycemic control increased with higher admission BG (BG 140–180 mg/dL: odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% CI, 1.5–2.2; BG 181–250 mg/dL: OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 3.1–4.4; BG > 250 mg/dL: OR, 7.2; 95% CI, 5.8–9.0), as compared with patients with BG < 140 mg/dL. A total of 1,192 patients (15%) treated with SSI required additional basal insulin during hospitalization.

Conclusion

Most non-intensive care unit patients with admission BG < 180 mg/dL treated with SSI alone achieve target glycemic control during hospitalization, suggesting that cautious use of SSI may be a viable option for certain patients with mild hyperglycemia.

### Glycemic control in medical inpatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving sliding scale insulin regimens versus routine diabetes medications: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^e52a76ec]. Annals of Family Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus traditionally receive insulin on a sliding-scale regimen, but the benefits of this approach are unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of the sliding scale insulin regimen with those of routine diabetes medications on hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and length of hospitalization in diabetic patients hospitalized for other conditions.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial conducted in family medicine inpatient services. One hundred fifty-three patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus hospitalized for other conditions were randomized to receive routine diabetes medications (control) or the combination of a standard sliding-scale insulin regimen and routine diabetes medications (intervention). The outcome measures included frequency of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia (glycemic events), and length of hospitalization.

Results

No differences were identified between treatment groups in the frequency of glycemic events. In the intervention group, 33.3% of patients developed hyperglycemia compared to 34.6% in the control group (P = 0.87). Six patients developed hypoglycemia in the intervention group, compared with 7 in the control group (P = 0.83). There was no difference in length of hospitalization (P = 0.86). Regardless of treatment assignment, patients receiving intermediate-acting insulin (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.2–6.5), those with blood glucose values greater than 250 mg/dL at baseline (OR, 6.3; 95% CI, 2.3–17.2) and those receiving corticosteroids (OR, 9.1; 95% CI, 3.1–27.0) were more likely to have glycemic events.

Conclusions

The use of the sliding scale insulin regimen in combination with routine diabetes medications does not affect the rate of hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia or length of hospitalization in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus hospitalized for other conditions.

Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

16. A basal plus bolus correction insulin regimen (a strategy using multiple doses of long- and short-acting insulins) is a reasonable option for correcting hyperglycemia in hospitalized, non-critically ill diabetic patients. [IIa, B] The use of sliding-scale insulin in the inpatient hospital setting is discouraged. [III, C]

Summary of evidence

Hyperglycemia in in-hospital patients with diabetes is very common. Retrospective and randomized controlled trials in surgical populations have reported that hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with increased length of stay, hospital complications, resource utilization, and mortality.
A randomized controlled trial showed that basal-bolus treatment (glargine and glulisine) improved glycemic control and reduced hospital complications (wound infection, pneumonia, acute renal failure, and bacteremia) compared with sliding-scale insulin (glulisine) in general surgery patients with type 2 diabetes.
Some RCTs were performed in type 2 diabetic patients hospitalized for nonsurgical conditions. In this population, basal–bolus treatment (glargine and glulisine or NPH and regular) also improved glycemic control compared with sliding-scale insulin.

Outpatient treatment: monotherapy

17. In patients with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes, metformin plus non-pharmacological therapy including physical activity and targeted nutrition therapy for weight control is recommended as first-line therapy. [I, A]

Summary of evidence

Metformin has a favorable efficacy and safety profile, with important metabolic effects and cardiovascular benefits. Due to its effect in reducing cardiovascular events and mortality, its efficacy in blood glucose reduction with low incidence of hypoglycemia, low cost, tolerable adverse effects, and no association with weight gain, it is the current first-line agent of choice for treatment of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. Titration or addition of further hypoglycemic drugs should be implemented as soon as possible to avoid inertia in achieving glucose targets.

### Hospital management of hyperglycemia in the context of COVID-19: evidence-based clinical considerations [^ffaa2cda]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic strategies in hospitalized patients with T2D or no previous diabetes

Insulin is the first-choice treatment for glycemic control given its efficacy and the possibility of quick titration. An intensive regimen with subcutaneous basal and prandial insulin is the best treatment for non-critically ill hospitalized patients. The initial total daily dose of insulin recommended to avoid both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia is 0.4–0.6 IU/kg of body weight, but may be lower, at 0.2 UI–0.3 IU/Kg of body weight, in patients aged over 70 years old or with an estimated creatinine clearance below 60 mL/min. The total daily dose of insulin should be distributed as 50% of basal insulin and 50% of short-or-rapid insulin equally divided before each of the three main meals. Notably, insulin requirement varies from person to person and patients taking GCs may require higher doses in the range of 1.2 to 1.5 IU/kg daily.

Basal insulin only or basal plus bolus regimens are preferred in noncritically ill hospitalized patients with poor oral intake. Even if the patient is fasting, the basal insulin should not be withheld. A comprehensive table for prandial insulin dose adjustment according to BG can be found elsewhere. Of note, sliding-scale insulin as the only regimen is not recommended as it is a reactive method that provides insulin only after hyperglycemia.

Therapeutic strategies in hospitalized patients with T1D

All T1D patients should be treated with insulin. For those who had been receiving mixed insulin at home, changing to a basal bolus regimen is recommended as it reduces hypoglycemia risk. Decreasing the usual at home rapid insulin dose by 20–30%, especially in those who have decreased appetite, decreases the risk of hypoglycemia. For insulin naïve patients, the initial total daily dose of insulin should be between 0.3 and 0.6 IU/kg, depending on hyperglycemia severity. The total daily dose of insulin should be distributed as 50% of basal insulin and 50% of short-or-rapid insulin equally divided before each of the three main meals.

More intensive BG monitoring and supportive therapy to reduce the risk of metabolic decompensation leading to events such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hypoglycemia is required. Additionally, blood or urinary ketones should be checked if hyperglycemia or fever develop.

### Pathways to quality inpatient management of hyperglycemia and diabetes: a call to action [^5d5ca5ee]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Sliding scale versus nutritional/correctional scheduled insulin administration

To the great chagrin of the majority of diabetologists, the use of sliding scale insulin administration persists, even at the most prestigious teaching hospitals. This reflexive behavior of ordering sliding scale may be harmful, comparing unfavorably to the more physiological scheduled insulin therapy. Several obstacles appear to exist in this seemingly perpetual and frustrating fight. The first is a lack of agreement on and understanding of what the term sliding scale actually means. Depending on the amount of food (or carbohydrates) to be consumed and the level of premeal glycemia, both components of scheduled bolus insulin, nutritional and correctional, may differ from one injection to another. This may create the deceptive appearance of a sliding scale regimen in the eyes of nonspecialists. It is our task to clearly articulate the differences between sliding scale insulin and scheduled insulin doses that include both nutritional and correctional (supplemental) insulin for our colleagues and the next generation of clinicians.

A significant challenge preventing the elimination of the sliding scale is the lack of clinical evidence for the superiority of basal-prandial correction therapy to the sliding scale approach during shorter hospital stays. The paucity of trials examining the potential impact of glycemic control during shorter stays raises reasonable questions about the appropriate approach in this setting. However, it may not be ethical to test sliding scale insulin therapy without scheduled insulin in type 1 diabetes.

An effective solution to the use of sliding scale insulin is the development and implementation of policies, protocols, and order sets for scheduled insulin administration in various clinical situations, as was demonstrated by the RABBIT (RAndomized Study of Basal-Bolus Insulin Therapy) studies. Unfortunately, these are not available in many hospital systems: institutional acceptance of protocols and order sets is far from universal. This leaves these key clinical decisions in the hands of practitioners, who may be reluctant to seek advice from a consultant but are unwilling or lack the expertise to implement proactive insulin strategies themselves.

Suggested future directions.

Additional well-designed comparative effectiveness RCTs, similar to the RABBIT studies, examining the effect of scheduled insulin (basal/nutritional/correctional) to sliding scale insulin (basal + correctional without nutritional insulin) on intermediary glycemic, clinical, and economic outcomes are needed to provide the evidence base for promoting changes in prescribing practices. In addition, health services studies are needed to evaluate the impact of systems interventions, such as implementation of policies, protocols, and order sets promoting scheduled insulin and provider education, on changing prescribing behavior.

### Efficacy and safety of intensive versus nonintensive supplemental insulin with a basal-bolus insulin regimen in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical study [^08d9b7c5]. Diabetes Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Administration of supplemental sliding scale insulin for correction of hyperglycemia in non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients with type 2 diabetes is frequently used with basal-bolus insulin regimens. In this noninferiority randomized controlled trial we tested whether glycemic control is similar with and without aggressive sliding scale insulin treatment before meals and bedtime in patients treated with basal-bolus insulin regimens.

Research Design and Methods

Patients with type 2 diabetes with admission blood glucose (BG) 140–400 mg/dL treated with basal-bolus insulin were randomized to intensive (correction for BG > 140 mg/dL, n = 108) or to nonintensive (correction for BG > 260 mg/dL, n = 107) administration of rapid-acting sliding scale insulin before meals and bedtime. The groups received the same amount of sliding scale insulin for BG > 260 mg/dL. Primary outcome was difference in mean daily BG levels between the groups during hospitalization.

Results

Mean daily BG in the nonintensive group was noninferior to BG in the intensive group with equivalence margin of 18 mg/dL (intensive 172 ± 38 mg/dL vs. nonintensive 173 ± 43 mg/dL, P = 0.001 for noninferiority). There were no differences in the proportion of target BG readings of 70–180 mg/dL, < 70 or < 54 mg/dL (hypoglycemia), or > 350 mg/dL (severe hyperglycemia) or total, basal, or prandial insulin doses. Significantly fewer subjects received sliding scale insulin in the nonintensive (n = 36 [34%]) compared with the intensive (n = 98 [91%] [P < 0.0001]) group with no differences in sliding scale insulin doses between the groups among those who received sliding scale insulin (intensive 7 ± 4 units/day vs. nonintensive 8 ± 4 units/day, P = 0.34).

Conclusions

Among non-ICU patients with type 2 diabetes on optimal basal-bolus insulin regimen with moderate hyperglycemia (BG < 260 mg/dL), a less intensive sliding scale insulin treatment did not significantly affect glycemic control.

### 70 / 30 insulin algorithm versus sliding scale insulin [^00cde25d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The medical literature supports the fact that sliding scale dosing of insulin is an ineffective means to control blood glucose concentrations. Despite this, many clinicians still use sliding scale insulin (SSI) regimens. A better tool for controlling hyperglycemia is clearly needed.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of an algorithm using 70/30 insulin with traditional SSI dosing for glycemic control in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

A prospective, cohort, comparative trial was conducted at a 644-bed, 2-hospital, regional referral health system. Patients were screened for enrollment based on orders received in the pharmacy for sliding scale dosing of insulin. Patients were treated either following an algorithm using 70/30 insulin twice daily or traditional SSI dosing as written by the prescribing physician.

Results

Twenty patients with type 2 diabetes were involved in this pilot trial: 10 were treated with the 70/30 insulin algorithm and 10 received a physician-determined traditional SSI regimen. Patients treated based on the 70/30 insulin algorithm achieved better glycemic control (p = 0.042). No difference between the groups was detected in the average number of insulin units administered, insulin injections, or days patients spent on their respective insulin regimens.

Conclusions

Glycemic control with the 70/30 insulin algorithm was superior to traditional SSI dosing.

Treatment for Non-critically Ill Patients

Insulin is the preferred treatment for glycemic control in critically ill patients. For non-critically ill patients with good nutritional intake basal, meal-related, and correction insulin dose are preferred. Subcutaneous rapid- or short-acting insulin before meals or every 4–6 h may be used in patients not on regular meals or in patients receiving continuous enteral/parenteral nutrition to correct hyperglycemia. For non-critically ill patients with poor oral intake or those who are taking nothing by mouth (NPO), basal insulin or a basal plus bolus correction insulin regimen is preferred. Basal-bolus is preferred over sliding scale insulin (SSI) owing to improved glycemic control and reduced hospital complications. Premixed insulin is preferred in the outpatient setting and basal-bolus therapy in the inpatient setting.

Recommendations

Consider using basal plus bolus correction insulin regimen, with the addition of meal-related insulin in patients who have good nutritional intake, in non-critically ill patients (Grade A, EL I)
Avoid sliding scale insulin in the inpatient hospital setting (Grade A, EL I)

Treatment for Critically Ill Patients

In the critically ill patients, continuous IV insulin is preferred. When the patient is able to take regular meals, basal and correction insulin doses are administered. When transitioning T1DM or T2DM patients to outpatient, SC insulin, SC basal insulin should be started 2–4 h before the IV insulin is discontinued.

Surgery

Perioperative Management

Perioperative management of blood glucose levels is based on the following objectives: (1) reduction in morbidity and mortality, (2) prevention of severe hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, (3) maintenance of physiological electrolyte and fluid balance, (4) prevention of ketoacidosis, and (5) achieving the target glycemic levels less than 10 mmol/L in critical patients and less than 7.7 mmol/L in stable patients. Long-acting insulin (insulin glargine) should be discontinued 2–3 days prior to surgery and combination of intermediate-acting insulin (NPH) with short- or rapid-acting insulin twice daily or Regular insulin before meals and intermediate-acting insulin at bedtime used for glycemic control. Figure 6 shows the perioperative management in T1DM and T2DM patients.

### Comparison of weight-based insulin titration (WIT) and glucose-based insulin titration using basal-bolus algorithm in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes: a multicenter, randomized, clinical study [^b95e0c94]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Inpatient hyperglycemia is associated with adverse patient outcomes. Scheduled subcutaneous administration of insulin is the preferred method for achieving and maintaining glucose control in non-critically ill patients with diabetes or stress hyperglycemia. Basal-bolus insulin (BBI) protocol is recommended by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and American Diabetes Association (ADA). The traditional sliding scale insulin (SSI) is found to be ineffective and is discouraged. However, SSI continues to be a common practice, even in the most prestigious teaching hospitals, owing to its convenience and simplicity.BBI requires basal, bolus and correction insulin. The inconvenience and complexity of this approach has limited its acceptance among physicians. Thus, we tried to seek an alternative.

Except for the insulin titration algorithm based on glycemic level, there is another group of titration protocols based on the percentage of current insulin dose. Although the former is widely used, the latter is also used for long-acting, premixedand short-acting insulin. Interestingly, these two groups of algorithms are conflicting. The former leads to a decrease in the titration dose, while the latter leads to an increase. Given that both are acceptable, it is hypothesized that a fixed-dose titration algorithm is reasonable.

In many clinical trials involving inpatients, insulin initiation was usually expressed as unit/kg (body weight), as recommended by ADA. Also, at the end of these studies, the insulin dose was also expressed as unit/kg, which included long-acting insulin detemir and glargine, premixed human insulin 30/70and short-acting human insulin, aspart, lispro and glulisine. Then, why is insulin not titrated as unit/kg, that is, based on weight?

Previously, we have designed a weight-based titration algorithm for long-acting insulin (glargine or determir, 0.1 unit/kg/day), which is simple and effective as the glucose-based algorithm. Since basal-to-bolus insulin secretion was about 1:1 in normal persons, and in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we presumed that bolus insulin could also be titrated based on the body weight. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of a weight-based insulin titration algorithm in hospitalized patients with T2DM.

What of patients outside critical care units? Hyperglycemia is associated with increase in mortality, and this is particularly so for those with new-onset hyperglycemia rather than for patients with established diabetes. During exacerbation of chronic obstructive lung disease, a stepwise increase in adverse outcome has been seen at glucose levels of < 108, 108–124, 125–160, and > 160 mg/dl. We need, then, to "identify reasonable, achievable, and safe glucose targets". A reasonable recommendation is that of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American Diabetes Association consensus statement on inpatient glycemic control, aiming for levels of 140–180 mg/dl in general and 110–140 mg/dl in cardiothoracic intensive care unit patients, with 100–140 mg/dl premeal and other levels < 180 mg/dl. Hospital hyperglycemia is currently being defined as any glucose > 140, with stress hyperglycemia refering to elevated glucose in patients without prior history of diabetes, for which one may use A1C < 6.5% in screening (with appropriate cautions as to factors affecting A1C). Hypoglycemia is defined as < 70 mg/dl and severe hypoglycemia < 40 mg/dl. "How", Korytkowski asked, "do we get there safely?" In non–critically ill patients, insulin is preferred as scheduled basal-bolus therapy with correctional components rather than treatment with sliding-scale insulin. Insulin is preferred because sulfonylureas cause hypoglycemia, particularly with variable meals, metformin is often contraindicated, thiazolidinediones cause edema and heart failure and require weeks to months for onset of glycemic action, α-glucosidase inhibitors are relatively weak, and pramlintide and glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists can cause nausea and exert greater postprandial effect. An approach is to institute treatment with a total daily dose of 0.2–0.4 units/kg body wt, with 50–60% as basal insulin, using correction insulin for glucose levels above goal and adjusting according to results of bedside glucose monitoring. Such regimens lead to better mean glycemia without increase in hypoglycemia compared with sliding scale–only treatment approaches, and the use of insulin analogs leads to less hypoglycemia than do human and NPH insulin.

### Guidelines abstracted from the American Geriatrics Society guidelines for improving the care of older adults with diabetes mellitus: 2013 update [^9d78ab76]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) in older adults — antihyperglycemic medications: If an older adult is prescribed an oral antidiabetic agent, metformin, unless contraindicated, is the preferred first-line agent in combination with lifestyle therapy (IA). After the use of metformin, glucose-lowering medication therapy should be individualized, sulfonylureas have been associated with greater risk of hypoglycemia and the risk increases with age, glyburide should generally not be prescribed to older adults with type 2 DM because of the high risk of hypoglycemia, and chlorpropamide should be avoided; expert opinion supports the safety of insulin use with DM education, careful monitoring, and ongoing cognitive assessment and suggests the elimination of insulin sliding scale in nursing homes. Despite concern about lactic acidosis with metformin, recent data suggest that the risk is low.

### Defining the role of basal and prandial insulin for optimal glycemic control [^b31dd19e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a progressive disease characterized by early impairment of beta-cell function and ultimately loss of beta-cell mass. Hence, a single daily injection of a long-acting insulin is commonly initiated after intensification of oral antihyperglycemic therapy. Hemoglobin A1C should be measured every 3 months and therapy adjusted if the target is not met. As beta-cell function continues to decline, it is often necessary to add exogenous bolus insulin therapy, using short-acting insulin analogs or regular insulin. Alternatively, the use of pre-mixed insulin preparations, combining both long-acting and short-acting insulins, may be used.

### Executive summary: standards of medical care in diabetes – 2009 [^79962cbd]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Diabetes Care in the Hospital

All patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital should have their diabetes clearly identified in the medical record. (E)
All patients with diabetes should have an order for blood glucose monitoring, with results available to all members of the health care team. (E)
Goals for blood glucose levels: Critically ill surgical patients' blood glucose levels should be kept as close to 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) as possible and generally < 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l). (A) These patients require an intravenous insulin protocol that has demonstrated efficacy and safety in achieving the desired glucose range without increasing risk for severe hypoglycemia. (E) Critically ill nonsurgical patients' glycemic targets are less well defined. Intravenous insulin infusion protocols targeting blood glucose levels < 110–140 mg/dl have been shown to reduced morbidity and mortality in some but not all studies. Intravenous insulin infusion protocols that effectively and safely keep blood glucose < 140 mg/dl are recommended. (C) Non–critically ill patients: there is no clear evidence for specific blood glucose goals. Since cohort data suggest that outcomes are better in hospitalized patients with fasting glucose < 126 mg/dl and all random glucose levels < 180–200, these goals are reasonable if they can be safely achieved. Insulin is the preferred drug to treat hyperglycemia in most cases. (E) Due to concerns regarding the risk of hypoglycemia, some institutions may consider these blood glucose levels to be overly aggressive for initial targets. Through quality improvement, glycemic goals should systematically be reduced to the recommended levels. (E)
Scheduled prandial insulin doses should be appropriately timed in relation to meals and should be adjusted according to point-of-care glucose levels. The traditional sliding-scale insulin regimens are ineffective as monotherapy and are generally not recommended. (C)
Using correction dose or "supplemental" insulin to correct premeal hyperglycemia in addition to scheduled prandial and basal insulin is recommended. (E)
Glucose monitoring with orders for correction insulin should be initiated in any patient not known to be diabetic who receives therapy associated with high risk for hyperglycemia, including high-dose glucocorticoid therapy, initiation of enteral or parenteral nutrition, or other medications such as octreotide or immunosuppressive medications. (B) If hyperglycemia is documented and persistent, initiation of basal/bolus insulin therapy may be necessary. Such patients should be treated to the same glycemic goals as patients with known diabetes. (E)
A plan for treating hypoglycemia should be established for each patient. Episodes of hypoglycemia in the hospital should be tracked. (E)
All patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital should have an A1C obtained if the result of testing in the previous 2–3 months is not available. (E)
A diabetes education plan including "survival skills education" and follow-up should be developed for each patient. (E)
Patients with hyperglycemia in the hospital who do not have a diagnosis of diabetes should have appropriate plans for follow-up testing and care documented at discharge. (E)

### Eliminating inpatient sliding-scale insulin: a reeducation project with medical house staff [^5177a48e]. Diabetes Care (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

We studied a systematic program to reeducate our medical house officers on how to manage inpatient hyperglycemia without the use of sliding-scale insulin (SSI).

Research Design and Methods

Patients admitted to the general medical service with diabetes or a blood glucose > 140 mg/dl were included. HbA(1c) was measured in all patients, and therapy was modified if the HbA(1c) was > 7.0%. For each 24 h on call, two house officers were responsible for all glucose management for their team's patients and rounded with a teaching endocrinologist twice daily for 2 weeks. Oral agent or insulin therapy was modified using blood glucoses and HbA(1c). All patients who required insulin therapy were treated with basal and bolus insulin, usually NPH and regular, adjusted twice daily.

Results

During 8 weeks, 88 patients were identified and 16 house officers were instructed. The mean duration of diabetes was 10.4 years. Mean HbA(1c) level was 8.7%, and 48% of patients had HbA(1c) > 8%. All patients with HbA(1c) > 7% had diabetes therapy intensified. Overall 80% had their diabetes therapy changed by discharge. Compared with 98 historical control subjects, significantly fewer study patients had episodes of hyperglycemia, and a subgroup followed for 12 months showed a decrease in HbA(1c) from 10.1 to 8%.

Conclusions

Medical history, blood glucose, and HbA(1c) testing can effectively identify patients with inpatient hyperglycemia. Using direct ward-based teaching and a widely disseminated pocket set of guidelines, house officers can be taught to effectively and safely manage inpatient hyperglycemia without the use of SSI.

### Glucose control in hospitalized patients [^a9d88ffe]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Evidence indicates that hospitalized patients with hyperglycemia do not benefit from tight blood glucose control. Maintaining a blood glucose level of less than 180 mg per dL (9.99 mmol per L) will minimize symptoms of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia without adversely affecting patient-oriented health outcomes. In the absence of modifying factors, physicians should continue patients' at-home diabetes mellitus medications and randomly check glucose levels once daily. Sulfonylureas should be withheld to avoid hypoglycemia in patients with limited caloric intake. Patients with cardiovascular conditions may benefit from temporarily stopping treatment with thiazolidinediones to avoid precipitating heart failure. Metformin should be temporarily withheld in patients who have worsening renal function or who will undergo an imaging study that uses contrast. When patients need to be treated with insulin in the short term, using a long-acting basal insulin combined with a short-acting insulin before meals (with the goal of keeping blood glucose less than 180 mg per dL) better approximates normal physiology and uses fewer nursing resources than sliding-scale insulin approaches. Most studies have found that infusion with glucose, insulin, and potassium does not improve mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction should have moderate control of blood glucose using home regimens or basal insulin with correctional doses.

### Inpatient management of diabetic foot disorders: a clinical guide [^da248d1c]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Insulin is the preferred agent for reducing glucose levels in hospitalized patients. In patients with increased insulin resistance, such as those with sepsis, infection, or in the perioperative period, insulin needs are often greatly increased even in the presence of reduced or absent caloric intake. There is strong evidence that the use of sliding scale insulin regimens as monotherapy without basal insulin, is inappropriate and leads to poorer outcomes and increased hyperglycemia. Either basal/bolus insulin algorithms with supplemental or correction doses of intravenous insulin (i.e. sliding scale) may be required. In some cases the use of continuous, variable insulin infusions with appropriate algorithms are most appropriate, particularly with critically ill patients, those in the perioperative period, and in some patients with uncertain oral intake or very variable or large insulin requirements.

The normal outpatient insulin dosage often needs to be modified in patients while hospitalized. While in some cases the outpatient dosage may be reduced, patients with severe physical stress such as sepsis secondary to a foot infection, typically require increased insulin to achieve glycemic control. Factors which may alter dosing in hospital settings include factors that may reduce insulin dosage, such as reduced caloric intake, worsening renal failure, increased age, or marked weight loss. Factors that may increase insulin requirements include severe hyperglycemia and/or ketosis, infection, fever, severe pain, myocardial infarction, surgical procedure, or corticosteroid therapy.

For noncritically ill patients with type 2 DM, one guideline suggests as a dosing regimen for insulin therapy:

0.2–0.3 units/kg body weight for patients aged ≥ 70 years of age and/or an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min
0.4 units/kg body weight for patients not meeting the criteria above who have glucose levels 140–200 mg/dL
0.5 units/kg body weight for patients not meeting the criteria above when the glucose levels are 201–400 mg/dL

In each case, 50% of the insulin should be given as long-acting insulin as a basal dose and 50% as nutritional doses using short-acting insulin. Frequent reassessment is required throughout the hospitalization due to potential changes in clinical status as a result of cessation of food intake or worsening renal failure. It is important that there be a hospital-wide effort to provide education and training for the team responsible for the glycemic control of the patient, including a nurse-based hospital-wide program to initiate treatment of hypoglycemia and to prevent its occurrence.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American diabetes association consensus statement on inpatient glycemic control [^3ea6c983]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Subcutaneously administered insulin

Scheduled subcutaneous administration of insulin is the preferred method for achieving and maintaining glucose control in non-ICU patients with diabetes or stress hyperglycemia. The recommended components of inpatient subcutaneous insulin regimens are a basal, a nutritional, and a supplemental (correction) element. Each component can be met by one of several available insulin products, depending on the particular hospital situation. Readers are referred to severalrecentpublications and reviews that describe currently available insulin preparations and protocols.

A topic that deserves particular attention is the persistent overuse of what has been branded as sliding scale insulin (SSI) for management of hyperglycemia. The term "correction insulin", which refers to the use of additional short- or rapid-acting insulin in conjunction with scheduled insulin doses to treat BG levels above desired targets, is preferred. Prolonged therapy with SSI as the sole regimen is ineffective in the majority of patients (and potentially dangerous in those with type 1 diabetes).

Noninsulin agents

Noninsulin agents are inappropriate in most hospitalized patients. Continued use of such agents may be appropriate in selected stable patients who are expected to consume meals at regular intervals. Caution must be exercised with use of metformin because of the potential development of a contraindication during the hospitalization, such as renal insufficiency, unstable hemodynamic status, or need for imaging studies with radiocontrast dye. Injectable noninsulin therapies such as exenatide and pramlintide have limitations similar to those with orally administered agents in the hospital setting.

### Spectro-spatial features in distributed human intracranial activity proactively encode peripheral metabolic activity [^08e6fc82]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Predictive capabilities of blood glucose levels hours holds potential for augmenting current closed-loop insulin controllers for diabetes management, if our findings hold true for diabetic patients. One of the disadvantages of current implementation of closed-loop controllers (and sliding-scale insulin regimens used inpatient) is that they are reactive to currently measured glucose. Playing "catch-up" with boluses of fast-acting insulin is typically inferior to basal-bolus regimens which use a combination of long-acting basal insulin with correctional boluses of fast-acting insulin. However, optimal dosing of long-acting basal insulin takes weeks of close follow-up. This makes it difficult to achieve optimal glucose control in the outpatient setting and impractical in the inpatient setting. Being able to predict glucose proactively hours in advance, as demonstrated here, could potentially enable the use of long-acting basal insulin in closed-loop controllers to achieve tighter glucose control. Future studies in patients with diabetes mellitus will be needed to evaluate if similar findings observed here can be replicated when glucose homeostasis is already disturbed.

Expert panel recommendations — preparation of diabetic patients for 18F-FDG PET in cardiac sarcoidosis: The optimal preparation for diabetic patients has not been defined, and we currently recommend use of the above preparation whenever possible. Patients with type 1 diabetes should continue basal insulin, avoiding or minimizing rapid-acting insulin if safe to do so, and sliding-scale rapid-acting insulin may be necessary the day before the study but should be avoided the day of the study. Patients with type 2 diabetes should not take oral agents or noninsulin injections while fasting or on the morning of the test, and insulin should also be avoided or reduced as much as possible if safe to do so. In view of the limited data on preparing diabetic patients, the approach must currently be individualized.

### Common standards of basal insulin titration in type 2 diabetes [^dc6a867a]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2013). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus has become a worldwide major health problem, and the number of people affected is steadily increasing. Thus, not all patients suffering from the disease can be treated by specialized diabetes centers or outpatient clinics, but by primary care physicians. The latter, however, might have time constraints and have to deal with many kinds of diseases or with multimorbid patients, so their focus is not so much on lowering high blood glucose values. Thus, the physicians, as well as the patients themselves, are often reluctant to initiate and adjust insulin therapy, although basal insulin therapy is considered the appropriate strategy after oral antidiabetic drug failure, according to the latest international guidelines. A substantial number of clinical studies have shown that insulin initiation and optimization can be managed successfully by using titration algorithms-even in cases where patients themselves are the drivers of insulin titration. Nevertheless, tools and strategies are needed to facilitate this process in the daily life of both primary health care professionals and patients with diabetes.

### Basal insulin intensification in patients with type 2 diabetes: a review [^dd5fae4b]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Beyond Basal Insulin

When treatment is intensified beyond basal insulin therapy, a number of factors should be taken into account as part of the shared decision-making process, such as patient preference, safety, tolerability, glycemic efficacy, risk of hypoglycemia, and other non-glycemic effects (e.g. weight change and/or impact on life-style). Continued basal insulin therapy should, however, be considered an essential component of future treatment strategies. Initial discussions should also include issues around lifestyle (nutrition, weight loss, and physical activity) and the possible treatment of obesity, such as using the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Obesity Treatment Algorithm, which may include obesity pharmacotherapy. The effectiveness of lifestyle changes such as weight loss and exercise in decreasing the incidence and progression of T2D is well known. Although generally considered an initial strategy, it is important that lifestyle optimization is ongoing throughout the course of T2D. In a cohort study, almost half of overweight or obese patients with T2D who lost a mean of 4% of body weight were able to reduce their insulin dose; a mean reduction of 11% of initial body weight was required to discontinue insulin. Although exercise has undoubted benefits for patients with T2D, those using insulin or insulin secretagogues should be made aware of the amplified risk of hypoglycemia during and after exercise and should be advised on blood-glucose monitoring, reductions in insulin dose, and/or carbohydrate supplementation.

Efforts to improve lifestyle, however, should not delay changes in therapy; such changes can be done simultaneously and adjusted based on patient response to lifestyle efforts. Therapeutically, there are two main guideline-recommended options for escalating basal insulin therapy. The first is to add a prandial insulin to the treatment regimen, either by adding a RAI prior to the largest meal of the day, with addition at other meals in stages if required (basal-plus), adding RAI at all meals (basal-bolus), or by switching to a premixed (biphasic) insulin formulation of intermediate- and short-acting insulins. In general, RAIs are preferred over regular human insulin because of their more rapid onset and offset of action and association with a lower incidence of hypoglycemia, although regular insulin may represent a pragmatic choice where costs or lack of resources limit availability. The second option is to add a GLP-1 RA to the treatment regimen. Each treatment regimen has advantages and disadvantages (Table 1), and these should be taken into account when deciding on a strategy with the patient.

### Efficacy of a new protocol of premixed 70 / 30 human insulin in Haitian youth with diabetes [^8970c1c5]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

A sliding scale was provided to all patients according to their randomization and TDD. For patients in G70, the front side displayed insulin correction doses (ICD) for different BG ranges (see Table 1) and were used to adjust or determine the 70/30 insulin doses shown in Table 2 when applicable (meal skipped and BG measure missed, or mid-day BG, when performed, > 240 mg/dL). The other cases were based on a retrospective algorithm (planned dose). For patients in GNR, the front side of the sliding scale displayed the ICD (Table 1) and the pre-meal insulin R doses (ICD + MID) related to 60 g of CHO for different BG ranges. However, adjustment of the twice-daily doses of NPH insulin was based on a retrospective algorithm (planned dose). Additional instructions were provided on pre-meal insulin R dose adjustment for estimated CHO loads other than 60 g. The corresponding part (G70 or GNR) of Table 2 was positioned on the back of the sliding scales to determine insulin doses based on the presence of pre-meal BG tests and meals.

SMBG and insulin were routinely administered before morning and evening meals. The pre-meal glycemic target was 80–130 mg/dL. Any BG test not done in the morning or evening with or without a meal was considered missed. Any meal not taken among the three standard daily meals was considered skipped. Patients were encouraged to perform SMBG at the time of any skipped meal, before the next meal following BG < 80 mg/dL or if needed (symptoms of hypo- or hyperglycemia, or unexplained malaise).

### Perioperative management of diabetes [^e18f8d4b]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Maintaining glycemic and metabolic control is difficult in diabetic patients who are undergoing surgery. The preoperative evaluation of all patients with diabetes should include careful screening for asymptomatic cardiac or renal disease. Frequent self-monitoring of glucose levels is important in the week before surgery so that insulin regimens can be adjusted as needed. Oral agents and long-acting insulin are usually discontinued before surgery, although the newer long-acting insulin analog glargine may be appropriately administered for basal insulin coverage throughout the surgical period. The usual regimen of sliding scale subcutaneous insulin for perioperative glycemic control may be a less preferable method because it can have unreliable absorption and lead to erratic blood glucose levels. Intravenous insulin infusion offers advantages because of the more predictable absorption rates and ability to rapidly titrate insulin delivery up or down to maintain proper glycemic control. Insulin is typically infused at 1 to 2 U per hour and adjusted according to the results of frequent blood glucose checks. A separate infusion of dextrose prevents hypoglycemia. Potassium is usually added to the dextrose infusion at 10 to 20 mEq per L in patients with normal renal function and normal preoperative serum potassium levels. Frequent monitoring of electrolytes and acid-base status is important during the perioperative period, especially in patients with type 1 diabetes because ketoacidosis can develop at modest levels of hyperglycemia.

### The effort required to achieve and maintain optimal glycemic control [^fce4a7d3]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Insulin therapy is most effective when dosage is frequently adjusted. We sought to evaluate the effort required to maintain A1C below 7% once attained in older patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

A total of 2380 insulin dosage adjustment episodes were analyzed for their intensity and frequency. The data were divided into an "induction period" (n = 608), defined as the time before subjects' A1C dropped below 7% for the first time, and a "maintenance period" (n = 1772), defined as the remaining study period. The data originated from a published study and included 26 older subjects with suboptimally controlled type 2 diabetes treated for a year with intensive insulin therapy. To achieve therapy goals, the study team contacted the subjects once every few weeks, reviewed records and optimized the insulin dosage.

Results

During both the induction and maintenance periods, insulin dosage (both long-acting and fast-acting) was adjusted by more than 20%. Maintaining A1C below 7% required dosage adjustments every 2.7(± 1.0) weeks, averaging 11.4% (± 4.0) in 2.0 (± 0.3) different components of insulin dosage (i.e., two of either long-acting or short-acting for breakfast, lunch or dinner) per contact.

Conclusions

Considerable effort was required to maintain optimal A1C levels in older patients with type 2 diabetes. Since the full benefit of insulin therapy is attained only when multiple components of insulin dosage are frequently adjusted and given the growing shortage of care providers' availability, innovative approaches are needed to empower patients to safely make their own insulin adjustments.

### In-hospital management of hyperglycemia: the role of insulin degludec [^2db3dd4c]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Insulin remains the cornerstone of hyperglycemia management in hospitals, with basal–bolus regimens being the preferred approach. This regimen combines basal insulin, which provides continuous glucose control, with prandial (mealtime) and correction insulin to address postprandial spikes. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2025 guidelines recommend a basal insulin or basal plus bolus correction insulin regimen for noncritically ill hospitalized patients with poor oral intake or those with no oral consumption or oral intake restrictions. An insulin regimen with basal, prandial, and correction components is the preferred treatment for most noncritically ill hospitalized patients with adequate nutritional intake. Notably, the use of sliding scale insulin (SSI) without basal insulin is discouraged. Similarly, the Research Society for the Study of Diabetes in India (RSSDI) 2022 guidelines recommend using a basal–bolus regimen for patients undergoing surgery.

The preference for a basal–bolus regimen over SSI arises from the historical context, wherein SSI was once the standard practice but proved to be inadequate for stable glucose management. SSI has been associated with increased complications, such as infections and longer hospital stays. In contrast, basal–bolus regimens utilizing long-acting insulin provide more stable and proactive glucose management, thereby reducing glycemic variability and improving overall patient outcomes. Multiple RCTs have consistently shown that basal–bolus regimens outperform SSI in terms of glycemic control and reduction of hospital-related complications.

Long-acting insulins in a basal–bolus regimen play a vital role in managing hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients by maintaining consistent insulin levels throughout the day, particularly benefiting patients with irregular meal patterns typical in hospital settings. Studies indicate that combining long-acting basal insulin with rapid-acting mealtime insulin not only enhances glycemic control but also reduces complications during hospitalization. Clinical practice guidelines advocate the use of basal and prandial insulin regimens with insulin analogs for most noncritically ill hospitalized patients with diabetes who have adequate nutritional intake.

### Insulin matters: a practical approach to basal insulin management in type 2 diabetes [^3bd6a32b]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Several factors underlie the importance of the initiative put forth by this expert panel: there is a rising prevalence of diabetes; half of the T2D population is not at target, among which 61% were receiving insulin therapy, suggesting delayed insulin initiation and intensification; there are multiple titration algorithms to choose from which adds to the confusion and complexity for patients and providers; and the arrival of new long-acting basal insulins and other pharmacological and technological advances that require consideration. This document was developed by a multidisciplinary panel to address frequently asked questions on insulin initiation and titration, and it establishes simple and practical guidelines for diabetes HCPs for effective initiation and titration of basal insulin, with the intent that it may translate to effective glycemic outcomes in clinical practice.

### Prevalence of diabetes medication intensifications in older adults discharged from US veterans health administration hospitals [^5987cf40]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

In this national retrospective cohort study of older adults with diabetes who were hospitalized for common medical conditions, we found that intensified diabetes medications were prescribed at discharge for 1 in 10 patients, most of whom we estimated were unlikely to benefit from stricter glycemic control. Most intensifications were for insulins or sulfonylureas, classes with the highest risk of hypoglycemia, and intensifications commonly occurred in patients previously not taking diabetes medications. Elevated inpatient blood glucose recordings were associated with discharge with intensifications even in patients with previously well-controlled outpatient HbA 1c values. These findings indicate that half of older adults receiving diabetes medication intensifications at hospital discharge may be at high risk of overtreatment while 20% may have potential to benefit.

In the hospital setting, many factors may cause blood glucose levels to fluctuate. Patients may experience physiologic stress hyperglycemia related to acute illness, be given medications that raise blood glucose levels (eg, corticosteroids or intravenous solutions containing dextrose), and have different dietary patterns than they would at home. Both acute kidney injury and inability to take pills by mouth are common in hospitalized older adults and may lead inpatient clinicians to withhold outpatient diabetes medications. For this reason, temporary inpatient sliding scale insulin protocols have become common despite risks of hypoglycemia. Our finding that nearly half of intensifications were for new insulin, primarily short-acting insulins, may represent high-risk carryover of inpatient regimens to the outpatient setting. While we found that most patients were unlikely to benefit from intensifications, for patients with both severe inpatient hyperglycemia and uncontrolled outpatient blood glucose levels who may benefit from intensifications, simpler guideline-based insulin regimens, starting with single dose long-acting agents, is likely to lessen hypoglycemia risks compared with more complex short-acting or multidrug insulin regimens.

### Treat-to-target insulin titration algorithms when initiating long or intermediate acting insulin in type 2 diabetes [^6d150e3e]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Until recently, titration of insulin in type 2 diabetes clinical trials was typically left up to the investigator's discretion with a simple statement of the target ranges for glucose. In type 2 diabetes trials the average glycemic control achieved was usually less than desirable. Since then a number of trials have been conducted and reported utilizing various algorithms under various conditions. The objective of this article is to provide a review of the evidence to date.

Methods

In addition to studies already identified through work in the area, the literature was searched using PubMed with the search words "insulin and titration" and subsequently "insulin and algorithm" from which studies starting insulin therapy using insulin titration algorithms in type 2 diabetes were selected.

Results

The different algorithms and achieved results for glycemic control and hypoglycemia, as well as factors appearing to impact the results, are reviewed.

Conclusion

The recent introduction of rigorously implemented insulin titration algorithms when adding on basal insulin to oral drugs in inadequately treated type 2 diabetes patients has led to better average glycemic control with little risk of severe hypoglycemia, as long as the morning fasting plasma glucose target is not lower than 100 mg/dl. Insulin titration algorithms have undergone and continue evolution in the direction of increased patient control.

Prandial insulin dose adjustment — hyperglycemia: For pre-midday meal glucose > 110 mg/dL, increase the morning meal dose by 10% to 20%; for pre-evening glucose > 140 mg/dL, increase the midday meal dose by 10% to 20%; and for bedtime glucose > 140 mg/dL, increase the pre-evening meal dose by 10%. Fixed-dose insulin can be titrated by 2 units every 2 to 3 days relying on the morning FBG because of the presence of basal insulin.

In summary, having two effective approaches to deliver and adjust rapid-acting mealtime insulin (a simple algorithm and insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio) may increase patients' and clinicians' willingness to undertake basal:bolus insulin therapy, a step that is often needed to achieve optimal glucose control in type 2 diabetes.

### Glucose management in hospitalized patients [^58a7e294]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Glucose management in hospitalized patients poses challenges to physicians, including identifying blood glucose targets, judicious use of oral diabetes mellitus medications, and implementing appropriate insulin regimens. Uncontrolled blood glucose levels can lead to deleterious effects on wound healing, increased risk of infection, and delays in surgical procedures or discharge from the hospital. Previously recommended strict blood glucose targets for hospitalized patients result in more cases of hypoglycemia without improvement in patient outcomes. The current target is 140 to 180 mg per dL. Use of oral diabetes medications, particularly metformin, in hospitalized patients is controversial. Multiple guidelines recommend stopping these medications at admission because of inpatient factors that can increase the risk of renal or hepatic failure. However, oral diabetes medications have important nonglycemic benefits and reduce the risk of widely fluctuating blood glucose levels. There is no proven risk of lactic acidosis from metformin in patients with normal kidney function, and it can be used safely in many hospitalized patients with diabetes. Insulin dosing depends on the patient's previous experience with insulin, baseline diabetes control, and renal function. Other considerations include the patient's current oral intake, comorbidities, and other medications. Many patients can be managed using only a basal insulin dose, whereas others benefit from additional short-acting premeal doses. Historically, sliding scale insulin regimens have been used, but they have no proven benefit, increase the risk of hypoglycemia and large fluctuations in blood glucose levels, and are not recommended. Discharge planning is an important opportunity to address diabetes control, medication adherence, and outpatient follow-up.

Although extensive dosing instructions for insulin are beyond the scope of this statement, most patients can be taught to uptitrate their own insulin dose based on several algorithms, each essentially involving the addition of a small dose increase if hyperglycemia persists. For example, the addition of 1–2 units (or, in those already on higher doses, increments of 5–10%) to the daily dose once or twice weekly if the fasting glucose levels are above the preagreed target is a reasonable approach. As the target is neared, dosage adjustments should be more modest and occur less frequently. Downward adjustment is advisable if any hypoglycemia occurs. During self-titration, frequent contact (telephone, e-mail) with the clinician may be necessary. Practitioners themselves can, of course, also titrate basal insulin, but this would involve more intensive contact with the patient than typically available in routine clinical practice. Daily self-monitoring of blood glucose is of obvious importance during this phase. After the insulin dose is stabilized, the frequency of monitoring should be reviewed.

Consideration should be given to the addition of prandial or mealtime insulin coverage when significant postprandial glucose excursions (e.g. to > 10.0 mmol/L [> 180 mg/dL]) occur. This is suggested when the fasting glucose is at target but the HbA 1c remains above goal after 3–6 months of basal insulin titration. The same would apply if large drops in glucose occur during overnight hours or in between meals, as the basal insulin dose is increased. In this scenario, the basal insulin dose would obviously need to be simultaneously decreased as prandial insulin is initiated. Although basal insulin is titrated primarily against the fasting glucose, generally irrespective of the total dose, practitioners should be aware that the need for prandial insulin therapy will become likely the more the daily dose exceeds 0.5 U kg −1 day −1, especially as it approaches 1 U kg −1 day −1. The aim with mealtime insulin is to blunt postprandial glycemic excursions, which can be extreme in some individuals, resulting in poor control during the day. Such coverage may be provided by one of two methods.

### Efficacy of a new protocol of premixed 70 / 30 human insulin in Haitian youth with diabetes [^c2cfb9e1]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Our findings suggest that in our population of youth who reside in a resource-limited, food-insecure setting, the use of sliding scales adjusted for missed SMBG and skipped meals can be a key factor in achieving better glycemic control, without severe hypoglycemia, at least in patients treated with premixed 70/30 human insulin. The beneficial effect was achieved in the presence of a minimum but essential clinical support package that included two rather than one clinic visits per month and a moderate increase in the length of each visit for better self-management education. In resource-limited settings where children and adolescents are considered autonomous at a much younger age and patients' families have a lower education level, these findings can provide important information to diabetes care teams who are often called upon to substitute for families in terms of providing the required care support to youth with diabetes. Further, healthcare providers may encourage the transfer from a self-mixed regimen to a premixed one when the former appears to be a factor contributing to poor treatment adherence.

Our study has a number of limitations. The small size of the sample and the short duration of the follow-up period may have prevented us from finding significant differences between and within groups or detecting significant predictors of poor glycemic control. The high baseline HbA1c level may have made patients more prone to improving their metabolic control. Our protocol, which prevented some patients from taking insulin at midday and night in cases of missed BG tests and skipped meals, was a potential risk factor for DKA, particularly on sick days, but this risk was lessened by the systematic administration of insulin in the morning and the patients' awareness to signs and management of DKA. Similarly, failure to administer 70/30 insulin for a BG level < 80 mg/dL (4.4 mmol/mol) in the absence of meal could result in DKA but, based on our long-standing experience at FHADIMAC, we hypothesized that rapid-acting insulin, even after ingestion of fast-acting carbohydrates, might increase the risk of hypoglycemia in the following hours. SMBG before the next meal, as recommended, then might help decrease the risk of DKA. On the other hand, the limitation of only one to two SMBG tests per day could have under-detected rates of hypoglycemia. Lastly, it was not possible to dissociate the glycemic effect of the sliding scale from that of the change in the characteristics of the visit, since the two formed a package.

For most persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D) taking insulin, glucose goals are A1C < 7% and fasting and premeal blood glucose < 110 mg/dL in the absence of hypoglycemia.

### Best practices and tools for titrating basal insulins: expert opinion from an Indian panel via the modified Delphi consensus method [^0fb1750f]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Profile of Basal Insulin for Titration

Insulin with low hypoglycemic risk and which allows for optimal titration once initiated is the need of the hour in clinical practice. Even mild hypoglycemic episodes can shake a patient's confidence. Evidence suggests that persons with T2DM reduce their insulin dose after a mild hypoglycemic episode.

Hypoglycemia during the first 3 months of basal insulin therapy is a predictor for long-term hypoglycemia risk. In one observational study, the authors conducted a retrospective analysis of the patient database of general practitioners' electronic medical records. The study used medical records from five European countries and the USA. The aim of the study was to evaluate short-and long-term glycemic control and hypoglycemia incidence in insulin-naïve persons with T2DM who were initiating basal insulin therapy, with or without OADs. The total number of participants was 40,627. The authors noted that hypoglycemia during the initial 3-month period was associated with a long-term risk of these events over the ensuing 3 to 24 months. These results led to the conclusion that the effective titration of insulin doses that optimizes blood glucose control without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia is crucial.

Initial drug therapy.

It is generally agreed that metformin, if not contraindicated and if tolerated, is the preferred and most cost-effective first agent (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs.). It is initiated at, or soon after, diagnosis, especially in patients in whom lifestyle intervention alone has not achieved, or is unlikely to achieve, HbA 1c goals. Because of frequent gastrointestinal side effects, it should be started at a low dose with gradual titration. Patients with a high baseline HbA 1c (e.g. ≥ 9.0%) have a low probability of achieving a near-normal target with monotherapy. It may therefore be justified to start directly with a combination of two noninsulin agents or with insulin itself in this circumstance. If a patient presents with significant hyperglycemic symptoms and/or has dramatically elevated plasma glucose concentrations (e.g. > 16.7–19.4 mmol/L [> 300–350 mg/dL]) or HbA 1c (e.g. ≥ 10.0–12.0%), insulin therapy should be strongly considered from the outset. Such treatment is mandatory when catabolic features are exhibited or, of course, if ketonuria is demonstrated, the latter reflecting profound insulin deficiency. Importantly, unless there is evidence of type 1 diabetes, once symptoms are relieved, glucotoxicity resolved, and the metabolic state stabilized, it may be possible to taper insulin partially or entirely, transferring to noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents, perhaps in combination.

Basal insulin titration — frequency and fasting target: Basal insulin should be titrated every 2 to 3 days to reach glycemic targets with a goal fasting blood glucose (FBG) of < 110 mg/dL without hypoglycemia, and because of the longer half-life of insulin degludec, slower titration every 3 to 5 days is recommended.

### Randomized study comparing a basal-bolus with a basal plus correction insulin regimen for the hospital management of medical and surgical patients with type 2 diabetes: basal plus trial [^33462c33]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Patients were randomized according a 2:2:1 ratio to one of three regimens: a basal-bolus regimen with insulin glargine given once daily and glulisine before meals plus corrective doses of glulisine by sliding scale for BG > 140 mg/dL (Lantus and Apidra; Sanofi), a basal plus regimen with a daily dose of glargine and corrective doses of glulisine by sliding scale before meals for BG > 140 mg/dL, or SSI for BG > 140 mg/dL (Novolin R; Novo Nordisk). Patients in the basal-bolus group were started at a total daily dose (TDD) of 0.5 units/kg divided with half as insulin glargine once daily and half as insulin glulisine before meals. Patients in the basal plus group received 0.25 units/kg of glargine plus corrective doses of glulisine before meals. In patients ≥ 70 years of age and those with a serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL, the starting TDD in the basal-bolus group was reduced to 0.3 units/kg in the basal-bolus, and TDD of glargine was reduced to 0.15 units/kg in the basal plus regimen. The goal of insulin therapy was to maintain fasting and premeal glucose concentrations between 100 and 140 mg/dL. The doses of insulin were adjusted daily according to protocol. During treatment, treatment failure was arbitrarily defined as a mean daily BG level > 240 mg/dL or two consecutive values > 240 mg/dL. In case of treatment failure, patients in the basal plus and SSI groups were switched to a basal-bolus regimen starting at a TDD of 0.5 units/kg.

This study was conducted at Grady Memorial Hospital, Emory University Hospital, and the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Atlanta, Georgia; Medical University of South Carolina Medical Center in Charleston, South Carolina; and Tulane Medical Center in New Orleans, Louisiana. The study protocol and consent form were approved by the institutional review board at each participating institution. A research pharmacist at each institution followed a computer-generated randomization table to coordinate the randomization and treatment assignment. All patients were managed for medical and surgical problems by their primary care team, who received a copy of the assigned treatment protocol.

Transitions to and titrations of insulin.

Most patients express reluctance to beginning injectable therapy, but, if the practitioner feels that such a transition is important, encouragement and education can usually overcome such reticence. Insulin is typically begun at a low dose (e.g. 0.1–0.2 U kg −1 day −1), although larger amounts (0.3–0.4 U kg −1 day −1) are reasonable in the more severely hyperglycemic. The most convenient strategy is with a single injection of a basal insulin, with the timing of administration dependent on the patient's schedule and overall glucose profile (Fig. 3).

Figure 3
Sequential insulin strategies in type 2 diabetes. Basal insulin alone is usually the optimal initial regimen, beginning at 0.1–0.2 units/kg body weight, depending on the degree of hyperglycemia. It is usually prescribed in conjunction with one to two noninsulin agents. In patients willing to take more than one injection and who have higher HbA 1c levels (≥ 9.0%), twice-daily premixed insulin or a more advanced basal plus mealtime insulin regimen could also be considered (curved dashed arrow lines). When basal insulin has been titrated to an acceptable fasting glucose but HbA 1c remains above target, consider proceeding to basal plus mealtime insulin, consisting of one to three injections of rapid-acting analogs (see text for details). A less studied alternative — progression from basal insulin to a twice-daily premixed insulin — could be also considered (straight dashed arrow line); if this is unsuccessful, move to basal plus mealtime insulin. The figure describes the number of injections required at each stage, together with the relative complexity and flexibility. Once a strategy is initiated, titration of the insulin dose is important, with dose adjustments made based on the prevailing glucose levels as reported by the patient. Noninsulin agents may be continued, although insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas, meglitinides) are typically stopped once more complex regimens beyond basal insulin are utilized. Comprehensive education regarding self-monitoring of blood glucose, diet, exercise, and the avoidance of, and response to, hypoglycemia are critical in any patient on insulin therapy. Mod. moderate.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^2b09e597]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Insulin therapy for type 2 diabetes (T2D) is usually initiated when oral agents do not provide sufficient glycemic control, and self-monitoring of blood glucose must be performed for insulin to be used safely and effectively. Initially, a single long-acting insulin analog can be added as basal insulin therapy with dose adjustment to maintain fasting glucose in the desired range. Insulin glargine U300 and insulin degludec, compared with insulin glargine U100, showed overall similar levels of glycemic control but with less variability and hypoglycemia. If fasting glucose is near goal but the HbA1c remains above goal, rapid-acting insulin can be added first prior to the largest meal and then prior to other meals as necessary. Premixed insulins given twice daily may be a simpler approach, but the lack of flexibility, especially in patients who may skip or delay meals, may increase the risk of hypoglycemia; moving from one to three or four injections per day increases regimen complexity, and assistive appliances such as insulin pens can be helpful. Fixed doses of GLP-1 receptor agonists with basal insulin — insulin degludec and liraglutide (IDegLira) or insulin glargine and lixisenatide (LixiLan) — are available in a single syringe so only one injection is needed; a low dose is started with gradual titration, and studies have reported excellent reduction in HbA1c with less hypoglycemia and weight loss compared with increased titration of basal insulin alone or intensification with basal/bolus insulin.

### Safely converting an entire academic medical center from sliding scale to basal bolus insulin via implementation of the eGlycemic management system [^aa9c519a]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Hyperglycemia is common in the inpatient setting and providers frequently rely on sliding scale insulin. This case study reviews the experience of one hospital moving from high utilization of sliding scale to basal bolus insulin therapy.

Method

This Retrospective Quality Improvement Study describes the journey of clinicians at a 580-bed hospital to convert from high usage of SSI to BBI. Hyperglycemic adult patients prescribed insulin, with/without a diagnosis of diabetes, were included.

Results

Data over the first year showed that patients treated with Glucommander (GM) spent more time in the target range of 70–180 mg/dL than patients treated with non-Glucommander (non-GM), with 2,434 fewer hypoglycemic events and 40,589 fewer hyperglycemic events. Prior to implementation of GM, SSI was close to 95%, BBI at 5%. Within the first month of use, 96% usage of BBI was achieved. Reduction of hypoglycemic events (% of BG < 70 mg/dL) by 21% with 2.16% non-GM compared to GM at 1.74% and severe Hypoglycemia (% of BG < 50 mg/dL) by 50% in the ICU 3% non-GM compared to GM at 1.5%. In addition, patients treated with GM had a shorter LOS than patients treated with non-GM by 3.18 days and used 47.4% less point of care tests per patient.

Conclusion

Glycemic management improved with use of eGMS. The conversion from SSI to BBI enhanced overall patient safety, eliminated the time and effort otherwise required when manually titrating insulin and reduced overall cost of care for patients on insulin therapy.

### The usage of a simplified self-titration dosing guideline (303 algorithm) for insulin detemir in patients with type 2 diabetes – results of the randomized, controlled PREDICTIVE 303 study [^6558e3f6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

The Predictable Results and Experience in Diabetes through Intensification and Control to Target: An International Variability Evaluation 303 (PREDICTIVE 303) Study (n = 5604) evaluated the effectiveness of insulin detemir, a long-acting basal insulin analogue, using a simplified patient self-adjusted dosing algorithm (303 Algorithm group) compared with standard-of-care physician-driven adjustments (Standard-of-care group) in a predominantly primary care setting, over a period of 6 months. Insulin detemir was to be started once-daily as add-on therapy to any other glucose-lowering regimens or as a replacement of prestudy basal insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Investigator sites rather than individual patients were randomized to either the 303 Algorithm group or the Standard-of-care group. Patients from the 303 Algorithm group sites were instructed to adjust their insulin detemir dose every 3 days based on the mean of three 'adjusted' fasting plasma glucose (aFPG) values (capillary blood glucose calibrated to equivalent plasma glucose values) using a simple algorithm: mean aFPG < 80 mg/dl (< 4.4 mmol/l), reduce dose by 3 U; aFPG between 80 and 110 mg/dl (4.4–6.1 mmol/l), no change; and aFPG > 110 mg/dl (> 1.1 mmol/l), increase dose by 3 U. The insulin detemir dose for patients in the Standard-of-care group was adjusted by the investigator according to the standard of care. Mean A1C decreased from 8.5% at baseline to 7.9% at 26 weeks for the 303 Algorithm group and from 8.5 to 8.0% for the Standard-of-care group (p = 0.0106 for difference in A1C reduction between the two groups). Mean FPG values decreased from 175 mg/dl (9.7 mmol/l) at baseline to 141 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) for the 303 Algorithm group and decreased from 174 mg/dl (9.7 mmol/l) to 152 mg/dl (8.4 mmol/l) for the Standard-of-care group (p < 0.0001 for difference in FPG reduction between the two groups). Mean body weight remained the same at 26 weeks in both groups (change from baseline 0.1 and -0.2 kg for the 303 Algorithm group and the Standard-of-care group respectively). At 26 weeks, 91% of the patients in the 303 Algorithm group and 85% of the patients in the Standard-of-care group remained on once-daily insulin detemir administration. The rates of overall hypoglycaemia (events/patient/year) decreased significantly from baseline in both groups [from 9.05 to 6.44 for the 303 Algorithm group (p = 0.0039) and from 9.53 to 4.95 for the Standard-of-care group (p < 0.0001)]. Major hypoglycaemic events were rare in both groups (0.26 events/patient/year for the 303 Algorithm group and 0.20 events/patient/year for the Standard-of-care group; p = 0.2395). In conclusion, patients in the 303 Algorithm group achieved comparable glycaemic control with higher rate of hypoglycaemia as compared with patients in the Standard-of-care group, possibly because of more aggressive insulin dose adjustments. The vast majority of the patients in both groups were effectively treated with once-daily insulin detemir therapy. The use of insulin detemir in this predominantly primary care setting achieved significant improvements in glycaemic control with minimal risk of hypoglycaemia and no weight gain.

Table 2
Guideline recommendations for key clinical outcomes for older people with diabetes

Currently, guidelines for older adults with diabetes in LTCF prioritize the avoidance of hypoglycemiaand the individualization of therapy. The ADA recommends simplifying treatment regimens and avoiding the use of sliding scale insulin alone. Addressing diabetes goals in older adults residing in LTCF should be conducted in an interdisciplinary manner based on individual comorbidities.

Several studies have confirmed that glucose control is often tight rather than poor at LTCFs with HbA1c that is lower than the goal for this population. This may indicate overtreatment since more than 50% of older adults being treated with hypoglycemia-associated drugs (insulin and insulin secretagogues) have an HbA1c that is less than 7% as reported from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

Recent developments in antidiabetic drugs portfolio provide an opportunity to optimize diabetes care in LTCFs. Currently, there are 12 glucose-lowering agents with different mechanisms of action. Some of the newer agents (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium–glucose cotransport 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i)) are associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia compared with insulin and sulfonylureas (SUs). In addition, newer long-acting insulin analogs, such as glargine U300 and degludec insulin, are associated with lower rates of hypoglycemia compared with first-generation basal insulins (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn insulin (NPH), glargine U100 and detemir).

Basal-bolus insulin regimen for inpatient glycaemic control

Basal-bolus insulin for inpatient glycaemic control replicates the principles of basal-bolus insulin in the community. Patients take once-a-day long-acting insulin and then take a rapid-acting insulin with meals (if eating).

The original multicentre basal-bolus study described recruiting surgical patients with T2DM, who were either on oral glucose-lowering agents or minimal amounts of insulin. They were randomised to either a basal-bolus insulin therapy or sliding scale insulin. The dose of the basal insulin glargine was 0.25 units kg −1 if fit and well, and 0.15 units kg −1 if comorbidities present. The bolus dose of rapid-acting insulin glulisine was to be given with meals and was either 0.08 units kg −1 or 0.05 units kg −1 if frail. The basal-bolus regimen improved glycaemic control and reduced hospital complications compared with sliding scale insulin in general surgery patients.

Although this strategy is clearly effective, the methodology is very labour intensive, and this may hinder widespread adoption and replication of the encouraging results.

Basal plus correction insulin regimen for inpatient glycaemic control

The basal plus correction insulin regimen was designed to overcome the apparent complexity of the basal-bolus insulin regimen for inpatient glycaemic control. It involves the administration of once-a-day basal insulin and the administration of correction doses of a rapid-acting insulin to rectify hyperglycaemia.

The original multicentre study described recruiting surgical and medical patients with T2DM, who were either on oral glucose-lowering agents or minimal amounts of insulin. Patients were enrolled into a multicentre three-armed study. The three cohorts were basal plus correction, basal bolus, and 'sliding scale' insulin. The basal plus correction regimen was demonstrated to provide better glycaemic control and fewer hypoglycaemic episodes than the other two regimes. Again, 'sliding scale' insulin was found to provide the worst glycaemic control.

### Clinical decision support to improve management of diabetes and dysglycemia in the hospital: a path to optimizing practice and outcomes [^bef7788b]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

We observed fewer cases of inappropriate use of SSI as monotherapy during the active period observed among type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients with recurrent hyperglycemia. However, in type 1 diabetes this did not retain statistical significance in the adjusted analysis likely due to the small absolute numbers. The count of gap in care events for inappropriate use of SSI as monotherapy among patient with stress hyperglycemia was larger during the active period. This CDS tool aimed to convey a sense of urgency by alerting providers about the risk for DKA in patients with type 1 diabetes receiving SSI monotherapy. Similarly, it intended to heighten the interest in improving glycemic control among patients with stress hyperglycemia who were receiving only ISS. In trying to explain the higher number of innapropriate SSI in stress hyperglycemia patients, we speculate that the low response to the messages advocating avoidance of sliding scales as monotherapy among patients with stress hyperglycemia could be related to the tendency of providers to omit stress hyperglycemia and fear of hypoglycemia when scheduling insulin. It is possible that our message promoting improvement of glucose control could have been less impactful than if it had actually stated outcome benefits from reducing stress hyperglycemia. However, it is not completely understood why the number of events corresponding the use insulin monotherapy in stress hyperglycemia was significantly larger during the ON period. A possible explanation is that by alerting about stress hyperglycemia provider opted to only prescribe correctional insulin in some cases thus increasing the number if events recognizing SSI monotherapy. Clinical guidelines strongly discourage the use of SSI monotherapy in the management of persistent hyperglycemia of any origin and recommend scheduled insulin either basal or basal/prandial as clinically applicable. A Cochrane study suggests that the evidence in favor of either SSI or basal-bolus therapy is equivocal. Sliding scale monotherapy was inferior to basal-bolus insulin in controlling glycemia and was associated with worse clinical outcomes among surgical patients with hyperglycemia. Using SSI alone is strongly discouraged for patients with type 2 diabetes or those with stress hyperglycemia given association with increased risk of hospital complications. Basal-bolus insulin therapy is the standard of care for patients with type 1 diabetes, and SSI monotherapy is contraindicated in patients with type 1 diabetes due to their absolute insulin dependency and risk for diabetic ketoacidosis.

### Inpatient management of diabetes and hyperglycemia among general medicine patients at a large teaching hospital [^1be921af]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Because of the relationship between inpatient hyperglycemia and adverse patient outcomes, current guidelines recommend glucose levels less than 180 mg/dL in the non-ICU inpatient setting and the use of effective insulin protocols for appropriate patients.

Objective

To determine the current state of glucose management on an academic hospitalist service and the relationship between insulin-ordering practices and glycemic control.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Hospitalist-run general medicine service of an academic teaching hospital.

Patients

107 consecutive patients with diabetes mellitus or inpatient hyperglycemia.

Measurements

We collected data on up to 4 bedside glucose measurements per day, detailed clinical information, and all orders related to glucose management. The primary outcomes were rate of hyperglycemia (glucose > 180 mg/dL) per patient and mean glucose level per patient-day.

Results

The mean rate of hyperglycemia was 31% of measurements per patient. Basal insulin was ordered for 43% of patients, and scheduled rapid- or short-acting insulin was ordered for 4% of patients. Sixty-five percent of patients who had at least 1 episode of hyper- or hypoglycemia had no change made to any insulin order during the first 5 days of the hospitalization. When adjusted for clinical factors, the use of sliding-scale insulin by itself was associated with a 20 mg/dL higher mean glucose level per patient-day.

Conclusions

Management of diabetes and hyperglycemia on a general medicine service showed several deficiencies in process and outcome. Possible targets for improvement include increased use of basal and nutritional insulin and daily insulin adjustment in response to hyperglycemia.

### Practical guidance on the use of premix insulin analogs in initiating, intensifying, or switching insulin regimens in type 2 diabetes [^46383a4e]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Switching from Basal–Bolus to Premix Insulin Analog Therapy in Primary Care

Practical Guidance: Chronic Treatment Failure

Not all patients achieve successful glycemic control with long-term basal–bolus therapy. The reasons for this are many and, with further education, the regimen may prove to be appropriate. For others, switching to a premix insulin analog may be the right decision. For example, some patients are unwilling or unable to deal with complexity, or they may have tried a basal–bolus regimen but their circumstances may have changed. Others may find carbohydrate counting, dose adjustment, or the required degree of monitoring too difficult, or be unable to handle two different insulin delivery devices.

To date, there is limited published evidence concerning this change, although all practicing endocrinologists will have experience in this situation. Rather than suggesting a specific HbA1c cutoff for switching regimens, we suggest a switch to premix insulin analogs in patients who are clearly unable or unwilling to use basal–bolus therapy, or whose HbA1c has consistently remained above target despite using a basal–bolus regimen while having access to proper training and adequate information.

The default switch is to premix insulin analog BID, not TID, and the titration guidance shown in " Box 4 " is our suggested approach. If the patient is transferring from an analog basal–bolus regimen, education concerning the need to resuspend the protaminated insulin is important.

Box 4: Titration algorithm for switching from basal–bolus to premix insulin analog (based on consensus)

General guidance: as always, titration must be tailored to the individual patient.
These guidelines do not override clinical judgment and knowledge.
Reduce total daily dose of all insulin by 20–30%.
Then split this value 50/50 to give you the starting dose of premix insulin analog at breakfast and evening meal.
Unusual meal patterns may lead you to reconsider the initial dose ratio.
Titrate the dose preferably once or twice a week (see " Box 1 "). Adjust the evening meal dose first, followed by the breakfast dose.
Safety is key: go slowly.

Practical Guidance: Patients Discharged from Hospital

Some hospitalized patients may have been placed on a basal–bolus regimen to provide a flexibility of management that is not required following discharge. Under these circumstances, switching to an alternate premix insulin regimen would be appropriate.

In such patients, it is important to be conservative, and insulin requirements may change dramatically from those required in hospital. Discharge planning is vital and expert input is desirable. For titration guidelines, see " Box 4 ".

### Which patients will benefit from a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetic drugs? Further analysis of the lantus registry study [^4f73e597]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The selection of appropriate therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can often be challenging given the availability of a wide variety of therapeutic options. However, it is recognized that most patients with long-standing T2DM will need to incorporate insulin into their treatment regimen at some point because of the progressive nature of the condition. Early initiation of insulin is increasingly advocated to enable patients to achieve adequate glycemic control. Several international guidelines, as well as the Chinese treatment guidelines, recommend that insulin should be considered if the initiation of lifestyle modifications and metformin or combination therapy of two to three oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) is unable to achieve and maintain target glycemic levels. While some guidelines recommend initiation with basal insulin, a long-acting insulin analogue that maintains basal glycemic levels throughout the day, others recommend initiation with basal or premixed insulin. Premixed insulin, a combination of rapid-acting bolus insulin and intermediate-acting basal insulin, was developed to mimic physiological endogenous insulin secretion. Premixed insulin is typically prescribed and initiated in approximately 70.0% of Chinese patients with T2DM, while only around 10.0% receive basal insulin. This is partly because premixed insulin was available in China earlier than basal insulin analogues, and is considerably cheaper. While premixed insulins are considered to be a good option for patients who require both basal and prandial insulin but wish to limit the number of daily injections, the fixed dose combination of basal and rapid-acting insulins means that the dose of insulins cannot be conveniently adjusted to meet individual patient requirements. Additionally, in comparison to treatment with basal insulin, premixed insulin has been associated with inadequate glycemic control, as well as an increased risk of hypoglycemia.

### Sliding scale insulin use in a national cohort study of nursing home residents with type 2 diabetes [^0afb38ae]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines discourage sliding scale insulin (SSI) use after the first week of a nursing home (NH) admission. We sought to determine the prevalence of SSI and identify factors associated with stopping SSI or transitioning to another short-acting insulin regimen.

Methods

In an observational study from October 1, 2013, to June 30, 2017 of non-hospice Veterans Affairs NH residents with type 2 diabetes and an NH admission over 1week, we compared the weekly prevalence of SSI versus two other short-acting insulin regimens - fixed dose insulin (FDI) or correction dose insulin (CDI, defined as variable SSI given alongside fixed doses of insulin) - from week 2 to week 12 of admission. Among those on SSI in week 2, we examined factors associated with stopping SSI or transitioning to other regimens by week 5. Factors included demographics (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity), frailty-related factors (e.g., comorbidities, cognitive impairment, functional impairment), and diabetes-related factors (e.g. HbA1c, long-acting insulin use, hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia).

Results

In week 2, 21% of our cohort was on SSI, 8% was on FDI, and 7% was on CDI. SSI was the most common regimen in frail subgroups (e.g., 18% of our cohort with moderate-severe cognitive impairment was on SSI vs 5% on FDI and 4% on CDI). SSI prevalence decreased steadily from 21% to 16% at week 12 (p for linear trend < 0.001), mostly through stopping SSI. Diabetes-related factors (e.g., hyperglycemia) were more strongly associated with continuing SSI or transitioning to a non-SSI short-acting insulin regimen than frailty-related factors.

Conclusions

SSI is the most common method of administering short-acting insulin in NH residents. More research needs to be done to explore why sliding scale use persists weeks after NH admission and explore how we can replace this practice with safer, more effective, and less burdensome regimens.

### Clinical decision support to improve management of diabetes and dysglycemia in the hospital: a path to optimizing practice and outcomes [^65568197]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Greater count of hypoglycemia or impending hypoglycemia events when the tool was active may suggest that more proactive management of hyperglycemia could have resulted in an increased rate of hypoglycemia during the ON period. To further evaluate this matter, we conducted a subsequent analysis to determine whether recommendations to treat elevated glucose or to avoid insulin sliding scales as monotherapy in patients with hyperglycemia could have directly predisposed to subsequent hypoglycemia and as a result evoked more gap in care events for hypoglycemia. We also analyzed whether having been identified with hypoglycemia or near hypoglycemia by the clinical decision support tool would result in fewer subsequent hypoglycemic events. We performed an analysis of the frequency and mean of hypoglycemia gap in care events in two different ways; (A) after an initial hypoglycemia alert to assess the contribution of the diabetes CDS tool in preventing subsequent hypoglycemia events and (B) after an initial non-hypoglycemia alert to determine whether it promoted subsequent hypoglycemia events. The mean of hypoglycemia events following a previous hypoglycemia alert was smaller in the ON (1.78) than in the OFF (1.87) but did not reach statistical significance (IRR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.30, p = 0.438) suggesting that alerting for hypoglycemia did not prevent subsequent hypoglycemic episodes. The mean of hypoglycemia events following a non-hypoglycemia alert was smaller in the ON (1.69) than in the OFF (1.70) period and not significantly different (IRR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.21, p = 0.846). This indicates that there was not an increase in hypoglycemic events after the CDS tool alerted for hyperglycemia or inappropriate insulin use. The values programed in the tool to alert for hypoglycemia or impending hypoglycemia were ≤ 3.9 and ≤ 4.4 mmol/L (≤ 70 and ≤ 80 mg/dL), respectively. Records of glucose values representing all first hypoglycemic events during the pilot were 660 (5.72%) corresponding to at risk or impending hypoglycemia values between 3.94 mmol/L and 4.4 mmol/L (71–80 mg/dL); 394 (3.42%) to mild hypoglycemia with values between to 2.28 mmol/L and 3.9 mmol/L (41–70 mg/dL); and 17 (0.15%) denoting severe hypoglycemia with values ≤ 2.2 mmol/L (≤ 40 mg/dL). Following initial events evoked, subsequent hypoglycemia events (recurrent hypoglycemia) accounted for 244 (2.23%) values between 3.94 mmol/L and 4.4 mmol/L (71–80 mg/dL); 202 (1.84%) values between 2.28 mmol/L and 3.9 mmol/L (41–70 mg/dL); and 13 (0.12%) values ≤ 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dL). This illustrates that the majority of events evoked for hypoglycemia either initial or recurrent corresponded to impending hypoglycemia, which is important although less concerning than established hypoglycemia.

### Individualizing insulin therapy in the management of type 2 diabetes [^a46aa92a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

It is recognized that reducing hyperglycemia early on in disease progression has long-term benefits for patients with diabetes. Insulin therapy has greater potential to reduce hyperglycemia than other therapies; however, there is often a significant delay in insulin initiation and intensification. Insulin replacement therapy in type 2 diabetes should no longer be viewed as the treatment of last resort. With the development of modern insulin analogs, the field has evolved. Large clinical trials have improved our understanding of the potential benefits and risks associated with intensive glycemic control in different patient populations and highlighted the need for individualization of glycemic targets and treatment strategies. Current treatment guidelines recognize the important role of insulin therapy both early on and throughout the progression of type 2 diabetes.

### Randomized study comparing a basal-bolus with a basal plus correction insulin regimen for the hospital management of medical and surgical patients with type 2 diabetes: basal plus trial [^b6d19b83]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Effective and easily implemented insulin regimens are needed to facilitate hospital glycemic control in general medical and surgical patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Research Design and Methods

This multicenter trial randomized 375 patients with T2D treated with diet, oral antidiabetic agents, or low-dose insulin (≤ 0.4 units/kg/day) to receive a basal-bolus regimen with glargine once daily and glulisine before meals, a basal plus regimen with glargine once daily and supplemental doses of glulisine, and sliding scale regular insulin (SSI).

Results

Improvement in mean daily blood glucose (BG) after the first day of therapy was similar between basal-bolus and basal plus groups (P = 0.16), and both regimens resulted in a lower mean daily BG than did SSI (P = 0.04). In addition, treatment with basal-bolus and basal plus regimens resulted in less treatment failure (defined as > 2 consecutive BG > 240 mg/dL or a mean daily BG > 240 mg/dL) than did treatment with SSI (0 vs. 2 vs. 19%, respectively; P < 0.001). A BG < 70 mg/dL occurred in 16% of patients in the basal-bolus group, 13% in the basal plus group, and 3% in the SSI group (P = 0.02). There was no difference among the groups in the frequency of severe hypoglycemia (< 40 mg/dL; P = 0.76).

Conclusions

The use of a basal plus regimen with glargine once daily plus corrective doses with glulisine insulin before meals resulted in glycemic control similar to a standard basal-bolus regimen. The basal plus approach is an effective alternative to the use of a basal-bolus regimen in general medical and surgical patients with T2D.

### Continuous glucose control in the ICU: report of a 2013 round table meeting [^f2949c43]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Insulin algorithms

An algorithm can be defined as 'a formalized sequence of instructions for solving a complex problem in finite processing steps'. Algorithms in the field of tight glucose control are used to standardize care, for quality assurance and to avoid intuitive decision making. An optimal system should be accurate, safe, efficacious, simple to use, reliable, flexible for different patient populations, assessable in real-time, fit into workflow, require a low number of glucose measurements (if not based on CGM), and take into account inter- and intrapatient variability and carbohydrate intake. Algorithms should incorporate dynamic scale protocols, instead of static sliding-scale protocols. Although early algorithms were paper-based, increasingly, glucose control algorithms are computer-based, enabling more complex protocols to be developed. Several studies have demonstrated improved glucose control with computer-based compared to paper-based algorithms. A common type of algorithm is the PID algorithm in which deviation of the blood glucose value from the target range is corrected by adjusting the dose of insulin using a linear combination of absolute deviation, trend, and the sum of past deviations. Another main type of glucose algorithm used in critical care is the model-based or model-predictive control algorithm, which adjusts insulin dose according to a mathematical model of the relationship between blood glucose and insulin. Better standardization of algorithm development is needed.

Insulin therapy intensification when prandial control is needed (Table 18) — steps, doses, and titration: Begin prandial control with Step 1A for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Step 1B for type 1 diabetes (T1D) ("Begin with Step 1A for T2D and Step 1B for T1D"). Step 1A adds noninsulin options ("GLP-1 RA, SGLT2 inhibitor, or DPP-4 inhibitor") with the caveat "If glucose goals remain unmet, add prandial insulin". Step 1B uses prandial insulin, with "Prandial insulin analogs preferred over (NPH + regular insulin) or premixed insulin", and an initial "TDD 0.3 to 0.5 units/kg (50% basal; 50% prandial)". Step 2 advises, "Titrate insulin every 2–3 days", using a fixed regimen to "Increase TDD by 2 units/d", or an adjustable regimen: "Elevated fasting BG Increase HS basal doses", "Elevated midday meal BG Increase breakfast prandial insulin doses", "Elevated pre-evening meal BG Increase midday prandial insulin dose", and "Elevated bedtime BG Increase dinner prandial insulin dose", with "Increase dose by 10% to 20% depending on severity of BG elevation"; for premixed insulin, "FBG/premeal BG > 180 mg/dL Increase AM or PM dose depending on times of BG elevation" and "Increase dose by 10% to 20%". Step 3 (hypoglycemia) adjusts down: "Low fasting BG Reduce HS basal dose" with "Decrease dose by 10% to 20% depending on severity of hypoglycemia", plus "Low midday meal BG Reduce breakfast prandial dose", "Low pre-evening meal BG Reduce midday prandial dose", and "Low bedtime BG Reduce evening prandial dose"; for premixed insulin, "Low BGs in AM or PM Reduce AM or PM dose" with "Reduce dose by 10% to 20% depending on severity of BG reduction". For most persons with T2D taking insulin, glycemic targets are stated as "A1C < 7% and fasting and premeal blood glucose < 110 mg/dL, in the absence of hypoglycemia".

### Use of V-goInsulin delivery device in patients with sub-optimally controlled diabetes mellitus: a retrospective analysis from a large specialized diabetes system [^7fab5606]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Data Collection

Clinical and demographic data were extracted from the EMR at baseline and for all subsequent office visits when an HbA1c value was captured and the patient remained on V-Go. Clinical data extracted included HbA1c values, fasting plasma glucose levels, prescribed and patient reported insulin use, body weight, concomitant anti-hyperglycemic medications, and patient-reported hypoglycemic events. It is common to prescribe insulin dosing as a range, with a lower limit representing the primary dose excluding titration and correction, and the upper limit allowing additional units to optimize insulin therapy (titration, correction, sliding scale). Both the lower and upper limits of the prescribed baseline insulin use were collected in the study. Patient-reported insulin dosing was also captured when available for comparison to actual prescribed doses.

Concomitant anti-hyperglycemic medications were recorded at baseline and at each follow-up visit. Patients were categorized as having an increase, decrease or no change to baseline concomitant medications at the follow-up visit. An addition or removal of a medication, as well as a change in dose with a proven difference in efficacy over the previous dose qualified as a change in concomitant medications. The time course of the change in medications relative to the follow-up visit was also reviewed during the data collection process to assess whether adequate time had elapsed for any therapeutic benefit of the medication change to take effect. It was confirmed that in 90% of patients categorized as having a change in concomitant medications, at least 2 months had elapsed from the time of the change to the time of the follow-up HbA1c value, so any impact of the concomitant medication change would be reflected in the follow-up HbA1c value.

The principal investigator oversaw review of subject records to determine study eligibility, and data collection. Records from all sites were reviewed via the EMR database in Plano, Texas. Clinical results on V-Go were collected through March 31, 2015 for inclusion in the current study analysis.

### Gestational diabetes mellitus: update on screening, diagnosis, and management [^3e73cc50]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common condition of pregnancy with increasing prevalence in the United States. GDM increases risks of complications, including operative delivery, hypertensive disorders, shoulder dystocia, fetal macrosomia, large-for-gestational-age infants, neonatal hypoglycemia, and neonatal respiratory distress. In patients who are overweight or obese, prepregnancy weight loss and lifestyle modifications during pregnancy may prevent GDM. First-trimester screening can identify preexisting diabetes and early-onset GDM for prompt implementation of glucose control measures. Treatment of GDM has been shown to reduce the risk of complications and should start with lifestyle modifications. For patients who are unable to maintain euglycemia with lifestyle modifications alone, insulin is the recommended first-line medication. For patients with poor glucose control or who require medications, fetal surveillance is suggested starting at 32 weeks of gestation. For all patients with GDM, physicians should assess for fetal macrosomia (estimated fetal weight more than 4,000 g) and discuss the risks and benefits of prelabor cesarean delivery if the estimated fetal weight is more than 4,500 g. Delivery during the 39th week of gestation may provide the best balance of maternal and fetal outcomes. The recommended delivery range for patients controlling their glucose levels with lifestyle modifications alone is 39/0 to 40/6 weeks of gestation, and the ideal range for those controlling glucose levels with medications is 39/0 to 39/6 weeks of gestation. Practice patterns vary, but evidence suggests that glucose management during labor can safely include decreased glucose testing and sliding-scale dosing of insulin as an alternative to a continuous intravenous drip. Insulin resistance typically resolves after delivery; however, patients with GDM have an increased risk of developing overt diabetes. Continued lifestyle modifications, breastfeeding, and use of metformin can reduce this risk.

### Randomized study of basal-bolus insulin therapy in the inpatient management of patients with type 2 diabetes (RABBIT 2 trial) [^db71bef3]. Diabetes Care (2007). Low credibility.

The study RABBIT 2 was published by Umpierrez GE and colleagues in 2007 in the journal Diabetes Care. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2 and In-hospital hyperglycemia. In the RABBIT 2 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of basal-bolus insulin therapy in the management of non-critically ill, hospitalized patients with T2DM? In the RABBIT 2 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the RABBIT 2 study, the population was: 130 patients (67 female, 63 male). The inclusion criteria were non-critically ill, hospitalized patients with T2DM who are insulin-naive. The key exclusion criteria were without a known history of diabetes, ICU patients, the use of corticosteroid therapy, expected to undergo surgery during the hospitalization course, clinically relevant hepatic disease, serum creatinine ≥ 3.0 mg/dl, or pregnancy. In the RABBIT 2 study, the interventions were: n = 65 use of a basal-bolus insulin regimen (glargine once daily and glulisine before meals at a starting dose of 0.4 units x kg(-1) x day(-1) for blood glucose 140–200 mg/dl or 0.5 units x kg(-1) x day(-1) for blood glucose 201–400 mg/dl) n = 65 use of a standard sliding-scale insulin protocol (sliding-scale regular insulin four times per day for blood glucose > 140 mg/dL). In the RABBIT 2 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving mean glucose target of < 140 mg/dL (66% vs. 38%; RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.06). In the RABBIT 2 study, the conclusion was: in non-critically ill, hospitalized patients with T2DM who are insulin-naive, use of a basal-bolus insulin regimen were superior to use of a standard sliding-scale insulin protocol with respect to the percentage of patients achieving mean glucose target of < 140 mg/dL.

### When basal insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus is not enough – what next? [^3c857c1d]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive disease characterized by co-existing insulin deficiency (relative) and insulin insensitivity. Both fasting and post-prandial blood glucose are elevated, exposing the patient to acute and chronic complications due to micro- and macro-vascular angiopathy. Improving glycaemic control has been demonstrated to lower the risk of these complications. Owing to the progressive nature of the disease, an evolving treatment strategy is necessary to maintain glycaemic control. Insulin therapy is required when dietary and lifestyle modifications combined with oral hypoglycaemic agents fail to provide adequate glycaemic control. Adding an optimized dose of basal insulin to the existing oral therapy is a simple and widely used method for initiating insulin therapy. However, despite an effective control of fasting hyperglycaemia, further intervention to control post-prandial hyperglycaemia may become necessary to achieve HbA1c targets. Strategies for the addition of prandial insulin include administering short-acting (or rapid-acting) insulin analogues before each meal or twice-daily administration of pre-mixed insulin. As a single large meal often contributes to the greatest part of daytime hyperglycaemia, an alternative strategy is emerging with the addition of a single injection of prandial insulin prior to the meal that induces the largest post-prandial blood glucose excursion measured 2 h after the start of the meal. Over time, additional prandial boluses of insulin may be required to sustain daytime glycaemic control. This strategy offers a simple, stepwise approach to progress from basal insulin to a basal-bolus regimen. Studies are needed to validate this method and better define specific titration tactics.

The ADA/EASD goal starts at an HbA1c of 7% or less, then suggests lower goals can be selected for patients in whom this can be achieved safely, without significant hypoglycaemia or other adverse effects. The recommendation aligns with the data presented herein, that use of medications which do not lead to hypoglycaemia is a hallmark of being able to achieve low HbA1c targets safely. Further, characteristics pointing toward achieving a benefit from tight control include younger age with long life expectancy and achieving that control without hypoglycaemia. Conversely, short life expectancy, frailty, advanced complications and poorly tolerating therapy point toward needing a more conservative patient‐specific HbA1c goal (e.g. < 8%). Advanced complications are important for two key reasons: patients such as these may have more difficulty safely managing medications and patients with extensive complications, including microvascular complications, have experienced the outcome tighter glycemic control would have attempted to prevent.

### Efficacy and safety of insulin degludec for hyperglycemia management in noncritical hospitalized patients with diabetes: an observational study [^f7c54c8f]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyperglycemia management is a common, serious, and costly health care problem in hospitalized patients. Hyperglycemia is associated with a prolonged hospital stay, infection, disability after discharge, and death. Hypoglycemia and glycemic variability due to suboptimal management of insulin therapy in the inpatient setting have been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and overall costs of care. The incidence of hypoglycemia peaks between midnight and 6 a.m. and is very often due to a lack of basal insulin dose adjustment. To improve outcomes, sliding scale insulin (SSI) should be abandoned in favor of inpatient diabetes management programs involving effective and well-tolerated basal-bolus insulin regimens.

Insulin degludec (IDeg) is a new basal insulin that is ultralong-acting; it improves glycemic control to a similar degree to insulin glargine but confers lower risks of overall and nocturnal hypoglycemia. In fact, the day-to-day variability in the glucose-lowering effect of IDeg is less than that for glargine, so the effect of IDeg is more predictable. Furthermore, IDeg allows flexibility in the timing of dose administration provided there is a minimum of 8 h between injections. The safe, predictable, and flexible profile of IDeg may be an advantage in the management of diabetic inpatients and for increasing the therapy compliance of insulin-treated patients after discharge.

The GesTIO protocol — a subcutaneous insulin order set for the management of a basal-bolus-correction insulin regimen in inpatients — was developed by a multidisciplinary team of diabetologists, internal medicine, and geriatrics specialist physicians from DIMED at Padua University. It is based on the ADA guidelines and Trence's insulin order form. The safety, efficacy, and benefit of clinical management with the GesTIO protocol have previously been documented with basal insulins other than IDeg. This is the first report of the impact of the GestTIO protocol when IDeg is used as basal insulin.

Prandial insulin titration and monitoring: Goal premeal glucose targets are 110 to 140 mg/dL, and prandial insulin should be titrated every 2 to 3 days based on the premeal glucose of the meal until glycemic targets are met; use of CGM is recommended to reach glycemic goals safely.
