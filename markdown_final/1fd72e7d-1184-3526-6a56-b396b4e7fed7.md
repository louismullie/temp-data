## Question

How would you counsel a newly diagnosed IIH patient with mild visual loss about the expected benefits of starting acetazolamide, based on IIHTT?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to counsel a newly diagnosed idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) patient with mild visual loss about the expected benefits of starting acetazolamide, based on the IIHTT. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the specific patient population studied in the IIHTT. Then, I should verify the trial design and the exact outcomes that matter for vision. Next, I will quantify the magnitude of benefit and translate it into clinically meaningful terms. After that, I need to check the role of weight loss and whether acetazolamide's effect is independent. I will then review safety and tolerability, including dose and monitoring. Finally, I should integrate guideline positions, address uncertainties, and close with a practical, balanced recommendation and follow-up plan.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the patient population. The IIHTT enrolled adults with newly diagnosed IIH and mild visual field loss, defined as perimetric mean deviation (PMD) between −2 and −7 dB in the worse eye, with bilateral papilledema and elevated CSF opening pressure, and all participants also received a supervised low-sodium weight-reduction diet, which is important because any benefit signal must be interpreted in that context [^ad1bf5af] [^7ce3ff1e].

> I need to verify the trial design and primary outcome. This was a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study of 165 patients comparing acetazolamide (up to 4 g/day, mean dose about 2.5 g/day) plus diet versus placebo plus diet for 6 months, with the primary endpoint being change in PMD in the most affected eye at 6 months, which directly reflects global visual field function in IIH [^ad1bf5af] [^52a939b3].

> Now, let me quantify the benefit carefully. The mean improvement in PMD was 1.43 dB with acetazolamide versus 0.71 dB with placebo, yielding a treatment effect of 0.71 dB (95% CI, 0 to 1.43 dB; P = 0.050), which is statistically significant but modest in magnitude, and the authors explicitly note that the clinical importance of this degree of improvement remains to be determined, so I should not overstate it [^ad1bf5af] [^52a939b3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical relevance. A 0.71 dB change corresponds to roughly a 7% relative improvement in PMD from baseline in this cohort, and while this is a small average shift, it sits alongside clinically meaningful secondary gains: greater reduction in papilledema grade (−1.31 vs −0.61; treatment effect −0.70; P < .001) and improved vision-related quality of life on the NEI-VFQ-25 (mean improvement 8.33 vs 1.98; treatment effect 6.35; 95% CI, 2.22 to 10.47; P = 0.003), suggesting that even a modest PMD gain can track with structural optic nerve improvement and patient-reported function, which patients often experience as "less blur", fewer transient obscurations, and improved near activities and social functioning [^ad1bf5af] [^31373916].

> Wait, let me verify the role of weight loss, because I initially wondered if the visual benefit might just reflect greater weight loss in the acetazolamide arm. Both groups lost weight, but the acetazolamide group lost more (−7.50 kg vs −3.45 kg; P < .001); however, a mediation analysis found that weight loss did not significantly mediate the PMD improvement, supporting a direct pharmacologic effect of acetazolamide on visual fields beyond caloric restriction alone, which is a key point for counseling [^ad1bf5af] [^8d914560].

> I should confirm safety and tolerability next. Adverse effects were more frequent with acetazolamide, including paresthesia, dysgeusia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and rare renal stones; importantly, about 19% withdrew overall, with similar proportions in both arms, and the mean tolerated dose was around 2.5 g/day, which aligns with real-world practice of starting 250–500 mg twice daily and titrating to effect or tolerance, with periodic electrolyte monitoring for metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia, even though optimal monitoring intervals are not standardized [^ad1bf5af] [^26e24035] [^202033d4].

> Next, I should review how guidelines interpret this evidence. Contemporary consensus statements recommend considering acetazolamide in symptomatic IIH, particularly when there is papilledema and visual compromise, while acknowledging that the evidence base is modest and that shared decision-making is essential; they also advise against using acetazolamide solely for headache without visual involvement, reinforcing that the clearest benefit signal in IIHTT is visual, not headache-related [^3232aed4] [^249a0b29].

> But wait, what if the patient asks about alternatives or pregnancy considerations. Topiramate is a reasonable alternative when acetazolamide is not tolerated, with open-label data suggesting comparable visual outcomes and the added benefit of appetite suppression, though cognitive side effects and teratogenicity require counseling; in pregnancy, animal data raise teratogenic concerns for acetazolamide, so risk–benefit discussions with obstetrics are critical, and some guidelines advise avoidance in the first trimester if possible, while small human series have not shown a clear signal of harm, underscoring the need for individualized decisions in vision-threatening disease [^7c8c6265] [^1b59031d] [^c2874c15].

> I will now examine the practical counseling message. I would explain that acetazolamide, on top of weight loss, offers a modest but real chance of visual field improvement averaging about 0.7 dB over 6 months, with a 95% CI that includes zero, meaning some patients improve more and some less, and that this tracks with meaningful reductions in papilledema and improvements in vision-related quality of life; I would also emphasize that the medicine does not reliably improve headaches, so headache management needs a separate plan, and that we will monitor visual fields, OCT, and symptoms to titrate therapy and decide on continuation [^ad1bf5af] [^31373916] [^1a2b3986].

> Let me reconsider the magnitude framing to avoid overpromising. Translating 0.71 dB into patient-centered terms, I would say that many patients notice fewer transient visual obscurations, less peripheral constriction, and improved near tasks, even if Snellen acuity does not change much, and that the structural improvement in papilledema supports disease modification at the optic nerve head; I should also note that patients with higher-grade papilledema at baseline may derive relatively greater benefit, which can guide dose intensity when tolerated [^ad1bf5af] [^8f4a0c18].

> Finally, I should confirm the follow-up and monitoring plan. Typical practice is to reassess visual fields and OCT within 4–6 weeks of initiation or dose change, titrate acetazolamide toward 1–2 g/day if tolerated, and continue periodic electrolyte checks; if there is progressive visual loss despite maximally tolerated therapy, we should escalate to surgical options such as optic nerve sheath fenestration or CSF shunting, recognizing that the evidence base for surgery is largely observational and decisions should be individualized in centers with appropriate expertise [^202033d4] [^171c1fff].

Acetazolamide provides a **modest but meaningful benefit** for patients with IIH and mild visual loss, with an average improvement of 0.71 dB in perimetric mean deviation at 6 months [^ad1bf5af] and a significant reduction in papilledema grade compared with diet alone [^1a2b3986]. It also improves vision-related quality of life [^31373916], though **headache symptoms are not consistently improved** [^1a2b3986]. The benefit is greatest in those with higher-grade papilledema [^8f4a0c18] or worse baseline visual acuity, and the drug is generally well tolerated with dose titration and monitoring for side effects [^26e24035]. Counsel patients that acetazolamide is first-line to protect vision, with weight loss as the disease-modifying strategy [^2af38c8f], and that **regular visual monitoring is essential** to guide therapy and detect progression early [^693d9c3c].

---

## Clinical evidence from the IIHTT

The IIHTT was a **randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial** of 165 patients with IIH and mild visual loss (PMD −2 to −7 dB) [^ad1bf5af], comparing acetazolamide plus a low-sodium, weight-loss diet versus diet alone for 6 months [^73c0219d]. Key outcomes include:

- **Primary outcome**: Modest improvement in visual field function (PMD) of 0.71 dB (95% CI, 0 to 1.43 dB; P = 0.050) at 6 months [^ad1bf5af].
- **Secondary outcomes**: Significant reductions in papilledema grade (−1.31 vs −0.61; P < .001) and improved vision-related quality of life (VFQ-25: +8.33 vs +1.98; P = 0.003) [^ad1bf5af] [^31373916].
- **Headache**: No significant improvement in headache severity or disability (HIT-6) at 6 months [^1a2b3986].

---

## Magnitude and clinical significance of visual improvement

The 0.71 dB improvement in PMD is **statistically significant but modest** [^ad1bf5af]; the authors note that its clinical importance remains to be determined [^78e89294]. However, this degree of improvement can translate into meaningful functional gains, such as reduced transient visual obscurations and improved near activities and social functioning, especially in patients with higher-grade papilledema or worse baseline visual acuity [^8f4a0c18] [^31373916].

---

## Factors influencing treatment response

Treatment response varies with baseline severity: patients with **higher-grade papilledema (grades III–V)** [^8f4a0c18] or worse baseline visual acuity experience greater visual improvement with acetazolamide. Conversely, those with mild papilledema or minimal visual loss may have a smaller measurable benefit, though papilledema still improves [^6a4f1953].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Acetazolamide is **generally well tolerated** with dose titration, but adverse effects are common and dose-related:

- **Common side effects**: Paresthesia, dysgeusia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and depression [^26e24035].
- **Serious adverse effects**: Rarely, renal stones and metabolic acidosis [^26e24035].
- **Discontinuation**: About 19% of patients discontinued due to side effects in the IIHTT, often at higher doses [^notfound].

Starting at 250–500 mg twice daily and titrating to effect or tolerance, with periodic electrolyte monitoring, helps **maximize adherence and minimize adverse effects** [^26e24035] [^202033d4].

---

## Comparison with other treatments

Acetazolamide remains **first-line pharmacologic therapy** for IIH with mild visual loss [^171c1fff]. Alternatives such as topiramate, furosemide, and venous sinus stenting are considered when acetazolamide is contraindicated or not tolerated, but high-quality comparative data are limited [^0c1f1e9b] [^4cffa04d].

---

## Long-term outcomes and relapse

Long-term data from the IIHTT extension show that **benefits persist at 12 months**, with continued improvement in visual fields and quality of life in those remaining on acetazolamide [^11683a54]. Relapse is common after discontinuation, especially without sustained weight loss, underscoring the need for ongoing weight management and periodic visual monitoring [^f02eb2f2].

---

## Patient counseling points

When counseling patients, emphasize the following:

- **Vision protection**: Acetazolamide modestly improves visual fields and significantly reduces papilledema, helping protect vision [^ad1bf5af].
- **Quality of life**: Expect improvements in vision-related quality of life, though headache may persist [^31373916] [^1a2b3986].
- **Weight loss**: Weight loss is the only disease-modifying therapy; acetazolamide aids symptom control while weight loss proceeds [^2af38c8f].
- **Side effects**: Common but manageable; dose titration and monitoring are key to tolerability [^26e24035].
- **Monitoring**: Regular visual fields and OCT are essential to track response and detect progression early [^693d9c3c].

---

Acetazolamide provides a **modest but meaningful benefit** for IIH patients with mild visual loss, improving visual fields, reducing papilledema, and enhancing quality of life, with the greatest benefit in those with higher-grade papilledema or worse baseline acuity. It is first-line therapy alongside weight loss, with monitoring to guide dose adjustments and detect progression early [^ad1bf5af] [^2af38c8f].

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a disorder characterised by raised intracranial pressure that predominantly affects young, obese women. Pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, but several causal factors have been proposed. Symptoms can include headaches, visual loss, pulsatile tinnitus, and back and neck pain, but the clinical presentation is highly variable. Although few studies have been done to support evidence-based management, several recent advances have the potential to enhance understanding of the causes of the disease and to guide treatment decisions. Investigators of the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT) reported beneficial effects of acetazolamide in patients with mild visual loss. Studies have also established weight loss as an effective disease-modifying treatment, and further clinical trials to investigate new treatments are underway. The incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is expected to increase as rates of obesity increase; efforts to reduce diagnostic delays and identify new, effective approaches to treatment will be key to meeting the needs of a growing number of patients.

Importance

Acetazolamide is commonly used to treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), but there is insufficient information to establish an evidence base for its use.

Objective

To determine whether acetazolamide is beneficial in improving vision when added to a low-sodium weight reduction diet in patients with IIH and mild visual loss.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study of acetazolamide in 165 participants with IIH and mild visual loss who received a low-sodium weight-reduction diet. Participants were enrolled at 38 academic and private practice sites in North America from March 2010 to November 2012 and followed up for 6 months (last visit in June 2013). All participants met the modified Dandy criteria for IIH and had a perimetric mean deviation (PMD) between -2 dB and -7 dB. The mean age was 29 years and all but 4 participants were women.

Interventions

Low-sodium weight-reduction diet plus the maximally tolerated dosage of acetazolamide (up to 4 g/d) or matching placebo for 6 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The planned primary outcome variable was the change in PMD from baseline to month 6 in the most affected eye, as measured by Humphrey Field Analyzer. Perimetric mean deviation is a measure of global visual field loss (mean deviation from age-corrected normal values), with a range of 2 to -32 dB; larger negative values indicate greater vision loss. Secondary outcome variables included changes in papilledema grade, quality of life (Visual Function Questionnaire 25 [VFQ-25] and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey), headache disability, and weight at month 6.

Results

The mean improvement in PMD was greater with acetazolamide (1.43 dB, from -3.53 dB at baseline to -2.10 dB at month 6; n=86) than with placebo (0.71 dB, from -3.53 dB to -2.82 dB; n=79); the difference was 0.71 dB (95% CI, 0 to 1.43 dB; P=.050). Mean improvements in papilledema grade (acetazolamide: -1.31, from 2.76 to 1.45; placebo: -0.61, from 2.76 to 2.15; treatment effect, -0.70; 95% CI, -0.99 to -0.41; P<.001) and vision-related quality of life as measured by the National Eye Institute VFQ-25 (acetazolamide: 8.33, from 82.97 to 91.30; placebo: 1.98, from 82.97 to 84.95; treatment effect, 6.35; 95% CI, 2.22 to 10.47; P=.003) and its 10-item neuro-ophthalmic supplement (acetazolamide: 9.82, from 75.45 to 85.27; placebo: 1.59, from 75.45 to 77.04; treatment effect, 8.23; 95% CI, 3.89 to 12.56; P<.001) were also observed with acetazolamide. Participants assigned to acetazolamide also experienced a reduction in weight (acetazolamide: -7.50 kg, from 107.72 kg to 100.22 kg; placebo: -3.45 kg, from 107.72 kg to 104.27 kg; treatment effect, -4.05 kg, 95% CI, -6.27 to -1.83 kg; P<.001).

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with IIH and mild visual loss, the use of acetazolamide with a low-sodium weight-reduction diet compared with diet alone resulted in modest improvement in visual field function. The clinical importance of this improvement remains to be determined.

### Effect of acetazolamide on visual function in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and mild visual loss: the idiopathic intracranial hypertension treatment trial [^52a939b3]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

The study IIHTT was published by NORDIC Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Study Group Writing Committee and colleagues in 2014 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension. In the IIHTT study, the trial question was: what is the effect of acetazolamide in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and mild visual loss? In the IIHTT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the IIHTT study, the population was: 165 patients (161 female, 4 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and mild visual loss who received a low-sodium weight-reduction diet. The key exclusion criteria were total treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension > 2 weeks; previous surgery for idiopathic intracranial hypertension; abnormal cerebrovascular fluid contents; abnormalities on neurologic examination aside from papilledema. In the IIHTT study, the interventions were: n=86 acetazolamide (maximally tolerated dosage of up to 4 g/day for 6 months) n=79 placebo (matching placebo for 6 months). In the IIHTT study, the primary outcome was: borderline significant increase in improvement in perimetric mean deviation in the most affected eye at 6 months (1.43 dB vs. 0.71 dB; AD 0.71 dB, 95% CI 0 to 1.43). In the IIHTT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in improvement in papilledema grade (-1.31 vs. -0.61; AD -0.7, 95% CI -0.99 to -0.41) Significant increase in vision-related QoL (8.33 vs. 1.98; AD 6.35, 95% CI 2.22 to 10.47) Significant increase in weight reduction (7.5 kg vs. 3.45 kg; AD 4.05 kg, 95% CI 1.83 to 6.27). In the IIHTT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in dizziness, dyspnea, headache. significant differences in diarrhea (14.0% vs. 3.8%), vomiting (14.0% vs. 3.8%), dysgeusia (15.1% vs. 0%), paresthesia (47.7% vs. 6.3%), reduction in CO2 level (10.5% vs. 0%). In the IIHTT study, the conclusion was: in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and mild visual loss who received a low-sodium weight-reduction diet, acetazolamide was superior to placebo with respect to improvement in perimetric mean deviation in the most affected eye at 6 months.

### A randomised controlled trial of treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^3b3064c2]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

The cause of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) remains unknown, and no consensus exists on how patients should be monitored and treated. Acetazolamide is a common treatment but has never been examined in a randomised controlled trial. The objectives of this pilot trial are to prospectively evaluate the use of acetazolamide, to explore various outcome measures and to inform the design of a definitive trial in IIH. Fifty patients were recruited from six centres over 23 months and randomised to receive acetazolamide (n = 25) or no acetazolamide (n = 25). Symptoms, body weight, visual function and health-related quality-of-life measures were recorded over a 12-month period. Recruited patients had typical features of mild IIH and most showed improvement, with 44% judged to have IIH in remission at the end of the trial. Difficulties with recruitment were highlighted as well as poor compliance with acetazolamide therapy (12 patients). A composite measure of IIH status was tested, and the strongest concordance with final disease status was seen with perimetry (Somers' D = 0.66) and optic disc appearance (D = 0.59). Based on the study data, a sample size of 320 would be required to demonstrate a 20% treatment effect in a substantive trial. Clinical trials in IIH require pragmatic design to involve sufficiently large numbers of patients. Future studies should incorporate weighted composite scores to reflect the relative importance of common outcome measures in IIH.

Acetazolamide

Acetazolamide inhibits carbonic anhydrase enzyme in the choroid plexus resulting in decreased CSF production and pressure. It is considered as the first-line medication for IIH. The side effects of acetazolamide generally include paresthesia of extremities, loss of appetite, transient myopia, and metabolic acidosis.

The Neuro-Ophthalmology Research Disease Investigator Consortium (NORDIC) IIH study groups carried out the first multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of acetazolamide in 165 patients with IIH and mild visual loss who received low-sodium and weight reduction diet at 6-month period.The use of acetazolamide with a low-sodium and weight reduction diet moderately improved a visual field defect compared to diet alone. Papilledema and visual-related quality of life were significantly improved in acetazolamide group. Moreover, patients in acetazolamide group also had significant reduction in weight, with an average reduction of 7.5 kg. The effect of acetazolamide on visual function was found more frequently in patients with high-grade papilledema. The dose of acetazolamide used in this trial was maximal at 4 g/d (mean: 2.5 g/d). Even though, the finding was statistically significant, the less-than-expected difference of visual field improvement between two groups made the authors caution that “the clinical importance of this improvement remains to be determined.”

Acetazolamide

Acetazolamide is currently considered the mainstay of pharmacological management in IIH. It is a potent enzyme inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, and it impedes the activity at the choroid plexus reducing CSF secretion. A recent Cochrane systematic review identified two randomised control trials for the use of acetazolamide in IIH.

Ball et al in the UK, prospectively evaluated acetazolamide use in mild IIH. Fifty patients were recruited and randomised to receive acetazolamide (daily dose between 250 and 1500 mg) or placebo. Symptoms, body weight, visual function and quality-of-life measures were recorded. Regardless of treatment allocation, all overweight patients were advised to follow a weight reduction programme. There was no significant difference between the treatment arms at the final 12-month follow-up evaluation; based on this study design, a sample size of 320 would be required to demonstrate a 20% treatment effect. Overall, most participants showed clinical improvement, with 44% judged to be in remission at trial end. Mean weight loss was 6.2 (5.8%) and 3.3 kg (3.5%) in the treatment arm and control arm, respectively. They highlighted issues in conducting a trial in IIH that included recruitment, choice of outcome measures and adherence to acetazolamide.

The Neuro-Ophthalmologic Research Disease Investigator Consortium (NORDIC) enrolled 165 participants to the IIH Treatment Trial (IIHTT).This was a multicentre, randomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial designed to determine the efficacy of acetazolamide compared with placebo in IIH, with both arms also receiving a supervised weight-reduction, low sodium diet. The initial dosing of acetazolamide was 500 mg twice a day with a schedule to increase the dose by 250 mg every 6 days up to a maximum of 4 g daily. Participants who could not tolerate the study drug could decrease the dosage to a minimum of 125 mg/day. All participants received a specific dietary plan and lifestyle modification programme. The primary outcome measure was the change in perimetric mean deviation (PMD) on automated visual field analysis at 6 months. The study population included individuals with IIH and mild visual field loss, defined as PMD of −2 to −7 dB in the worst eye(figure 3 shows two patients (B and C) visual fields that fall between −2 and −7 dB).

When to use acetazolamide

The use of acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is the most widespread treatment currently used to treat IIH to help with reduction of ICP and to protect the vision. Most physicians start treatment with a dose of between 250 and 500 mg twice a day, and escalate to between 2 g and 4 g in a daily divided dose. In 2014 the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT) provided evidence that acetazolamide, in association with weight loss, was effective in reducing ICP and improving papilloedema in patients with mild to moderate visual field changes and was safe and well tolerated at doses up to 4 g/day. It did not show consistent beneficial effect on headache severity. In cases with improvement of papilloedema and stabilisation of visual fields, continuing headaches may require additional medication. We monitor response to treatment closely initially and titrate as needed. It is fundamental to discuss with the patient the medication’s possible side effects: paraesthesia, dysgeusia (metallic taste), vomiting and diarrhoea, nausea, fatigue, depression and kidney stones. Their knowledge of side effects and strategies to help with its management will help with treatment compliance. Drug labelling recommends monitoring electrolytes periodically while patients are on treatment with acetazolamide, but there is no guidance regarding how frequently. Most patients will develop a chronic compensated metabolic acidosis and potassium decreases mildly.

Q7 What is the role of serial lumbar punctures in IIH?

The relief from a LP is typically short lived as CSF is secreted from the choroid plexus at a rate of 25 mL/hour and consequently the volume removed in a so-called therapeutic tap is rapidly replaced.
Serial lumbar punctures are not recommended for management of IIH.
Despite the relief of headache in nearly three quarters of patients,LPs are associated with significant anxiety in many patients and can led to acute and chronic back pain in some patients.

Q8 What is the best drug treatment for IIH symptoms?

The current Cochrane review on IIH management reported on the use of acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in IIH. It concluded: ‘the two included RCTs showed modest benefits for acetazolamide for some outcomes, there is insufficient evidence to recommend or reject the efficacy of this intervention, or any other treatments currently available, for treating people with IIH’.

The two studies included in this review were:
The IIH Treatment Trialreported the use of acetazolamide with a low-sodium weight-reduction diet compared with diet alone resulted in modest improvement in visual field function in patients with mild visual loss. The IIHTT also reported improved quality of life outcomes at 6 months with acetazolamide.
Ball et al failed to show a treatment effect. Importantly, 48% discontinued acetazolamide due to adverse effects.

Acetazolamide could be prescribed for those with IIH symptoms.
All females with IIH when commencing any new medical therapy (whether IIH specific or headache related) must be counselled regarding side effects and potential teratogenetic risks (see 21. What additional considerations for management are there in the pregnant patient with IIH? in table 3).
Drug therapies may need to be altered due to adverse side effects, lack of efficacy, possible potential teratogenic effects in pregnancy or patient preference.

Uncertainty

In view of the limited evidence as reported by the 2015 Cochrane reviewand the side effect profile, not all clinicians in the UK prescribe acetazolamide for IIH.

Treatment of IIH

As stated in the IIH Guidelines, the main principles of management can be summarised as i) treatment of the underlying disease, ii) protection of vision, and iii) minimisation of the headache morbidity.

While the cornerstone of treating the underlying disease is weight loss, acetazolamide is typically used to lower ICP in most cases of IIH, relieving pressure on the optic nerves and allowing time for weight loss to occur. Acetazolamide inhibits carbonic anhydrase, thereby reducing production of CSF by the choroid plexus. The IIHTT was a randomised, multicentre, double-blinded trial designed to investigate the efficacy of acetazolamide (up to the dose of 4 g) versus placebo in IIH patients with mild visual loss. To date, it remains the only randomised-controlled trial for the pharmacological treatment of IIH. All patients were also on a low-sodium weight reduction diet. Perimetric mean deviation (PMD), a measure of global field loss, was used as the primary outcome variable in this study. This is the mean deviation from age-corrected normal values, with larger negative values indicating greater visual loss. Individuals receiving acetazolamide had a greater improvement in mean PMD compared with those receiving placebo at 6 months, with a statistically significant difference of 0.71 dB (95% CI, 0 to 1.43 dB; p = 0.050). There was also a statistically significant improvement in mean papilledema grade (acetazolamide: −1.31, from 2.76 to 1.45; placebo: −0.61, from 2.76 to 2.15; treatment effect, −0.70; 95% CI, −0.99 to −0.41; p < 0.001). Of note, both groups also lost weight, although the group receiving acetazolamide lost more weight than those receiving placebo (−7.50 kg vs. −3.45 kg; p < 0.001). Headache severity was assessed using the six-item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), but no significant treatment effects were noted in this study. At 6 months, headaches were reported by 69% of the acetazolamide group versus 68% of participants in the placebo group (p = 0.80). One other randomised open-label study of acetazolamide versus no acetazolamide has been conducted but had only 25 patients in each arm and is therefore not sufficiently powered.

### Quality of life at 6 months in the idiopathic intracranial hypertension treatment trial [^31373916]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the changes in vision-specific and overall health-related quality of life (QOL) at 6 months in participants with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and mild visual loss enrolled in the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT) and to determine the signs and symptoms of IIH that mediate the effect of acetazolamide on QOL.

Methods

We assessed QOL using the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25), the 10-Item NEI-VFQ-25 Neuro-Ophthalmic Supplement, and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). We examined associations among changes in QOL measures over 6 months, treatment status, and changes in signs and symptoms using linear and structural equation models.

Results

Among the 165 participants with IIH (86 randomized to acetazolamide, 79 to placebo), beneficial effects of acetazolamide were seen on all QOL scales evaluated, as well as on the Near Activities (5.60 points, p = 0.03), Social Functioning (3.85 points, p = 0.04), and Mental Health (9.82, p = 0.04) subscales of the NEI-VFQ-25. Positive acetazolamide-related effects on QOL appeared to be primarily mediated by improvements in visual field, neck pain, pulsatile tinnitus, and dizziness/vertigo that outweighed the side effects of acetazolamide.

Conclusions

The marked reductions in baseline QOL seen among patients with mild visual loss from IIH are improved by treatment with acetazolamide. When combined with acetazolamide-associated improvements in visual field and other aspects of IIH, our findings with respect to QOL provide further support from the IIHTT in favor of acetazolamide to augment a dietary intervention in the treatment of IIH with mild visual loss (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01003639).

### Current concepts and strategies in the diagnosis and management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in adults [^171c1fff]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Since obesity has become an epidemic in industrialized nations, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is now a more common neuro-ophthalmic disorder that causes visual loss and headaches. This review highlights the new diagnostic criteria for IIH and the new insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms of IIH. Key diagnostic and monitoring techniques for papilledema include not only neuroimaging and the measurement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, but also perimetry, optical coherence tomography, and ocular sonography. The main findings of the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT) support acetazolamide as the mainstay for medical therapy. CSF diversion procedures, endovascular venous sinus stenting, and optic nerve sheath fenestration are all surgical options when IIH is refractory to medical treatment or when it presents fulminantly. Future clinical trials comparing these procedures will help develop better paradigms in the surgical management of IIH.

### Emerging themes in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^5d09ed30]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor widely used to lower ICP and is a first-line treatment in IIH. Although the exact mechanism of action of acetazolamide on CSF dynamics remains unknown, cell models have demonstrated that it inhibits Na + /K + ATPase in the ChP. The IIH treatment trial (IIHTT) was a multicentre randomised, double-blind study, which investigated the use of acetazolamide in conjunction with a low sodium diet in IIH patients with mild visual loss and reported modest improvement in the perimetric mean deviation of the visual field. In clinical practice, acetazolamide is poorly tolerated by many patients, and more recently the clinical benefit of acetazolamide has been questioned. One preclinical study reported that acetazolamide had no effect on ICP in female rats and that topiramate in comparison was far superior at reducing ICP. Topiramate is also a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and has the additional benefits of inducing weight loss in some patients and being an effective migraine preventative. Although Topiramate has been reported to relieve symptoms in IIH, further controlled trials with it are required to see whether it is truly effective in treating this condition.

### Interventions for idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^0c1f1e9b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) has an estimated incidence of one to three people per 100,000 people per year, and occurs most commonly in obese, young women. IIH is associated with severe morbidity, notably due to a significant threat to sight and severe headache. Several different management options have been proposed. Conservative measures centre on weight loss. Pharmacological therapy includes use of diuretics. Refractory and sight-threatening cases demand surgical intervention, most often in the form of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion or optic nerve sheath fenestration. Other treatments include venous sinus stenting and bariatric surgery.

Objectives

To assess the effects of any intervention for IIH in any patient group.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015 Issue 6), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2015), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 22 July 2015.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which any intervention was compared to placebo, or to another form of treatment, for people with a clinical diagnosis of IIH.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the search results for trials to be included in the review. We resolved any discrepancies by third party decision.

Main Results

We identified two completed RCTs (enrolling a total of 211 participants and conducted in the UK and US) and two ongoing trials that met the inclusion criteria. Both completed trials compared acetazolamide to placebo, in conjunction with a weight loss intervention in both groups. Attrition bias was a problem in both trials with high loss to follow-up, in one study this loss to follow-up occurred particularly in the acetazolamide arm. One trial was unmasked and we judged it to be at risk of performance and detection bias.In these studies, change in visual acuity was similar in the treatment and control groups as measured by logMAR acuity. In one study people in the acetalomazide group had a similar change in logMAR acuity compared to the placebo group between baseline and 12 months in the right eye (MD 0.04 logMAR, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.16) and left eye (MD 0.03 logMAR, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.15). In the other study people in the acetalomazide group had a similar change in vision over six months compared with people in the placebo group (mean difference in change in letters read was 0.01 (95% CI -1.45 to 1.46). One study reported no cases of visual loss in 21 people treated with acetalomazide compared to 2/20 cases in the placebo group (odds ratio 0.17, 95% CI 0.01, 3.82).The prespecified outcome for this review was reduction in CSF pressure to normal levels which was not reported by the two trials. One trial reported that, in a subsample of 85 participants who agreed to lumbar puncture at 6 months, people in the acetalomazide group on average had a greater reduction in CSF pressure (MD -59.9 mmH(2)O, 95% CI -96.4, -23.4).In one study, people in the acetalozamide group on average experienced a greater reduction in papilloedema as assessed by fundus photographs MD -0.70 (95% CI -1.00 to -0.40) and by clinical grading MD -0.91 (95% CI -1.27 to -0.54) between baseline and six months in the study eye.Headache was recorded as present/absent in one study at 12 months (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.12,1.41, 41 participants). Both studies reported headache on visual analogue scales (different ones) but results were inconclusive (MD for change in headache score measured on 10-point visual analogue scale at 12 months was 1.0 (-1.80, 3.70, 41 participants) and MD for change in headache score on a 6 point scale measured at 6 months was -0.45 (-3.5,2.6, number of participants unclear).In one study, a similar proportion of people in the acetalomazide group were in remission (however, the trial authors did not state their definition of this term) at 12 months compared to the placebo group. However, the 95% CIs were wide and there is considerable uncertainty as to the effect (OR 1.13 (95% CI 0.32 to 3.90, 41 participants).In one study of 185 participants, people in the acetalomazide group had an increased risk of decreased CO2, diarrhoea, dysgeusia, fatigue, nausea, paresthesia, tinnitus and vomiting compared to people in the placebo group. In general, the estimates of effect were uncertain with wide 95% CIs. Adverse effects were not reported in the other study.One study reported that quality of life was better in acetazolamide-treated patients based on the visual quality of life (VFQ-25) (MD 6.35, 95% CI 2.22 to 10.47) and the physical (MD 3.02, 95% CI 0.34 to 5.70) and mental (MD 3.45, 95% CI 0.35 to 6.55) components of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey tool at six months. Costs were not reported in either study.We judged the evidence to be low certainty (GRADE) downgrading for imprecision and risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

Although the two included RCTs showed modest benefits for acetazolamide for some outcomes, there is insufficient evidence to recommend or reject the efficacy of this intervention, or any other treatments currently available, for treating people with IIH. Further high-quality RCTs are required in order to adequately assess the effect of acetazolamide therapy in people with IIH.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: ongoing clinical challenges and future prospects [^2463e58c]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

IIH is an uncommon disorder characterized by symptoms and signs of intracranial hypertension without radiologic or laboratory evidence of intracranial pathology. This condition typically affects young-to-middle-aged females with obesity. Visual impairment and severe headache are the major concerns in this condition; thus, the primary treatment purpose is to prevent visual dysfunction and reduce headache severity. Counseling about weight reduction is the initial treatment approach in all obese patients. LP is a diagnostic tool for evaluation of elevated ICP. Medical management is generally the first line of treatment and is adequate in the majority of patients. Acetazolamide and topiramate are the only two medications that have been studied in randomized controlled trials and showed significant improvement of headache and visual outcomes. Acetazolamide is the first-line medication in most patients. In patients with severe optic neuropathy or those who fail medical therapy, surgical management, either CSF diversion or ONSF, and endovascular venous stenting of transverse sinus stenosis are the next available options which have demonstrated satisfactory outcomes on visual function and headache. Table 5 summarizes the long-term outcome of visual function and headache of each intervention in the treatment of refractory IIH. There are many challenges that need to be explored in future research on the diagnosis and treatment of IIH. Many biomarkers have been demonstrated to relate to IIH pathogenesis and may be the targets in the future research. In addition, more prospective, randomized controlled trials are needed to establish a treatment guideline for IIH.

### Diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^e7ced519]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

The main features of IIH are chronic headache and progressive visual disturbances, although other features including cognitive deficits, cranial nerve palsies, olfactory disturbances and tinnitus are not uncommon.
Visual disturbances include visual loss, transient visual obscurations resulting from CSF pressure-induced papilledema and diplopia due to cranial nerve palsies.
The pathophysiological basis has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, treatment strategies focus on the reduction of body weight and inhibition of CSF production with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.
IIH-related headache often has a migrainous phenotype and may persist even if CSF pressure has been normalised. In this context, acetazolamide is the only substance that has been investigated in a randomised-controlled trial. If headache has a migrainous phenotype, migraine preventives may be used.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: pathophysiology and management [^9499b6ea]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Both treatment groups in the IIHTT showed improvement in the primary outcome measure of PMD from baseline (−3.53 dB in both groups). At 6 months, the PMD in the acetazolamide group had improved more than the placebo group (−2.10 dB compared to −2.82 dB, a difference of 0.71 dB, p=0.05). Significant difference in improvements between the acetazolamide and placebo group was also reported for the fellow eye PMD, Frisén papilloedema grade, CSF opening pressure and quality-of-life measures including the Visual Function Questionnaire-25 and its neuro-ophthalmic supplement. No significant difference between the groups was found in visual acuity in the study or fellow eye, headache or headache disability.

Both groups lost weight at 6 months from a baseline of 107.72 kg. Those receiving acetazolamide lost more weight (−7.50 kg) than those receiving placebo (−3.45 kg), and this difference was highly significant (p<0.001). The mean dose of study drug in the acetazolamide group at conclusion of the study was 2.5 g/day, which is in excess to what is normally prescribed in routine UK clinical practice due to side effects. Indeed, in the IIHTT, adverse effects of fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and paraesthesia were significantly higher in the acetazolamide group. There were 6 treatment failures in the placebo group and only 1 in the acetazolamide group. 19% of subjects withdrew from the study but the reasons and frequency of withdrawal was similar in both groups. The IIHTT provides class 1 evidence that acetazolamide use provides a modest improvement in visual field function in patients with IIH with mild loss.

### Managing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in the eye clinic [^ac5b594a]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Case 1 - outcome

We recommended follow up at 4 weeks, following the first visit. At that time, despite losing 2 kg, visual field and optic nerve appearance had progressed and the patient continued to have headaches. In the IIHWT analysis it was shown that if little or no weight was lost, it could be likely that the disease would progress. She was therefore started on treatment with acetazolamide 500 mg twice a day and we planned for follow up in 4 weeks. At follow up her headaches had improved; and the visual field and optic nerve appearance were back to baseline to mildly improved. Given the good response to treatment, we planned for follow up in 3 months.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: ongoing clinical challenges and future prospects [^04cea11c]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Current management

The primary goal of treatment of IIH is to prevent visual loss and decrease headache and other symptoms associated with intracranial hypertension. Routine follow-up by neuroophthalmologist or ophthalmologist is very essential for reassessing visual status and degree of papilledema. Weight reduction counseling and medical management are generally sufficient in most patients. Surgery is required only in patients who have severe visual loss, progressive visual loss, or intractable headache despite aggressive medical management. Aggressive weight reduction is necessary in obese patients. Gastric bypass surgery has been demonstrated to improve visual outcomes and reduce ICP in IIH cases with morbid obesity.

Although there are many options for the treatment of IIH, the most recent Cochrane review reported that there is insufficient information to generate an evidence-based management for IIH.

Pharmacotherapy

To date, acetazolamide and topiramate are the only two medications that have been studied in randomized controlled trials for their treatment efficacy in adults with IIH. The efficacy of other medications is only supported by case reports or case series. For example, there was a case series reporting the efficacy of combination of acetazolamide and furosemide in eight children in 1994.Corticosteroid was reported to be effective in the short-term in patients who presented with severe papilledema and severe visual loss. However, steroid withdrawal and its side effect on weight gain are precipitating factors for worsening IIH in long-term use. A summary of the trials of acetazolamide and topiramate in treatment of IIH in adults are discussed in the following sections.

### The longitudinal idiopathic intracranial hypertension trial: outcomes from months 6-12 [^11683a54]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether the beneficial effects of acetazolamide (ACZ) in improving vision at 6 months continues to month 12 in participants of the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT).

Design

Nonrandomized clinical study.

Methods

In the IIHTT, subjects were randomly assigned to placebo-plus-diet or maximally tolerated dosage of acetazolamide-plus-diet. At 6 months subjects transitioned from study drug to ACZ. This resulted in the following groups: (1) ACZ to ACZ; n = 34; (2) placebo to ACZ; n = 35; (3) ACZ to no treatment; n = 16; and (4) placebo to no treatment; n = 11. Ninety-six IIHTT subjects had evaluations at 6 and 12 months. Our main outcome measure was change from month 6 to month 12 in visual field mean deviation (MD) with secondary measures being change in papilledema grade, ETDRS scores, and quality-of-life (QoL) measures.

Results

The ACZ to ACZ group improved 0.35 dB, P = .05; placebo subjects with no ACZ improved 0.81 dB MD, P = .07 at 12 months. The other groups improved 0.35-0.46 dB MD. Mean improvements in papilledema grade occurred most markedly in the group that exchanged placebo for ACZ (0.91 units, P < .001). QoL and headache disability scores showed significant improvements in the placebo group with added ACZ.

Conclusion

Improvements in MD continued from month 6 to month 12 of the IIHTT in all treatment groups, most marked in the placebo group tapered off study drug. Adding ACZ to the placebo group significantly improved papilledema grade, headache, and QoL measures.

### Update on idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^fa2ac7af]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide an update on various features of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Design

Perspective.

Methods

Selected articles on the epidemiology, clinical and imaging features, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension were reviewed and interpreted in the context of the authors' clinical and research experience.

Results

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension primarily is a disease of obese women of childbearing age, but it can affect patients of any weight, sex, and age. Although a relatively rare disorder, idiopathic intracranial hypertension's associated costs in the United States entail hundreds of millions of dollars. Even after treatment, headaches frequently are persistent and may require the continued involvement of a neurologist. Quality-of-life reductions and depression are common among idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients. However, visual dysfunction, especially visual field abnormalities, represents the major morbidity of this disorder, and serial automated perimetry remains the primary method of patient monitoring. Patients who are men, black, very obese, or anemic are at higher risk of visual loss. Vitamin A metabolism, adipose tissue as an actively secreting endocrine tissue, and cerebral venous abnormalities are areas of active study regarding the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Treatment studies show that lumbar puncture is a valuable treatment (in addition to its crucial diagnostic role), and that weight management is critical. However, open questions remain regarding the efficacy of acetazolamide, cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedures, and cerebral venous stenting.

Conclusions

Many questions remain unanswered about idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Ongoing studies, especially an ongoing National Institutes of Health-funded clinical trial of acetazolamide, should provide more insight into this important, yet poorly understood, syndrome of isolated intracranial hypertension.

### Advances in the understanding of headache in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^c45b42a6]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

HEADACHE AND THE PERSON WITH INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION

Headache in IIH is known to have a detrimental effect on quality of life and chronic headaches have a profound effect on people's lives, showing similarities with other pain conditions. The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT), a key trial, was a North American multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of 165 participants with investigating utility of acetazolamide in mild visual loss. In this cohort, headache, particular when associated with photophobia, was the major factor in detrimental general and visual quality of life [, ▪▪].

In an observational study, headache frequency and severity of depression symptoms were independent predictors of disability in IIH with mean score of 22.8 (±15.2), compared with an average Italian general population of 12.9. This indicated that consideration should be given to reducing headache and treating depression in IIH. In the United Kingdom, the James Lind Alliance priority setting partnership investigated over 500 IIH patients and clinician preferences, understanding of headache mechanisms and treatment was ranked in two domains of the top 10 research priorities for IIH. This reflects the unmet need of the disability of headache in everyday life of our patients.

### The idiopathic intracranial hypertension prospective cohort study: evaluation of prognostic factors and outcomes [^f02eb2f2]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) predominately affects women with obesity and emerging evidence suggests it is a neuro-metabolic disorder. It is a condition of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) which can lead to chronic headaches, visual loss and cognitive dysfunction. It has a number of comorbid conditions such as obstructive sleep apnoea, infertility, increased pregnancy complications, and long-term risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. For the majority of patients the visual prognosis is good. However, poor visual prognostic factors that have previously been demonstrated include male sex, ethnicity, high-grade papilloedema, > 30 transient visual obscurations per month and decreased visual acuity at baseline. Headaches associated with IIH are problematic, debilitating, and persistent. Weight loss is currently the only known disease modifier in IIH and the recent IIH Weight Trial showed that bariatric surgery was superior over community weight management in lowering the intracranial pressure with it also being cost-effective. Maintenance of weight loss especially by dietary means can be difficult. Reports state that IIH relapse is common, occurring between 9% and 28% in IIH patients. Pharmacological interventions currently consist of off-label use of acetazolamide, topiramate and other diuretics. When papilloedema is sight threatening, surgical intervention is often required.

Within the literature, there are few large cohorts describing the longitudinal course of IIH [,–]. Most were performed retrospectively or focus on particular interventions or investigate specific risks such as sex or ethnicity. There is a need for large prospective cohort studies evaluating the real-world clinical course of IIH. Whilst there has been a number of randomised controlled trials and small case–controlled cohort studies, these define specific populations for their inclusion criteria such as new onset disease (as in the IIH Treatment Trial) or chronic disease (as in the IIH Weight Trial) and therefore do not focus on the whole disease spectrum. We aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes in a prospectively collected real-world cohort of patients with IIH irrespective of disease timing. We hypothesised that those with the greatest papilloedema would have worse visual outcomes, and those with the greatest burden of headache at the start of the disease may have a more challenging clinical course. We evaluated all patients but also aimed to determine the key prognostic indicators in those managed exclusively medically (no IIH surgical interventions).

### Risk factors for poor visual outcome in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^8f4a0c18]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Determine potential risk factors for progressive visual field loss in the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial, a randomized placebo-controlled trial of acetazolamide in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and mild visual loss concurrently receiving a low sodium, weight reduction diet.

Methods

Logistic regression and classification tree analyses were used to evaluate potential risk factors for protocol-defined treatment failure (>2 dB perimetric mean deviation [PMD] change in patients with baseline PMD -2 to -3.5 dB or >3 dB PMD change with baseline PMD -3.5 to -7 dB).

Results

Seven participants (6 on diet plus placebo) met criteria for treatment failure. The odds ratio for patients with grades III to V papilledema vs those with grades I and II was 8.66 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.65-∞, p = 0.025). A 1-unit decrease in the number of letters correct on the ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) chart at baseline was associated with an increase in the odds of treatment failure by a factor of 1.16 (95% CI 1.04-1.30, p = 0.005). Compared with female participants, the odds ratio for male participants was 26.21 (95% CI 1.61-433.00, p = 0.02). The odds of treatment failure were 10.59 times higher (95% CI 1.63-116.83, p = 0.010) for patients with >30 transient visual obscurations per month vs those with ≤30 per month.

Conclusions

Male patients, those with high-grade papilledema, and those with decreased visual acuity at baseline were more likely to experience treatment failure. All but one of these patients were treated with diet alone. These patients should be monitored closely and be considered for aggressive treatment of their idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

### Topiramate is more effective than acetazolamide at lowering intracranial pressure [^7f17d40e]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) typically affects obese woman of childbearing age and is characterised by raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Morbidity results from chronic disabling headaches and papilloedema, with the potential for severe visual loss (permanent in up to 25%). IIH affects 1–2 per 100,000 of the general population and 20 per 100,000 of the obese female population with numbers expected to rise over the forthcoming decade in line with escalating obesity figures. Management strategies focus on disease modification through weight loss, although this is notoriously difficult to achieve. Therefore, the majority of patients receive pharmacological therapy with the aim of reducing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secretion and consequently ICP. For those with fulminant IIH and rapidly declining vision, CSF diversion surgery may be necessary.

Acetazolamide is the most commonly used drug in IIH. Class 1 evidence has demonstrated modest improvement in visual ﬁeld function in patients with IIH with mild visual loss. However, the 2015 Cochrane review has summarised that there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend or reject the efficacy of acetazolamide for treating IIH. Between 19–48% of patients will not tolerate acetazolamide due to side effects and consequently alternative drugs maybe prescribed such as topiramate, furosemide, amiloride and octreotide. However, there is extremely limited mechanistic and clinical data to support their use. The purpose of this study was to determine which drug currently used to treat IIH has the greatest effect at lowering ICP in rats to provide pre-clinical evidence for its use in IIH.

### Venous stenting evaluation in patients with intracranial (...) [^3b0a1058]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Venous Stenting Evaluation in Patients With Intracranial Hypertension Under Long-term Acetazolamide ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview This study is aimed at patients suffering from long term intracranial hypertension, receiving acetazolamide for more than 1 year, having inadequate response to treatment. The goal is to evaluate if stenting of a specific vein in the brain could decrease the hypertension and improve associated symptoms. Patients will be randomly assigned in either best medical care group or interventional group and will undergo specific follow-up visits after 1, 3 and 12 months.

The DIVE-IIN-LATE trial is a multicenter randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate whether transverse sinus stenting is more effective than best medical therapy alone for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension treated with acetazolamide for more than one year. The study targets patients diagnosed with IIH with bilateral transverse sinus stenosis or unilateral stenosis of the dominant transverse sinus with a hypoplastic contralateral sinus. Restoring a normal luminal diameter of the transverse sinus using a stent could therefore allow for the rapid restoration of normal intracranial pressures and an improvement in various symptoms. Stent implantation in the transverse sinus is now part of standard care, but no large-scale clinical trial has formally established the superiority of the technique compared to the standard of care.

This study aims to provide evidence on the potential benefits of transverse venous sinus stenting as a treatment option for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which could significantly change the current management approach of this disease. Drug: Acetazolamide Device: Stent

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: ongoing clinical challenges and future prospects [^fbdaab09]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is an uncommon disorder characterized by increased intracranial pressure without radiological or laboratory evidence of intracranial pathology except empty sella turcica, optic nerve sheath with filled out cerebrospinal fluid spaces, and smooth-walled nonflow-related venous sinus stenosis or collapse. This condition typically affects obese women. The incidence of IIH is increasing with the rising prevalence of obesity. Persistent headache is the most common symptom. Visual impairment is a serious complication that may not be recognized by the patients. This paper reviews clinical manifestations, diagnostic challenges, and current treatments of IIH in adults. Various imaging modalities have been studied on their validity for detection of IIH and papilledema. This review also includes new studies on medical, surgical, and interventional management of this condition. Acetazolamide and topiramate are the only two medications that have been studied in randomized controlled trials about their efficacy in treatment of IIH. In patients who have severe visual impairment or progressive visual deterioration despite medical management, surgical or interventional treatment may be considered. The efficacy and complications of cerebrospinal fluid diversion, optic nerve sheath fenestration, and endovascular venous stenting reported in the last 3 decades have been summarized in this review. Finally, the prospective aspects of biomarkers and treatments are proposed for future research.

### Managing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in the eye clinic [^1458ee4e]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a neuro-ophthalmological condition characterised by a raised intracranial pressure and papilloedema that causes disabling headaches. The main risk factors of female sex and living with obesity have been known for some time, however the knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology is evolving. Papilloedema can impact the visual function, and the majority of people are offered acetazolamide. Those with sight threatening disease need urgent management, though there is little high quality evidence to recommend any particular surgical intervention. Headache treatment is an unmet clinical need and simple medication overuse advice has the potential to reduce the chronification of migraine-like headaches. IIH is emerging as a systemic metabolic disease distinct from people living with obesity alone. While weight loss is the main stay of disease modifying therapy this is challenging to access and many healthcare professionals that manage the condition have no formal training or accessible pathways for weight management. The aim of this "how to do it" article is to present the latest advances in knowledge of IIH that we pragmatically included in routine clinical care for people living with the condition.

Managing IIH in pregnancy

As IIH is common in women of childbearing age, there will inevitably be patients diagnosed with IIH who become pregnant. If the patient takes acetazolamide, we advise her to stop this on becoming pregnant, to minimise the risk of toxicity, particularly in the first trimester. However, in a series of 50 patients treated with acetazolamide during the first trimester, there were no reported adverse outcomes for the pregnancy or the baby.We therefore occasionally consider using acetazolamide, particularly after the first trimester, following an informed discussion of the potential risks and benefits.During pregnancy, we increase observations and begin communication with the obstetric team; we advise that the mother's birth plans are not changed simply due to their diagnosis of IIH. We recommend specialist dietary advice to guide on appropriate weight gain during pregnancy (eg, the Maternal Lighten Up program). The Institute of Medicine recommended 5–9 kg weight gain during the pregnancy (0.22 kg/week in the second and third trimester) in those with a starting Body Mass Index of ≥30 kg/m 2.For the great majority, the IIH remains stable and they can have a normal vaginal delivery. Very occasionally, when there is compromised optic nerve function, we advise against a prolonged second stage of labour. Epidural and spinal anaesthetic during labour (even with a shunt in situ) can still go ahead.A few patients present with IIH for the first time during the first trimester. If they have visual compromise they may require temporising serial lumbar punctures, until they can undergo CSF diversion during their second trimester.

In the postpartum period, acetazolamide is probably safe for a breastfeeding baby. Only 0.06% of the dose of acetazolamide given to the mother is ingested by the child (less than 0.7% of the dose/kg body weight received by the mother); such a low dose is unlikely to harm the baby.

Topiramate

Topiramate is an anticonvulsant, which has been previously reported to be effective in the treatment of IIH.–There was an open-label, randomized study to compare the efficacy of topiramate (20 patients) and acetazolamide (20 patients).The doses of topiramate and acetazolamide ranged from 100–150 mg/d to 1–1.5 g/d, respectively. This study demonstrated no significant difference in visual field improvement between these two groups at the end of the months 3, 6, and 12. Relief of headache and improvement of papilledema were comparable between two groups. The improvement in headache was seen after 3.75 months in the topiramate group and 3.30 months in the acetazolamide group. This is the first open-label, randomized study on the efficacy of topiramate on the treatment of IIH. However, the number of subjects was small (total: 40 subjects in this study). A larger multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial would be the next step to confirm the efficacy of topiramate in IIH.

The mechanism of topiramate in IIH treatment is explained by its mild effect on carbonic anhydrase inhibition. The common side effects of topiramate are distal paresthesia, concentration difficulty, weight loss, and nephrolithiasis. Rare cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma and myopia were reported.–As topiramate is a prophylactic medication for other forms of headache including migraine, it may be particularly effective in IIH patients without papilledema or in IIH patients with migraine who have intractable headache after resolution of papilledema.

Surgical management

Generally, surgical intervention is indicated in IIH cases with severe optic neuropathy or medical treatment failure that are vision-threatening. Surgical intervention for IIH includes CSF diversion and optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF).

Medication

Women of childbearing age need to have a careful risk–benefit discussion about medications that may be teratogenic. Several medications are used off label in IIH aiming to reduce intracranial pressure.

Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is the most commonly used medication in IIH. It can modestly improve visual function in IIH patients who have mild visual loss, and improve quality of life.However, there is a high (48%) likelihood of discontinuation due to adverse effects when using a mean daily dose of 1.5 g.Animal studies have shown teratogenicity and so in the UK it is not recommend for those planning a pregnancy or during pregnancy.However, opinion internationally variesand a retrospective series of 50 pregnancies found no increase in adverse events.Women should be counselled that acetazolamide is potentially teratogenic (table 1) and its prescription in pregnancy must only follow discussion with the patient and their obstetrician.

Table 1 
Main adverse effects and teratogenic risks of acetazolamide and topiramate

Topiramate is used off label in IIH supported by in vivoand open-label study evidence.It is also effective in migraine preventionand sometimes can drive weight loss through appetite suppression.Human pregnancy registry studies have highlighted its teratogenicity(table 1) and so topiramate should be avoided in women actively planning to conceive. It is also important to counsel patients that at higher doses (>200 mg/day) it can reduce the efficacy of the combined contraceptive pill.

Folic acid supplementation ≥400 μg daily is recommended for all women wishing to become pregnant, starting at least 1–3 months before conception and continuing during the first trimester. In line with the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics guidelines we recommend considering a higher dose (5 mg) for women with IIH and obesity, as obesity in pregnancy is a risk factor for fetal neural tube defects.

Clinical care

Q 19 Are there any other chronic problems that need to be addressed in IIH?

All of these patients require recognition that they have been diagnosed with a rare disease and need appropriate support to deal with the psychological burden of living with a chronic condition.
The patient with IIH may have significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression and a lower quality of life.This may be as a response to chronic pain. This needs recognition and appropriate management.
Sleep apnoea is frequently reported in this group,and referral to respiratory service may be appropriate.
Polycystic ovary syndrome may coexist.
Cognitive dysfunction may coexist.

Managing IIH in pregnancy

Q20 What advice should be given regarding drug treatments in the pregnant patients with IIH?

A clear risk−benefit assessment regarding the necessity of acetazolamide treatment during pregnancy should be discussed with the patient as perinatal exposure in rodents has reported teratogenic effects.
With the limited evidence, it is difficult to make any safe recommendations on using acetazolamide during pregnancy and its manufacturers do not recommend it use.
Topiramate should not be used in pregnancy. There is clear evidence of a higher rate of fetal abnormalities following its use.
If a patient on topiramate becomes pregnant, they should reduce and discontinue it as soon as possible in line with manufacturers recommendations.
A clear risk−benefit assessment regarding the necessity of headache treatment during pregnancy should be discussed with the patient as many of the regularly used headache medications are not recommended in pregnancy.

Q21 What additional considerations for management are there in the pregnant patient with IIH?

Multidisciplinary communication among relevant experienced clinicians should occur throughout pregnancy, peridelivery and in the postpartum period.
No specific mode of delivery should be suggested based on the fact there is a previous diagnosis of IIH.
If not already under a weight management programme, consider referral to a weight service, so that weight gain is appropriate for gestational age of fetus as described by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 2013 Guidelines.
Increased outpatient observation may be helpful to reassure other healthcare professionals and patients during this period.
How should an acute exacerbation of IIH, with imminent risk to vision be managed in pregnancy?
If the IIH is active with imminent risk of vision loss, then some would consider serial lumbar punctures as a temporising measure only until longer term measures, such as CSF diversion or ONSF, can be implemented.
Those with imminent risk of vision loss at time of delivery should be managed in a specialist centre.

Long-term prognosis and visual outcome of 54 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) was studied. Mean observation period was 6.2 years; 33 patients had two or more recurrences. Visual acuity was preserved in all patients without recurrence and in 86% of patients with recurrences. Recurrences did not occur while patients were maintained on acetazolamide. No statistical difference was found between IIH patients who had only one event, compared to the recurrent group.

### Papilledema outcomes from the optical coherence tomography substudy of the idiopathic intracranial hypertension treatment trial [^6a4f1953]. Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess treatment efficacy using spectral-domain (SD) optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements of papilledema in the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT), which evaluated the effects of acetazolamide and weight management and of placebo and weight management in eyes with mild visual loss.

Design

Randomized double-masked control clinical trial of acetazolamide plus weight management compared with placebo plus weight management in subjects with mild visual field loss and previously untreated idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

Participants

Eighty-nine (43 acetazolamide treated, 46 placebo treated) of 165 subjects meeting IIHTT entry criteria.

Methods

Subjects underwent perimetry, papilledema grading (Frisén method), high- and low-contrast visual acuity, and SD OCT imaging at study entry and 3 and 6 months. Study eye results (worse perimetric mean deviation [PMD]) were used for most analyses.

Main Outcome Measures

Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, total retinal thickness (TRT), optic nerve (ONH) volume, and retinal ganglion cell layer (RGCL) measurements derived using 3-dimensional segmentation.

Results

Study entry OCT values were similar in both treatment groups. At 6 months, the acetazolamide group had greater reduction than the placebo group for RNFL thickness (175 μm vs. 89 μm; P = 0.001), TRT (220 μm vs. 113 μm; P = 0.001), and ONH volume (4.9 mm(3) vs. 2.1 mm(3); P = 0.001). The RNFL thickness (P = 0.01), TRT (P = 0.003), and ONH volume (P = 0.002) measurements also showed smaller increases in subjects who lost 6% or more of study entry weight. The acetazolamide (3.6 μm) and placebo (2.1 μm) groups showed minor RGCL thinning (P = 0.06). The RNFL thickness, TRT, and ONH volume measurements showed moderate correlations (r = 0.48-0.59; P ≤ 0.0001) with Frisén grade. The 14 eyes with RGCL thickness less than the fifth percentile of controls had worse PMD (P = 0.001) than study eyes with RGCL in the fifth percentile or more.

Conclusions

In IIH, acetazolamide and weight loss effectively improve RNFL thickness, TRT, and ONH volume swelling measurements resulting from papilledema. In contrast to the strong correlation at baseline, OCT measures at 6 months show only moderate correlations with papilledema grade.

### Bariatric surgery or non-surgical weight loss for idiopathic intracranial hypertension? A systematic review and comparison of meta-analyses [^1c8cd9a7]. Obesity Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Bariatric surgery is an alternate way of sustainably reducing both excess weight and IIH symptomology, whilst also improving glycaemic control and cardiovascular and cancer risk. A previous review of 65 patients demonstrated that following bariatric surgery 92% (60/65) had improvement in IIH outcomes. Although there is also evidence suggesting that non-surgical interventions, including a recent multicentre RCT of weight loss vs. weight loss with acetazolamide, may improve IIH outcomes via weight reduction and possibly additional mechanisms, there are lack of studies directly comparing these treatment strategies.

The aim of this paper was therefore to systematically review the current evidence and concomitantly appraise both bariatric surgery and non-surgical weight-loss interventions in the management of IIH, via the assessment of visual outcomes (papilloedema and visual field deficits), symptoms (headache), intracranial pressure (via cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure measurement) and BMI as summary outcome parameters.

4.4 Treatment Strategies During Pregnancy

This systematic review shows how the treatment approach of pregnant women with IIH has evolved over the decades. The included papers observed a progressive decline in the use of decompressive craniectomy and shunting as first‐line treatments, nowadays largely replaced by serial LP and acetazolamide (Table 1, FLT) (Figure 5).

FIGURE 5 
Evolution of the treatment of IIH during pregnancy over time.

The optimal timing for initiating medical treatment remains under debate. If on one hand, some authors suggest delivering acetazolamide after the onset of visual deficits, others support implementing diuretics in case of headaches persistence, as these usually precede the onset of visual dysfunctions. Acetazolamide is nowadays the first‐line treatment in most cases diagnosed with IIH, as it significantly improves papilledema, visual field deficits, and headache severity. Its effectiveness is particularly enhanced when combined with weight control, ultimately improving the patients' quality of life. In studies where IIH was treated with acetazolamide, even in the first trimester at dosages > 1 g/d, the risk of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and abortion was similar to the control group. Case reports have described congenital malformations associated with acetazolamide use during pregnancy; however, a causal relationship has not been confirmed. Many authors remain skeptical due to the controversies surrounding FDA guidelines (Table 3). Furosemide and chlorthalidone may represent second choices, but they need to be accurately evaluated with the obstetricians before substitution.

Topiramate

Topiramate alters several targets such as inhibition of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, augmentation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced chloride flux, inhibition of glutamate-related excitatory neurotransmission and action on carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes. Topiramate use was first reported in a prospective open label study of 40 patients using both topiramate (daily dose range 100–150 mg) and acetazolamide daily (dose range 1000–1500 mg); however, no placebo group was included. A statistically significant improvement in visual field was detected with both drugs, with no statistically significant difference found when compared with each other. Weight loss was prominent in the topiramate group. The side effect profile is similar to acetazolamide, however, adverse cognitive effects can occur, and the drug is not recommended for use in patients with a history of severe depression. Additionally, as topiramate is a first-line agent for migraine prevention (National Institute for Clinical Excellence Guideline CG150) it may have additional benefit for those patients with IIH with coexisting migraine-like headaches (68% at diagnosis).

Other drugs

Other diuretics, such as furosemide, are used in IIH, when acetazolamide is contraindicated or not tolerated. There is animal evidence that furosemide reduces CSF production, possibly by a different mechanism to acetazolamide, and it is postulated that it might have an additive effect to acetazolamide.Caution is advised when combining diurectics, as severe hypokalaemia may result. Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue which inhibits pituitary growth hormone (GH) secretion, and antagonises GH and insulin-like growth factor action by blocking GH receptors. Somatostatin receptors are highly expressed in arachnoid villi and choroid plexus and, therefore, may be related to CSF production and absorption. Following case reports, an unblinded, open-label study reported resolution of papilloedema in 92% of cases with further improvement in other visual parameters and headache.Given the observational nature of this study, the small study size, and the lack of a control group, further data are required.

Non-medical interventions

If medical therapy fails, is not tolerated, or there is fulminant IIH, more aggressive measures should be considered. Management options include serial LP; optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF); neurosurgery employing shunts and stenting of the transverse venous sinuses. The decision regarding the choice of surgical procedure often depends on local expertise and the patient's morbidity.

### Bariatric surgery or non-surgical weight loss for idiopathic intracranial hypertension? A systematic review and comparison of meta-analyses [^360da222]. Obesity Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Patients in both the surgical and non-surgical trials (excluding the two non-surgical RCTs who used a placebo) received the diuretic acetazolamide which has been shown to have a modest effect on IIH symptoms. Other non-surgical weight-loss interventions were non-standardised between trials, reflecting real world variation in practice. A small number of non-surgical patients also underwent bariatric surgery in one included study.

Studies in both arms also showed variation in reported outcome measures, which restricted the extent of analysis; notably in the case of visual field status and CSF opening pressure following bariatric surgery. In comparing the two meta-analytical groups, both the mean pre-intervention BMI and the prevalence of IIH symptoms and signs were materially higher in the surgical group, which could impact the overall reduction in BMI and degree of decrease in symptoms (although absolute improvements were still considerably greater than in non-surgical patients).

Though this analysis elucidates the comparison of surgical and non-surgical studies by combining results from both treatment strategies, it does not formally quantify the difference in their effects. As result of the selection criteria requiring the inclusion of both BMI and visual status findings pre and post-intervention, several studies were excluded meaning that our analysis may not be fully representative of all interventions in the literature to date.

Q9 How should acetazolamide be prescribed?

The IIHTT used a maximal dose of 4 g daily, with 44% of participants achieving 4 g/day, and the majority tolerating 1 g/day.Ball et al identified that 48% discontinued at mean doses of 1.5 g due to side effects.
A popular starting dose of acetazolamide is 250–500 mg twice a day, with the majority of clinicians titrating the daily dose up.
Patients should be warned of the adverse side effects of acetazolamide that are well recognised and include increased risk of diarrhoea, dysgeusia, fatigue, nausea, paraesthesia, tinnitus, vomiting, depression and rarely renal stones.
There is no consensus over the use of normal release and modified release acetazolamide.

Uncertainties

The optimal dose of acetazolamide is not established. The licencing information regarding acetazolamide recommends periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes; however, there is no consensus on the timing of monitoring.

Q10 Are there other drugs that are helpful in IIH?

Topiramate has carbonic anhydrase activity and can suppress appetite. It has been compared with acetazolamide in an uncontrolled open label study for IIH.Participants were alternately assigned to the treatments, not randomly, and there was no placebo control group. There is evidence of efficacy of topiramate in treating migraine.
There may be a role for topiramate in IIH with weekly dose escalation from 25 mg to 50 mg bd.
Where topiramate is prescribed, women must be informed that it can reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive pill/oral contraceptives and other hormonal contraceptives.
When topiramate is prescribed, women must be counselled regarding side effects (including depression and cognitive slowing) and potential teratogenetic risks.

Uncertainties

The role of other diuretics such as furosemide, amiloride and coamilofruse are not certain but are used by some as alternative therapies.

Third principle of IIH management: reduce headache disability

Raised ICP can drive headaches, which may be very severe at presentation.Despite significant headache morbidity in IIH, there are no randomised controlled trials to guide headache management in IIH.

Risk Factors of Poor Visual Outcome: IIH-SOS

To predict visual outcomes and to enable health care professionals to risk-stratify IIH treatment and management at baseline, we designed the IIH-SOS based on a clinical importance ranking of the visual outcomes “visual acuity” and “visual field” (eFigure 2A). Only 5% of patients with IIH scored 4 of 5, and no patients became blind (score 5, eFigure 2B). Patients with probable IIH presented with milder papilledema than patients with definite IIH (p < 0.0001) and did not have reduced visual acuity or scotoma at remission (score 0; eFigure 2B). The IIH-SOS correlated with the severity of the papilledema at baseline (Spearman ρ = 0.30; p = 0.016, Figure 5A) and DRIL at baseline (p = 0.02; Figure 5B) and seemed worse in patients with macular edema at baseline (p = 0.19; Figure 5C). As expected, the maximum acetazolamide dose used for IIH treatment correlated with the severity of papilledema (p < 0.001; eFigure 3A) as it was tailored according to papilledema severity at baseline. Accordingly, the maximum acetazolamide dose also correlated with the IIH-SOS at remission in that the higher the acetazolamide dose, the higher the IIH-SOS and the worse the visual outcome (p = 0.014; eFigure 3B). In exploratory analyses, the IIH-SOS did not correlate with baseline LPOP (p = 0.15; Figure 5D), a recently published MRI score,plasma neurofilament light chain,time to remission, time from baseline to treatment initiation, BMI, and age at baseline (data not shown).

### Efficacy and safety of GLP-1 and dual GIP / GLP-1 receptor agonists in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b7d6e40d]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Notably, weight‐independent mechanisms may also account for the previous findings. In fact, early effects of GLP‐1 RAs in IIH are unlikely to be related to weight loss, as evidenced by the significant ICP reduction measured via implanted telemetric catheters in IIH patients as early as 2.5 h following exenatide administration. This observation arguably reinforces the preclinical data of reduced CSF production and direct alterations in ICP via GLP‐1 RA‐mediated increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump in the choroid plexus.

With respect to safety outcomes, no SAEs or AEs leading to premature discontinuation of GLP‐1 RAs were reported, while the pooled incidence of mild gastrointestinal AEs and nausea was 88% for each outcome among GLP‐1 RA‐treated IIH patients. Although gastrointestinal AEs are typically mild and self‐limited in patients receiving GLP‐1 RA treatment, they may represent a relevant limitation in RCT designs, likely introducing unmasking bias in patients undergoing active treatment. The inclusion of robust physiological primary outcome measures, including optic nerve ultrasound, standardized visual acuity, visual field, and OCT assessments, alongside CSF opening pressure measurements, should thus be considered in future trial designs.

Certain limitations of this meta‐analysis should be acknowledged. Two TriNetX registry‐based retrospective studies, one of which evaluated tirzepatide as the only available dataset on a GIP/GLP‐1 RA in IIH to date, alongside one phase I RCT and one non‐randomized matched clinical trial, were included in the pooled analysis. However, the inherent risk of bias, as demonstrated in the quality assessment, limits the generalizability of our findings, which warrant further prospective validation. Given the scarcity of IIH trials, a prior Cochrane review included only two RCTs comparing acetazolamide to placebo. Despite its rising incidence, IIH remains a rare disorder, a fact that explains the disproportionately limited number of dedicated RCTs and the premature termination of the IIH EVOLVE trial (ID: NCT05347147), a phase III randomized, placebo‐controlled trial that sought to evaluate presendin, a novel exenatide formulation in IIH patients. This trial was halted prematurely due to slower than expected recruitment, and no active or recruiting RCTs on GLP‐1 RAs in IIH are currently in the pipeline.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension in children: a review and algorithm [^ee01ded0]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

This updated review of pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension focuses on epidemiology, clinical presentations, diagnostic criteria, evaluation, clinical course, and treatment. General guidelines for the clinical management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension are discussed. A new algorithm outlines an efficient management strategy for the initial diagnostic evaluation of children with signs or symptoms of intracranial hypertension. This algorithm provides a systematic approach to initial evaluation and management, and identifies important decision-making factors. The risk of permanent visual loss with idiopathic intracranial hypertension necessitates a prompt, thorough collaborative approach in the management of patients. Although idiopathic intracranial hypertension has been recognized for over a century, the need remains for prospectively collected data to promote a better understanding of the etiology, risk factors, evaluative methods, and effective treatments for children with this syndrome.

### Managing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in the eye clinic [^1dc2b970]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

How do we treat case 2 with moderate optic nerve oedema, abnormal visual function and headaches?

Case 2 had moderate compromise of visual function and more severe optic nerve oedema. Treatment included acetazolamide 500 mg twice a day with planned titration up to 1000 mg twice a day over a week and referral to the local weight management programme. Follow up examination two weeks later showed BCVA at 6/6 both eyes, mildly decreased colour vision in the right eye with right RAPD and worsening visual field more significant in the right eye (Fig. 3). The optic nerve oedema had not changed, as evidenced by her OCT imaging. She reported of persistent pulsatile tinnitus and headaches. She had found it difficult to comply with the acetazolamide due to side effects. Due to worsening visual function, persistent severe optic nerve oedema, intolerance to acetazolamide and weight gain in the preceding months, options of intensive weight management or a surgical option to save the sight was discussed with the patient. Together we decided to proceed with surgical management of IIH. The patient underwent placement of a right frontal ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) without complications.

Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial ClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Clinical Phase: Phase II Investigators: NORDIC Network sites Study Centers: 38 study centers Coordinating Center
- University of Rochester Statistical Center
- University of Rochester Study Period Planned enrollment duration: 2 years Planned duration of treatment: 6 months followed by open-label treatment Planned duration of follow-up:

4. 5 years Study Objectives: The primary objective is determining the efficacy of diet plus acetazolamide vs diet alone in reducing or reversing visual loss in subjects with mild visual loss. Study Design: Multi-center, double-blind randomized intervention study followed by a 4-year observation period. Subjects will be randomized to diet and acetazolamide or diet and placebo. The study will use 250 mg acetazolamide or matching placebo tablets taken with food at meals and at bedtime.

The subject will begin with one tablet four times daily, at meals and at bedtime for the first week. After the 6 month visit, all subjects will transition from study medication to acetazolamide by replacing one tablet of study drug with 250 mg of acetazolamide every four days. The acetazolamide dose will be titrated in a manner similar to the initial study drug schedule to the maximum tolerated dose of acetazolamide. To avoid treating subjects unnecessarily, any subject with grade 0-1 papilledema will be tapered off study drug but not placed on acetazolamide unless they have persisting headaches or pulse-synchronous tinnitus. If so, they will be placed on acetazolamide regardless of the low papilledema grade. At the 9-month follow-up visit, we will make sure that the subjects' vision is stable after the transition off of study medication.

After the 9 month visit, medication will be prescribed by the subject's treating physician. The intervention phase of the study will end at the subject's 12 month visit and subjects will be invited to participate in the observational phase of the study and consented to do so if willing.

Q11 What is the best way to manage headaches in newly diagnosed IIH?

Patients must be informed, at the earliest opportunity, of the potential issues of painkiller overuse that can lead to medication overuse headache (use of simple analgesics on more than 15 days per month or opioids, combined preparations or triptan medication on greater than 10 days per month for more than 3 months).
Short-term painkillers may be helpful in the first few weeks following diagnosis. These could include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or paracetamol. Indomethacin may have some advantage due to its effect of reducing ICP.Caution is required with potential side effects of NSAIDs, and gastric protection may be needed.
Opioids should not be prescribed for headaches.
Greater occipital nerve blocks maybe considered helpful by some, but there is a lack of evidence and consensus.
Acetazolamide has not been shown to be effective for the treatment of headache alone.
Lumbar punctures are not typically recommended for treatment of headache in IIH (see 7. What is the role of serial lumbar punctures in IIH? in table 3).

Uncertainty

There is no evidence to support the optimal managing of headache in acute IIH.

Q12 What is the best approach for long-term headache management in IIH?

The pattern of headache in IIH often changes over time and needs careful assessment. There is frequently a mixed headache phenotype: headache attributed to IIH, migraine, medication overuse headache, tension-type headache, headache attributed to low CSF pressure and headache attributed to iatrogenic Chiari malformation secondary to CSF shunting.
A multidisciplinary team approach could be considered including, ideally, an assessment by an experienced clinician with an interest in headache management.
In patients with IIH, the headache phenotype should be assessed. Headache therapies should be tailored to the headache phenotype.
IIH patients with headache need clear explanation of how their headaches change over time and how to minimise the risks of developing medication overuse headache.
Early introduction of preventative medications (migraine preventatives) should be considered as these can take 3–4 months to reach maximal efficacy.

Uncertainty

There is no evidence to support the optimal managing of headache in established IIH.

### Weight management interventions for adults with idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a systematic review and practice recommendations [^2af38c8f]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is associated with obesity; however, there is a lack of clinical consensus on how to manage weight in IIH. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate weight loss interventions in people with IIH to determine which intervention is superior in terms of weight loss, reduction in intracranial pressure (ICP), benefit to visual and headache outcomes, quality of life, and mental health.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023339569). MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched for relevant literature published from inception until December 15, 2022. Screening and quality appraisal was conducted by 2 independent reviewers. Recommendations were graded using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodology.

Results

A total of 17 studies were included. Bariatric surgery resulted in 27.2-27.8 kg weight loss at 24 months (Level 1- to 1++). Lifestyle weight management interventions resulted in between 1.4 and 15.7 kg weight loss (Level 2+ to 1++). Bariatric surgery resulted in the greatest mean reduction in ICP (-11.9 cm H 2 O) at 24 months (Level 1++), followed by multicomponent lifestyle intervention + acetazolamide (-11.2 cm H 2 O) at 6 months (Level 1+) and then a very low-energy diet intervention (-8.0 cm H 2 O) at 3 months (Level 2++). The least ICP reduction was shown at 24 months after completing a 12-month multicomponent lifestyle intervention (-3.5 cm H 2 O) (Level 1++). Reduction in body weight was shown to be highly correlated with reduction in ICP (Level 2++ to 1++).

Discussion

Bariatric surgery should be considered for women with IIH and a body mass index (BMI) ≥35 kg/m 2 since this had the most robust evidence for sustained weight management (grade A). A multicomponent lifestyle intervention (diet + physical activity + behavior) had the most robust evidence for modest weight loss with a BMI <35 kg/m 2 (grade B). Longer-term outcomes for weight management interventions in people with IIH are required to determine whether there is a superior weight loss intervention for IIH.

### Review of acetazolamide and novel medical paradigms for idiopathic intracranial hypertension treatment [^61a90f9a]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To summarize recent emerging treatments for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) as an adjunct to surgical repair of cerebrospinal fluid leak by rhinology and skull base surgeons.

Data Sources

PubMed and Embase databases.

Review Methods

A literature review of aforementioned databases was performed on August 23, 2024, to identify studies from the past 5years of acetazolamide alternatives and on September 16, 2024, for acetazolamide for the medical management of IIH. Data collected from studies included author, publication year, type of evidence, main findings, dosage, reported adverse effects, and medication studied.

Results

Ten articles met screening criteria, and medications studied included the following: acetazolamide, topiramate, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), and 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) inhibitors. There were 4 randomized control trials, 1 pilot single-center study, 2 retrospective cohort studies, 1 retrospective case-control study, and 2 murine model basic science studies. There were significant findings supporting the case for increased research into their respective medications with hopeful clinical translation.

Conclusion

Topiramate, GLP-1RAs, and 11β-HSD1 inhibitors are promising adjuncts or alternatives to acetazolamide and should be further investigated as effective IIH treatments.

### Resolution of headache and papilledema in idiopathic intracranial hypertension associated with inhibition of Na +-K +-2Cl-cotransport [^d5a92a62]. Journal of Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Medical treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is often ineffective. Cerebrospinal fluid diversion or optic nerve sheath fenestration is employed when medical therapy fails. Here, we describe a case of a 13-year-old girl with idiopathic intracranial hypertension refractory to long-term trials of acetazolamide and furosemide at maximally tolerated doses. After declining surgical intervention despite progression of her visual symptoms, a trial of bumetanide (0.25 mg daily) monotherapy was successful in resolution of the patient's symptoms. These results suggest bumetanide could be effective in the treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, perhaps by restoring the balance between cerebrospinal fluid formation and absorption and/or by altering the volume or ionic composition of the brain's extracellular fluid compartment.

Conservative management

Weight loss

Some patients volunteer recent weight gain before presentation, others do not, but weight loss is currently the only proven disease-modifying treatment for all overweight patients.Our recent prospective study highlighted that a 15% reduction of body weight, using a low calorie meal replacement liquid diet for 3 months, significantly reduced intracranial pressure, papilloedema and headaches.However, strategies to achieve long-term significant weight loss are notoriously difficult with typically as little as 2–4 kg of weight loss maintained at 2 years irrespective of the diet followed.Many case reports describe the benefits of bariatric surgery in IIH.We are currently recruiting to a randomised controlled trial comparing efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the most effective community weight loss programmeversus bariatric surgery.

Pharmacological management

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, can provide symptomatic relief of raised intracranial pressure, although there is no evidence to support their benefit. Additionally, in the only randomised controlled trial looking at acetazolamide, over half the patients in the acetazolamide arm stopped treatment due to side effects.This aligns with our clinical experience that many cannot tolerate it. For these reasons, we manage many of our patients with active IIH without acetazolamide. The maximum dose is up to 2 g/daily; in our experience, up to 1 g daily is adequate, depending on body weight. If we do prescribe acetazolamide, we use the modified release preparation to reduce side effects.

Managing venous stenoses

Many patients with pseudotumour cerebri have venous sinus stenosis (narrowing), particularly of the transverse sinuses, reflecting elevated intracranial pressure.Several research centres are now evaluating the therapeutic potential of stenting the transverse sinus in IIH.There is growing consensus that the stents do not treat the underlying cause of IIH. Reducing intracranial pressure by lumbar puncture can resolve the stenoses.Stenting the stenoses may, however, improve IIH by increasing CSF drainage at the arachnoid granulations, thereby lowering intracranial pressure and improving the signs and symptoms of IIH.Serious complication of the procedure (venous sinus perforation, stent migration, in-stent thrombosis, subdural haemorrhage and the development of recurrent stenoses immediately proximal to the stent) suggest the need for caution with this approach.We need larger long-term randomised clinical trials to evaluate this treatment before it can become routine clinical practice.

### A practical approach to, diagnosis, assessment and management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^e1aa31a7]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Management

Disease evolution and outcomes in IIH are poorly characterised and are currently being evaluated in the National IIH:LIFE study (centres interested in participating should contact the author, AS). We have noted the following patient types:
Those who rapidly lose vision at diagnosis over days to weeks (rare but vital to identify early).
Those whose disease resolves following diagnosis, over weeks to months, occasionally after a single lumbar puncture (rare).
Those at lower risk of visual loss who develop chronic disease with small fluctuations in disease activity, frequently with weight changes (the majority).
Those in disease remission and off treatment.

For most patients, the clinical priority is to monitor vision and help the disease into remission. The headache symptoms typically comprise the greatest morbidity for these patients (see later). For patients in remission (the fourth cohort) with no papilloedema noted on visits over several years, we will aim to discharge and advise annual optometrist assessments, but return if any symptoms recur.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: pathophysiology and management [^6d573acc]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Weight loss

Newborgwas the first to document diet as a treatment for IIH. In her uncontrolled prospective case series, nine patients were treated with a low-calorie rice diet with fluid (750–1250 mL/day) and sodium (<100 mg/day) restriction; the resultant weight loss (13–38%) was associated with improvement in IIH symptoms and assessments of papilloedema. The association between weight loss and improvement in papilloedema was further supported by several retrospective case reviews.

A low-salt diet is often recommended in IIH based on the association with orthostatic oedema in women.However, there is no direct evidence for the mechanism of action of salt restriction in vivo to reduce ICP.

On the basis of small studies showed that reduction of body weight by 6% was associated with improved visual function and papilledema grade in IIH,weight loss was studied in a prospectively designed cohort study.Patients with chronic IIH were treated with a severely restricted calorie-controlled diet (425 kcal/day) for 3 months following a 3-month observational period; 44% of the patients took a stable dose of acetazolamide during the study. Internal comparators prediet and postdiet within the same patient demonstrated significantly reduced ICP measurements (−8 cm CSF, p<0.001), headache scores and papilloedema. There was a 15% mean weight reduction (p<0.001). All qualitative and quantitative improvements were sustained at 3 months postdiet cessation. This study provided evidence that weight loss can lower ICP.

Long-term maintenance of weight loss is notoriously difficult and is typically as little as 2–4 kg at 2 years, irrespective of the dietary regime followed.In keeping with this, patients in the Birmingham weight loss studywere noted to regain weight in the year following discontinuation in the study and, consequently, their symptoms and signs of IIH relapsed, a documented phenomenon in IIH.

Obesity pharmacological therapies, such as tetrahydrolipstatin and phentermine/topiramate may induce a modest weight loss, but have not been specifically studied in IIH.There is class IV evidence for bariatric surgery as an effective treatment for IIH in obese patients, both in terms of symptom resolution and visual outcome.A randomised control trial evaluating bariatric surgery in IIH is currently underway (Clinical trials. gov ID NCT02124486).

Visual Outcomes

Only 5 studies reported the visual acuity,,,, (eTable 2,). Five studies gave brief descriptions of visual field loss but did not detail the type of visual fields that were performed,,, whereas 1 study did not report visual field outcomes.Six studies reported the perimetric mean deviation (PMD) from the 24-2 Humphrey visual field (HVF) analyzer (Level 3 to 1+,,,,,). Five studies commented on the presence or absence of papilledema (Level 4,,,), whereas formal Frisén grading and OCT imaging were recorded in 6 studies (Level 2− to 1+,,,,,).

Only 1 studynoted significant improvements in visual acuity, low-contrast visual acuity, HVF, and OCT measures of papilledema with a 15% reduction in weight (Level 2++). Generally, visual parameters improved over time; however, when a direct comparison was made in between groups, there was no significance found in most studies (eTable 2,). In IIH Treatment Trial (IIHTT),there was a modest, but statistically significant, improvement in the visual field MD, in conjunction with a significant difference in the weight loss between those on placebo and multicomponent intervention and those in the acetazolamide and multicomponent intervention arm (acetazolamide −7.50 kg, from 107.72 kg to 100.22 kg; placebo −3.45 kg, from 107.72 kg to 104.27 kg; treatment effect −4.05 kg, 95% CI −6.27 to −1.83 kg; p < 0.001) (Level 1+). A mediation analysis of the primary outcome PMD was performed to determine the degree to which the effect of acetazolamide on PMD was mediated by its effect on weight, but this was found to be not significant (p = 0.64). The IIHTT and IIH Weight Trial (IIHWT) RCTs, therefore did not find visual parameters that were directly associated with the extent of weight loss (Level 2+ to 1+), and all the other studies reporting visual outcomes did not directly compare changes in visual outcomes with weight outcomes (Level 4 to Level 2++).

### Treating sight threatening papilloedema in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: temporary versus permanent intervention [^30ef42c0]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Approximately 7% of all people living with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) require surgical intervention. Schwartzmann et al. have highlighted that there is a paucity of high‐quality research in this clinical circumstance.

When to intervene in IIH to avoid permanent sight loss is an enduring question. The Birmingham IIH:Life study offered a distinct perspective on phenotyping those with sight‐threatening disease and similarly noted that the height of the retinal nerve fibre layer could predict visual and structural outcomes. The authors used visual acuity as their outcome measure, which may be biased in papilloedema. In the IIH Treatment Trial, the investigators ‘over refracted’ the participants to omit the reduction in visual function caused by hyperopic shift. Visual acuity loss is a late sign in IIH, and it is important for all specialists to understand that visual field testing and structural imaging of the optic nerve head are instrumental in triangulating decision making.

It is logical that a higher lumbar puncture opening pressure suggests a more pathological disease state. We hypothesise that intracranial pressure (ICP) amplitude may be more informative than the absolute mean ICP. Reduction of ICP is one of the therapeutic aims in IIH, and this has been successfully evidenced in randomised control trials (RCTs) with acetazolamide, a very low calorie dietary intervention, bariatric surgery, and use of the glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist, Exenatide. None of the surgical interventions, temporary or permanent, have yet been subject to the rigour of an RCT: two RCTs are currently evaluating shunts and neurovascular stents in the United Kingdom (ISRCTN57142415) and in France (NCT05050864).

A previously published case that used a highly accurate telemetric ICP monitor in a person whose disease had become sight threatening provides insight here. Whilst awaiting definitive neurosurgical intervention, a lumbar drain was inserted where the ICP trace showed a marked drop in ICP. Three days later, the lumbar drain was clamped to facilitate the insertion of a ventricular peritoneal shunt. The drainage had not reversed the underlying disease process, and ICP rose from a mean −2.0 mmHg (equivalent to 2.7 cmCSF) to a mean 40.6 mmHg (equivalent to 55.2 cmCSF) over 2 h. Although the period of drainage was shorter than that published here, there is an increasing risk of adverse events such as meningitis and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis the longer a drain is in situ.

### CSF pressure, papilledema grade, and response to acetazolamide in the idiopathic intracranial hypertension treatment trial [^1c2fab89]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Previous reports suggest an association between the degree of optic nerve head edema and CSF pressure (CSFp) in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). We hypothesized that CSFp would be associated with Frisén papilledema grade (FPG) and other clinical features, and that FPG would modify the CSFp response to acetazolamide in participants in the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT). In the IIHTT, eligible patients underwent lumbar puncture (LP) prior to enrollment and were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: acetazolamide plus supervised diet or placebo plus supervised diet. Trial eligibility required baseline CSFp ≥250 mm H2O or ≥200 mm H2O with compelling clinical or imaging IIH findings. Associations between CSFp and FPG and other clinical features were examined at baseline. The effect of acetazolamide on 6-month change in CSFp was examined in those with low FPG (grades I-III) and those with high FPG (grades IV-V) at baseline. All 165 enrolled subjects had a baseline LP and 85 had an LP at 6 months. There was an association between CSFp and FPG at baseline: CSFp was more elevated in subjects with high FPG (378 ± 90 mm H2O, n = 50) than in subjects with low FPG (331 ± 77, n = 115, p = 0.002). At 6 months, acetazolamide had a similar effect on CSFp in subjects with high FPG (-79.9 mm H2O) and in subjects with low FPG (-50.9 mm H2O, p = 0.50). We found a modest association between CSFp and FPG. Acetazolamide had a beneficial effect on CSFp regardless of baseline FPG.

### Interventions for idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^6975bccf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension occurs throughout the world with an estimated incidence of one to three per 100,000 population per year. It occurs most commonly in obese young women but the cause is unknown. It presents a significant threat to sight and is associated with severe morbidity, in the form of headaches in most cases. Several different treatments have been proposed ranging from relatively conservative measures such as diuretic therapy to more invasive treatments such as optic nerve sheath fenestration, stenting of cerebral venous sinuses, or lumbo-peritoneal shunting.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of various forms of treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension with a view to producing an evidence-based treatment strategy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register, on The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2005) and EMBASE (1980 to January 2005).

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials in which any intervention used to treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension had been compared to placebo or to another form of treatment in people with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently assessed the search results for trials to be included in the review. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Since no trials met our inclusion criteria, no assessment of quality or meta-analysis was undertaken.

Main Results

No randomised controlled trials were found that met the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient information to generate an evidence-based management strategy for idiopathic intracranial hypertension. There is inadequate information regarding which treatments are truly beneficial and which are potentially harmful. Properly designed and executed trials are needed.

### The idiopathic intracranial hypertension treatment trial: clinical profile at baseline [^7ce3ff1e]. JAMA Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

To our knowledge, there are no large prospective cohorts of untreated patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) to characterize the disease.

Objective

To report the baseline clinical and laboratory features of patients enrolled in the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We collected data at baseline from questionnaires, examinations, automated perimetry, and fundus photography grading. Patients (n=165) were enrolled from March 17, 2010, to November 27, 2012, at 38 academic and private practice sites in North America. All participants met the modified Dandy criteria for IIH and had a perimetric mean deviation between -2 dB and -7 dB. All but 4 participants were women.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Baseline and laboratory characteristics.

Results

The mean (SD) age of our patients was 29.0 (7.4) years and 4 (2.4%) were men. The average (SD) body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 39.9 (8.3). Headache was the most common symptom (84%). Transient visual obscurations occurred in 68% of patients, back pain in 53%, and pulse synchronous tinnitus in 52%. Only 32% reported visual loss. The average (SD) perimetric mean deviation in the worst eye was -3.5 (1.1) dB, (range, -2.0 to -6.4 dB) and in the best eye was -2.3 (1.1) dB (range, -5.2 to 0.8 dB). A partial arcuate visual field defect with an enlarged blind spot was the most common perimetric finding. Visual acuity was 85 letters or better (20/20) in 71% of the worst eyes and 77% of the best eyes. Quality of life measures, including the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 and the Short Form-36 physical and mental health summary scales, were lower compared with population norms.

Conclusions and Relevance

The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial represents the largest prospectively analyzed cohort of untreated patients with IIH. Our data show that IIH is almost exclusively a disease of obese young women. Patients with IIH with mild visual loss have typical symptoms, may have mild acuity loss, and have visual field defects, with predominantly arcuate loss and enlarged blind spots that require formal perimetry for detection.

### Managing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in pregnancy: practical advice [^6e112634]. Practical Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

During pregnancy

Medical management

Most pregnant women with IIH come under obstetric consultant care. Patients with existing stable IIH typically do very well during pregnancy; those newly diagnosed with IIH while pregnant can be more challenging as their disease may be more aggressive.

During pregnancy, we aim to review patients who are in ocular remission every trimester, for the reassurance of both the patient and healthcare professionals involved in their care. This allows information to be passed to the obstetric team regarding safe delivery methods. For those not in ocular remission, the frequency of visits depends on their papilloedema and field status and is based on clinical judgement and experience. In the vast majority we review as frequently as every 6–8 weeks; however, some visits maybe done to evaluate visual assessment alone, with remote virtual review by the consultant with OCT imaging and visual fields.

Medication

Patients ideally should stop potentially teratogenic drugs (eg, acetazolamide, topiramate) before pregnancy, in order to avoid their use during the critical stages of embryogenesis in the first trimester. Pregnancies detected after the first trimester, may not benefit from rapid withdrawal and therefore should be based on IIH disease control. We recommend having individual patient discussions where there is ongoing actively raised ICP and if a patient is unable or unwilling to delay pregnancy. We understand that there are multifactorial reasons behind this decision and as clinicians our role is to enable an informed choice (table 1). We cannot, however, recommend their routine use in pregnancy. Teratogenicity in humans has not been reported for acetazolamide unlike topiramate, however, this is based on a small case series of 50 patients and not by large data, therefore, this should be factored into a risk–benefit assessment. From our experience, where use of these medications would be indicated during pregnancy, our patients can be managed by alternative methods outlined later in this article.

Headache management during pregnancy is important. When there is a new or changed headache in pregnancy, it is essential to identify red flag symptoms or signsand to investigate accordingly. The headache phenotype in IIH is typically migraine-likeand, therefore, its management during pregnancy is based on migraine management. Clinicians should weigh the risks and benefits of headache medication taken during pregnancy. Table 2 summarises appropriate treatments, based on published reviews and guidance.Unrestricted acute treatment of headache symptoms increases the risk of medication overuse headache in IIH during pregnancy; this should be discussed and managed appropriately.

### Idiopathic "benign" intracranial hypertension: case series and review [^7cb44aff]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Idiopathic "benign" intracranial hypertension is an uncommon but important cause of headache that can lead to visual loss. This study was undertaken to review our experience in the diagnosis and management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, giving special attention to treatments used. A retrospective chart review was conducted on 32 patients diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension between 1984 and 1995. Subjects included 23 females and ranged in age from 2 to 17.5 years. Headache was the most common symptom, followed by nausea and vomiting, double vision, and visual loss. Papilledema was the most common sign. Others were VIth cranial nerve palsy and compromised visual acuity at or within 3 months of presentation. Management included administration of acetazolamide or corticosteroids, lumboperitoneal shunt, optic nerve fenestration, and repeat lumbar puncture. Treatment combinations were used in 40% of cases. During follow-up, headache, papilledema, and decreased visual acuity persisted for longer than 10 months in a significant number of patients. We conclude that idiopathic intracranial hypertension causes significant short- and long-term morbidity with no proven effective treatment available. A prospective study is needed to establish the indications for treatment and the efficacy of the treatments used.

### Sodium bicarbonate use in the treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^fd38d1da]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This retrospective case-control study from 2008 to 2022 aimed to determine the effect of adjunctive sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 ) on treatment outcomes of and side effects of acetazolamide (ACZ) for the treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

Subjects/Methods

Retrospective data was collected via chart review. 288 eyes of 144 patients with IIH, including those taking ACZ alone (control group, n=89) vs. ACZ and NaHCO 3 (treatment group, n=56). The primary outcome measure was time to IIH resolution. Secondary outcomes included retinal nerve fibre layer thickness (RNFL), visual field mean deviation (VFMD), visual acuity (VA), discontinuation ACZ, and patient-reported side effects of ACZ.

Results

Cox proportional hazards model for the primary outcome yielded a hazard ratio of 0.800, which was statistically insignificant (95% CI, 0.57-1.13; p=0.200). There was no significant difference between groups when comparing RNFL, VFMD, VA, surgical intervention, or discontinuation of ACZ. The treatment group was more likely to experience side effects from ACZ prior to starting sodium bicarbonate therapy (p<0.001). Among the treatment group, 92.7% remained on NaHCO 3 until IIH resolution, and 9 of 12 (75%) subjects reported significant improvement in ACZ-related side effects.

Conclusion

Sodium bicarbonate does not appear to impact treatment outcomes in patients taking acetazolamide for IIH. Sodium bicarbonate may represent a reasonable adjunctive medication to help mitigate acetazolamide-related side effects in this group of patients.

### Surgical idiopathic intracranial hypertension treatment trial (SIGHT) [^87f6012b]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Eligible individuals will be randomly assigned with equal allocation to one of 3 treatment groups: medical therapy, medical therapy plus ONSF, or medical therapy plus VPS. Acetazolamide should be started on the day of randomization. Surgery should be performed as soon as possible, ideally within 3 days of randomization, but not more than 7 days. Medical therapy will consist of a low sodium weight loss diet and acetazolamide with or without furosemide. Treatment will start with acetazolamide 2 grams per day, with the dose increased as tolerated up to 4 grams per day. If there is no clinical improvement after 2 weeks of maximal dosage of acetazolamide, furosemide will be started at a dose of 40 mg per day and titrated up to 160-200 mg per day.

### Patterns of retinal damage and visual long-term consequences in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^7619f93a]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patient Cohort

This prospective cohort study consecutively enrolled patients with clinically suspected IIH at 2 tertiary headache centers in Denmark (Odense University Hospital [OUH] and the Danish Headache Center, Copenhagen University Hospital-Rigshospitalet, Glostrup, from January 2018 to September 2022). Clinical suspicion of IIH was based on objective findings (papilledema, abducens nerve palsy), symptoms (visual disturbances, headache, pulsatile tinnitus), and phenotype (young women with obesity). Patients had to be 18 years or older and were able to give informed consent. Exclusion criteria were missing data that impeded diagnosis, optic disc edema for reasons other than elevated ICP, pseudopapilledema, and elevated LPOP without papilledema due to other diseases. The diagnostic workup was standardized at both centers and included a structured interview, neurologic and ophthalmologic investigation, lumbar puncture, radiologic diagnostics, routine blood samples, and electrocardiography.

According to the 2013 diagnostic criteria,patients were classified as definite IIH, probable IIH, and definite IIH without papilledema (IIHWOP), suggested IIHWOP (IIH hereafter), or “without IIH” if not fulfilling the criteria (in “Diagnosis of IIH” further down in the “Methods” section). Secondary pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (PTCS) was diagnosed in patients in whom a recognized condition known to induce intracranial hypertension and papilledema was found. Patients with secondary PTCS were excluded.

In this study, we included only patients with IIH. Participants were investigated longitudinally from baseline to ophthalmologic remission (mentioned in “Definitions of Baseline, Remission, and IIH Severity” further down in the “Methods” section). If tolerated, patients were treated with acetazolamide from baseline until they achieved ophthalmologic remission. The daily acetazolamide dose was adjusted according to IIH severity and side effects.

Parts of this cohort are published elsewhereand were used to develop an evidence-based update of the diagnostic criteria.

Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Southern Denmark (VEK S-20170058) and the Danish Data Protection Agency (nos. 16/20512, June 6, 2016, and April 7, 2017). Data are reported in line with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology recommendationsand adherent to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients gave written informed consent.

### Expanding the clinical spectrum of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^6a549e76]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1 
Diagnostic criteria for idiopathic intracranial hypertension

It is recognized that some patients with IIH may be relatively asymptomatic, and papilledema may be incidentally discovered by eye care providers when the patient attends a routine eye examination or has an unrelated eye issue. In a recent study, this presentation accounted for 40.3% of all IIH patients assessed in tertiary neuro-ophthalmology clinics in one large North American city. Compared with patients with the classic presentation of IIH, incidentally discovered patients had a significantly lower CSF opening pressure, were less symptomatic, had better visual function, and required less treatment.

Over the past 20 years, an increasing number of radiological signs of intracranial hypertension (RAD-IH), such as empty sella, have been recognized in IIH patients (Fig. 2). It is crucial that clinicians do not immediately associate incidentally detected RAD-IH with a presumptive diagnosis of IIH, as these findings can also be seen in those with unrelated disorders or may indicate a state of previous intracranial hypertension. The vast majority of patients with incidentally detected RAD-IH do not have papilledema and, therefore, do not have IIH. Proceeding to lumbar puncture or empiric treatment with acetazolamide has the potential to cause patient harm.

### Unsupervised machine learning shows change in visual field loss in the idiopathic intracranial hypertension treatment trial [^394f1c2d]. Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We previously reported that archetypal analysis (AA), a type of unsupervised machine learning, identified and quantified patterns of visual field (VF) loss in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), referred to as archetypes (ATs). We assessed whether AT weight changes over time are consistent with changes in conventional global indices, whether visual outcome or treatment effects are associated with select AT, and whether AA reveals residual VF defects in eyes deemed normal after treatment.

Design

Analysis of data collected from a randomized controlled trial.

Participants

Two thousand eight hundred sixty-two VFs obtained from 165 participants during the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT).

Methods

We applied a 14-AT model derived from IIHTT VFs. We examined changes in individual AT weights over time for all study eyes and evaluated differences between treatment groups. We created an AT change score to assess overall VF change from baseline. We tested threshold baseline AT weights for association with VF outcome and treatment effect at 6 months. We determined the abnormal ATs with meaningful weight at outcome for VFs with a mean deviation (MD) of -2.00 dB or more.

Main Outcome Measures

Individual AT weighting coefficients and MD.

Results

Archetype 1 (a normal VF pattern) showed the greatest weight change for all study eyes, increasing from 11.9% (interquartile range [IQR], 0.44%-24.1%) at baseline to 31.2% (IQR, 16.0%-45.5%) at outcome (P < 0.001). Archetype 1 weight change (r = 0.795; P < 0.001) and a global score of AT change (r = 0.988; P < 0.001) correlated strongly with MD change. Study eyes with baseline AT2 (a mild diffuse VF loss pattern) weight of 44% or more (≥ 1 standard deviation more than the mean) showed higher AT2 weights at outcome than those with AT2 weight of < 44% at baseline (P < 0.001). Only the latter group showed a significant acetazolamide treatment effect. Archetypal analysis revealed residual VF loss patterns, most frequently representing mild diffuse loss and an enlarged blind spot in 64 of 66 study eyes with MD of -2.00 dB or more at outcome.

Conclusions

Archetypal analysis provides a quantitative approach to monitoring VF changes in IIH. Baseline AT features may be associated with treatment response and VF outcome. Archetypal analysis uncovers residual VF defects not otherwise revealed by MD.

### Efficacy and safety of GLP-1 and dual GIP / GLP-1 receptor agonists in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^686d29fc]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

In this systematic review and meta‐analysis, treatment with GLP‐1 or dual GIP/GLP‐1 RAs was associated with a significantly reduced risk of papilledema and visual disturbances or blindness, and with a near‐significant reduction in headache risk compared with standard‐of‐care IIH treatment. By contrast, the secondary efficacy and safety outcomes were derived exclusively from studies of GLP‐1 RAs. GLP‐1 RA treatment was associated with a significant reduction in MHD, with an average decrease of −3.6 and −4.8 days per month in GLP‐1 RA‐treated IIH patients versus controls between baseline and 3 months, and between baseline and the end of follow‐up, respectively. These estimates align with or even marginally exceed the previously established cut‐off of −2 MHD for clinically meaningful treatment benefits in IIH and chronic migraine RCTs. Notably, as indicated in current practice guidelines, despite the significant headache morbidity in IIH, no RCT data are available to guide headache management; thus, the current findings advocate for larger, well‐designed trials to robustly evaluate the efficacy of GLP‐1 and dual GIP/GLP‐1 RAs in IIH.

The prior results should also be viewed in conjunction with recently published data from the IIH Pressure Trial (ISRCTN12678718), the double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled phase I trial by Mitchell et al. which assessed the effects of the GLP‐1 RA exenatide on ICP in a cohort of 15 patients with active IIH (7 and 8 of whom received exenatide and placebo, respectively). In a post hoc exploratory analysis, the authors reported that exenatide was associated with significant improvements in cognitive performance, including enhanced fluid intelligence, processing speed, and episodic memory. Given the growing evidence of positive neurocognitive effects with GLP‐1 RA use, including in IIH cohorts, these agents are increasingly regarded as an attractive alternative to first‐line IIH treatments (e.g. acetazolamide and topiramate), both of which are associated with cognitive side effects and impairment, even in young patients.

MANAGEMENT OF HEADACHE IN INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION

The 2015 Cochrane review concluded that there is a lack of evidence to guide pharmacological treatment in IIH. There are few published randomised clinical trials and a small number of ongoing trials. None of these have focused on management of headache. Managing headache in IIH is an essential aspect of patient care and recent consensus guidelines have provided a practical approach to managing them [▪▪].

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: consensus guidelines on management [^ee6ae130]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Background

IIH occurs predominantly in women and although the underlying pathogenesis is not fully understood, it has a striking association with obesity.The combination of raised intracranial pressure, without hydrocephalus or mass lesion, normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition and where no underlying aetiology is found are accepted criteria for the diagnosis of IIH.The overall age-adjusted and gender-adjusted annual incidence is increasing and was reported to be 2.4 per 100 000 within the last decade (2002–2014).

The majority of patients presenting with IIH have symptoms that include a headache that is progressively more severe and frequent, as defined by International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) (figure 1).The headache phenotype is highly variable and may mimic other primary headache disorders. Other symptoms may include transient visual obscurations (unilateral or bilateral darkening of the vision typically seconds), pulsatile tinnitus, back pain, dizziness, neck pain, visual blurring, cognitive disturbances, radicular pain and typically horizontal diplopia (figure 1A): none of which are pathognomonic for IIH.Investigation and management depends on symptoms and signs and requires an interdisciplinary team approach.

For the individual patient, some can have permanent visual loss.Chronic headache significantly impacts quality of lifewith over half of patients with IIH reporting ongoing headaches at 12 months.

Clinical uncertainty exists, and IIH can be misdiagnosed.The 2015 Cochrane review has concluded that there is lack of evidence to guide pharmacological treatment in IIH.Randomised clinical trials are currently infrequent in this field due to the rarity of the disease, the lack of understanding of the underlying pathological mechanisms and limited disease-modifying therapies.

MANAGEMENT OF MIGRAINE IN INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION

As migraine is the predominant phenotype (Table 1), the use of migraine therapies has been recommended [▪▪]. Migraine attacks may benefit from triptan acute therapy used in combination with either a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory or paracetamol and an antiemetic with pro-kinetic properties. Their use should be limited to in the region of 2 days/week or a maximum of 10 days/month. Where medication overuse coexists, this should be addressed, and if chronic migraine is present, preventive strategies have been recommended [▪▪,]. Caution should be observed before selecting drugs that could increase weight such as β-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, sodium valproate, pizotifen and flunarizine. Care should be taken in those medications that exacerbate depression which is a frequent co-morbidity in IIH, such as β-blockers, topiramate and flunarizine [▪▪].

A meta-analysis demonstrated that topiramate was effective in reducing headache frequency and was reasonably well tolerated in adult patients with episodic migraine. It may have additional benefits of suppressing appetite and have an effect on reducing ICP through carbonic anhydrase inhibition. In-vivo studies demonstrated that both subcutaneous and oral administration of topiramate significantly lowered ICP in rodents, whereas other drugs tested, including acetazolamide, furosemide, amiloride and octreotide, did not significantly reduce ICP. Topiramate utility in IIH reported in an open-label study which randomly assigned 40 patients with IIH to acetazolamide or topiramate and demonstrated treatment equivalence with all experiencing improvement in visual fields.

Other preventive therapies, some of which are not licenced for migraine, could include candesartan because of its lack of weight gain and depressive side-effects or potentially non-invasive neuromodulation. Botulinum toxin A, which is a licenced therapy for migraine, could also be useful in those with coexisting chronic migraine. Other strategies, such as mindfulness, may suit some patients.

### The effect of acetazolamide and weight loss on intraocular pressure in idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients [^be100ed8]. Journal of Glaucoma (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Acetazolamide (ACZ) lowers intraocular pressure (IOP), acutely in normal eyes and both acutely and chronically in eyes with glaucoma, and cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFp), chronically in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). We hypothesize chronic daily ACZ would significantly reduce IOP and contribute to a translaminar pressure gradient change reflected by alteration in the CSFp-IOP difference and the deformation of the neural canal in patients with IIH and no glaucoma.

Patients and Methods

Before randomization to ACZ or placebo treatment for 6 months, 165 participants in the IIH Treatment Trial had evaluations that included Goldmann applanation, CSFp measurement, and optical coherence tomography determination of the neural canal deformation. These measures were repeated at the 6-month outcome.

Results

The IOP was not significantly decreased from baseline at 1, 3, or 6 months in eyes in both treatment groups. At month 6, the amount of ACZ or weight modification did not correlate with any IOP change. The 6-month mean change in neural canal deformation was 0.96 and -0.04 (P=0.001) and in CSFp was -128 and -38mmH2O (P=0.001), but CSFp-IOP difference change was not significant, in the ACZ and placebo groups, respectively.

Conclusions

ACZ does not reduce the IOP in eyes without glaucoma but does decrease the pathologic elevated CSFp, providing evidence that normal systems can compensate for chronic medication effects. The CSFp-IOP is not a direct marker of translaminar pressure gradient and the ACZ normalization of the neural canal deformation appears due to CSFp reduction alone.

### What is new about idiopathic intracranial hypertension? An updated review of mechanism and treatment [^a0813232]. Cephalalgia (2006). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is the syndrome of raised intracranial pressure without clinical, laboratory or radiological evidence of intracranial pathology. IIH is a relatively rare disease but rapidly increasing incidence is reported due to a global increasing incidence of obesity. Disease course is generally said to be self-limiting within a few months. However, some patients experience a disabling condition of chronic severe headache and visual disturbances for years that limit their capacity to work. Permanent visual defects are serious and not infrequent complications. The pathophysiology of IIH is still not fully understood. Advances in neuroimaging techniques have facilitated the exclusion of associated conditions that may mimic IIH. No causal treatment is yet known for IIH and existing treatment is symptomatic and rarely sufficient. The aim of this review is to provide an updated overview of this potentially disabling disease which may show a future escalating incidence due to obesity. Theories of pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies are discussed.

Q13 What therapeutic strategies are useful for headache in IIH?

Migrainous phenotype is noted in 68% of IIH patients with headache.Despite the lack of clinical trials, the use of migraine therapies in IIH patients with migraine headaches may be useful. Headaches with migrainous features include moderate to severe pain that maybe throbbing with photophobia, phonophobia, nausea and movement intolerance.
Migraine attacks may benefit from triptan acute therapy used in combination with either a NSAID or paracetamol and an antiemetic with prokinetic properties.Their use should be limited to 2 days per week or a maximum of 10 days per month.
Migraine preventative strategies could also be tried. These are most likely to be effective in those in whom the ICP is settling and also in those whom the papilloedema has resolved (IIH in ocular remission).
National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines for migraine prevention therapy is useful.
Caution must be observed before selecting drugs that could increase weight (beta blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, sodium valproate, pizotifen and flunarizine) or those that could exacerbate depression, a frequent comorbidity in IIH (beta blockers, topiramate and flunarizine).
Topiramate (see 10. Are there other drugs that are helpful in IIH? in table 3) may help with weight loss by suppressing appetite and have an effect on reducing ICP through carbonic anhydrase inhibition. Patients need to be cautioned about potential side effects of depression, cognitive slowing, reduction of the efficacy of the contraceptive pill/oral contraceptives and potential of teratogenic effects.
Where topiramate has excessive side effects, zonisamide may be an alternative.
In patients with migraine, candesartan can be a useful alternative to a beta blocker due to its lack of weight gain and depressive side effects.Alternatively, venlafaxine is weight neutral and helpful with depression symptoms.
Botulinum toxin A may be useful in those with coexisting chronic migraine; there are no studies of botulinum toxin A in IIH.
As with treatment of migraine, preventative drugs need to be started slowly and increased to a therapeutic tolerated dose for 3 months to enable a therapeutic trial.
Similar to the treatment of migraine, many of these drugs are used off label in IIH.
Lifestyle advice should be given with all headache disorders, as these can have considerable impact on the disease course. Strategies should be implemented to limit caffeine intake. Ensure regular meals and adequate hydration, exercise programme and sleep hygiene. Behavioural and stress management techniques can be implemented such as yoga, cognitive–behavioural therapy and mindfulness.

### The effect of GLP-1RA exenatide on idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a randomized clinical trial [^9b7981db]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide, with placebo to reduce ICP in patients with active IIH. We have found a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in ICP in the treatment arm as compared to the placebo arm both acutely and after 12 weeks of dosing. The drug was safe and well-tolerated. This trial establishes the successful translation of preclinical data into humans and is the first to demonstrate a new drug treatment for IIH that significantly reduces ICP in IIH.

The hallmark of IIH is raised ICP, which causes headaches and visual loss (through compression of the optic nerve and papilloedema). Therefore, to evaluate the efficacy of exenatide the primary outcome for this trial was chosen as ICP.A significant reduction in ICP was seen acutely at 2.5 h of −4.2 mmHg (equivalent to −5.7 cmCSF), which corresponds to peak exenatide serum levels. The reduction in ICP was also noted at 24 h [reduction of 4.7 mmHg (equivalent to 6.4 cmCSF); Table 1 and Fig. 2]. There are no studies that have evaluated other drugs (used off-label) to treat IIH that have shown ICP reduction within the first 24 h of administration. IIH patients can deteriorate rapidly (over days)and hence a drug with rapid onset of action is clinically advantageous for IIH. A drug treatment that can rapidly reduce ICP is also of potential relevance for other conditions characterized by raised ICP, such as following traumatic brain injury and stroke.

A significant reduction in ICP was also noted after prolonged dosing at 12 weeks (−4.1 mmHg equivalent to −5.6 cmCSF; Table 1 and Fig. 2), demonstrating durability of dosing. The minimal clinically important change in ICP in those with IIH has yet to be determined.There have been four previous randomized control trials in IIH, and one prospective crossover trial.Four of these have used ICP as an outcome measure, with the magnitude of treatment effect between trial arms ranging from 5.9 cmCSF (acetazolamide and diet),−6.0 (1.8) (by bariatric surgery)and −6.2 cmCSF (through low-calorie diet).The efficacy in these studies is akin to what we have observed following treatment with exenatide for 3 months (−5.6 cmCSF).

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^29d0d4a1]. Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The history, diagnosis, and therapy of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) (pseudotumor cerebri) are reviewed. Theories of pathogenesis are considered, the clinical presentation is described, and potential diagnostic and therapeutic challenges are explored.

Methods

An extensive literature review of IIH and related conditions (secondary pseudotumor syndromes) was performed. The history of and rationale for the diagnosis and medical and surgical approaches to treatment are reviewed. Available outcome studies are presented.

Results

Diagnosis of IIH requires that the modified Dandy criteria be satisfied. Multiple potential contributing causes of intracranial hypertension must be identified or excluded. The clinical presentation most often includes headaches and papilledema, but many other findings have been described. The most important goal of therapy is to prevent or arrest progressive visual loss. Medical therapies include alleviation of associated systemic diseases, discontinuation of contributing medications, provision of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and weight loss. Surgical therapies include lumboperitoneal shunting, ventriculoperitoneal shunting, and optic nerve sheath fenestration. On the basis of the advantages and disadvantages of these treatment modalities, a suggested treatment paradigm is presented.

Conclusion

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is the term to be adopted instead of pseudotumor cerebri. IIH remains an enigmatic diagnosis of exclusion. However, prompt diagnosis and thorough evaluation and treatment are crucial for preventing visual loss and improving associated symptoms.

### Novel advances in monitoring and therapeutic approaches in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^693d9c3c]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

The key management principles are addressing the underlying modifiable risk factor of weight gain; protecting the vision through regular assessment and escalation of treatment when sight is threatened; and reducing headache morbidity through active management. Importantly, considerations included the indication for CSF diversion surgery in declining visual function. However, alternative interventions, such as neurovascular stenting do not yet have evidence to recommend them. It should also be stressed that headache alone is not an indication for CSF diversion with a majority of patients having persistent headache following the procedure.

The major achievement of this document is the interdisciplinary working to provide a framework to standardize care for those with IIH. This standardized approach to care has been subsequently published in the European Headache Federation Guidelines for IIH.

### Evaluation and management of adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^8c28ea1e]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Horizon scanning for IIH shows that research is active and that metabolic concepts may potentially provide more understanding of the cause and provide evidence for innovative therapeutic opportunities.A phase 2 randomised control trial with the first novel drug treatment for IIH has finished recruitment; a phase 3 randomised control trial investigating the best method for weight loss is underway; other surgical trials are in planning.

This infographic highlights three areas that are covered by the consensus guideline for adult IIH, which are: (1) investigation of papilloedema and diagnosis of IIH; (2) management strategies; and (3) investigation and management of acute exacerbation of headache in established IIH(figure 1).

Key points

Cerebral venography is an essential part of the work-up to exclude venous sinus thrombosis as a cause of papilloedema.
Lumbar puncture opening pressure forms part of the diagnostic criteria; however, most clinicians feel there is a ‘grey zone’ between 25 cmCSF and 30 cmCSF, which may not be pathological.
Those with fulminant or precipitous visual decline need urgent surgical treatment, preferably with a ventriculoperintoneal shunt.
All patients diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension need sensitive and appropriate discussion regarding weight loss (the only disease-modifying treatment).
Those with acute exacerbation of headache do not require further neuroimaging or repeat lumbar puncture, unless there are red flag symptoms/signs of infection, or papilloedema with precipitous visual decline.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: consensus guidelines on management [^aee75c67]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Scope

This is a consensus document to provide practical information for best practice in uniform investigation and treatment strategies based on current literature and opinion from a specialist interest group (SIG) for adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). This should increase awareness of IIH among clinicians and improve outcomes for patients.

The target audience for this statement includes neurologists, ophthalmologists, neurosurgeons, radiologists, emergency medicine specialists, physicians, ear nose and throat specialists and other clinicians who investigate and manage IIH. It also contains information that will be of interest to those in primary care and other healthcare professionals.

The increasing economic burden of IIH has been highlighted by a number of groups.Clear guidance will help educate the attending doctors to manage these patients appropriately. This will help reduce the repeat unsolicited emergency hospital attendances and reduce IIH-related disability. There are a number of ongoing clinical trials in IIH and as evidence for medical and surgical management evolves in IIH this document will require timely updates.

### The effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists on ocular parameters in idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients: a retrospective study [^640e3d2f]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a neurological condition marked by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) with no evident secondary cause, primarily affecting obese females of childbearing age. While acetazolamide is the standard medical therapy, weight loss is also considered a first-line treatment. Recently, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists have garnered interest for IIH management due to their weight reduction and potential CSF production-decreasing effects. This study evaluates the effect of GLP-1 agonists on ocular parameters of IIH.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from 79 IIH patients who met the modified Dandy criteria and were diagnosed between January 2016 and July 2023. All included patients received acetazolamide, while some received additional therapy with a GLP-1 agonist, either liraglutide or semaglutide. The acetazolamide monotherapy group was compared with the combined therapy group. Data on ocular parameters and BMI changes were collected from the Soroka Medical Center's electronic medical records. Patients with incomplete electronic documentation or with any history of invasive interventions were excluded from the study.

Results

When comparing 68 patients on acetazolamide alone to 11 patients on combined therapy with acetazolamide and GLP-1 agonists, no significant differences were found in any of the parameters: papilledema grade, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), visual field (VF) or OCT RNFL thickness improvements over a 12-month period. Seven of the 11 patients in the combined therapy group completed the full year of follow up data and were included in the secondary outcome analysis, which revealed a trend of BMI reduction and possible acetazolamide dose reduction following GLP-1 initiation.

Conclusion

This study suggests that GLP-1 agonists effectively reduce BMI, a major risk factor for IIH. Moreover, our analysis of seven patients from the combined therapy group suggests that GLP-1 agonists allow for a reduction in acetazolamide dosage in the treatment of IIH without changing the clinical outcome.

### Guiding follow-up of paediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension with optical coherence tomography [^746567e0]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is uncommon in the paediatric population. Papilloedema is the hallmark sign and patients can suffer permanent vision loss as a consequence. We describe the role of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the follow-up of two paediatric patients with newly diagnosed IIH. Patient A presented with vomiting and examination showed ophthalmoplaegia and papilloedema. She was treated with acetazolamide, furosemide and therapeutic lumbar punctures. Patient B presented with incidental papilloedema and was treated with acetazolamide and she reported intermittent headache during follow-up. Fundoscopic examinations for both patients showed persistent blurred disc margins but OCT examinations documented improvement of average retinal nerve fibre layers. OCT may be of value in monitoring for recurrence in paediatric IIH.

### Emerging themes in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^bf0c86f3]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a rare disorder of unknown cause characterised by raised intracranial pressure (ICP) in the absence of underlying structural pathology. IIH typically affects women of reproductive age, with a significant association with obesity and recent weight gain. Although IIH is considered a rare syndrome, the incidence is increasing, and appears to reflect country specific rates of obesity.

The majority of patients with IIH present with headache, visual disturbance (e.g. loss of peripheral vision, transient visual obscurations, horizontal double vision) and pulsatile tinnitus. Some patients also experience back pain, dizziness and cognitive disturbances. Papilloedema (swelling of the optic nerve head) is a hallmark feature of IIH and left untreated could lead to optic atrophy and permanent visual loss. Rarely, patients present with papilloedema in the absence of any other symptoms. Preserving the vision is a key priority in the management of IIH. Commonly, patients with IIH develop chronic headaches, which significantly reduce quality of life and are typically difficult to treat.

In 2018, the first consensus guidelines for the investigation and management of IIH in adults was established. It outlines diagnostic principles and key management strategies, namely to treat underlying disease accomplished by weight loss, preserve vision via emergency surgery (when required) and minimise headache morbidity.

The exact pathology underlying IIH remains unknown. Improved treatment options are an unmet clinical need in this disease area. Recent mechanistic studies have identified therapeutic targets such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), which have formed the basis of IIH randomised clinical trials. The aim of this review is to inform the reader of emerging issues and present new key highlights in the therapeutic development for IIH.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: pathophysiology and management [^f5838af8]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare but important disease associated with significant morbidity. There is an expected rise in prevalence in line with the escalating global burden of obesity. Modern revisions in the terminology and diagnostic criteria for IIH help guide clinicians in investigations and researchers in standardising recruitment criteria for clinical trials. The pathophysiology of IIH is incompletely characterised; suggested underpinning mechanisms include the role of cerebrospinal fluid regulation as well as metabolic and endocrinological perspectives. Recent treatment trials are providing insights into the management but debate still surrounds key areas in treatment. This review will provide an up-to-date discussion on the potential pathogenic mechanisms and management of IIH.

### Current concepts in pseudotumor cerebri [^f75b02da]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a potentially blinding disorder of unknown cause, characterized by elevated intracranial pressure in the absence of a mass lesion, venous sinus thrombosis, or meningitis. This review summarizes recent developments and insights from leading treatment trials, emerging treatment options, and evolving ways to evaluate IIH.

Recent Findings

The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial is the first large-scale, randomized, prospective study to evaluate medical treatment of patients with mild vision loss. These data have facilitated our understanding of baseline clinical manifestations, including impact on quality of life and treatment outcomes. Recent hypotheses and studies evaluating the role of cerebral venous sinus stenosis and stenting are discussed. Technological advances in optical coherence tomography are emerging to provide novel ways of evaluating and tracking optic disc swelling in IIH.

Summary

Recent changes in defining IIH, understanding the impact and treatment of mild visual loss, and the roles that cerebral venous stenting and optical coherence tomography might have in clinical practice provide the framework to better treat patients with IIH.

### The relationship between optic disc volume, area, and frisén score in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^6b88614d]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare measurements of papilledema using fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and Frisén score in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

Design

Retrospective, noncomparative analysis of randomized controlled trial data.

Methods

The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT) evaluated weight management and treatment with acetazolamide compared with placebo in patients with IIH and mild visual loss. Among the 126 subjects in the IIHTT OCT substudy, fundus photographs and OCT scans of the optic disc were taken at baseline and at 6 and 12 months after enrollment. Trained readers scored each eye using a modified Frisén scale and measured the area of disc elevation. OCT scans assessed optic nerve head (ONH) volume. Correlations between volume and area were computed for both study and nonstudy eyes.

Results

Disc area and ONH volume were positively correlated at baseline (R 2 = 0.77 in study eyes, P < .001). Correlations between area and volume were similar in the treatment groups at baseline, but were weaker in the acetazolamide group compared with the placebo group at 6 months (R 2 = 0.25 vs R 2 = 0.76 in study eyes) and 12 months (R 2 = 0.19 vs R 2 = 0.65 in study eyes). At 6 and 12 months after enrollment, there was no consistent relationship between Frisén score, disc area, and ONH volumes in the acetazolamide group.

Conclusion

Frisén score fails to reflect the photographic area and OCT volume of papilledema after treatment with acetazolamide. Clinicians should use caution when using the Frisén scale to monitor the effect of treatment on papilledema over time.

### Indications for the performance of intracranial endovascular neurointerventional procedures: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^4cffa04d]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)—venous sinus disease and endovascular stenting context: IIH is defined by elevated intracranial pressure without a structural lesion; long-term risk involves visual deterioration and disabling symptoms, and transverse sinus stenosis is almost universally seen in IIH. Primary medical treatments include weight loss, acetazolamide, diuretics, and high-volume lumbar punctures. Endovascular approaches aim to create a lower-resistance pathway in at least one transverse or sigmoid sinus; because imaging assessment correlates poorly with symptoms, inclusion criteria generally include intraluminal pressure gradients, with most treated patients having measured gradients of >10 mm Hg. Stenting has usually been performed with self-expanding stents; angioplasty has been described with stent placement, but angioplasty without stenting has not been described, and periprocedural anticoagulation or antiplatelet management is not standardized.

### Acetazolamide for mild visual loss in intracranial hypertension (...) [^78e89294]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Importance Acetazolamide is commonly used to treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension, but there is insufficient information to establish an evidence base for its use. Objective To determine whether acetazolamide is beneficial in improving vision when added to a low-sodium weight reduction diet in patients with IIH and mild visual loss. Design, Setting, and Participants Multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study of acetazolamide in 165 participants with IIH and mild visual loss who received a low-sodium weight-reduction diet. Participants were enrolled at 38 academic and private practice sites in North America from March 2010 to November 2012 and followed up for 6 months. All participants met the modified Dandy criteria for IIH and had a perimetric mean deviation between −2 dB and −7 dB. The mean age was 29 years and all but 4 participants were women.

Interventions Low-sodium weight-reduction diet plus the maximally tolerated dosage of acetazolamide or matching placebo for 6 months. Conclusions and Relevance In patients with IIH and mild visual loss, the use of acetazolamide with a low-sodium weight-reduction diet compared with diet alone resulted in modest improvement in visual field function. The clinical importance of this improvement remains to be determined. Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT01003639. Lubow and Kuhr11 reported a series of patients with IIH, many of whom were treated successfully with acetazolamide and weight reduction. Data on the dosage of acetazolamide, however, are based on limited experience. Gücer and Viernstein12 used intracranial pressure monitoring and showed gradual CSF pressure reduction in patients receiving acetazolamide once they reached a dosage of 4 g/d.

These studies were uncontrolled, and to our knowledge there are no properly designed clinical trials to guide therapy in IIH.
13. Because the efficacy of pharmacologic therapy has not been adequately studied, the Neuro-Ophthalmology Research Disease Investigator Consortium IIH Study Group developed the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial, a multicenter, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled study of acetazolamide in participants with mild visual loss. All participants received a lifestyle modification program that focused on weight reduction with a low-sodium diet because this intervention is widely accepted in practice and there was no equipoise regarding its use. The purpose of the trial was to determine the effect of acetazolamide in reducing or reversing visual loss after 6 months of treatment when added to a weight-reduction program.
14.

We chose an upper limit of −2 dB so that participants would have some room to improve; −7 dB was chosen as a lower limit to maintain clinical equipoise because enough investigators believed that surgical treatments were necessary for participants with more severe visual loss. Participants needed to have bilateral papilledema, have an elevated CSF opening pressure, be untreated with regard to IIH, and have no secondary cause of increased intracranial pressure present; other entry criteria are found in eTable 2 in the Supplement. The study drug was acetazolamide or matching placebo tablets. The initial dosage of study drug was 4 tablets daily in 2 divided doses, followed by dosage increases of 1 tablet every week up to a maximum dosage of 4 g/d for participants receiving acetazolamide.

### Secondary intracranial hypertension in pediatric patients with leukemia [^8ba6efe2]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

We investigated the clinical characteristics of a pediatric population with hemato-oncological disease and intracranial hypertension, analyze the therapeutic response and outcome, and compare its characteristics with respect to a control group with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed patients with hemato-oncological disease and secondary intracranial hypertension in our center during the past five years. We compared these individuals with a historical cohort with idiopathic intracranial hypertension from our institution (control group).

Results

We identified eight patients, all with leukemia, and 21 controls. Mean age at diagnosis was 10.6 years, and 62% of individuals were female. Most of them were under treatment with drugs (62% corticosteroids, 75% active chemotherapy). Mean opening pressure of cerebrospinal fluid was 35cmH 2 O. All had headache, but only 28% complained of visual symptoms. Only 12.5% exhibited papilledema at the time of diagnosis (versus 71% in controls). All of them were treated with acetazolamide, with average therapy duration of nine months, and all had a favorable outcome (versus 57% of controls who needed second-line treatment). None of them showed long-term visual complications (versus 20% of controls).

Conclusions

Patients with hemato-oncological disease and secondary intracranial hypertension may not develop typical symptomatology. Thus, diagnosis and recognition of this entity among this cohort may be difficult. Associated factors are diverse and do not show an obvious causal relationship. A high index of suspicion must be maintained for diagnosis, because a favorable outcome is expected with prompt treatment. Acetazolamide is effective as a first-line therapy and caused few side effects.

### Quality of life in idiopathic intracranial hypertension at diagnosis: IIH treatment trial results [^8667d190]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The study purpose was to examine vision-specific and overall health-related quality of life (QOL) at baseline in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial patients who were newly diagnosed and had mild visual loss. We also sought to determine the associations between vision-specific QOL scores and visual symptoms, visual function, pain, headache-related disability, and obesity.

Methods

We assessed QOL using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25), and 10-Item NEI-VFQ-25 Neuro-Ophthalmic Supplement. We compared these results with those of previously reported idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) QOL studies. We assessed relationships between QOL and other clinical characteristics.

Results

Among 165 participants with IIH (161 women and 4 men with a mean age ± SD of 29.2 ± 7.5 years), vision-specific QOL scores were reduced compared with published values for disease-free controls. Scores of participants were comparable to published results for patients with multiple sclerosis and a history of optic neuritis. A multiple linear regression model for the NEI-VFQ-25 composite score found that perimetric mean deviation in the best eye, visual acuity in the worst eye, visual symptoms, and pain symptoms (headache, neck pain), but not obesity, were independently associated with QOL.

Conclusions

IIH affects QOL at time of diagnosis even in patients with mild visual impairment. Vision-specific QOL in patients with newly diagnosed IIH may be as decreased as that for patients with other neuro-ophthalmic disorders. IIH treatment should target visual loss and other symptoms of increased intracranial pressure associated with reduced QOL. Reduced QOL does not simply reflect obesity, an underlying IIH risk factor.

### Advances in the understanding of headache in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^d5d2e900]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

HEADACHE DISABILITY SCORE

The Headache Impact Test (HIT)-6, which is a validated for use across headache disorders, is commonly used. Most agree at baseline the HIT-6 measures substantial to severe impact on IIH patients. Headache disability is multifactorial, and comorbid conditions can influence disability for example those with a high risk of sleep apnoea, as determined by the Berlin questionnaire, had a higher HIT-6 score in the IIHTT (P = 0.04) [▪▪].

In the Birmingham weight loss study, baseline HIT-6 was 57.5 (±9.0) which significantly improved after weight loss to 46.9 (±10.1) (P = 0.004). The IIHTT HIT-6 mean baseline was similar to 59.7 (±9.0) reducing both arms by over 9 points, which did not reach significance [▪▪]. In an open-label extension of the IIHTT, 96 participants were sorted into remaining on acetazolamide (n = 34), switch placebo to acetazolamide (n = 35), switch acetazolamide to no treatment (n = 16) and switch placebo to no treatment (n = 11). At month 12, those switched placebo to acetazolamide had significant improvement HIT-6 with −3.70 point reduction (P = 0.01). This is an interesting fact; however, caution must be used in interpreting this as headache outcomes are prone to placebo effects and total blinding to treatment allocation is hampered by knowledge of trial arm allocation and through the experience of drug-related side-effects (such as use of acetazolamide and experiencing paraesthesia).

### Acute bilateral vision loss secondary to cerebral venous thrombosis-induced intracranial hypertension: a case report [^e0c169e1]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

This case highlights the rapid loss of visual function in a patient with raised ICP secondary to CVT. Malignant idiopathic intracranial hypertension has been defined as a constellation of acute onset of symptoms of elevated ICP, rapid worsening of vision loss within 4 weeks from the onset of symptoms, and rapid worsening of vision over a few days. Patients with raised intracranial tension are usually associated with good visual acuity initially. Acute onset bilateral loss of vision with bilateral disc edema is more common in the setting of optic neuritis, malignant hypertension, and anterior ischemic optic neuropathies. Raised cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure and radiological findings of CVT clinched the diagnosis in favour of a malignant rise in intracranial tension secondary to CVT.

Aggressive medical and surgical treatment is essential in the presence of vision-threatening disease. Thambisetty et al. used high doses of acetazolamide and repeated lumbar punctures to bring down the ICP. Both unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin are routinely used to manage CVT. This patient responded well to medical treatment in the form of high doses of acetazolamide and systemic anticoagulation. At the same time, the presence of systemic risk factors associated with thrombosis was dealt with. Previous studies have highlighted the role of surgical interventions in bringing down the intracranial tension. However, our patient responded well to medical management, and surgical treatment was not required. Sutraye et al. have reported a case of rapidly progressive vision loss in 44-year-old obese woman due to fulminant idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure was raised to 42 cm of H 2 O. Management with medical therapy and urgent thecoperiteoneal shunt improved visual function in both eyes. The presence of optic disc pallor in spite of good visual recovery is indicative of residual mild optic nerve damage. This highlights the importance of early diagnosis and treatment initiation in such cases to avoid severe optic nerve damage.
