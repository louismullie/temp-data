## Question

85 year old female with chronic neck pain. Neck x-ray showing the following impression: "X-ray shows mild levocurvature, grade 1 anterolisthesis of C6 upon C7, no evidence of motion, vertebral body heights maintained, mild to moderate degenerative change most significant at C3–4 through C6–7, evidenced by disc space narrowing, uncovertebral hypertrophy with endplate spurring, and facet degeneration. Mild nonspecific prevertebral soft tissue prominence of the lower cervical spine". Recommended next steps?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate next steps for an 85-year-old woman with chronic neck pain, grade 1 anterolisthesis at C6–C7, and multilevel degenerative changes as seen on X-ray. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether red flags are present. Then, I should verify the imaging implications of the X-ray findings, especially the anterolisthesis and degenerative changes. Next, I will review guideline-based imaging recommendations and decide between MRI and CT. After that, I need to consider the differential diagnosis, including degenerative cervical myelopathy and radiculopathy, and how to screen for them. Then, I should outline immediate management steps, including conservative care and when to consider facet-directed diagnostics. Finally, I will define escalation triggers, surgical indications, and special considerations in an older adult, and close with a concise, prioritized plan with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and red flags. Chronic axial neck pain in an 85-year-old with multilevel degenerative changes is common, but I need to check for neurologic deficits, gait disturbance, hand clumsiness, hyperreflexia, clonus, Babinski, or bowel/bladder changes that would suggest degenerative cervical myelopathy, and I should also screen for infection, malignancy, or inflammatory disease that would alter imaging choices and urgency [^113VSiEE] [^113RCjA4] [^113zDrdG].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging implications of the X-ray. Grade 1 anterolisthesis at C6–C7 with disc space narrowing, uncovertebral hypertrophy, endplate spurring, and facet degeneration indicates multilevel spondylosis and could contribute to central canal or foraminal stenosis. However, plain films cannot assess cord or root compression, so advanced imaging is warranted to define neural element involvement and stability of the listhesis, especially in this age group where degenerative changes are highly prevalent and often asymptomatic on imaging [^114rZrBw] [^114GuzUT] [^113uu7do].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about modality choice. I initially thought CT might be better to characterize bony detail and the anterolisthesis, but I should confirm guideline direction. The ACR recommends MRI as the next imaging for chronic neck pain when X-rays show degenerative changes and there are no red flags, because MRI best evaluates cord, roots, and soft tissues, whereas CT is reserved for specific scenarios like suspected ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament or MRI contraindication [^114rZrBw] [^1156VQ3e] [^113VSiEE].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis. Degenerative cervical myelopathy is a leading concern in older adults with multilevel spondylosis; I need to check for subtle gait imbalance, hand dexterity decline, sensory changes, and long-tract signs, and correlate with MRI for cord compression, T2 cord signal, and canal diameter, because DCM is the most common cause of adult spinal cord dysfunction and progression can be unpredictable, warranting timely recognition and referral when suspected [^113VSiEE] [^1161pkAJ] [^115rtJ4w]. But wait, what if symptoms are radicular rather than myelopathic; given the C6–C7 level and foraminal encroachment from spondylosis, C7 radiculopathy remains plausible and should be screened with a focused neurologic exam of the C7 distribution and reflexes, recognizing that radicular pain often improves spontaneously but may require intervention if persistent or severe [^111pEere] [^116TbxQx].

> Next, I should review immediate management while awaiting advanced imaging. Conservative therapy is first-line for chronic axial neck pain without myelopathy: physical therapy emphasizing posture, range of motion, and isometric strengthening; NSAIDs or acetaminophen as tolerated; a soft cervical collar for short-term flares; and patient education on activity modification and ergonomics, with expectations set that improvement is often gradual and multimodal [^114rZrBw] [^1164obWx] [^117BSnWs]. I need to ensure we avoid overtreatment; routine imaging without neurologic deficits is not generally indicated, but here MRI is justified by the abnormal X-ray and the need to exclude cord or root compression, so we are not violating appropriateness criteria [^1149x94W] [^114rZrBw].

> Let me consider facet-mediated pain as a contributor. Facet joints are implicated in a substantial proportion of chronic neck pain, and in carefully selected patients after failed conservative care, diagnostic medial branch blocks can help confirm a facet pain generator; however, I should confirm that we meet criteria such as pain ≥ 3 months, moderate intensity, and no better explanatory pathology before proceeding, and I should counsel that false positives occur and that ≥ 50% pain relief is commonly used as a positive block threshold in contemporary guidelines [^115wWxw9] [^113K7qW7] [^1139Gs5L]. Hold on, I should verify timing; consensus supports at least a 6-week trial of conservative therapy before prognostic blocks when feasible, which aligns with a stepwise, cost-conscious approach in this 85-year-old [^114q1sMZ] [^116iqNxi].

> I should double-check escalation triggers and thresholds. If MRI demonstrates cord compression with clinical myelopathy, especially moderate to severe, surgical decompression is generally recommended to halt progression and improve function; for mild myelopathy, either structured rehabilitation with close monitoring or surgery can be considered, but given the risk of deterioration and the patient's age, early spine referral is prudent to avoid delays in care [^113VSiEE] [^114mGYrE] [^1156XKun]. If radiculopathy persists beyond 6–12 weeks despite conservative therapy, or if there is progressive motor weakness, epidural steroid injection can be considered, with interlaminar cervical epidurals having better safety and evidence than transforaminal approaches, and surgery reserved for refractory cases or progressive deficits [^114zbncC] [^115RPb2V] [^1144zgVv].

> But wait, what about the anterolisthesis itself? Does it change urgency. Grade 1 anterolisthesis is mild and often stable in degenerative spondylosis, yet I need to ensure there is no dynamic instability on flexion–extension views or progressive translation; if instability is suspected or symptoms are refractory, surgical consultation becomes more compelling even without severe myelopathy, as motion segment disease can perpetuate pain and neural compromise [^1144zgVv].

> I need to ensure special considerations for an 85-year-old are addressed. Frailty, osteoporosis, cardiopulmonary risk, and medication interactions can shift the risk–benefit calculus for procedures; shared decision-making is essential, and if interventional steps are pursued, image guidance and judicious sedation plans are critical, with careful selection of candidates for facet blocks or epidural injections and realistic counseling about modest effect sizes and durability.

> Let me reconsider the immediate next steps to avoid any gaps. First, obtain a cervical spine MRI without contrast to assess cord, roots, and stability of the listhesis. Second, perform a focused neurologic exam now and again after MRI to detect evolving myelopathy or radiculopathy. Third, initiate conservative therapy while awaiting imaging. Fourth, if facet pain is suspected after an adequate conservative trial, proceed to controlled diagnostic medial branch blocks with ≥ 50% relief as a positive threshold. Fifth, refer to spine surgery urgently if MRI shows cord compression with myelopathy or if there is progressive neurologic deficit, and consider epidural injection for persistent radiculopathy before surgical decompression if appropriate [^114rZrBw] [^1139Gs5L] [^113VSiEE] [^114zbncC].

> In summary, I should confirm that the plan aligns with evidence and guidelines: MRI is the correct next imaging to define neural compression and stability. Conservative management is first-line in the absence of red flags. Facet-directed diagnostics are reasonable after a conservative trial if facet pain is suspected. And surgical referral is indicated for myelopathy or refractory radiculopathy with correlating imaging, with individualized risk–benefit discussion given the patient's age and comorbidities [^114rZrBw] [^114q1sMZ] [^113VSiEE].

The next step is to obtain a **cervical MRI** [^114rZrBw] to assess for spinal cord or nerve root compression, spinal canal stenosis, and to characterize the C6–C7 anterolisthesis [^notfound]. MRI is indicated because the patient has chronic neck pain with degenerative changes on X-ray and no red flags, and it is the preferred modality to evaluate soft tissues, neural structures, and instability [^114rZrBw]. If MRI is contraindicated, obtain a **CT myelogram** as an alternative [^113VSiEE]. Conservative management (physical therapy, analgesics, and activity modification) should begin while awaiting MRI, and surgical referral is indicated if MRI shows spinal cord compression, progressive neurologic deficits, or refractory pain despite conservative care [^113VSiEE].

---

## Clinical significance of imaging findings

- **Levocurvature**: Mild levocurvature (scoliosis) is common in elderly patients and often asymptomatic, but it may contribute to mechanical neck pain.

- **Grade 1 anterolisthesis of C6 on C7**: This degree of anterolisthesis (≤ 25% displacement) is typically stable but may cause or exacerbate spinal canal or foraminal stenosis, potentially compressing the spinal cord or nerve roots [^notfound].

- **Degenerative changes**: Disc space narrowing, uncovertebral hypertrophy, endplate spurring, and facet degeneration are typical of cervical spondylosis and can cause axial neck pain, radiculopathy, or myelopathy [^1161pkAJ].

- **Prevertebral soft tissue prominence**: This is nonspecific but may reflect degenerative changes or mild soft tissue swelling; clinical correlation is needed.

---

## Recommended next diagnostic step

Obtain a **cervical spine MRI** [^114rZrBw] to evaluate:

- **Spinal cord compression**: Assess for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), which is common in elderly patients with degenerative cervical spine disease [^111g5Q46].

- **Nerve root compression**: Identify radiculopathy due to foraminal stenosis or disc herniation [^111pEere].

- **Stability of anterolisthesis**: MRI can help assess the stability of the C6–C7 segment and guide management decisions [^notfound].

- **Soft tissue structures**: Evaluate prevertebral soft tissue prominence for potential inflammatory or infectious processes [^117MvHAM].

If MRI is contraindicated (e.g. pacemaker, severe claustrophobia), obtain a **CT myelogram** as an alternative [^115rtJ4w].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

The **ACR Appropriateness Criteria** recommend cervical spine MRI as the next imaging modality for chronic neck pain with degenerative changes on X-ray and no neurologic deficits [^114rZrBw]. The **AAFP guidelines** emphasize MRI for suspected spinal cord or nerve root compression, myelopathy, or radiculopathy [^113VSiEE].

---

## Management considerations

While awaiting MRI results, initiate **conservative management**:

- **Physical therapy**: Focus on neck strengthening, flexibility, and posture correction [^1164obWx].

- **Analgesics**: NSAIDs or acetaminophen for pain control.

- **Activity modification**: Avoid heavy lifting, prolonged neck flexion, and repetitive neck movements.

- **Orthotic support**: Soft cervical collar may provide temporary relief.

---

## Indications for surgical referral

Surgical referral is indicated if MRI reveals **spinal cord compression** with clinical evidence of myelopathy (gait instability, hand clumsiness, hyperreflexia) [^115rtJ4w]. Progressive neurologic deficits — such as **worsening weakness, sensory loss, or bowel/bladder dysfunction** — also warrant referral [^113VSiEE]. Refractory pain persisting despite conservative management likewise merits surgical evaluation [^1144zgVv].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The next step is to obtain a **cervical spine MRI** [^114rZrBw] to evaluate for spinal cord or nerve root compression, spinal canal stenosis, and the stability of the C6–C7 anterolisthesis. Conservative management should begin while awaiting MRI results, and surgical referral is indicated if MRI shows spinal cord compression, progressive neurologic deficits, or refractory pain despite conservative care [^1144zgVv].

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy: recognition and management [^113VSiEE]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy encompasses a collection of pathologic conditions that result in progressive spinal cord dysfunction secondary to cord compression. Patients are typically male (3: 1 male-to-female ratio), and the average age of presentation is 64 years. The exact incidence is unclear because of differences in terminology and because radiographic findings can be present in asymptomatic individuals. Common examination findings include neck pain or stiffness, a wide-based ataxic gait, ascending paresthesia in the upper or lower extremities, lower extremity weakness, decreased hand dexterity, hyperreflexia, clonus, Babinski sign, and bowel or bladder dysfunction in severe disease. Definitive diagnosis requires correlation of physical examination findings with imaging findings. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine with and without contrast media is the preferred imaging modality. Cervical spine computed tomography, computed tomography myelography, and plain radiography are helpful in certain situations. Treatment depends on the presence and severity of symptoms. Surgery is recommended for patients with moderate to severe symptoms or rapidly progressive disease. Conservative treatments with monitoring for progression may be considered in patients with mild to moderate disease. The evidence for the effectiveness of conservative treatments is scarce and of low quality, and outcomes can vary with individual patients. Primary care physicians play a vital role in recognizing the typical presentation of degenerative cervical myelopathy, coordinating treatment as indicated, and managing comorbidities.

### Clinical example… [^116QLLM1]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic neck pain present physicians with a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. 1–4 There is considerable controversy in the literature regarding the etiology of chronic neck pain and the role of imaging in the evaluation of the condition. The literature focuses on two general etiologic categories: posttraumatic and degenerative. Posttraumatic etiologies include gross injuries and whiplash syndrome. Previously, there was little research on the use of imaging modalities in the evaluation of patients with chronic neck pain. Most studies cited the use of radiography, particularly to diagnose spondylosis, degenerative disk disease, or posttraumatic malalignment. Physical examination was unremarkable, with the exception of a slight decrease in the left biceps reflex. Strength and sensory test results were normal.

Initial lateral radiographs revealed narrowing of the C5-C6 disk space, and osteophytes protruding into the vertebral canal. Subsequent cervical computed tomography showed narrowing of the vertebral canal by the osteophytes. 22–24 Furthermore, there was little correlation between the presence of cervical spondylosis or degenerative disk disease and the severity or duration of symptoms. Although there are additional factors associated with chronic neck pain, such as personality traits and ongoing compensation claims, the ACR Expert Panel considered only the imaging parameters. Recommendations A five-view radiographic examination should initially be performed in patients of any age with chronic neck pain with or without a history of remote trauma, 4with a history of malignancy, or with a history of neck surgery in the remote past.

Patients with radiographic evidence of cervical spondylosis or previous trauma and neurologic signs and symptoms should undergo MRI. If MRI is contraindicated, CT myelography is recommended. Patients with radiographic evidence of bone or disk margin destruction should undergo MRI. If an epidural abscess is suspected, the examination should be performed with intravenous contrast media. CT is indicated only if MRI cannot be performed. Facet injections and arthrography are useful for patients with multilevel disease diagnosed by any imaging modality to identify the specific disk level that is producing symptoms. Diskography is not recommended in patients with chronic neck pain.

### Operative treatment of the patient with neck pain [^1144zgVv]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Most patients with axial neck pain and cervical radiculopathy can be managed conservatively. Surgical intervention for radiculopathy is considered only when conservative management has failed unless the neurologic deficits are very significant. In cases of myelopathy, surgery may be considered earlier, but if the myelopathy is mild, conservative treatment and close observation are still appropriate. For patients with axial neck pain, surgery is generally not considered except for rare cases caused by single- or two-level degenerative disk disease with severe and unrelenting pain. There are many surgical options for the patients with the degenerative cervical spine, but the indications are different. Surgical intervention involves a complete understanding of the disease process both from physical examination and from radiographic studies. If surgery is undertaken without appropriate clinical correlation, poor results often occur. Although the operative planning is the responsibility of the surgeon. the referring physician should also have some awareness of the basic principles behind the different surgeries.

Facet joint hypertrophy and trauma-related changes — clinical and experimental observations — indicate associations with neck pain and potential neuropathic mechanisms. Following spinal trauma, pathological lesions may be produced in the facet joints and/or accentuate already existing pathology; hypertrophic changes of cervical facet joints have been described; imaging and clinical evaluation concluded that the hypertrophic change of a facet joint occurred at the mid-level of the cervical spine, usually unilaterally, was more frequent in males, and was associated with neck pain; stretching the facet joint capsule beyond physiological range could result in altered axonal morphology related to secondary or delayed axotomy changes similar to those in central nervous system injuries; it was concluded that these changes may contribute to neuropathic pain.

Clinical trials evaluating cervical medial branch RFA after whiplash

This committee considered differences in patient populations with facet pain due to degenerative and arthritic changes as opposed to younger patients who may have facet pain secondary to an isolated mechanism of injury (ie, whiplash). Studies have found that the cervical facet joints are responsible for 25–65% of non-traumatic and 50–60% of trauma-induced cases of chronic neck pain Given the higher prevalence, there should theoretically be a lower false-positive block rate in individuals with whiplash and older patients with osteoarthritis.

There are no direct comparisons of facet block pain relief cut-off thresholds in whiplash patients, but an indirect comparison of RFA outcomes does not reveal any significant differences between using 50%, 80%, and 100% pain relief cut-offs. Whereas the literature varies on recommendations for cut-offs in patients with whiplash-induced facet joint pain, a conjectural argument might be made for a higher cut-off given the lower likelihood of confounding pain generators, the higher risk for neuritis at upper cervical levels, and the younger age (ie, greater impairment from muscle denervation) compared with those with facet joint osteoarthritis.

Recommendations

Given the strong evidence that < 50% pain relief may be clinically meaningful and the absence of direct evidence that using higher MBB cut-off thresholds results in higher RFA success rates, this committee recommends that ≥ 50% reduction in pain be considered a positive prognostic block. There are theoretical underpinnings that in younger individuals (≤ 45 years of age) with whiplash injuries who are having C2–3 and or C3–4 treated, higher cut-offs should be used. Although deductive reasoning indicates that greater pain relief with MBB should lead to greater pain relief after RFA, the literature on the cervical spine does not support this; grade C recommendation, low-to-moderate level of certainty. At present, non-pain measures such as activity level should not be used as the sole criterion to determine the success or failure of a prognostic block, but may be used in conjunction with pain assessment; grade B recommendation, moderate level of certainty.

### Introduction and methodology: guidelines for the surgical management of cervical degenerative disease [^111FB5U9]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2009). Low credibility.

In March 2006, the Joint Section on Disorders of the Spine and Peripheral Nerves of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and Congress of Neurological Surgeons compiled an expert group to perform an evidence-based review of the clinical literature on management of cervical degenerative spine disease. This process culminated in the formation of the Guidelines for the Surgical Management of Cervical Degenerative Disease. The purpose of the Guidelines was to address questions regarding the therapy, diagnosis, and prognosis of cervical degenerative disease using an evidence-based approach. Development of an evidence-based review and recommendations is a multitiered process. Typical guideline development consists of 5 processes: 1) collection and selection of the evidence; 2) assessment of the quality and strength of the evidence; 3) analysis of the evidentiary data; 4) formulation of recommendations; and 5) guideline validation. This manuscript details the methodology in compiling the Guidelines for the Surgical Management of Cervical Degenerative Disease.

### Symptomatic progression of cervical myelopathy and the role of nonsurgical management: a consensus statement [^112TSoxC]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

This section of the cervical spondylotic myelopathy Spine focus issue collates the existing evidence related to natural history and nonoperative management. In the case of patients with symptomatic cervical spondylotic myelopathy treated nonoperatively, while 20% to 62% will deteriorate at 3 to 6 years of follow-up, no specific patient or disease characteristics have been shown to predict this change reliably. For patients without myelopathy with spondylotic cord compression, the rate of myelopathy development is approximately 8% at 1 year and approximately 23% at 4 years of follow-up. Clinical and/or electrophysiological evidence of cervical radiculopathy has been shown to predict such progression and should prompt strong consideration of surgical decompression. With respect to nonoperative care, in the case of mild myelopathy, there is low evidence that such treatment may have a role; for moderate and severe myelopathy, this treatment results in outcomes inferior to those of surgery and is not recommended. Given the unpredictably progressive nature of cervical myelopathy, the indications for nonoperative management are ostensibly limited. Finally, the preclinical rationale and clinical translation of a putative neuroprotective drug, which may one day serve to augment the effects of surgery in the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy, is presented and discussed.

Degenerative disorders in the spine are normal, age-related phenomena and largely asymptomatic in most cases. Conservative management of lumbar and cervical spondylosis is the mainstay of treatment, and most patients with symptomatic degenerative changes respond appropriately with nonsurgical management. Surgical intervention can be considered an appropriate and viable option when conservative measures have failed. Treatment options should always be directed toward the specific nature and location of the patient's individual pathology. Although current standards in the surgical management of lumbar and cervical degenerative disorders include discectomy, neural decompression, and instrumented spinal arthrodesis, new approaches that address this often-challenging clinical entity are on the horizon.

Recommendations

Due to a generally favorable natural history of acute neck pain symptoms, our recommendation is for a 6-week trial of conservative management prior to prognostic cervical facet blocks to prevent unnecessary invasive procedures and associated healthcare costs. The use of conservative measures may prevent the need for prognostic blocks (or further interventions) but does not preclude the use of blocks for those patients who have failed conservative treatments. Grade B recommendation, moderate level of certainty for a requirement of conservative management before prognostic blocks in patients with at least 3 months of neck pain; Grade C recommendation, low level of certainty for at least a 6-week trial of conservative therapy which may vary based on a personalized medicine paradigm; grade I recommendation for concomitant use of conservative measures to accompany prognostic blocks.

Cervical spine pain is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical care as it ranks in the top 5 causes of global years lost to disability. The economic burden of cervical pain is also significant. Imaging is at the center of diagnosis of cervical pain and its causes. However, different symptoms and potential causes of cervical pain require different initial imaging to maximize the benefit of diagnostic usefulness of imaging. In this document we address different cervical pain variants with detailed assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of different modalities for addressing each specific variant. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Cervical radiculopathy — single-level versus multi-level surgical decompression long term results lack comparative evidence, as a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this comparison. After this review, most patients with true radiculopathy suffer from one level and occasionally two level disease, and the incidence of multilevel disease without the additional presence of myelopathy is rare, leading to the conclusion that there is likely little to gain and a low probability of generating meaningful data to answer this question. For research prioritization, the work group would not recommend further pursuit of this question.

Introduction

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is an umbrella term for symptomatic spinal cord compression, secondary to degenerative changes of the cervical spine. Symptoms are often debilitating and progressive, typically resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.

Disease severity is often quantified using the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score, an objective physician evaluation of neurological dysfunction. Moderate and severe DCM are defined as cases where mJOA ≤ 14 and surgery has been recommended for such patients, as outlined in the most recent clinical practice guidelines. Prior to surgery, many factors contribute to a delay in diagnosis in moderate/severe DCM. Nonetheless, there is a consensus amongst surgeons in support of operative management.

In contrast, there is weak evidence informing the management of mild DCM, most commonly defined in the literature as mJOA 15–17. Amongst mild DCM patients, there is a subpopulation that deteriorates and another which remains stable. An absence of prognostic biomarkers and symptoms means that there are no strong predictions to support decision making.

Guidelines therefore currently suggest surgical intervention or a trial of structured rehabilitation in mild DCM, with the latter escalating to the former in cases of deterioration. This tentative guidance is reflected in variable practice, as has been anecdotally reported by surgeons. There is no specification on what structured rehabilitation or surveillance should entail.

Similar heterogeneity is believed to exist in the management of ASCC, a precursor to DCM. In this case, the guidelines cite weak evidence supporting non-operative management, involving counselling and education. Likewise, what this should constitute remains undefined.

Whilst widespread underdiagnosis so far limits the number of patients with mild or asymptomatic disease in spinal clinics, this is estimated to be vast (one meta-analysis estimates 1 in 5 adults could have ASCC) and rising with aging. Initiatives to accelerate diagnosis are on-going, and anticipated to increase case ascertainment.

On this background of weak evidence and variable practice, and driven by projected demand, efforts to better inform care for mild DCM and ASCC are a critical priority. The objective of this study was to assess current practices in the assessment and management of mild DCM and ASCC. This work also aligns with two other research priorities of the AO Spine RECODE-DCM initiative: diagnostic criteria and assessment and monitoring. We hypothesise that there is substantial variability in the definition, assessment, and management of mild DCM and ASCC.

Conclusions

Clinical trials evaluating cervical facet blocks and RFA are characterized by widely disparate outcomes, and there is enormous variation in selecting patients and performing procedures. These multi-society guidelines have been developed to serve as a roadmap to improve outcomes, enhance safety, and minimize unnecessary tests and procedures. Unlike standards, which often come from an unimpeachable authority and define standards of care, our recommendations are not meant to usurp clinician judgment or personalized medicine. As has been eloquently summarized previously, the practice of evidence-based pain medicine should consider not only the best available research, but also take into account clinical experience and expertise, patient values and preferences, and practical concerns The authors of these guidelines hope researchers, clinicians, and patients will continue to conduct and participate in high-quality research to answer some of the questions addressed in these guidelines in which evidence was not available.

Question 2: Can history and physical examination be used to identify a painful facet joint, or to select people for prognostic blocks?

Cervical facet joints are proposed as the primary source of pain in 25–67% of patients with chronic neck pain. The C2–3 and C5–6 joints are the most common clinically implicated in neck pain, while C2–3, C3–4, and C4–5 joints are the most likely to display radiological features of degeneration; injury to the neck increases the probability of the facet joints being the source of chronic neck pain (see below for whiplash). Frequently used criteria for considering patients for prognostic blocks include neck pain of moderate-to-severe intensity (score ≥ 4 out of 10 on a pain intensity scale) radiating to the head, shoulder, or upper arm for at least 6 weeks in the absence of focal neurological findings. The targeted facet joints are usually decided on based on patient report and tenderness on examination, sometimes performed under fluoroscopy. In patients who are postsurgical, adjacent segments are often affected after arthrodesis, and treated levels bear more force during extension following disc arthroplasty Factors that decrease the probability of the cervical facet joints being pain generators include prominent pathology of other likely sources of neck pain such as markedly degenerated or herniated intervertebral discs and symptomatic spinal stenosis In a study by Cohen et al that evaluated historical and physical examination features associated with successful cervical medial branch RFA outcomes, pain radiating to the occiput and a history of headaches increased the probability of treatment failure. In this study, paraspinal tenderness, but not neck pain worsened by "facet loading" (extension and rotation of the cervical spine), was highly predictive of a successful outcome, with two-thirds of patients with paraspinal tenderness reporting a successful outcome versus the same proportion of those without tenderness failing RFA.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^113ov2ev]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Cervical facet joint pain — diagnostic considerations indicate limited certainty from routine history, examination, and imaging. The diagnosis of facet joint pain may not be made based on a radiologic evaluation or clinical assessment with certainty, and local tenderness and a manual examination of the cervical spine are not diagnostic. There is little information on the validity or utility of a self-reported history, although some features of inspection, range of motion, strength, palpation, and provocation tests can be useful, and range of motion has been described to be moderately reliable. Chronic whiplash-associated disorder patients and subjects with neck pain and myalgia have less cervical spine mobility, and patients with chronic neck pain may have slightly lower neck muscle strength compared with controls. Diagnosis prediction guides may allow practitioners to use a patient's history, self-report measures, and physical examination toward selecting the patient for cervical diagnostic facet joint blocks. Imaging statements include that there is no evidence that common degenerative changes on a cervical MRI are strongly correlated with neck pain symptoms; the evidence illustrates that these changes are highly prevalent in asymptomatic subjects and are also prevalent with increasing age; there is no evidence that such changes are associated with pain in patients with suspected cervicogenic headache; evaluation of acute unilateral neck pain with restricted motion showed no synovial effusion or inflammation around the cervical joints on MRI; and single photon emission computerized tomography scan uptake into the facet joints was present in only 43% of patients.

Cervical spondylosis — epidemiology, distribution, and injection considerations: Degenerative changes of the cervical spine reach a prevalence of nearly 95% by age 65 and are associated with disc protrusion, neuroforaminal narrowing, and spinal cord contour changes in up to 78% of asymptomatic individuals. Degenerative changes are seen in approximately 10% of individuals by age 25 and in 95% by age 65, with most commonly affected levels at C6/ C7 followed by C5/C6. In most symptomatic cases, spondylosis is associated with aging and with compression of the spinal cord, producing either central or neuroforaminal stenosis in patients older than 55. Regarding epidural therapy, cervical epidural injections, specifically in radiculopathy, are known to be helpful in managing cervical spondylosis, but there are no specific studies conducted for this purpose, and epidural steroid injections are not routinely recommended in those patients who go on to develop spondylotic myelopathy.

Diagnostic efficiency — role of epidural injections and discography states that once facet joint pain is excluded the patient may be treated with epidural injections, that cervical provocation discography is the last step in the diagnostic algorithm and is utilized only when appropriate treatment can be offered if a disc abnormality is demonstrated, that a rare but justifiable indication is to satisfy patients' impressions if no improvement occurs with other modalities, and that studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of epidural injections in the cervical region in discogenic pain.

### Percutaneous disc decompression for the treatment of chronic atypical cervical discogenic pain [^116NN7ww]. Pain Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Percutaneous disc decompression with the radiofrequency coblation technique has been described to treat contained, symptomatic lumbar disc herniations. In symptomatic cervical disc herniations it has been used very selectively. We report a 42-year-old female with cervical disc pathology, predominantly at C6/C7, treated with percutaneous disc decompression using coblation technology. Her complaint of cervicogenic cephalgia completely resolved, along with an 85% reduction of neck pain and upper extremity pain 6-months post-operatively. This is the first case report of chronic cervical discogenic pain being treated with this technique.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy-update and future directions [^1161pkAJ]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the leading cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults worldwide. DCM encompasses various acquired (age-related) and congenital pathologies related to degeneration of the cervical spinal column, including hypertrophy and/or calcification of the ligaments, intervertebral discs and osseous tissues. These pathologies narrow the spinal canal, leading to chronic spinal cord compression and disability. Owing to the ageing population, rates of DCM are increasing. Expeditious diagnosis and treatment of DCM are needed to avoid permanent disability. Over the past 10 years, advances in basic science and in translational and clinical research have improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of DCM and helped delineate evidence-based practices for diagnosis and treatment. Surgical decompression is recommended for moderate and severe DCM; the best strategy for mild myelopathy remains unclear. Next-generation quantitative microstructural MRI and neurophysiological recordings promise to enable quantification of spinal cord tissue damage and help predict clinical outcomes. Here, we provide a comprehensive, evidence-based review of DCM, including its definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, and non-operative and operative management. With this Review, we aim to equip physicians across broad disciplines with the knowledge necessary to make a timely diagnosis of DCM, recognize the clinical features that influence management and identify when urgent surgical intervention is warranted.

Diagnostic facet joint nerve blocks — diagnostic facet joint injections may be performed either with an intraarticular approach or by blocking the facet joint nerves, and the evidence for diagnostic accuracy of facet joint nerve blocks is good in the lumbar, thoracic, and cervical regions. Common indications are listed as somatic or nonradicular neck, mid back, upper back or low back and headache, upper extremity pain, chest wall pain or lower extremity pain of at least 3 months duration, moderate to severe pain causing functional disability, failure to respond to conservative management including physical therapy modalities with exercise, chiropractic management, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, lack of evidence either for discogenic or sacroiliac joint pain, and lack of disc herniation or evidence of radiculitis.

### Efficacy and safety of surgery for mild degenerative cervical myelopathy: results of the AOSpine north America and international prospective multicenter studies [^114mGYrE]. Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a progressive degenerative spinal condition, and the leading cause of spinal cord dysfunction among adults worldwide. This clinicopathological entity encompasses osteoarthritic degeneration (ie, cervical spondylosis) and ligamentous aberrations (eg, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum [HLF]). Over 70% of individuals over 60 to 65 yr old demonstrate pathological or radiological evidence of cervical degeneration, and approximately one-quarter of these people become clinically symptomatic from mechanical neural compression. The proportion of the United States population 65 yr or older is expected to nearly double from 13% in 2010 to 22% in 2050, making optimal diagnosis and treatment of DCM a key public health priority.

Controversy in the treatment of DCM has stemmed by and large from mixed reports regarding the natural history of this condition. Although there is some variability, a large number of patients, ranging from 20% to 60%, will deteriorate neurologically over time when treated nonoperatively. Traditionally, surgical decompression for DCM was performed to halt progression of neurological dysfunction and prevent further disability. However, more recent evidence indicates that surgical intervention for DCM is actually associated with improvement in function and quality of life. As a result, surgery is now becoming standard of care for patients with clearly symptomatic DCM. Nonetheless, controversy persists regarding the optimal management of patients with only mild symptomology. The latest clinical guidelines recommend surgery for patients with moderate and severe DCM, and nonoperative treatment with serial clinical follow-up for asymptomatic patients with imaging evidence of cervical spinal cord compression. For patients with mild DCM, the guidelines suggest that either surgery or a supervised trial of structured rehabilitation is reasonable initial management strategy; the less definitive nature of this suggestion likely reflects the paucity of clinical evidence surrounding the effectiveness of surgery for patients with mild DCM. These patients present a conundrum to the surgeon. On one hand, if the disease is only causing mild symptoms, the risk-benefit scale may tip in favor of risk, with a lot to be lost, and little to be gained. The contrary view is that these patients stand to gain the most from intervention by halting progression of potentially irreversible neurological deficits early on in the course of the pathological process. Moreover, even "mild" DCM may be associated with a derangement in quality of life that patients consider unacceptable, and can perhaps be helped with operative intervention. To this end, the objectives of the present study were 2-fold: (1) to evaluate quality of life in mild DCM compared to population norms and (2) to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients with mild DCM following surgical intervention. We hypothesized that (1) patients would have significant derangement in quality of life, despite having what is considered only "mild" DCM and (2) surgery in these patients would halt progression of symptoms, and in fact lead to improved functional status and quality of life.

Question 2 — history and physical examination for cervical facet joint pain indicates that cervical facet joints are proposed as the primary source of pain in 25–67% of patients with chronic neck pain, and the C2–3 and C5–6 joints are the most commonly clinically implicated in neck pain while C2–3, C3–4, and C4–5 joints are the most likely to display radiological features of degeneration; injury to the neck increases the probability of the facet joints being the source of chronic neck pain.

Nevertheless, beyond ongoing differences of opinion on a few questions, the guidelines represent more than just a consensus. They are a detailed and extensively referenced review of the evidence pertinent to each question, acknowledging when evidence is non-existent, conflicting, arguable or suspect. The result is a comprehensive literature review trying not to endorse a particular bias, as physicians and their societies tend to be opinionated regarding their practice habits and recommendations.

We thank Brian Sites for graciously inviting us to write an editorial and providing a forum for discussing the cervical guidelines that emphasize inclusiveness over division.

### Cervical spondylotic myelopathy: a guide to diagnosis and management [^115rtJ4w]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a neurologic condition that develops insidiously over time as degenerative changes of the spine result in compression of the cord and nearby structures. It is the most common form of spinal cord injury in adults; yet, its diagnosis is often delayed. The purpose of this article is to review the pathophysiology, natural history, diagnosis, and management of CSM with a focus on the recommended timeline for physicians suspecting CSM to refer patients to a spine surgeon. Various processes underlie spondylotic changes of the canal and are separated into static and dynamic factors. Not all patients with evidence of cord compression will present with symptoms, and the progression of disease varies by patient. The hallmark symptoms of CSM include decreased hand dexterity and gait instability as well as sensory and motor dysfunction. magnetic resonance imaging is the imaging modality of choice in patients with suspected CSM, but computed tomography myelography may be used in patients with contraindications. Patients with mild CSM may be treated surgically or nonoperatively, whereas those with moderate-severe disease are treated operatively. Due to the long-term disability that may result from a delay in diagnosis and management, prompt referral to a spine surgeon is recommended for any patient suspected of having CSM. This review provides information and guidelines for practitioners to develop an actionable awareness of CSM.

Management of neck pain — epidemiology and course: In adults, annual prevalence estimates for neck pain range from 12.1% to 71.5%, with most estimates between 30% and 50%, and 5% of patients have grades III and IV chronic neck pain associated with high pain intensity and disability. Longitudinally, between 50% to 75% of people who initially experience neck pain will also report neck pain one to 5 years later, and in adults with whiplash associated disorder (WAD) recovery is prolonged, with approximately 50% reporting neck pain symptoms one year after the injury.
