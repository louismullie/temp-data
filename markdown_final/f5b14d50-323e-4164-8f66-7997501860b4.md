## Question

What are the AEs of the PPI drug class?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), including how these are supported by different levels of evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the quality and hierarchy of evidence and how to weigh randomized trials against observational associations. Then, I should categorize adverse effects by the strength of evidence, distinguishing confirmed from probable, possible, and unproven. Next, I will review key organ systems systematically and note any dose-response patterns or vulnerable populations. After that, I need to examine drug–drug interactions and their clinical implications. Finally, I will integrate this into practical prescribing and deprescribing guidance and highlight special populations, including pediatrics and pregnancy, before concluding with a balanced summary.

> Let me first confirm the evidentiary foundation so I don't jump to conclusions. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses provide the highest-quality data for causality, whereas observational database studies often identify associations limited by confounding and protopathic bias; expert position statements and systematic reviews help interpret the totality of evidence and correct for overinterpretation of weak signals [^1161rKgp] [^116xEDfX] [^1144tdE6] [^1133Mmgt].

> I will now examine the most consistently supported adverse signal: enteric infections. Wait, let me verify the RCT data. In a large placebo-controlled RCT of pantoprazole 40 mg daily in older adults with vascular disease, the only significant adverse difference was a modest increase in enteric infections (1.4% vs 1.0%; OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01–1.75), which aligns with biological plausibility given acid suppression and microbiome changes; observational syntheses also show increased risks for C. difficile and community-acquired pneumonia, though effect sizes vary and confounding remains a concern [^116xEDfX] [^113uXtVA] [^115xNWxu].

> Next, I should review bone-related outcomes. Hold on, I should verify whether this is causal or associative. Multiple observational studies and meta-analyses link long-term PPI use to hip and other fragility fractures, with odds ratios typically in the 1.2–1.5 range. Mechanistic hypotheses include impaired calcium absorption and secondary hypergastrinemia, but causality remains uncertain and routine bone density screening solely due to PPI use is not recommended, which tempers alarm while supporting prudence in high-risk patients [^112wjtRF] [^112kiSgM] [^111YisHb].

> Let me consider renal outcomes carefully. Several large observational cohorts associate PPIs with acute kidney injury, acute interstitial nephritis, and chronic kidney disease, but wait, I should double-check the risk of bias. Systematic reviews applying ROBINS-I judge many nonrandomized studies as having moderate to serious risk of bias, and while some authors argue residual confounding may not fully explain the association, causality remains unproven; nonetheless, vigilance is reasonable, especially in patients with other nephrotoxic exposures or comorbidities [^116pjru4] [^113w1PXe] [^11188Ffx].

> I need to check nutritional deficiencies next. Hypomagnesemia is the most consistently reported electrolyte abnormality, with FDA safety communications and pharmacovigilance data suggesting a rare but clinically important risk. Case reports and series also describe vitamin B12 deficiency and iron malabsorption, particularly with prolonged therapy, though routine supplementation beyond dietary reference intakes is not advised in the absence of deficiency or high-risk features [^114fBxtd] [^112kiSgM] [^111YisHb].

> But wait, what about cardiovascular outcomes and the clopidogrel interaction. Observational meta-analyses suggested increased MACE when PPIs are combined with clopidogrel, likely via CYP2C19 inhibition, yet randomized data and subsequent analyses have not confirmed a clinically meaningful increase in adverse cardiovascular events; moreover, PPI co-therapy substantially reduces GI bleeding in patients on dual antiplatelet therapy, so withholding indicated PPIs may cause harm, with pantoprazole favored if a PPI is needed alongside clopidogrel due to lower CYP2C19 interaction potential [^117GZJWn] [^111ysUEz] [^114h6WK8].

> I should confirm the status of dementia and cognitive decline. Multiple observational studies have linked PPIs to dementia, but effect sizes are small and confounding by indication and comorbidity is substantial. Expert reviews applying causality frameworks conclude that current evidence does not support a causal relationship, so routine cognitive screening solely due to PPI use is not warranted [^114BmRsW] [^1161rKgp].

> Let me review gastric neoplasia, because this is often a source of patient anxiety. Chronic PPI-induced hypergastrinemia and fundic gland changes are biologically plausible, and meta-analyses suggest a modest association with gastric cancer, particularly in the setting of H. pylori; however, confounding is strong and no RCT has tested this, so the signal remains associative and should be interpreted in the context of indication and Helicobacter status rather than as a standalone carcinogenic effect of PPIs [^115NAEHa] [^1173r7Ce].

> Next, I should review drug–drug interactions beyond clopidogrel. Omeprazole and, to a lesser extent, lansoprazole inhibit CYP2C19 and can affect the metabolism of drugs like diazepam, warfarin, and certain antipsychotics, whereas pantoprazole and rabeprazole have lower interaction potential; clinically significant interactions are uncommon but increase with polypharmacy and in poor CYP2C19 metabolizers, so medication reconciliation and agent selection matter [^1161VuS7] [^115cBQcz].

> I will now examine special populations. In pediatrics, observational data associate acid suppression with higher risks of GI and respiratory infections, and long-term safety remains incompletely characterized. Therefore, PPIs should be used cautiously with clear indications and the lowest effective dose. In older adults, polypharmacy and fall risk magnify concerns about infections, renal effects, and fractures, reinforcing the need for deprescribing conversations and periodic reviews. Regarding pregnancy, most PPIs are category B, with omeprazole historically category C, and shared decision-making is advised when benefits outweigh theoretical risks [^111Zh9Z9] [^11137koq] [^111YisHb] [^117YXL34].

> Hold on, I should verify deprescribing guidance and the issue of rebound acid hypersecretion. Professional society updates advise that decisions to stop PPIs should be based on the absence of a valid indication rather than fear of adverse effects, and they provide structured pathways for tapering or on-demand strategies. Importantly, rebound symptoms are common after discontinuation, so patient counseling and, in some cases, H2RA bridging can improve success, with most patients with uncomplicated GERD able to step down or stop with careful planning [^1173mGcG] [^115VgCy6] [^112DQEkz] [^112r4kzA].

> Let me reconsider how to synthesize this for practice. Short-term PPI therapy is generally safe, with the most consistent RCT-confirmed risk being a modest increase in enteric infections, whereas long-term therapy adds potential associations with fractures, kidney outcomes, and nutrient deficiencies that are small in magnitude and largely observational. Thus, the prudent approach is to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration, document and periodically reassess the indication, and deprescribe when there is no ongoing benefit, reserving chronic therapy for those with clear indications such as erosive esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, or high-risk NSAID users [^116xEDfX] [^111YisHb] [^116yQMgC].

> In summary, after verifying across RCTs, meta-analyses, and expert reviews, I should conclude that PPIs remain highly effective and generally safe when used appropriately, with a confirmed modest increase in enteric infections in large RCTs, probable small increases in fracture risk and possible renal effects in observational cohorts, and unproven associations with cardiovascular events, dementia, and gastric cancer. The key is indication-driven prescribing, dose minimization, and routine deprescribing reviews to align risk and benefit over time [^116xEDfX] [^112wjtRF] [^113w1PXe] [^114BmRsW] [^115NAEHa].

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are generally well tolerated, but **long-term use is associated with several adverse effects**. The most consistently observed risks are **enteric infections** (notably C. difficile) [^116xEDfX], **hypomagnesemia**, and **bone fractures** (hip, vertebral, wrist) [^112wjtRF] [^113FTRdk]. Other potential harms include **vitamin B12 deficiency** [^112kiSgM], **iron deficiency** [^112kiSgM], **community-acquired pneumonia** [^112wjtRF], and **chronic kidney disease** [^113w1PXe]; causality remains uncertain for many associations and is likely confounded [^113FTRdk] [^115NAEHa]. PPIs should be prescribed at the **lowest effective dose** for the shortest duration, with periodic reassessment of ongoing need [^115VgCy6] [^1173mGcG].

---

## Gastrointestinal adverse effects

### Infectious complications

- **Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI)**: Consistent association with PPI use; risk increases with prolonged therapy and is higher in hospitalized or antibiotic-exposed patients [^113uXtVA] [^1174zLH7].

- **Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)**: Observational studies suggest a modest increased risk, possibly due to altered gastric pH and bacterial overgrowth [^112wjtRF] [^113uXtVA].

- **Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)**: PPI-induced hypochlorhydria may promote SIBO, though evidence is limited and heterogeneous [^notfound].

---

### Structural and functional gastrointestinal changes

Long-term PPI use is linked to **fundic gland polyps**, which are usually benign but can rarely dysplastic, particularly with prolonged therapy. PPIs may also **delay gastric emptying**, which can worsen dyspeptic symptoms or cause new postprandial fullness [^117WyKZZ]. Rebound acid hypersecretion can occur after discontinuation and may perpetuate symptoms and continued use [^113rRwk4].

---

## Nutritional deficiencies

PPIs can impair absorption of micronutrients through sustained acid suppression [^112kiSgM]:

| **Nutrient** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Vitamin B12 | - Gastric acid needed for release from food proteins <br/> - Deficiency risk rises with prolonged use | - Neurological symptoms <br/> - Anemia |
| Iron | - Gastric acid aids solubilization and absorption <br/> - Deficiency risk increases with long-term therapy | - Anemia <br/> - Fatigue |
| Magnesium | - Mechanism unclear; may involve intestinal transport changes <br/> - Deficiency is rare but clinically important | - Arrhythmias <br/> - Neuromuscular symptoms [^notfound] |
| Calcium | - Acid suppression may reduce calcium solubility and absorption <br/> - Long-term use linked to fracture risk | - Bone loss <br/> - Fractures [^112wjtRF] |

---

## Bone health

- **Fracture risk**: Long-term PPI use is associated with increased risk of hip, vertebral, and wrist fractures, likely via impaired calcium absorption and secondary hyperparathyroidism [^112wjtRF] [^116hNvwx].

- **Bone mineral density (BMD)**: Some studies show reduced BMD with chronic PPI use, though findings are inconsistent and confounded [^115RsHbJ].

---

## Renal and electrolyte disturbances

PPIs are associated with **acute interstitial nephritis (AIN)**, which can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) with continued exposure [^113w1PXe]. Several observational studies also link long-term PPI use to incident CKD and progression, but causality remains uncertain and confounding is likely [^11188Ffx]. Hypomagnesemia is a rare but clinically significant adverse effect, especially with prolonged use or concomitant diuretics [^notfound].

---

## Cardiovascular effects

Regarding cardiovascular effects, **Clopidogrel interaction** involves omeprazole and esomeprazole inhibiting CYP2C19, reducing clopidogrel activation and increasing cardiovascular event risk in observational studies; pantoprazole is preferred if a PPI is needed with clopidogrel [^117GZJWn] [^114h6WK8]. Evidence for an **overall cardiovascular risk** from PPIs is mixed; large RCTs and meta-analyses show no significant increase in major adverse cardiovascular events overall, though subgroup signals may exist [^113cFxa3].

---

## Neurological and cognitive effects

Evidence for **cognitive effects** is limited; observational studies suggest possible associations with dementia and cognitive decline, but confounding is substantial and causality is unproven [^1133Mmgt] [^116oyqoh].

---

## Cancer risk

Evidence for **gastric cancer** includes observational studies linking long-term PPI use to increased gastric cancer risk, particularly in the setting of H. pylori, but confounding is strong and causality is not established [^1173r7Ce]. Evidence for **colorectal cancer** is limited and inconsistent, with no causal relationship demonstrated [^113hh6JM].

---

## Special populations

In special populations, **elderly patients** have increased risks of fractures, infections, and renal effects; careful indication review and dose minimization are essential [^111YisHb]. In **pediatric patients**, risks include infections, nutritional deficiencies, and rebound hyperacidity; chronic use should be avoided when possible [^111Zh9Z9].

---

## Clinical recommendations

- **Indication-based prescribing**: Use PPIs only for clear indications (e.g. GERD with erosive esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, H. pylori eradication, NSAID-induced ulcer prophylaxis) [^111YisHb].

- **Lowest effective dose**: Prescribe the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, with periodic reassessment [^111ofaxZ].

- **Monitoring**: Consider magnesium monitoring in long-term users, especially with symptoms or concomitant diuretics [^112QZmP1].

- **Deprescribing**: Attempt deprescribing in patients without ongoing indications, with patient education about rebound symptoms [^115VgCy6].

---

PPIs are effective and generally safe when used appropriately, but **long-term therapy carries measurable risks**. Clinicians should balance benefits and harms, use the lowest effective dose, and reassess need regularly.

### Patients' perceptions of proton pump inhibitor risks and attempts at discontinuation: a national survey [^113KComp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Little is known about how reports on the adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) impact patients' perceptions of these drugs and medication use. We sought to determine patients' level of concern about PPI adverse effects and its association with attempts to discontinue these drugs.

Methods

This study is an online survey of US adults who use PPIs for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Topics included awareness of and concern about PPI adverse effects, prior discussion with providers, and attempts to stop PPI because of concern about adverse effects. For the primary analysis, we used logistic regression to identify associations between having attempted to stop PPI and concern about PPI-related adverse effects, a provider's recommendation to stop, risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), age, and gender.

Results

Among 755 patient participants, mean age was 49 years (s.d. 16), 71% were women, and 24% were at high risk of UGIB. Twenty percent of patients were able to write in ≥ 1 reported adverse effect, and 46% endorsed awareness of ≥ 1 adverse effect when presented with a list, most commonly chronic kidney disease (17%). Thirty-three percent of patients were slightly concerned, 32% somewhat concerned, and 14% extremely concerned about adverse effects. Twenty-four percent of patients had discussed PPI risks and benefits with a provider, and 9% had been recommended to stop. Thirty-nine percent had attempted to stop their PPI, most (83%) without a provider recommendation. Factors associated with an attempt at stopping PPI included: (i) provider recommendation to stop (odds ratio [OR] 3.26 [1.82–5.83]); (ii) concern about adverse effects (OR 5.13 [2.77–9.51] for slightly, 12.0 [6.51–22.2] for somewhat, and 19.4 [9.75–38.7] for extremely concerned); and (iii) female gender (OR 1.64 [1.12–2.39]). Patients at high risk of UGIB were as likely to have attempted to stop as others (OR 0.98 [0.66–1.44]).

Conclusions

Concern about PPIs is common and strongly associated with attempts at discontinuation, even without a provider's recommendation. Notably, individuals at high risk of UGIB, who benefit from PPIs, were equally likely to have tried stopping PPIs as others. Providers should proactively discuss the risks and benefits of PPIs with their patients, who may otherwise make unwise decisions about PPI management on their own.

### The clinician's guide to proton-pump inhibitor discontinuation [^1131cXSG]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

There is increasing concern among patients and health care providers about the associations between PPI use and a multitude of potential adverse outcomes. Therefore, clinicians need to have a rational approach both to identifying PPI users who may not have an ongoing indication for their use and on how to encourage discontinuation of unnecessary PPI use. In this paper, we will provide a detailed review of the specific indications where the benefits of ongoing PPI use is of questionable value and will review the evidence on how to maximize the likelihood of being able to successfully discontinue PPI use while minimizing symptom recurrence.

### Long-term safety concerns with proton pump inhibitors [^113hh6JM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most widely prescribed medications worldwide. Their use has resulted in dramatic improvements in treatment of peptic ulcer disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Despite an acceptable safety profile, mounting data demonstrate concerns about the long-term use of PPIs. To provide a comprehensive review regarding the concerns of long-term PPI use, a literature search was performed to identify pertinent original and review articles. Despite study shortcomings, the collective body of information overwhelmingly suggests an increased risk of infectious complications and nutritional deficiencies. Data regarding any increased risk in gastric or colon malignancy are less convincing. PPIs have revolutionized the management and complications of acid-related disorders with a high margin of safety; however, with the data available, efforts to reduce the dosing of or discontinue the use of PPIs must be reassessed frequently.

### Proton pump inhibitors alter the composition of the gut microbiota [^115xNWxu]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are used to increase gastric pH by suppressing acid production. They are pro-drugs, only becoming functional in the acidic environment of the stomach. Here, activated PPIs inhibit hydrogen–potassium pumps (H+/K+ ATPases), transmembrane proteins responsible for releasing hydrochloric acid into the lumen of the stomach. PPIs inhibit H+/K+ ATPases by binding covalently to the transmembrane domain, with return of acid production dependent on the turnover of new H+/K+ ATPases once PPIs have left the system.

PPIs are frequently used to treat GI tract disorders such as bleeding peptic ulcers, erosive esophagitis, and gastroesophageal reflux. They are also used prophylactically to prevent stress ulcers and to reduce GI toxicity associated with certain medications, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, and steroids, sometimes despite a paucity of evidence.PPIs are one of the most profitable classes of drugs in the world; however, the high cost to healthcare systems has led to investigations into possible over-utilisation. These show that over 70% of PPI prescriptions may be inappropriate, with the majority of over-utilisation stemming from unnecessary stress ulcer prophylaxis in patients who do not meet the evidence-based criteria, and a lack of re-assessment of PPI use in the community.

The use of PPIs has generally been considered safe, with low reported incidences of serious adverse outcomes. However, recently a number of side effects have been identified, including nutritional deficiencies, increased risk of bone fracture, and risks of enteric and other infections; notably, increased risks of community acquired pneumonia and Clostridium difficile infection where PPIs may carry a high risk equivalent to that of oral antibiotics.

The term microbiome refers to the ecology and functionality of the microbial population within an environment. Nearly every site of the human body has a distinct microbiome with bacterial composition determined by environmental and inter-microbial influences. Using amplification and sequencing of the variable regions of the 16S ribosomal subunit it is possible to profile the taxonomic composition of the microbiome of a given sample. Application of this technique has shown changes to gut microbiota in a range of conditions, from IBD to obesity and frailty. Thus, factors affecting the microbiome have the potential to drive important secondary effects on health. For example, alterations to microbial communities caused by oral antibiotics may underlie their association with increased C difficile infection, and the same could be true for PPIs.

### Individualized prevention of proton pump inhibitor related adverse events by risk stratification [^111A1AG3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used for gastric acid-related disorders, but their safety profile and risk stratification for high-burden diseases need further investigation. Analyzing over 2 million participants from five prospective cohorts from the US, the UK, and China, we found that PPI use correlated with increased risk of 15 leading global diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, diabetes, respiratory infections, and chronic kidney disease. These associations showed dose-response relationships and consistency across different PPI types. PPI-related absolute risks increased with baseline risks, with approximately 82% of cases occurring in those at the upper 40% of the baseline predicted risk, and only 11.5% of cases occurring in individuals at the lower 50% of the baseline risk. While statistical association does not necessarily imply causation, its potential safety concerns suggest that personalized use of PPIs through risk stratification might guide appropriate decision-making for patients, clinicians, and the public.

### Proton pump inhibitors and the risk of gastric cancer: a systematic review, evidence synthesis and life course epidemiology perspective [^113A9SaF]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

The clinical implications of this study may be limited, and many scientific questions require further exploration. Yet, we do plead for better PPI stewardship because of the widespread documented over-utilisation of PPIs. Gastric cancer is not the only outcome linked to prolonged exposure to PPIs, and benefits of any medical treatment should be weighed against potential short- and long-term harm, considering alternatives including a healthier lifestyle and diet. Major open questions consider a potential safe dose and duration of PPI use (threshold effect?) regarding gastric cancer risks and other potential adverse events and what the effects are of prolonged exposure at a younger age (children, young adults, pregnancy). It does seem unlikely that short-term acid inhibition affects gastric carcinogenesis, yet it remains unclear how we could define a safe duration and accumulated dosage as there may be individual differences in susceptibility, and other adverse events have been associated with PPI exposure. Sex differences remain largely unexplored, while we do know gastric cancer incidence, time of diagnosis and prognosis differ. Efficacy and safety of drugs, including PPIs, may also differ drastically between sexes with a likely over-utilisation in women. We do suspect the effects, but also the risk-benefit balance, differ by underlying risk factors (age, sex, family history, unhealthy diet, alcohol consumption, smoking, lifestyle, presence of premalignancy) and by region, as both PPI consumption and prescription practices, and gastric cancer incidence vary.

### The interaction between proton pump inhibitors and clopidogrel and upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^111ysUEz]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

There is increasing concern regarding a possible adverse interaction between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and clopidogrel that could lead to reduced cardiovascular protection by clopidogrel. We performed a literature search for relevant original studies and systematic reviews. PPIs likely affect the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel as measured in vitro, and this may be a class effect. We conclude that the pharmacodynamic effect has not been translated into any clinically meaningful adverse effect. PPI cotherapy reduces the incidence of recurrent peptic ulcer and of upper gastrointestinal bleeding among patients on clopidogrel.

### Safety of proton pump inhibitor exposure [^116GJ4zc]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Proton pump (H(+)/K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase) inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used to treat patients with acid-related disorders because they are generally perceived to be safe and effective. However, as with any pharmacologic agent, they have the potential for side effects. Many studies have examined the side effects of long-term or short-term PPI exposure. We review the mechanism of action of PPIs, focusing on recently released products that might have greater risks of adverse effects than older products because of increased potency and/or duration of action. We summarize the data available on the putative adverse effects of PPI therapy and propose guidelines for clinicians who prescribe these agents to limit the potential for adverse outcomes in users of these effective therapeutic agents.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^116oyqoh]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Non-judicious PPI use is a matter of great concern in the elderly, who often have multiple comorbidities, are taking multiple medications, and are thus at increased risk of long-term PPI-related adverse outcomes. PPI-related adverse events involve the GI tract as well as other organs and systems. The potential risks of long-term PPI therapy, along with the respective evidence summary, have been summarized in the Safety section. While some concerns about the possible adverse effects of PPIs (including an increased risk of gastric carcinoids, gastric carcinoma, decreased absorption of minerals and vitamins) have been raised since their introduction in the late 1980s, more recently, the number of publications dealing with PPI-related adverse outcomes has steadily increased. It is worth mentioning, however, that the majority of studies are observational in nature and do not allow for establishing causality, but merely associations. Residual bias is always a concern in observational studies, even after statistical adjustment, because all confounding factors cannot be recorded or even known. When effect sizes are small (relative risk/OR/hazard ratio < 2), it is not possible to determine whether the association is valid or represents the result of residual bias. Hazard ratios for PPI use and some reported adverse effects (e.g. dementia, chronic kidney disease, any fracture, or community-acquired pneumonia) were all ≤ 1.5. Nevertheless, if a true causality exists, even small effect sizes can result in a meaningful risk for common interventions and conditions.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^1161VuS7]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

PPI-related adverse events involve the GI tract as well as other organs and systems. The majority of these events have been summarized in comprehensive reviews, to which the reader is referred. The potential risks of long-term PPI therapy, along with the respective evidence summary, are outlined in Tables 1 and 2.

Table 1
Concerns about long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): Digestive System

Table 2
Concerns about long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): Extra-digestive effects

Gastric pH is relevant for the absorption of several drugs and its modification by antisecretory therapy may significantly modify their pharmacokinetics. PPIs also influence drug absorption and metabolism by interacting with adenosine triphosphate-dependent P-glycoprotein (e.g. inhibiting digoxin efflux) or with the CYP P450 enzyme system (e.g. decreasing simvastatin metabolism), thereby affecting both intestinal first-pass metabolism and hepatic clearance. A number of studies have shown that omeprazole (and, to a lesser extent, lansoprazole) carries a considerable potential for DDIs, since it has a high affinity for CYP2C19 and a somewhat lower affinity for CYP3A4. In contrast, pantoprazole and rabeprazole display a lower potential for DDIs. DDIs therefore represent a molecule-related effect rather than a class-effect.

These interactions are clinically relevant mostly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. diazepam, warfarin, antipsychotics, etc.). In addition, PPI metabolism is very rapid in most Caucasian subjects (extensive metabolizers), so that their half-life ranges from only 0.5 to 2.1 hours. Indeed, the prevalence of poor metabolizers, potentially at increased risk of drug interactions, is as low as 1.2–3.8% in Europe as compared to 23% in Asia. This could explain why only few of the reported DDIs involving PPIs have been shown to be of clinical significance.

Recent studies have raised concerns about a possible adverse interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs (currently prescribed to patients who are receiving dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent upper GI bleeding) that could reduce the antithrombotic effect of the former and, therefore, lessen protection against CV events in high-risk patients. However, current evidence shows that, while concomitant use of some PPIs with clopidogrel does attenuate the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel, this effect is unlikely to be clinically relevant. Conversely, denying PPIs to patients at GI risk would result in increased life-threatening GI bleeding.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on the diagnosis and management of GERD: methodology and review of evidence [^116x7g7j]. VideoGIE (2025). High credibility.

ASGE guideline on GERD — proton pump inhibitor (PPI) management: In patients with symptomatic and confirmed GERD with predominant heartburn symptoms, the ASGE recommends medical management with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) at the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible period of time while initiating discussion about long-term management options. Best practice advice states that patients who have been on long-term PPI therapy (> 6 mo) should be considered for optimization and de-escalation of medical management, providers should carefully consider the risks, benefits, and alternatives of PPI use with the patient with GERD, and providers prescribing PPI therapy should be aware that adverse events from PPI in prospective data have been limited to increased risk of enteric infections; however, there is need for robust long-term data to prove or disprove any other putative adverse events.

### Patient-centered outcomes with concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors and other drugs [^114TNqne]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

We performed a systematic review of patient-centered outcomes after the concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and other drugs.

Methods

We searched 4 databases in July 2016 to find studies that reported mortality and morbidity after the concomitant use of PPIs and other drugs. We conducted direct meta-analyses using a random-effects model and graded the quality of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group approach.

Findings

We included data from 17 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, 16 randomized controlled trials, and 16 observational studies that examined the concomitant use of PPIs with medications from 10 drug classes. Low-quality evidence suggests that the use of PPIs is associated with greater morbidity when administered with antiplatelet drugs, bisphosphonates, antibiotics, anticoagulants, metformin, mycophenolate mofetil, or nelfinavir. Concomitant PPIs reduce drug-induced gastrointestinal bleeding and are associated with greater docetaxel and cisplatin response rates in patients with metastatic breast cancer. For demonstrated statistically significant relative risks and benefits from concomitant PPIs, the magnitudes of the effects are small, with < 100 attributable events per 1000 patients treated, and the effects are inconsistent among specific drugs. Among individual PPIs, the concomitant use of pantoprazole or esomeprazole, but not omeprazole or lansoprazole, is associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke. Clopidogrel is associated with a greater risk for myocardial infarction compared with prasugrel. Conflicting results between randomized controlled trials and observational studies and high risk for bias in the body of evidence lessened our confidence in the results.

Implications

Available evidence suggests a greater risk for adverse patient outcomes after the concomitant use of PPIs and medications from 9 drug classes and warns against inappropriate drug combinations.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^113xcsf1]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite PPIs carrying – like any other classes of drugs – some risks, they should not be denied to patients who are likely to benefit from them merely because of concerns about putative adverse effects. There is generally some equivalence between the acceptable burden of adverse effects and the severity of the illness being treated. However, patients with acid-related diseases are often otherwise "healthy" subjects, who take drugs for a given condition. What level of undesirable effects would be acceptable for them and who will bear the cost of treating any ensuing iatrogenic disease? A number of simple and potentially effective preventive measures should be recommended for some (if not all) safety concerns in order to minimize them.

First of all, PPI therapy should be evidence based. Decisions on whether or not to initiate or continue PPI therapy should be sound and PPIs should only be prescribed when there is an appropriate clinical indication. Clinical guidelines can certainly help. In this Position Paper, we have reviewed the current available guidelines, together with the systematic reviews and meta-analyses used to generate them, and synthesized the knowledge in a number of statements (i.e. Summaries of the current evidence) and in Table 3.

Table 3
Current indications of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy

Guidelines rely on both evidence and expert opinion; they are neither infallible nor a substitute for clinical judgment. They do, however, go beyond systematic reviews to recommend what should and should not be done in specific clinical circumstances. Despite guidelines being developed to improve quality of care received by patients, they have been criticized for recommending too little or too much, and even for providing reasons for national health systems or insurance payers to deny coverage. Guidelines are often inflexible and can actually harm by leaving insufficient room for clinicians to tailor care to individual patient circumstances and medical history. What is best for patients overall, as recommended by guidelines, may be inappropriate for individuals. Only evidence-based recommendations, which consider the balance between benefits and harms, and weigh these considerations using patient (rather than expert and societal) value, should be followed in everyday clinical practice. Taking these considerations into account, we have tried to distill the current evidence and provide physicians with clear patient-oriented recommendations, beyond cost and reimbursement issues. Medicine is a rapidly evolving field, however, and the validity of guidelines will not necessarily stand the test of time: indeed, today's assumptions may no longer be valid tomorrow. Healthcare providers should therefore stay tuned and constantly update their knowledge.

### Adverse event reporting for proton pump inhibitor therapy: an overview of systematic reviews [^113uXtVA]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To assist clinicians in counseling patients regarding the risk of adverse events from proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), by synthesizing evidence from published systematic reviews of antireflux therapy.

Data Sources

Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PubMed, Web of Knowledge.

Review Methods

Overview based on PRISMA reporting standards (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) of English-language meta-analyses and systematic reviews of PPI therapy for reflux disease through December 2014. Two independent investigators assessed study eligibility, rated the review quality with AMSTAR criteria (assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews), and abstracted data for adverse events.

Results

Thirty-three systematic reviews met inclusion criteria. The most commonly reported adverse events were community-acquired pneumonia (odds ratios, 1.04–1.92), with a greater association noted with shorter duration of therapy and higher doses. Hip fractures were also associated with PPI use (odds ratios, 1.16–1.50), especially with long-term therapy. Last, enteric infection with Clostridium difficile was more common with PPI therapy (odds ratios, 1.69–1.33). Other less commonly reported adverse events included electrolyte and vitamin deficiency. Risk factors for adverse events are reported in the text.

Conclusion

Our overview shows that PPI therapy is associated with significant and potentially serious adverse events that should be discussed with patients. The effect sizes and risk factors provided should facilitate this discussion and promote shared decision making.

### Proton pump inhibitors: risk for myopathy? [^114uAMi8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to describe the relationship between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and symptoms of myopathy based on case reports.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted in PubMed (1946 to June 2016) using MeSH terms proton pump inhibitors, omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and muscular diseases. Additionally, a search was conducted in ToxNet and EMBASE using similar search criteria.

Study Selection and Data Abstraction

The resulting articles were scanned to assess relevance to the review. Bibliographies of all relevant articles were evaluated for additional sources; 26 articles resulted from the search of PubMed, ToxNet, and EMBASE; articles that involved medications typically considered to have myalgia-like side effects (eg, statins), or included patients who presented with a confounding disease state (eg, Guillain-Barré) were excluded.

Data Synthesis

In total, 11 case reports as well as a review of an adverse event reporting database that included 292 cases were evaluated. Association of PPI use and myopathy symptoms does not have a clear etiology. Overall, the available published data do not show a high risk of myopathy with PPI use but should be considered if a patient presents with myopathy symptoms and concurrent PPI use.

Conclusion

A limited body of published data suggests that PPI use has been associated with myopathy-like symptoms without long-term effects following discontinuation. Although myopathy is a rare adverse effect observed with PPIs, it can be a serious side effect to be considered when starting a patient on acid suppression therapy.

### The risks and benefits of long-term use of proton pump inhibitors: expert review and best practice advice from the American Gastroenterological Association [^111YisHb]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The purpose of this review is to evaluate the risks associated with long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), focusing on long-term use of PPIs for three common indications: gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's esophagus (BE), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) bleeding prophylaxis.

Methods

The recommendations outlined in this review are based on expert opinion and on relevant publications from PubMed, EMbase, and the Cochrane library (through July 2016). To identify relevant ongoing trials, we queried clinicaltrials.gov. To assess the quality of evidence, we used a modified approach based on the GRADE Working Group. The Clinical Practice Updates Committee of the American Gastroenterological Association has reviewed these recommendations. Best Practice Advice 1: Patients with GERD and acid-related complications (ie, erosive esophagitis or peptic stricture) should take a PPI for short-term healing, maintenance of healing, and long-term symptom control. Best Practice Advice 2: Patients with uncomplicated GERD who respond to short-term PPIs should subsequently attempt to stop or reduce them. Patients who cannot reduce PPIs should consider ambulatory esophageal pH/impedance monitoring before committing to lifelong PPIs to help distinguish GERD from a functional syndrome. The best candidates for this strategy may be patients with predominantly atypical symptoms or those who lack an obvious predisposition to GERD (eg, central obesity, large hiatal hernia). Best Practice Advice 3: Patients with Barrett's esophagus and symptomatic GERD should take a long-term PPI. Best Practice Advice 4: Asymptomatic patients with Barrett's esophagus should consider a long-term PPI. Best Practice Advice 5: Patients at high risk for ulcer-related bleeding from NSAIDs should take a PPI if they continue to take NSAIDs. Best Practice Advice 6: The dose of long-term PPIs should be periodically reevaluated so that the lowest effective PPI dose can be prescribed to manage the condition. Best Practice Advice 7: Long-term PPI users should not routinely use probiotics to prevent infection. Best Practice Advice 8: Long-term PPI users should not routinely raise their intake of calcium, vitamin B12, or magnesium beyond the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA). Best Practice Advice 9: Long-term PPI users should not routinely screen or monitor bone mineral density, serum creatinine, magnesium, or vitamin B12. Best Practice Advice 10: Specific PPI formulations should not be selected based on potential risks.

### Individualized prevention of proton pump inhibitor related adverse events by risk stratification [^114VssRA]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Given the links with a substantial global disease burden and the high rate of inappropriate overuse of PPIs (up to 70%), the potential impact of long-term PPI use should not be ignored, even if the causal effects for these outcomes have not been established. In practice, the net risk of PPI-related adverse effects is low in those with low baseline risk, but it is not negligible and the risk profile may change over time. Personalized prevention is feasible by regular evaluating the baseline risk with readily available predictive factors for long-term PPI users while focusing on the high-risk patients. For high-risk individuals, potential effective strategies, such as dose reduction, discontinuation, transitioning to "on-demand" use, considering less profound acid suppressants like H2RAs, and regular monitoring for early indications of adverse events (e.g. blood glucose levels for the risk of diabetes,), may help mitigate the additional absolute risk associated with PPI use.

Further research is still required to (1) confirm the causal effects of PPIs on disease risk through RCT-based meta-analysis; (2) improve and validate the performance of prediction models for multiple PPI-related adverse effects; (3) investigate the appropriate cut-off value for defining high-risk population; (4) evaluate the effectiveness of the risk stratification strategy. These research avenues have the potential to refine clinical practices and optimize PPI use, ensuring a balanced approach between therapeutic benefits and potential risks in diverse patient populations.

In conclusion, long-term use of PPIs is likely to be associated with a wide range of high-burden diseases. Although it remains unclear whether these associations are causal, its impacts should not be ignored due to potential links with heavy disease burden. The risk stratification approach by individualized using of PPIs after evaluating the PPI-related risk, may be an effective strategy to reduce potential risks as well as fears among patients.

### Proton-pump inhibitors: understanding the complications and risks [^115NAEHa]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective therapy for the full spectrum of gastric-acid-related diseases. However, in the past decade, a steadily increasing list of complications following long-term use of PPIs has been reported. Their potent acid-suppressive action induces several structural and functional changes within the gastric mucosa, including fundic gland polyps, enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and hypergastrinaemia, which can be exaggerated in the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection. As discussed in this Review, most associations of PPIs with severe adverse events are not based on sufficient evidence because of confounding factors and a lack of plausible mechanisms. Thus, a causal relationship remains unproven in most associations, and further studies are needed. Awareness of PPI-associated risks should not lead to anxiety in patients but rather should induce the physician to consider the appropriate dosing and duration of PPI therapy, including long-term monitoring strategies in selected groups of patients because of their individual comorbidities and risk factors.

### Unexpected consequences of proton pump inhibitor use [^116Yu4JC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most widely prescribed classes of medications for gastroesophageal and laryngopharyngeal reflux diseases. There is emerging evidence that the pathogenesis of disease in laryngeal mucosa is not just related to refluxed acid, but also the presence of pepsin and acidic microenvironments. The widespread use of PPIs is also calling into question potential complications of PPI use. This commentary expands upon these issues with other potential unexpected consequences, and considers the importance of determining a proper approach to patient management.

### No associations between regular use of proton pump inhibitors and risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality: a population-based cohort of 0.44 million participants [^113Cdauq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the top 10 most commonly used medications worldwide. The short-term use of PPIs is generally safe, whereas the long-term use has been linked to various adverse effects, such as bone fractures and chronic kidney disease. Because the PPI-associated adverse outcomes are serious and each is independently associated with a higher risk of mortality, PPI use may have an effect on death. Many observational studies have evaluated the associations between PPI use and mortality, but the results were conflicting. For example, a cohort study of 0.21 million participants suggested that PPIs were associated with excessive risk of all-cause mortality, whereas no risk was observed in a recent analysis of 1.9 million US seniors. These analyses of administrative data have been limited by a lack of detailed information on lifestyle risk factors and general health status. Confounding effects of these factors cannot be excluded.

For acid-related conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, adherence to PPI treatment is crucial to achieving therapeutic success. However, concern about potential adverse outcomes, particularly mortality, is strongly associated with attempts or recommendations for discontinuation in patients and internists. On the other hand, overprescribing of PPI has also garnered widespread attention. Thus, further evaluation of the effects of PPIs on mortality is still required. The aim of this study was to evaluate the independent associations between regular use of PPIs and risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality based on the UK Biobank.

### Prescribing PPIs [^116Nwu91]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed and many people remain on them for years. In some, there may be good justification for long-term use; for example, in those with oesophageal stricture, Barrett's oesophagus or a history of a bleeding gastrointestinal ulcer, or to provide gastroprotection in those at high risk of gastrointestinal complications from taking NSAIDs. However, PPIs are often not used in line with clinical guidelines. 1,2 In addition, there are concerns that many people take them for long periods to manage less serious conditions (e.g. indigestion) and may prefer taking them to addressing factors such as diet, obesity or alcohol that may be contributing to their symptoms. Although PPIs are well-tolerated, there is increasing evidence that they may be associated with a range of long-term adverse effects. Here, we review the safety of PPIs and consider whether long-term prescribing needs to be reassessed.

### Basic pharmacology… [^117YXL34]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors are one of the most commonly prescribed classes of medications in the primary care setting and are considered a major advance in the treatment of acid-peptic diseases. Since the introduction of omeprazole in 1989, several other PPIs have become available in the United States. The intravenous form of pantoprazole is now available, and the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved the newest PPI, esomeprazole, in 2001. Basic Pharmacology PPIs are substituted benzimidazoles and are generally administered as enteric-coated tablets or capsules that pass through the stomach intact and are absorbed in the proximal small bowel. Once absorbed, all PPIs have a relatively short plasma half-life. Their duration of action is much longer because of their unique mechanism of action. PPIs are lipophilic weak bases that cross the parietal cell membrane and enter the acidic parietal cell canaliculus.

In this acidic environment, the PPI becomes protonated, producing the activated sulphenamide form of the drug that binds covalently with the H. +/K + ATPase enzyme that results in irreversible inhibition of acid secretion by the proton pump. 1–3 The parietal cell must then produce new proton pumps or activate resting pumps to resume its acid secretion. 1, 2 In contrast to the other PPIs, rabeprazole forms a partially reversible bond with the proton pump and is activated at a broader range of gastric pH. Therefore, it may have a more sustained acid-suppressing effect than the other PPIs. Side Effects and Precautions PPIs are generally well tolerated. The frequency of adverse effects associated with PPIs is similar to that of placebo, with an overall incidence of less than 5 percent. 2 The safety profiles of the newer agents, rabeprazole and pantoprazole, appear to be similar to those of the older agents.

2, 5, 7 PPIs are only contraindicated if the patient has a known history of hypersensitivity to them, and they should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic disease. Omeprazole is a pregnancy category C agent; the others are pregnancy category B medications. PPIs are not recommended for use in breast-feeding mothers. 8–12.

### When does proton pump inhibitor treatment become long term? A scoping review [^115i638H]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

If the aim is to study side effects related to long-term use, the definition of long term might need to be shorter or longer than 6 months depending on the length of exposure time needed for the side effect to occur.

In conclusion, we observed substantial variability in definitions of long-term PPI treatment. The majority of definitions did not include a rationale for the choice of definition. The variety of definitions complicates the comparison of research results and raises challenges in clinical practice, such as identifying an appropriate timeframe for discussing deprescribing. We suggest that long-term use could be defined as more than 4–8 weeks of PPI use in a clinical context depending on the indication for PPI therapy. One definition does not fit all research purposes. Thus, we suggest more than 6 months of PPI use as a possible definition for long-term use in pharmacoepidemiological studies and for studies of adverse effects the definition should be tailored the exposure time needed for the side effect in question to occur. When studying long-term use of PPIs, we suggest always giving well-argued choices of definitions.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on the diagnosis and management of GERD: methodology and review of evidence [^113xdH3s]. VideoGIE (2025). High credibility.

ASGE guideline — proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy for GERD recommendations: In patients with symptomatic and confirmed GERD with predominant heartburn symptoms, the ASGE recommends medical management with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) at the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible period of time while initiating discussion about long-term management options (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In patients with suboptimal clinical response to PPI therapy, the ASGE suggests testing CYP2C19 polymorphism and adjusting PPI dosage and selection accordingly (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Best practice advice states that patients who have been on long-term PPI therapy (> 6 months) should be considered for optimization and de-escalation of medical management, providers should carefully consider the risks, benefits, and alternatives of PPI use for patients with GERD, and providers prescribing PPI therapy should be aware that adverse events from PPI in prospective data have been limited to a modest increased risk of enteric infections; however, there is a need for robust long-term data to prove or disprove any other putative adverse events.

### Proton pump inhibitors: the good, bad, and ugly [^112gFx5y]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) continue to be the medication of choice for treatment of acid-related disease, with few if any overt side effects seen with daily use. They are often prescribed empirically, often in high doses and with many patients being treated with multiple PPIs without an objective diagnosis. Therefore, they are believed to be overprescribed and used without indication. In this article we discuss the appropriate clinical indications for PPIs, review in detail the major associated adverse events, and put in perspective key issues in balancing benefits and risk of this exceptional (and safe) class of drug.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^114oVcxn]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Overall, PPIs are irreplaceable drugs in the management of acid-related diseases. However, PPI treatment – as any kind of drug therapy – is not without risk of adverse effects. The overall benefits of therapy and improvement in quality of life significantly outweigh potential risks in most patients, but those without clear clinical indication are only exposed to the risks of PPI prescription. Adhering to evidence-based guidelines represents the only rational approach to an effective and safe PPI therapy.

### Individual proton pump inhibitors and outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease on dual antiplatelet therapy: a systematic review [^117FbTQo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

In patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor improves cardiovascular (CV) outcomes and is recommended by national guidelines for 1 year after initial hospitalization. 1, 2 Clopidogrel, now available in generic form, remains the most widely used P2Y12 inhibitor taken by post‐ACS outpatients. Clopidogrel is a prodrug that depends on cytochrome P450, or CYP, liver enzymes to metabolize it into active form. Due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding associated with clopidogrel and DAPT, many post‐ACS patients are also started on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 receptor antagonist. PPI medications (the most frequently prescribed drugs to reduce the risk of GI bleeding) also interact with the CYP liver enzymes and thus may inhibit the conversion of clopidogrel to its active metabolite and potentially alter its efficacy. Several observational studies have been completed to evaluate possible medication interaction between PPI and DAPT and its association with CV outcomes. 3, 4, 5, 6 These studies have had mixed results, with some showing a potential interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs that is associated with worse CV outcomes and others showing no association with outcomes. Very few randomized data are available to answer this question, and a recently meta‐analysis of this topic concluded that observational and randomized data on PPIs have divergent results. 7

Despite conflicting data and possible equipoise in the field, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning about the use of clopidogrel concomitant with PPI agents, specifically, omeprazole and esomeprazole, for which there is the most experience; in the case of omeprazole, data are from both observational and randomized, controlled studies. Uncertainty remains about extending this association to other PPIs because there seems to be variation in efficacy among drugs in this class. Each PPI has a differential effect on CYP metabolism and thus may have incongruous effects on clopidogrel metabolism and subsequent CV outcomes. Recent meta‐analyses have grouped all PPIs together, likely for greater power, to evaluate the relationship among PPIs, clopidogrel, and CV outcomes 8; however, based on pharmacology, there may be differential interactions between individual PPIs and clopidogrel. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between individual PPI medications and adverse CV events in patients with both acute and stable coronary artery disease (CAD) taking clopidogrel.

### Adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors: fact or fake news? [^1133Mmgt]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present review summarizes the past year's literature, both clinical and basic science, regarding potential adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors.

Recent Findings

Proton pump inhibitors are amongst the most widely prescribed and overprescribed medications worldwide. Although generally considered well tolerated, epidemiologic studies mining large databases have reported a panoply of purported serious adverse effects associated with proton pump inhibitors, including chronic kidney disease, cognitive decline, myocardial infarction, stroke, bone fracture and even death. It should be noted that the quality of the evidence underlying these associations is very low and these studies, by design, cannot ascribe cause and effect. Nonetheless, these associations have been sensationalized in the media and misinterpreted by patients and providers. Unintended consequences of the fake news are that patients are not being prescribed and/or taking clinical guideline-recommended proton pump inhibitors to prevent and treat complications from gastroesophageal reflux disease and upper gastrointestinal bleeding precipitated by NSAIDs and dual antiplatelet therapies. In addition, physicians, who already have limited time to interact with their patients, are spending an inordinate amount of additional time placing these findings into proper perspective and reassuring their patients when initiating treatment as well as on every follow-up visit.

Summary

Most of the recent highly publicized serious adverse effects ascribed to proton pump inhibitors are not based on demonstrable evidence. Nevertheless, when proton pump inhibitors are prescribed long-term, they should be used at the lowest effective dose and the need for their use periodically reassessed.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^115tHJYi]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The introduction of generic PPIs into the market has been followed by an increasing rate of PPI prescribing related to chronic treatments, unlicensed indications, and therapeutic substitutions. Furthermore, since PPIs are now available over-the-counter, patients can have free access to them and for long periods of time, without seeking medical attention. Counseling is therefore important to ensure that patients understand that failure of symptoms to resolve or a rapid symptom relapse while taking a PPI is an indication to consult a physician. Furthermore, concerns about potential masking of a more serious pathology, such as malignancy, should not be overlooked.

Inappropriate PPI use is a matter of great concern, especially in the elderly, who are often affected by multiple comorbidities and are taking multiple medications, and are thus at an increased risk of long-term PPI-related adverse outcomes and drug-to-drug interactions (DDIs). There is indeed a strong relationship between the number of administered drugs and potential, clinically relevant DDIs, particularly in older adults. As a consequence, the number of yearly papers reporting PPI-related adverse events and/or PPI-drug interactions has steadily increased over the past decade.

### Long-term use of proton-pump inhibitors: whole-of-population patterns in Australia 2013–2016 [^116C3mMv]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

A growing body of studies have detected possible harms associated with long-term use of PPIs.– The risk of PPI-related adverse events can be minimized by stepping down the PPI dose or discontinuing treatment altogether. However, it is not clear what proportion of PPI-treated people are receiving long-term treatment and to what extent long-term treated people are in fact attempting lower treatment strengths or discontinuation during the course of their therapy.

Previous studies have described contemporary real-world patterns of treatment with PPIs and how well this treatment adheres to recommended guidelines, but questions remain around the typical duration of PPI treatment, the patterns of PPI use over extended periods and the proportion of people who initiate PPIs and continue on maintenance and longer-term therapy. Therefore, in this study we used dispensing claims for every person in Australia dispensed publicly subsidized PPIs between 2013 and 2016 to determine the incidence and prevalence of PPI use and what other medicines people are using concomitant with PPIs. We further examine the patterns and durations of PPI treatment among individuals continuing treatment beyond 12 weeks after initiation.

### Effect of proton pump inhibitors on clinical outcome in patients treated with clopidogrel: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117GZJWn]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

To investigate whether proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) negatively affect clinical outcome in patients treated with clopidogrel. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Outcomes evaluated were combined major adverse cardiac events (MACE), myocardial infarction (MI), stent thrombosis, death and gastrointestinal bleeding. Studies included were randomized trials or post-hoc analyzes of randomized trials and observational studies reporting adjusted effect estimates. Twenty five studies met the selection criteria and included 159 138 patients. Administration of PPIs together with clopidogrel corresponded to a 29% increased risk of combined major cardiovascular events [risk ratio (RR) = 1.29, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.15–1.45] and a 31% increased risk of MI (RR = 1.31, 95%CI = 1.12–1.53). In contrast, PPI use did not negatively influence the mortality (RR = 1.04, 95%CI = 0.93–1.16), whereas the risk of developing a gastrointestinal bleed under PPI treatment decreased by 50% (RR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.37–0.69). The presence of significant heterogeneity might indicate that the evidence is biased, confounded or inconsistent. The sensitivity analysis, however, yielded that the direction of the effect remained unchanged irrespective of the publication type, study quality, study size or risk of developing an event. Two studies indicate that PPIs have a negative effect irrespective of clopidogrel exposure. In conclusion, concomitant PPI use might be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events but does not influence the risk of death. Prospective randomized trials are required to investigate whether a cause-and-effect relationship truly exists and to explore whether different PPIs worsen clinical outcome in clopidogrel treated patients as the PPI-clopidogrel drug-drug interaction does not seem to be a class effect.

### Reducing clinically significant gastrointestinal toxicity associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [^116D11S7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of treatment strategies to reduce clinically significant gastrointestinal adverse effects associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-November 2003) was performed to identify relevant articles. Key search terms included proton-pump inhibitors, histamine H2 antagonists, misoprostol, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, stomach ulcer, prevention, and economics. Additional references were obtained from cross-referencing the bibliographies of selected articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All information obtained from the MEDLINE search was reviewed. To provide the most clinically relevant information, only randomized controlled trials are included in this review.

Data Synthesis

Clinically significant upper gastrointestinal adverse events, such as ulcers and ulcer complications, associated with NSAIDs are a cause of significant morbidity and mortality in the US. Interest in strategies to reduce the risk of these adverse events is high among clinicians and patients. Misoprostol, high-dose H2-receptor antagonists, proton-pump inhibitors, and COX-2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce this risk. Misoprostol and proton-pump inhibitors are more effective than H2-receptor antagonists; dose-related diarrhea limits the clinical utility of misoprostol. These strategies may not provide enough protection in patients taking concomitant low-dose aspirin therapy or patients with a history of ulcer complications.

Conclusions

COX-2 inhibitors and proton-pump inhibitors are effective and well-tolerated therapies to reduce clinically significant upper gastrointestinal adverse events associated with NSAIDs.

### Community-dwelling older adults' awareness of the inappropriate use of proton pump inhibitors [^111N5yuV]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

PPIs are one of the most commonly used medications among community-dwelling older adults. The current study reported findings on the long-term use or inappropriate prescribing of PPIs. An association was found between patients' concerns regarding the adverse effects of PPIs and their attempts to stop PPIs, especially if advised to do so by a PCP. Despite the potential adverse effects of the long-term use of PPIs by older adults, PPI discontinuation may not be appropriate for patients who need long-term acid suppression. Therefore, PCPs should discuss the risks and benefits of PPI use with their patients in order to prevent them from making inappropriate decisions related to PPI therapy. The long-term use of PPIs should be carefully evaluated, especially in the case of older adults who take PPIs for uncertain indications. Future studies with more well-controlled designs and samples of older populations are recommended. Also, future studies which focus on older adults' awareness of the benefits of PPI use as well as the risks are recommended.

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate? [^11733SbJ]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is commonly used outside of Food and Drug Administration indication for a broad range of conditions such as extra-esophageal reflux and PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia. While this may be appropriate in some scenarios, it has also resulted in widespread inappropriate PPI use. At the same time, data suggesting adverse effects of long-term PPI therapy are multiplying, albeit mainly from low quality studies. The systematic review by Scarpignato et al. (BMC Med 14:179, 2016) addresses this dilemma with a comprehensive analysis of the risks and benefits of PPI use. The authors concluded that, while PPIs are highly efficacious in erosive acid-peptic disorders, efficacy is not equaled in other conditions. In some instances, they found no supportive evidence of benefit. With respect to side effects, they indicated that the questionable harms associated with PPI therapy do not outweigh the benefits afforded by appropriate PPI use. However, inappropriate PPI use results in increased healthcare costs and unnecessary exposure to potential adverse effects. Ideally, PPI therapy should be personalized, based on indication, effectiveness, patient preference, and risk assessment.

### Proton pump inhibitors for the prevention of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced ulcers and dyspepsia [^113kHgVj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most frequently prescribed medicines, commonly used to mitigate pain, inflammation, and cardiovascular prevention, among others. Chronic NSAID consumption increases the risk of acute renal failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, and gastrointestinal toxicity, ranging from mild dyspepsia to serious ulcer complications such as bleeding, obstruction, and perforation. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may exert a gastroprotective effect from NSAID gastroduodenal injury by reducing gastric acid secretion.

Objectives

To assess the effects of proton pump inhibitors on the prevention of dyspepsia and ulcers in people with chronic consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), and two trial registers up to 23 October 2023, as well as reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs comparing PPIs taken orally versus placebo, histamine 2-receptor antagonists, misoprostol, or sucralfate in adults and children with chronic consumption of NSAIDs for four weeks or longer.

Outcomes

Our outcomes were global symptoms of dyspepsia, incident ulcer, adverse events, ulcer complications, and quality of life.

Risk Of Bias

We used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for RCTs and the tool extension for cluster-RCTs.

Synthesis Methods

We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models to calculate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. Due to statistical heterogeneity, we conducted meta-analyses for all but two outcomes. We summarised the certainty of evidence according to GRADE methods.

Included Studies

We included 12 studies with 8760 participants. All studies were conducted in an outpatient setting in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Central America, South America, and Australia. They were published between 1996 and 2014. All studies measured outcomes in the short term (up to 12 months).

Synthesis Of Results

PPI versus placebo PPIs may have little to no effect on global symptoms of dyspepsia assessed as a dichotomous outcome, but the evidence is very uncertain (meta-analysis was not possible due to high and unexplained statistical heterogeneity and point estimates of RR ranged from 0.36 to 1.13; 8 studies; 4944 participants; very low-certainty evidence). PPIs probably result in a slight reduction in global symptoms of dyspepsia assessed as a continuous outcome (MD -0.56, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.38; 2 studies, 1149 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). PPIs probably result in a reduction in incident ulcers compared to placebo (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.36; 11 studies, 7022 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). PPIs may have few or no adverse events, but the evidence is very uncertain (meta-analysis was not possible due to high and unexplained statistical heterogeneity and point estimates of RR ranged from 0.67 to 6.35; 12 studies, 7530 participants; very low-certainty evidence). PPIs may reduce ulcer complications compared with placebo (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.07; P = 0.30; I² = 18%; 5 studies, 4394 participants; low-certainty evidence). PPIs probably result in a slight increase in quality of life (MD 0.39, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.55; 2 studies, 1149 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). PPI versus histamine 2-receptor antagonists PPIs may increase incident ulcers (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 19.44; 1 study, 26 participants; low-certainty evidence). The included study did not report data on global symptoms of dyspepsia, adverse events, ulcer complications, or quality of life. PPI versus misoprostol PPIs may increase incident ulcers (RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.25 to 4.30; 1 study, 402 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and may have fewer adverse events (RR 0.38, 0.25 to 0.57; 1 study, 402 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. The included study did not report data on global symptoms of dyspepsia, ulcer complications, or quality of life. No studies compared PPI against sucralfate. Most included studies were at overall high risk of bias or overall some concerns of risk of bias. Imprecision in the effect estimates was also a concern.

Authors' Conclusions

Compared with placebo, PPIs may have no effect on the presence of global symptoms of dyspepsia and probably result in a slight reduction in global symptoms of dyspepsia scales. PPI probably reduces incident ulcers and may have little to no effect on adverse events. PPIs may reduce ulcer complications and probably slightly increase quality of life. Compared with histamine 2-receptor antagonists, PPIs may increase incident ulcers. The evidence for this comparison came from only one study. Compared with misoprostol, PPIs may increase incident ulcers and may reduce adverse events, but the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence for this comparison came from only one study. The certainty of the evidence for most outcomes and comparisons was low or very low, except for global symptoms of dyspepsia measured as a continuous outcome, incident ulcer, and quality of life in the comparison of PPI versus placebo. Further research is needed to assess the effect of PPIs compared to other active treatments such as sucralfate, misoprostol, or histamine 2-receptor antagonists. Well-designed and reported studies focussing on patient-important outcomes and addressing the methodological limitations found in the present included studies would be informative. These could include different baseline ulcer risks, ages, and types of NSAIDs. Long-term follow-up would be beneficial.

### Complications of proton pump inhibitor therapy [^1144tdE6]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Safety issues associated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have recently attracted widespread media and lay attention. Gastroenterologists are frequently asked about the appropriateness of PPI therapy for specific patients. Furthermore, some patients may have had PPI therapy discontinued abruptly or inappropriately due to safety concerns. Faced with such a wide variety of potentially serious adverse consequences, prescribers need to evaluate the evidence objectively to discern the likelihood that any reported association might actually be causal. Here, we review many of the proposed adverse consequences of PPI therapy and apply established criteria for the determination of causation. We also consider the potential contribution of residual confounding in many of the reported studies. Evidence is inadequate to establish causal relationships between PPI therapy and many of the proposed associations. Residual confounding related to study design and the overextrapolation of quantitatively small estimates of effect size have probably led to much of the current controversy about PPI safety. In turn, this has caused unnecessary concern among patients and prescribers. The benefits of PPI therapy for appropriate indications need to be considered, along with the likelihood of the proposed risks. Patients with a proven indication for a PPI should continue to receive it in the lowest effective dose. PPI dose escalation and continued chronic therapy in those unresponsive to initial empiric therapy is discouraged.

### Recent safety concerns with proton pump inhibitors [^112QZmP1]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

There have been recent concerns about the safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). We focus here on 3 specific concerns-the possible interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel, the postulated link between PPI use and fractures, and the possibility that long-term PPI use might lead to hypomagnesemia. There is evidence for an in vitro interaction between clopidogrel and at least some PPIs. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned against the use of certain PPIs by patients on clopidogrel. However, a randomized controlled trial that compared clopidogrel alone with the combination of clopidogrel and omeprazole found no increase in adverse cardiovascular outcomes and a reduction in the rate of adverse gastrointestinal outcomes attributable to omeprazole. PPI use may be a weak risk factor for certain fractures, but the quality of evidence is relatively poor and there is a strong possibility of confounding. The mechanism whereby PPI use might increase fracture risk is unknown. Currently, no additional measures concerning calcium supplementation or bone mineral density monitoring are recommended for patients on a PPI. The FDA has suggested monitoring serum magnesium levels in patients on PPI therapy. The mechanism and frequency of PPI-induced hypomagnesemia are unclear. PPI treatment should not be withheld from patients who genuinely require it, but the PPI should be taken in the lowest effective dose and only for as long as clinically indicated. The same is, of course, true for all medicines. The benefits of PPI therapy greatly outweigh the risks.

### Cost effectiveness of COX 2 selective inhibitors and traditional NSAIDs alone or in combination with a proton pump inhibitor for people with osteoarthritis [^114pYLhD]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

A clear result from this analysis is it is cost effective to co-prescribe a proton pump inhibitor when either a COX 2 selective inhibitor or a traditional NSAID is given, even for patients at relatively low risk of gastrointestinal adverse events. This result is driven by recent improvements in the evidence base for proton pump inhibitors and reductions in their price. In the past it has not been considered usual to co-prescribe a proton pump inhibitor with a COX 2 selective inhibitor, thus this recommendation represents a change in current practice. Assuming a class effect for proton pump inhibitors, the cheapest of these agents will always be cost effective. At current prices the relative risk of gastrointestinal adverse events could be as high as 0.98 before the addition of a proton pump inhibitor becomes cost ineffective at a cost effectiveness threshold of £20 000 per additional quality adjusted life year.

Another key finding of this analysis is that the co-prescription of a proton pump inhibitor with a COX 2 selective inhibitor rather than a traditional NSAID might be a cost effective treatment option for younger patients without specific gastrointestinal risk factors. Previously, the use of a COX 2 selective inhibitor would have been considered only in patients at high risk of gastrointestinal adverse events. There is uncertainty over this finding, though, primarily owing to uncertainties over the adverse event data, some of which are based on low event numbers.

The relative cost effectiveness of the traditional NSAIDs depended on the adverse event data used. The sensitivity analyses showed that there is high uncertainty over which specific NSAID or COX 2 selective inhibitor is most cost effective — the results were sensitive to most of the analyses run. It is, therefore, difficult to make a firm conclusion. The same is true for the relative cost effectiveness of the two currently available COX 2 selective inhibitors. For patients at increased risk of cardiovascular or gastrointestinal events (that is, equivalent to the risk of an average 65 year old), paracetamol results in fewer adverse events and is more cost effective than any of the traditional NSAIDs co-prescribed with a proton pump inhibitor, but is not superior a COX 2 selective inhibitor with a proton pump inhibitor. For lower risk patients, prescribing a traditional NSAID or a COX 2 selective inhibitor with a proton pump inhibitor is likely to be cost effective compared with paracetamol.

### Community-dwelling older adults' awareness of the inappropriate use of proton pump inhibitors [^113m13Bv]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Given the potential benefits and adverse effects of PPI use, it is essential to examine older adults' awareness of the risks and benefits associated with the long-term use of PPIs. Many research studies have investigated the attitudes of healthcare providers regarding PPI use by older adults. However, limited studies have investigated the awareness of PPI use among older adults themselves. Whilst physicians' awareness is explicit, older adults tend to be passive in expressing their awareness of the potential risks and benefits of their medications.

A recent study, which was possibly the first to examine the awareness of PPI use among older adults, found that most older adults are neither familiar with nor concerned about the adverse effects of PPI use. Also, most patients were unwilling to stop using PPIs, despite their potential serious negative consequences. Even in cases where a physician had discussed the adverse effects of PPI use with the patient, only 9% of patients had responded positively and asked their physician to stop their PPI prescriptions. However, older adults reported feeling uncomfortable towards discussing whether to stop PPIs with their providers. Older adults asked for PPIs for non-evidence based medical indications, and the most common attitude towards prescription medications among older adults was confidence and trust in the physician's decisions. However, when advised to discontinue PPIs, older adults seem to doubt the competence of the physician. Social prescribing accounted for almost 38% of PPI prescriptions for American older adults in 2019.

The current study aimed to assess older adults' knowledge and awareness of the adverse effects of long-term PPI use and their willingness to stop taking PPIs. As a secondary purpose, we examined the predictors of PPI duration of use and discontinuation. Recent studies which have investigated PPI use have mainly focused on the prevalence of long-term PPI use, whilst little is known about the predictors of PPI discontinuation. Also, previous studies have mainly examined medical (e.g. gastroenterological morbidity and concurrent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) and non-medical (sociodemographic status) factors and how they are associated with PPI use. However, examining the association between older adults' awareness of PPIs and their use of PPIs is also crucial for achieving optimal patient care. The extent to which these factors predict PPI discontinuation and duration of use remains unclear.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^111ofaxZ]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

PPIs are among the safest class of drugs. Although concerns have been raised on their long-term safety, the preponderance of evidence does not strongly support the concerns, publicized over the last few years, and the absolute risk is probably low. Some adverse effects are plausible and predictable; others are idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and rare. Based on the quality of the existing evidence, the benefits of PPI treatment outweigh the potential risks in most patients, especially if PPI use is based on a relevant and appropriate indication. Conversely, patients treated without an appropriate therapeutic indication are only exposed to potential risks and the benefit-to-harm balance becomes very low. Consequently, the overall focus should be on the appropriateness of PPI therapy and on a regular assessment of the need for continued PPI treatment.

Nearly all the adverse outcomes associated with PPIs occur among patients who receive long-term therapy; minimizing the duration of treatment by periodically reviewing a patient's need for acid-suppressive therapy could eliminate or substantially reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. Therefore, during continued long-term use, the clinical effects should always be reviewed and attempts be made to stop any therapy that may not be needed. It is imperative to use the lowest dose of drug required to achieve the desired therapeutic goals. This may entail implementing discontinuation of treatment in asymptomatic patients as well as step-down, intermittent, or on-demand PPI therapy for maintenance of GERD. It should be emphasized, however, that PPI treatment in GERD is merely palliative in nature, since it does not address the underlying pathophysiology, something only ARS is able to achieve. Therefore, in young fit patients needing continuous acid suppression, fundoplication should be considered. Intermittent or on-demand PPI therapy is not suitable for NSAID users, since the risk of serious GI events is constant in those patients with GI risk factors and can persist for some time after stopping therapy.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on the diagnosis and management of GERD: summary and recommendations [^116A4fiT]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

ASGE guideline — Recommendation 4 for proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy in GERD states that in patients with symptomatic and confirmed GERD with predominant heartburn symptoms, the ASGE recommends medical management with PPIs at the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible period of time while initiating discussion about long-term management options (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). In patients with suboptimal clinical response to PPI therapy, the ASGE suggests testing CYP2C19 polymorphism and adjusting PPI dosage and/or selection accordingly (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). Best practice advice includes that patients on chronic PPI therapy (> 6 months) should be considered for optimization and de-escalation, providers should carefully consider risks, benefits, and alternatives of PPI use, and prescribers should be aware that adverse events in prospective data have been limited to a modest increased risk of enteric infections with a need for robust long-term data to confirm or refute other putative adverse events.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^1161rKgp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) observational associations and causality criteria — experts apply the Bradford-Hill criteria and caution that "unless RRs in cohort studies exceed 2–3 or ORs in case-control studies exceed 3–4, the findings generally should not be considered credible", noting that reported PPI adverse-effect associations "typically have described weak associations with RRs or ORs < 2". Apparent strong associations may reflect bias, as "a strong association (ORs > 4) between PPI usage and esophageal adenocarcinoma" is "likely due to confounding by indication", and reported links with community-acquired pneumonia "may well have been the result of protopathic bias".

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate? [^111FrojA]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Use of PPIs

Coincident with PPI usage, the literature surrounding PPI safety and efficacy is growing exponentially, making it difficult to delineate an evidence-based guideline on their use. In the study by Scarpignato et al. committees on behalf of three Italian scientific societies collaborated with impressive panels of expert international reviewers to address 13 clinical scenarios in which uncertainty exists about how to prescribe PPIs and where drug misuse is common. They performed a systematic literature review inclusive of almost 500 papers and present a narrative review of the safety and appropriateness of PPI therapy in each scenario. Table 1 summarizes the key messages regarding appropriate PPI use in the 13 scenarios, organized into those appropriate for long-term or short-term PPI use, or not at all. Examining this compendium, one is immediately struck by the fact that the table includes many usages for which there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications. Apparently, the world literature provides ample evidence for the efficacy of PPIs outside of FDA indications.

### Proton pump inhibitors and their drug interactions: an evidence-based approach [^115cBQcz]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

The proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective antisecretory agents used to treat acid-related disorders. As such, they are frequently prescribed for patients who are concurrently using other medications. PPIs may interact with other drugs through numerous mechanisms. The most important include competitive inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism, and alteration of the absorption of other drugs via changes in gastric pH levels. Poor metabolizers, who lack CYP2C19, may be particularly predisposed to drug interactions. Although the potential for drug interactions is high, few clinically significant interactions have been reported for the PPIs. Nevertheless, caution is indicated when certain drugs are co-prescribed with these agents. The incidence of clinically significant drug interactions increases proportionately with the number of drugs taken and with the age of the patient. The drug interaction with the greatest clinical importance is the reduction in benzodiazepine clearance by omeprazole.

### Are proton pump inhibitors really so dangerous? [^114S1mEN]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

For decades, millions of patients with acid-related disorders have had their acid inhibited effectively and safely first with H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and then with proton pump inhibitors (PPI). As with any pharmacological agent, PPIs have been reported to be associated with some adverse events, but several recent large-scale observational studies have evidenced new and serious abnormalities generally linked to their chronic use. However, these studies have often important limitations for their frequent retrospective design and other methodological drawbacks, such as selection biases of the analyzed populations and the presence of various confounding factors. Overall, although the conclusions of these pharmacovigilant investigations must be taken into account and can generate important hypotheses for future research, they do not have to create panic among patients and alarmism among physicians. On considering the weakness of these studies, we suggest physicians should not refrain from continuing to use PPIs, if these drugs are given for medical indications clearly established in the literature and, more importantly, they should not be induced to shift to H2RAs, a class of antisecretory agents that are much less effective than PPIs. A return to the past is potentially dangerous for the patients, taking into account the well-known success of PPIs in the wide spectrum of all acid-related conditions.

### Physicians' perceptions of proton pump inhibitor risks and recommendations to discontinue: a national survey [^113J3CvJ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide contemporary estimates of internists' perceptions of adverse effects associated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and self-reported clinical use.

Methods

We invited 799 internists, including specialists and postgraduate trainees, to complete an online survey. Topics included perceptions of PPI adverse effects (AEs) and effectiveness for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) prevention, changes in prescribing, and management recommendations for patients using PPIs for gastroesophageal reflux disease or UGIB prevention. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with appropriate PPI continuation in the scenario of a patient at high risk for UGIB.

Results

Among 437 respondents (55% response rate), 10% were trainees and 72% specialized in general medicine, 70% were somewhat/very concerned about PPI AEs, and 76% had somewhat/very much changed their prescribing. A majority believed PPIs increase the risk for 6 of 12 AEs queried. Fifty-two percent perceived PPIs to be somewhat/very effective for UGIB prevention. In a gastroesophageal reflux disease scenario in which PPI can be safely discontinued, 86% appropriately recommended PPI discontinuation. However, in a high-risk UGIB prevention scenario in which long-term PPI use is recommended, 79% inappropriately recommended discontinuation. In this latter scenario, perceived effectiveness for bleeding prevention was strongly associated with continuing PPI (odds ratio 7.68, P < 0.001 for moderately; odds ratio 17.3, P < 0.001 for very effective). Other covariates, including concern about PPI AEs, had no significant association.

Discussion

Most internists believe PPIs cause multiple AEs and recommend discontinuation even in patients at high risk for UGIB. Future interventions should focus on ensuring that PPIs are prescribed appropriately according to individual risks and benefits.

### How to advise patients on the risk of chronic proton pump inhibitor therapy [^114yiYrC]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed and have excellent short-term tolerability. Administrative database studies have highlighted that many diseases are associated with PPI therapy including pneumonia, fracture, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. This review therefore reviews the evidence of the risks and benefits of these drugs.

Recent Findings

There is high-to-moderate quality evidence that PPIs are effective at treating many acid-related disorders. Recent randomized trials have suggested that the associations between PPIs and various diseases are likely to be related to bias and residual confounding and these drugs appear to be safe apart from a possible increased risk of enteric infections.

Summary

PPIs should be used at the lowest dose and for the shortest duration possible. They are still relatively well-tolerated drugs but should only be prescribed for proven indications.

### Proton pump inhibitors for gastroduodenal damage related to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin: twelve important questions for clinical practice [^117T6ige]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin are among the most commonly used medications worldwide. Their use is associated with significant gastroduodenal adverse effects, including dyspepsia, bleeding, ulcer formation, and perforation. Given their long-term use by millions of patients, there is a substantial impact at the population level of these complications. In this evidence-based review, we have endeavored to answer 12 commonly encountered questions in clinical practice that deal with the following: extent of the problem of NSAID/aspirin-induced gastroduodenal damage and its impact on public health; role of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the primary prevention, healing, and secondary prevention of NSAID/aspirin-induced gastroduodenal ulceration as assessed by using endoscopic end points; role of PPIs in the prevention of adverse clinical outcomes related to NSAID/aspirin use; whether PPIs are effective in NSAID-induced dyspepsia; comparison of PPI co-therapy with selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors for risk reduction of adverse clinical outcomes; role of PPIs in preventing rebleeding from aspirin ± clopidogrel therapy in high-risk patients; identifying high-risk patients who can benefit from PPI co-therapy; the role of other gastroprotective agents for prevention of NSAID/aspirin-induced gastroduodenal damage; and the cost-effectiveness of and limitations to the use of PPIs for prevention of gastroduodenal damage related to the use of NSAIDs or aspirin. We then summarized our recommendations on the use of PPIs for the clinical management of patients using NSAIDs or aspirin.

### Proton pump inhibitor-associated hypomagnesemia: what do FDA data tell us? [^114fBxtd]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a class of medications indicated for the treatment of gastric acid-related diseases. Hypomagnesemia is a rare but serious adverse effect of PPIs.

Objective

To address the association between the use of different PPIs and hypomagnesemia by examining the frequency of occurrence of hypo magnesemia among the reported adverse drug reactions from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System database.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional study of PPI-associated adverse effect cases reported to the FDA between November 1, 1997, and April 1, 2012. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of sex, age, and different PPIs with hypomagnesemia. χ² analysis was conducted to investigate the association of PPI-associated hypomagnesemia with hypocalcemia and hypokalemia.

Results

Among 66,102 subjects identified as experiencing 1 or more adverse effects while taking a PPI, 1.0% (n = 693) were reported to have hypomagnesemia. The mean (SD) age of PPI users presenting with hypomagnesemia was 64.4 (12.9) years. Results from logistic regression indicated that, compared with esomeprazole, all other PPIs had a higher rate of hypomagnesemia, with pantoprazole having the highest rate (OR 4.3; 95% CI 3.3–5.7; p < 0.001). The risk of female subjects having hypo magnesemia (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.71–0.97; p = 0.016) was significantly lower than that of males. Elderly subjects (age > 65 years) were at increased risk of PPI-associated hypomagnesemia (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.2–1.7; p < 0.001). χ² analysis showed strong association between hypomagnesemia and both hypocalcemia (p < 0.001) and hypokalemia (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

All PPIs were associated with hypomagnesemia, with esomeprazole having the lowest risk and pantoprazole having the highest risk. The risk of PPI-associated hypomagnesemia was higher in males and the elderly population. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia commonly coexisted with PPI-associated hypomagnesemia.

### Proton pump inhibitors: potential adverse effects [^1111nUPZ]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes adverse effects of potential proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), including nutritional deficiencies (B12 and magnesium), rebound acid hypersecretion, acute interstitial nephritis, gastric carcinoid tumor, cardiovascular risk with clopidogrel and PPI coprescription, bone fractures, enteric infections and pneumonia. An epidemiologic framework is applied to assess clinical relevance and reinforce best practice recommendations.

Recent Findings

The evidence for PPI adverse events is limited by the absence of Level 1 (randomized controlled trial) studies. The best evidence supports Clostridium difficile and bone fractures in susceptible populations. A substantial reduction in gastrointestinal bleeding risk without increase in cardiovascular events was observed in the COGENT trial when clopidogrel was coprescribed with omeprazole. The risk of pneumonia is inconsistent, and although acute interstitial nephritis, nutritional deficiencies (including B12 and hypomagnesemia), gastric carcinoid and rebound hyperacidity are biologically plausible, studies have failed to demonstrate supportive clinical relevance.

Summary

Prescribe PPI for robust indications only. Strong data supporting risk of adverse events are lacking; however, exercise caution in the elderly and in patients with other risk factors for bone fractures or C. difficile infection.

### Discontinuing long-term PPI therapy: why, with whom, and how? [^114fPPGc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most widely used class of drugs prescribed over the long term in all of clinical medicine with 8–10% of ambulatory adults have been prescribed a PPI in the past 30 days. However, numerous studies have raised doubts about the long term safety of PPI use. The purpose of this review is threefold: (i) To provide an overview of the current evidence demonstrating associations between PPI use and adverse health outcomes and the likelihood of the associations being causal (Why?); (ii) To be able to identify long-term PPI users in whom the intensity of PPI therapy could be reduced or in whom PPIs could be eliminated outright (Who?); and (iii) To provide strategies on how to reduce or stop chronic PPI therapy while maintaining symptom control and reducing the risk for symptom or upper GI disease recurrence (How?).

### AGA clinical practice update on De-prescribing of proton pump inhibitors: expert review [^116yQMgC]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor use — epidemiology and indications: Observational studies have demonstrated that 7%–15% of patients use these medications at any time, with the prevalence increasing to 40% for patients 70 years or older; approximately one-quarter of all patients who receive a PPI will continue to use them for at least 1 year; and in a larger observational study examining ambulatory visits of PPI users, nearly two-thirds had no clear indication for PPI use.

### Proton-pump inhibitors among adults: a nationwide drug-utilization study [^116czQLh]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly prescribed for several acid-related disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and peptic ulcer disease. – These drugs are also effective in treating ulcers associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and as prophylactic treatment for patients on NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin. – Recommended doses and duration of PPI treatment vary by indications. Clinical guidelines rarely recommend PPI treatment for more than 8–12 weeks. High-dose treatment is recommended when initiating therapy for GORD and peptic ulcer disease, while low-dose treatment is generally regarded as a maintenance therapy for recovering patients.

PPIs are generally considered safe. However, their use has been associated with increased risks of adverse events, such as bone fractures, kidney disease, microscopic colitis, and hypomagnesemia. Use of PPIs has also been suggested to cause changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota, increasing the risk of Clostridium difficile infectionand chronic liver disease. Although PPIs have been shown to minimize NSAID-related adverse effects in the stomach, recent evidence suggests that PPIs might cause changes in the composition of the small intestinal microbiota, augmenting unwanted adverse effects of NSAIDs in the small intestines. Furthermore, discontinuation of PPI treatment has been linked to acid hypersecretionand the development of dyspeptic symptoms in healthy volunteers.

PPIs have had undisputed effects on the treatment of symptoms related to excessive acid secretion, but concerns are growing about inappropriate indications and potential overuse, both within hospitals and in the primary-care setting. – These concerns are compounded by observations of increased long-term use especially in elderly populations, – where overprescribing has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

In light of these concerns, we aimed to provide data on real-world use of PPIs, and changes thereof, across the past decade in an entire national population. Specifically, we aimed to determine patterns of use by patient and prescriber characteristics, including treatment duration contrasting between higher- and lower-dose PPIs. Furthermore, we described the proportion of PPI use attributable to gastroprotection.

### The effect of proton pump-inhibiting drugs on mineral metabolism [^116hNvwx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Two recent studies have reported increased hip fracture rates with long-term proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use raising concerns about adverse effects of this class of drugs on mineral metabolism. One plausible mechanism by which PPIs could affect calcium economy and skeletal homeostasis is by impairing intestinal calcium absorption. In the long term, this could potentially lead to a negative whole body calcium balance, resulting in higher rates of bone loss and a greater risk of fragility fractures.

### Pharmacologic features of proton pump inhibitors and their potential relevance to clinical practice [^115gqemD]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

In conclusion, PPIs differ slightly in their PK and PD properties and in their propensity to interact with other medications. Inhibition of acid secretion is a function of proton pump inhibition, and PPIs work in a similar fashion to achieve this goal. PK/PD principles can be used to optimize PPI therapy when considering issues related to administration, such as timing of drug delivery relative to the number of active pumps and the drug's AUC.

### Proton pump inhibitors for functional dyspepsia [^1165fiN9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Functional dyspepsia (FD or non-ulcer dyspepsia) is defined as continuous or frequently recurring epigastric pain or discomfort for which no organic cause can be found. Acid suppressive therapy, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), has been proposed as a therapeutic option in FD, but its efficacy remains controversial. While PPIs are generally considered safe and well tolerated, they have been associated with adverse events, especially in the long term. For this reason, decisions on whether to initiate or continue PPI therapy should be made based on an appropriate clinical indication. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate whether PPI therapy provides symptomatic relief in FD.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors in the improvement of global symptoms of dyspepsia and quality of life compared to placebo, H2 receptor antagonists or prokinetics, in people with functional dyspepsia.

Search Methods

We searched in the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Library (to January 2016), MEDLINE (OvidSP; to February 2016), Embase (OvidSP; to February 2016), and SIGLE grey literature (up to February 2016) and clinical trial registries; we handsearched abstracts from conferences up to February 2016. We screened non-systematic reviews, systematic reviews and guidelines to identify any additional trials. We contacted trialists to obtain missing information.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any PPI with placebo, H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) or prokinetics for the treatment of FD. Participants were adults (aged 16 years or greater) with an adequate diagnosis of FD (any validated criteria such as Rome I, II, III or Lancet Working Group).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, trial quality and extracted data. We collected data on dyspeptic symptoms, quality of life and number of overall adverse events. Specific adverse events were beyond the scope of this review.

Main Results

We identified 23 RCTs from 22 papers (with 8759 participants) studying the effect of PPIs versus placebo, H2RAs or prokinetics for improvement of global symptoms of dyspepsia and quality of life in people with FD. Low-dose PPIs had similar efficacy as standard-dose PPIs, therefore we combined these subgroups for the analysis. Two to eight weeks of therapy with PPI was slightly more effective than placebo at relieving overall dyspepsia symptoms in people with FD (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 0.94; participants = 5968; studies = 16; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 13; moderate quality evidence). PPIs may be slightly more effective than H2RAs (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.04; participants = 740; studies = 2, NNTB 13; low quality evidence), and slightly more effective than prokinetics (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.00; participants = 892; studies = 4; NNTB 20; low quality evidence) at relieving overall dyspepsia symptoms in people with FD. PPIs plus prokinetics were possibly slightly more effective than PPIs alone at relieving overall dyspepsia symptoms (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.08; participants = 407; studies = 2; NNTB 18; moderate quality evidence). The was no difference when subgrouped by Helicobacter pylori status, country of origin, or presence of reflux or Rome III subtypes. There were no differences in the number of adverse events observed between PPIs and any of the other treatments.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that PPIs are effective for the treatment of FD, independent of the dose and duration of treatment compared with placebo. PPIs may be slightly more effective than H2RAs for the treatment of FD; however, the evidence is scarce. The trials evaluating PPIs versus prokinetics are difficult to interpret as they are at risk of bias. Although the effect of these drugs seems to be small, the drugs are well tolerated.

### Proton pump inhibitors alter the composition of the gut microbiota [^115k6fLB]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

The described associations between PPI use and the gut microbiome warrant further research to better understand the driving mechanisms and their consequences, and are a further reason to reduce unnecessary prescribing.

### No associations between regular use of proton pump inhibitors and risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality: a population-based cohort of 0.44 million participants [^112Lr7RV]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The detailed discussion was reported in Supplementary eDiscussion (see Supplementary Digital Content 1). The findings of previous population-based cohort studies evaluating PPIs and mortality were inconsistent, showing either a positive or a null association. The primary rationale for increased mortality among PPI users is that PPIs are associated with various adverse outcomes and each is independently associated with higher risk of mortality. However, this inference may not be reliable because (i) the causal relationships between PPI use and most adverse outcomes have not been established; (ii) even if these associations are causal, the magnitudes of effects are small (most HRs were < 2), the proportion of participants that finally progress from these adverse outcomes to death would be small and require long period. Our results were in line with a recent cohort study, which suggested the association of PPIs with mortality may be due to protopathic bias. The additional contributions of the present analysis included the following: (i) we evaluated cause-specific mortality and the effects of individual PPIs and (ii) we identified a number of key confounding factors, particularly overall health status and longstanding disease, which have not been controlled in most previous observational studies. For example, a single adjustment for overall health rating led to a reduction in the HRs, from 1.37 to 1.05, for all-cause mortality (magnitude of confounding = 30.5%, which was much lower than the recommended cutoff change (10%) for assessing a confounder).

Our strengths included large sample size, high quality data source, adequate adjustment of confounding factors, and comparison with active control. A major limitation is potential misclassification of exposure because it was only assessed once at baseline. However, in a subset of 20,344 participants with reassessment of PPI use during 2012–13, the concordance rate was high (91.4%). Despite the large sample size, this study may not be able to test very small difference. Given the very wide overall PPI use in the population, a small risk increase may be consequential.

Overall, this large cohort found no convincing evidence of associations between regular PPI use and risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality. In clinical practice, there is no justification to stop PPI use out of concerns of increased mortality for patients with a valid indication. The potential long-term effects other than mortality remain to be determined. Future observational studies evaluating side effects of drugs should comprehensively adjust for confounders and carefully interpret the results to avoid misleading patients or the general public.

### Is empiric proton pump inhibition in patients with symptoms of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux justified? [^112r4kzA]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to the imprecision of a PPI trial as a diagnostic test, the potential side effects of PPIs should also be kept in mind. While the absolute risk of side effects caused by a PPI trial is low, long-term use in larger populations may significantly increase gastrointestinal infections, alter the gastrointestinal microbiome and increase the risk of gastric cancer. Rebound acid hypersecretion after cessation of PPI use is especially of concern when treating individuals with poor indication of PPI use as it may lead to long-term use with risks that will necessarily outweigh benefits. Symptomatic rebound hypersecretion is likely to be common after a 12-week PPI trial. After eight weeks of esomeprazole 40 mg once daily 44% of healthy volunteers reported symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux versus 15% in the placebo group. Similarly, after cessation of four weeks of pantoprazole 40 mg once daily as many as 44% versus 9% in the placebo group had dyspeptic symptoms. After long-term PPI use, rebound acid hypersecretion lasts between two and four months, which may prevent patients from stopping PPI once started. The use of PPI has almost doubled over the past decade in Norway as well as in other countries and the costs are high. Although many patients have good indications for long-term PPI use that clearly outweighs risks of side effects, the concern is obvious when patients without indication or benefit of PPI use starts life-long acid inhibition.

### Proton pump inhibitors: an update [^111Y5bhT]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Since their introduction in the late 1980s, proton pump inhibitors have demonstrated gastric acid suppression superior to that of histamine H2-receptor blockers. Proton pump inhibitors have enabled improved treatment of various acid-peptic disorders, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced gastropathy. Proton pump inhibitors have minimal side effects and few significant drug interactions, and they are generally considered safe for long-term treatment. The proton pump inhibitors omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and the recently approved esomeprazole appear to have similar efficacy.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) safety — randomized trial outcomes: In a large placebo-controlled trial, "17,598 patients aged 65 years or older" with vascular disease were randomized to pantoprazole "(40 mg daily, n = 8,791) or placebo (n = 8,807)", with data collected "at 6-month intervals over a period of 3 years" to assess predefined adverse events. Investigators "found no significant differences between the PPI and placebo groups" for potential side effects "except for enteric infections (1.4% vs 1.0% in the PPI and placebo groups, respectively; OR 1.33; 95% CI, 1.01–1.75)", and "Pantoprazole for 3 years was not associated with any adverse event other than a modestly increased risk of developing enteric infections". Caveats noted include that "the trial had a maximum follow-up of 5 years" and that it "cannot exclude the possibility that PPIs confer a modest risk of any of these adverse events (i.e., the upper limit of the 95% CIs all are > 1)".

### Proton pump inhibitors in children: a review [^113BEYij]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2003). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors are often used to treat disorders associated with gastric hypersecretion in children, despite the lack of pediatric formulations. They are highly effective in the treatment of ulcers, gastro-esophageal reflux disorders and hypersecretory diseases. They provide a high level of gastric acid inhibition with few adverse effects. The aim of this article is to review the available studies concerning the use of proton pump inhibitors in pediatric populations and to point out: indications for use in children, optimal dosage, risk of adverse effects and consequences of the mechanism of action, and drug interactions. We performed a Medline and Embase search of publications printed from January 1980 to December 2002 concerning the use of proton pump inhibitors in children. We consider the available randomised controlled trials and several other uncontrolled studies conducted in the pediatric population, including all available information concerning the pediatric use of proton pump inhibitors. In children as well as in adults, there are clinical conditions (i.e., severe esophagitis or eradication of Helicobacter pylori) in which proton pump inhibitors offer clear advantages over histamine-2 receptor antagonists. The relatively common use of acid inhibitors (proton pump inhibitors and histamine-2 receptor antagonists) in uncomplicated gastro-esophageal reflux disorders or in the prevention of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/steroid gastropathy is often unsubstantiated and should be limited to very specific situations. Multicentre randomised controlled studies are needed to better define the efficacy profile, the optimal dosage with respect to the different indications and the safety profile for chronic therapy of proton pump inhibitors in children.

### Deprescribing versus continuation of chronic proton pump inhibitor use in adults [^112DQEkz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a class of medications that reduce acid secretion and are used for treating many conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), dyspepsia, reflux esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, and hypersecretory conditions (e.g. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), and as part of the eradication therapy for Helicobacter pylori bacteria. However, approximately 25% to 70% of people are prescribed a PPI inappropriately. Chronic PPI use without reassessment contributes to polypharmacy and puts people at risk of experiencing drug interactions and adverse events (e.g. Clostridium difficile infection, pneumonia, hypomagnesaemia, and fractures).

Objectives

To determine the effects (benefits and harms) associated with deprescribing long-term PPI therapy in adults, compared to chronic daily use (28 days or greater).

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 10), MEDLINE, Embase, clinicaltrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). The last date of search was November 2016. We handsearched the reference lists of relevant studies. We screened 2357 articles (2317 identified through search strategy, 40 through other resources). Of these articles, we assessed 89 for eligibility.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized trials comparing at least one deprescribing modality (e.g. stopping PPI or reducing PPI) with a control consisting of no change in continuous daily PPI use in adult chronic users. Outcomes of interest were: change in gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, drug burden/PPI use, cost/resource use, negative and positive drug withdrawal events, and participant satisfaction.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed and extracted data and completed the risk of bias assessment. A third review author independently confirmed risk of bias assessment. We used Review Manager 5 software for data analysis. We contacted study authors if there was missing information.

Main Results

The review included six trials (n = 1758). Trial participants were aged 48 to 57 years, except for one trial that had a mean age of 73 years. All participants were from the outpatient setting and had either nonerosive reflux disease or milder grades of esophagitis (LA grade A or B). Five trials investigated on-demand deprescribing and one trial examined abrupt discontinuation. There was low quality evidence that on-demand use of PPI may increase risk of 'lack of symptom control' compared with continuous PPI use (risk ratio (RR) 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31 to 2.21), thereby favoring continuous PPI use (five trials, n = 1653). There was a clinically significant reduction in 'drug burden', measured as PPI pill use per week with on-demand therapy (mean difference (MD) -3.79, 95% CI -4.73 to -2.84), favoring deprescribing based on moderate quality evidence (four trials, n = 1152). There was also low quality evidence that on-demand PPI use may be associated with reduced participant satisfaction compared with continuous PPI use. None of the included studies reported cost/resource use or positive drug withdrawal effects.

Authors' Conclusions

In people with mild GERD, on-demand deprescribing may lead to an increase in GI symptoms (e.g. dyspepsia, regurgitation) and probably a reduction in pill burden. There was a decline in participant satisfaction, although heterogeneity was high. There were insufficient data to make a conclusion regarding long-term benefits and harms of PPI discontinuation, although two trials (one on-demand trial and one abrupt discontinuation trial) reported endoscopic findings in their intervention groups at study end.

### Sex-specific association of chronic proton pump inhibitor use with reduced bone density and quality [^115RsHbJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) represent a class of drugs widely used in clinical practice for their antacid action. Their use has increased rapidly worldwide because they generally are well tolerated and have few side effects. However, recent investigations have raised concerns regarding the potential long-term adverse effects associated with chronic PPI use, such as an increased risk of enteric infections, community-acquired pneumonia, and possibly some forms of gastric cancer.

Another possible side effect of chronic PPI intake is an increase in bone fragility. In 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration updated the list of potential side effects for PPIs to include an increased risk of hip, wrist, and vertebral fractures following reports from multiple epidemiological studies conducted in preceding years. Subsequently, this association between PPI use and fracture risk has been further corroborated by numerous additional studies and meta-analyses.

Although the evidence regarding increased fracture risk is relatively concordant, studies regarding the effect of PPI use on bone mineral density (BMD) have reported conflicting results, with most of them showing either modest or no effect on BMD during PPI use. A frequent limitation of these studies is that, despite the well-known differences in the pathophysiology of bone metabolism between males and females, the possible presence of sex-specific differences in the association between PPI use and BMD has only rarely been explored. Moreover, although bone density is the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis and the most reliable noninvasive predictor of fracture risk, skeletal fragility can also be determined by alterations in bone quality, with subtler changes in bone microarchitecture that are not captured by BMD.

In recent years, various noninvasive methods for assessing bone quality have been developed, with the trabecular bone score (TBS) emerging as one of the simplest and most accessible. TBS is a texture-based metric that measures the rate of gray-level changes in lumbar spine dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) images, providing an indirect estimation of bone microarchitectural health. Numerous studies have shown that TBS can predict osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women independently of bone density; in addition, the evaluation of TBS is of particular relevance in various settings of secondary osteoporosis, in which the risk of fractures is often less associated with BMD, but rather related to changes in bone microstructure and quality.

### When does proton pump inhibitor treatment become long term? A scoping review [^1166HAib]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Objective

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use has risen substantially, primarily driven by ongoing use over months to years. However, there is no consensus on how to define long-term PPI use. Our objectives were to review and compare definitions of long-term PPI use in existing literature and describe the rationale for each definition. Moreover, we aimed to suggest generally applicable definitions for research and clinical use.

Design

The databases PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched for publications concerning long-term use of PPIs and ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for registered studies. Two reviewers independently screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts in two series and subsequently extracted data.

Results

A total of 742 studies were identified, and 59 met the eligibility criteria. In addition, two ongoing studies were identified. The definition of long-term PPI use varied from > 2 weeks to > 7 years. The most common definition was ≥ 1 year or ≥ 6 months. A total of 12/61 (20%) of the studies rationalised their definition.

Conclusion

The definitions of long-term PPI treatment varied substantially between studies and were seldom rationalised.

In a clinical context, use of PPI for more than 8 weeks could be a reasonable definition of long-term use in patients with reflux symptoms and more than 4 weeks in patients with dyspepsia or peptic ulcer. For research purposes, 6 months could be a possible definition in pharmacoepidemiological studies, whereas studies of adverse effects may require a tailored definition depending on the necessary exposure time. We recommend to always rationalise the choice of definition.

### Adverse outcomes of long-term use of proton pump inhibitors: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112wjtRF]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

The association between the long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and the risks of various diseases remains controversial. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to quantify the associations as presented in the literature and to also provide this information to healthcare professionals and patients about their potentially adverse effects. In July 2016, we searched through Medline (PubMed), Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception using common keywords. We included observational studies that provided risk estimates on the long-term use of PPIs and their adverse effects. Overall, 43 studies were included in the systematic review, of which 28 studies were also included in the random effect meta-analysis. Odds of community-acquired pneumonia, hip fracture, and colorectal cancer were 67% [odds ratio (OR) = 1.67; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04–2.67], 42% (OR = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.33–1.53), and 55% (OR = 1.55; 95% CI: 0.88–2.73) higher in patients with long-term PPIs use compared with patients who did not use PPIs. Although the use of PPIs provides short-term health benefits, their prolonged use is associated with minor and also potentially major adverse health outcomes. Hence, we strongly recommend that the prescription of PPIs should be done with caution to improve the medication's efficacy and patients' safety.

### The association of proton pump inhibitors and chronic kidney disease: cause or confounding? [^113w1PXe]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss whether the recently described relationship between proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use and the risk of adverse kidney outcomes represents a causal relationship or is merely the result of confounding.

Recent Findings

A wave of observational studies has described an association between PPI use and the risk of development of chronic kidney disease and its progression to end-stage renal disease. The results are generally robust and remarkably consistent across different studies. The application of modern pharmacoepidemiologic methods to estimate the effect of a putative unmeasured or unknown confounder or set of confounders on the relationship of PPI use and risk of adverse renal outcomes suggests that confounding is unlikely to explain away the reported association.

Summary

The constellation of evidence from all available studies suggests that PPI use is associated with increased risk of adverse kidney outcomes. Exercising vigilance in the use of PPI is warranted.

### AGA clinical practice update on De-prescribing of proton pump inhibitors: expert review [^115VgCy6]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Description

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most commonly used medications in the world. Developed for the treatment and prevention of acid-mediated upper gastrointestinal conditions, these agents are being used increasingly for indications where their benefits are less certain. PPI overprescription imposes an economic cost and contributes to polypharmacy. In addition, PPI use has been increasingly linked to a number of adverse events (PPI-associated adverse events [PAAEs]). Therefore, de-prescribing of PPIs is an important strategy to lower pill burden while reducing real costs and theoretical risks. The purpose of this clinical update was to provide Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements about how to approach PPI de-prescribing in ambulatory patients.

Methods

Our guiding principle was that, although PPIs are generally safe, patients should not use any medication when there is not a reasonable expectation of benefit based on scientific evidence or prior treatment response. Prescribers are responsible for determining whether PPI use is absolutely or conditionally indicated and, when uncertainty exists, to incorporate patient perspectives into PPI decision making. We collaboratively outlined a high-level "process map" of the conceptual approach to de-prescribing PPIs in a clinical setting. We identified the following 3 key domains that required BPA guidance: documentation of PPI indication; identifying suitable candidates for consideration of de-prescribing; and optimizing successful de-prescribing. Co-authors drafted 1 or more potential BPAs, supported by literature review, for each domain. All co-authors reviewed, edited, and selected or rejected draft BPAs for inclusion in the final list submitted to the American Gastroenterological Association Governing Board. Because this was not a systematic review, we did not carry out a formal rating of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: All patients taking a PPI should have a regular review of the ongoing indications for use and documentation of that indication. This review should be the responsibility of the patient's primary care provider. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: All patients without a definitive indication for chronic PPI should be considered for trial of de-prescribing. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Most patients with an indication for chronic PPI use who take twice-daily dosing should be considered for step down to once-daily PPI. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Patients with complicated gastroesophageal reflux disease, such as those with a history of severe erosive esophagitis, esophageal ulcer, or peptic stricture, should generally not be considered for PPI discontinuation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Patients with known Barrett's esophagus, eosinophilic esophagitis, or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis should generally not be considered for a trial of de-prescribing. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: PPI users should be assessed for upper gastrointestinal bleeding risk using an evidence-based strategy before de-prescribing. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Patients at high risk for upper gastrointestinal bleeding should not be considered for PPI de-prescribing. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Patients who discontinue long-term PPI therapy should be advised that they may develop transient upper gastrointestinal symptoms due to rebound acid hypersecretion. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: When de-prescribing PPIs, either dose tapering or abrupt discontinuation can be considered. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: The decision to discontinue PPIs should be based solely on the lack of an indication for PPI use, and not because of concern for PAAEs. The presence of a PAAE or a history of a PAAE in a current PPI user is not an independent indication for PPI withdrawal. Similarly, the presence of underlying risk factors for the development of an adverse event associated with PPI use should also not be an independent indication for PPI withdrawal.

### Proton pump inhibitors are associated with increased risk of development of chronic kidney disease [^112wE6Mm]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, we found that long-term use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with increased risk of development of CKD and death. Although cause and effect cannot be determined with an observational study, with the large number of patients being treated with proton pump inhibitors, healthcare providers need to be cautious in prescribing these drugs because of the potential side effects.

### Individualized prevention of proton pump inhibitor related adverse events by risk stratification [^111eALv7]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The identified associations may be partially or completely due to confounding effects. Potential confounders include indications for using PPIs, overall health status, comorbidity, and other medications. To minimize confounding effects, our study first comprehensively adjusted for potential confounders in statistical models, then included propensity score analysis, and finally, for the CDARS cohort, contributing to over 65% of the overall population, H2RAs were considered as active comparators. Some of the positive associations, such as osteoarthritis and esophageal cancer, may be due to reverse causation, whereby the subclinical symptoms may be related to PPI use. In the primary analysis, we lagged the exposure for a time window of 2 years (4 years in the sensitivity analysis) to minimize its influence. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and RCT-based meta-analyses would provide the best evidence on PPI safety, which is currently unavailable (except for enteric infectionand stroke) and may not be ethically or practically feasible in the foreseeable future.

Clinicians now face a dilemma: there is a lacking of high-quality evidence confirming the long-term safety of PPI use, and their potentially harmful effects cannot be ignored, since should these associations be causal, their impacts would be substantial. Our risk stratification approach provides a feasible practical solution. Risk stratification, in this context, facilitates identifying individuals at higher or lower baseline risk for PPI-associated adverse events. This involves a comprehensive assessment of individual characteristics and health status through a prediction model. The importance of risk stratification is not only to identify those who are at high risk and take preventive measures individually to minimize the additional harm caused by long-term PPI use, but also to screen patients who could safely use PPIs. This, in turn, reduces fears and increases treatment adherence among patients.

To the best of our knowledge, this is currently the most comprehensive assessment on the long-term safety of PPIs, encompassing the associations with 30 leading causes of global disease burden. The outcome-wide approach allowed us to compare the effects of multiple outcomes, which reduced selective reporting bias. In addition, disease incidence information was ascertained by national record linkage or biennially updated information, which might reduce misclassification, recall bias, and attrition bias. Finally, the dose–response associations, robust sensitivity analyses as well as the negative control outcome (road injuries), added additional strengths to our findings.

### Risk of bias in non-randomized observational studies assessing the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors and adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review [^11188Ffx]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Taking into consideration the sources of bias described above makes it challenging to establish causality and may clarify many of the observed potential associations. A review published in 2018 considered the available evidence from non-randomized observational studies and potential underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for the development of AKI and CKD with PPI use. The authors observed that the association between CKD and PPI use, although consistent for the studies reviewed, did not meet the Hill criteria for causationand may have been confounded by NSAID use and underlying comorbidities (i.e. hypertension, diabetes). In contrast, the association between AKI and PPI was described as inconsistent based on the studies reviewed, but also potentially confounded by NSAID use and failing to meet the Hill criteria. Overall, these findings suggest that it is important to distinguish associations from causality in the interpretation of results from non-randomized observational studies.

We also found that effect estimates for the evaluation of reported associations were largely of small magnitude and uncertain clinical relevance; thus, these results should not prevent prescribers from using appropriate doses of PPIs for proper indications. Results from our study, combined with other literature reviews, should support recommendations for clinical prudence. For instance, health care professionals should avoid unnecessary long-term PPI use by being cautious in their initial decision-making for prescribing PPI, and by periodically revisiting the need for continued PPI therapy to ensure medical indication. There is considerable variation in defining long-term PPI use in prior studies, ranging from more than 8 weeks of regular daily use to greater than 1 year. Few studies selected for this review defined long-term PPI use. Among the eight studies that reported on the association between long-term PPI use or duration of PPI use, respectively, and associated kidney effects, long-term PPI use was described as ranging from as low as 3 monthsto over 3 years. Using recommendations outlined in guidelines on prescribing PPIs and how to mitigate the potential harms of long-term PPI therapy for three common indications (GERD, BE, and NSAID bleeding prophylaxis), physicians can safely and appropriately balance the evidence on the benefits and harms of PPI use in managing their patients.

### Reducing adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors [^116ssB1K]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors effectively treat gastroesophageal reflux disease, erosive esophagitis, duodenal ulcers, and pathologic hypersecretory conditions. Proton pump inhibitors cause few adverse effects with short-term use; however, long-term use has been scrutinized for appropriateness, drug-drug interactions, and the potential for adverse effects (e.g., hip fractures, cardiac events, iron deficiency, Clostridium difficile infection, pneumonia). Adults 65 years and older are more vulnerable to these adverse effects because of the higher prevalence of chronic diseases in this population. Proton pump inhibitors administered for stress ulcer prophylaxis should be discontinued after the patient is discharged from the intensive care unit unless other indications exist.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^117WyKZZ]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Dyspeptic symptoms are common in GERD patients, especially those with frequent reflux related symptoms. In these patients, epigastric pain, belching, bloating, and early satiety were found to improve on PPI therapy, conversely from nausea and vomiting, which did not benefit from acid suppression.

In addition to suppressing acid secretion, PPIs can also inhibit gastric motility and delay emptying rate and, as a consequence, dyspeptic symptoms may actually be worsened by PPI therapy or, alternatively, new symptoms (especially postprandial fullness) may arise during treatment. If this is the case, patients could be switched to the H 2 RAs, ranitidine or nizatidine, which, in addition to their antisecretory activity, display a cholinergic-like activity and have been shown to accelerate gastric emptying. On the other hand, a Cochrane meta-analysis showed that H 2 RAs are better than placebo in achieving symptom relief in patients with FD.

PPIs for NSAID-associated symptoms and lesions

Summary of the current evidence

Standard dose PPIs are indicated for patients taking non-selective NSAIDs at risk for upper GI complications (bleeding and perforation) and for those given selective cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitors having had an episode of previous GI bleeding. In both non-selective and COX-2 selective NSAID users, PPI therapy reduces upper GI symptoms, in particular dyspepsia. However, NSAID-induced adverse events in the lower GI tract are not prevented by PPIs.

NSAIDs are amongst the most widely used classes of drugs. Although they are very effective medications, their use is associated with a broad spectrum of adverse effects in the liver, kidney, cardiovascular (CV) system, skin, and gut. GI adverse effects are the most common and include a wide clinical spectrum ranging from dyspepsia, heartburn, and abdominal discomfort to more serious events such as PU with life-threatening complications, including bleeding and perforation.

### Proton pump inhibitors: misconceptions and proper prescribing practice [^116itPru]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The current review summarizes and attempts to place in proper perspective the past year's literature regarding purported adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

Recent Findings

Although generally considered safe, physicians are inundated with retrospective database-driven epidemiologic studies, and meta-analyses on the same studies, claiming a panoply of serious adverse effects associated with long-term use of PPIs. The quality of the evidence underlying most of these associations is very low and cannot ascribe cause and effect. Nonetheless, these reports have stoked fears, in both prescribers and patients. As a result, patients are being harmed. Physicians are not prescribing PPIs when medically indicated and patients are stopping PPIs without consulting their caregivers. It is reassuring that a cross-sectional analysis of data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey as well as a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial report no safety concerns with PPIs, other than a possible small association with enteric infection.

Summary

Most of the publicized serious putative adverse effects attributed to PPIs have been debunked in more recent and properly designed studies. Nevertheless, PPIs should be prescribed for valid indications and, when prescribed long-term, they should be used at the lowest effective dose and their ongoing need periodically assessed.

### Drug-drug interaction between clopidogrel and the proton pump inhibitors [^114h6WK8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

Data Sources

Literature retrieval was accessed through PubMed (1980-January 2009), abstracts from 2008 American Heart Association and 2009 Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions Scientific Sessions, and media press releases using the terms clopidogrel, proton pump inhibitors, cytochrome 2C19, genetic cytochrome P450 polymorphisms, and drug interaction. In addition, reference citations from publications identified in the search were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Relevant original research articles and review articles were evaluated. Articles were selected if they were published in English and focused on any of the key words or appeared to have substantial content addressing the drug interaction.

Data Synthesis

Recent attention has been placed on a potential interaction observed between clopidogrel and the widely used PPIs. Preliminary evidence suggests that omeprazole interacts with clopidogrel, reducing clopidogrel's antiplatelet effects as measured by various laboratory tests. Most data indicate that the interaction involves the competitive inhibition of the CYP2C19 isoenzyme. The interaction appears to be clinically significant, as several retrospective analyses have shown an increase in adverse cardiovascular outcomes when PPIs and clopidogrel are used concomitantly. However, this may not be a class effect.

Conclusions

Available data suggest that omeprazole is the PPI most likely to have a significant interaction with clopidogrel. Further studies are needed to determine that an interaction between the other PPIs and clopidogrel does not exist. In situations in which both clopidogrel and a PPI are indicated, pantoprazole should be used since it is the PPI least likely to interact with clopidogrel.

### Toxicity of long-term use of proton pump inhibitors in children [^111Zh9Z9]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2018). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use is becoming increasingly common. Although the toxicity profiles of PPIs are not well understood particularly in children, PPIs have been associated with increased risks of gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infection, vitamin B 12 deficiency, hypomagnesaemia, bone fractures, and rebound hyperacidity after discontinuation. Prescribers should take into account that PPI uses pose toxicity risks, which remain to be fully characterised in infants and children.

### When does proton pump inhibitor treatment become long term? A scoping review [^113rRwk4]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used drugs worldwide. In Denmark, PPI prescriptions are redeemed by more than 10% of the population each year. Incident and prevalent PPI use are rising, the latter driven primarily by ongoing use over months to years. This has raised questions about whether continuous PPI therapy is actually needed in many patients. Around 40% of PPI users may be treated without an ongoing registered indicationand concerns have been raised about possible adverse effects, specifically related to use of PPIs over months to years. Only 4–8 weeks of treatment with PPIs can cause rebound acid hypersecretion and acid-related symptoms in previously asymptomatic individuals, potentially contributing to continued use of PPIs.

Trends in PPI use have been intensely investigated in recent years, with studies consistently referring to long-term PPI use. However, there is no consensus on how to define long-term PPI useand the definitions of long-term use vary between studies. Substantial discrepancies in definitions of long-term use make it difficult to draw firm overall conclusions about the prevalence and impact of extended continuous PPI therapy and about discontinuation of long-term PPI therapy.

An appropriate uniform definition of long-term use of PPIs is relevant in a clinical context. Position statements or guidelines have provided comprehensive and rational clinical advice concerning long-term use but have not provided a clear definition of what long-term use is. This makes it challenging in clinical practice to determine whether and when a patient is considered a long-term user and to decide when deprescribing can be discussed.

Therefore, the objectives of this study are to review and compare definitions of long-term PPI use which have been used in the literature and explore the rationale for each definition. Furthermore, we aim to suggest a generally applicable definition of long-term use of PPIs for research and clinical use.

### The risks of PPI therapy [^112SRJGs]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Medium credibility.

PPIs have become one of the most commonly used medications worldwide, as they are the treatment of choice for several acid-related gastrointestinal disorders. However, concerns have been raised about PPI therapy, including the risk of pneumonia, bone fractures and enteric infections, and a possible interaction with clopidogrel that could increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Observational studies have shown very modest associations between PPI therapy and these risks, although the association between PPI treatment and the risk of enteric infections seems to be stronger than the association with other risk factors. However, given the inherent limitations of observational studies, these associations could be attributable to bias and/or confounding factors. In addition, evidence from randomized, controlled trials does not support a clinically significant effect of PPI therapy on the risk of cardiovascular events in patients taking clopidogrel or the risk of pneumonia. Nevertheless, it is impossible to exclude the possibility that some of these associations might be causal or indeed that PPI therapy has an as yet unknown long-term adverse effect. As with any therapy, therefore, it is advisable to prescribe PPIs only to patients for whom these drugs have been proven beneficial.

### What you need to know when you prescribe a proton pump inhibitor [^112ryaGH]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Ever since they were launched, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been regarded as profligate prescription interventions and have become a favourite target for pharmacy advisers. Now that they are cheap, with generic omeprazole 20 mg daily costing £1.88 per month (£24.51 per annum) in the UK, it is time to ask whether this status should be reviewed, whether there are areas where the message should be reversed and whether there are any circumstances in which the extra cost of branded PPIs or combined preparations is justified. Equally, with the recognition of an extended toxicity profile, is prescribing profligacy not an economic but a safety issue?

### Coprescribing proton-pump inhibitors with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: risks versus benefits [^116qwspC]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often coadministered with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) to reduce NSAID-induced gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events. This coadministration is generally regarded as safe, and is included in many of the guidelines on NSAID prescription. However, recent evidence indicates that the GI risks associated with NSAIDs can be potentiated when they are combined with PPIs. This review discusses the GI effects and complications of NSAIDs and how PPIs may potentiate these effects, options for prevention of GI side effects, and appropriate use of PPIs in combination with NSAIDs.

### Latest insights into the hot question of proton pump inhibitor safety-a narrative review [^114BmRsW]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most widely prescribed medications worldwide and their use is continuously increasing. Although they have been shown to combine high therapeutic efficacy and good safety profile in many studies, in last years we have witnessed the publication of many articles reporting the possible association of long-term PPI therapy with important unexpected adverse events and these observations have created alarmism in both patients and physicians. However, the majority of these studies are observational, retrospective and prone to residual confounding. Also, the odds ratio values are generally comprised between 1 and 2 and therefore devoid of strong clinical relevance. As it is unlikely that prospective randomized trials will be ever done to reinforce these associations, we can only attempt to distinguish clear- from unclear-defined adverse events from the available literature. Nowadays we can reasonably exclude cardiovascular diseases, community-acquired pneumonia, all-cause mortality, dementia and bone fractures from PPI-related adverse events. However, physicians should be aware of the existence of possible risks when treating their patients, especially the elderly and frail ones, with long-term PPIs, which should be prescribed only to persons with defined indications and at lowest dose and duration.

### Are there risks associated with empiric acid suppression treatment of infants and children suspected of having gastroesophageal reflux disease? [^11137koq]. Hospital Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

It has become common practice to empirically treat infants and children who have suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease by using acid-suppressive medications. However, evidence to support the effectiveness of these medications in the pediatric population is limited. With multiple studies in adult patients indicating increased risk of infection, we reviewed the literature to determine the association between acid-suppressive medications and serious adverse effects in infants and children.

Methods

We conducted a PubMed search on the adverse effects of H2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors in pediatric patients. The studies selected were original research and systematic reviews with control groups and study objectives evaluating the relationship between acid-suppressive medications and serious adverse effects (namely, infections).

Results

Fourteen studies met our inclusion criteria. The majority of studies found a significant association between acid-suppressive medications and the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis/bacteremia, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal infections in infants and children.

Conclusions

Given the questionable efficacy of H2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors and the growing evidence of increased risk of serious infections, acid-suppressive medications should be used cautiously in infants and children suspected of having gastroesophageal reflux disease.

### Proton pump inhibitors: placing putative adverse effects in proper perspective [^113FTRdk]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes the past year's literature, both clinical and basic science, regarding potential adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

Recent Findings

PPIs are amongst the most widely prescribed and over-prescribed medications worldwide. Although generally considered well tolerated, epidemiologic studies that mine large databases have reported a panoply of putative adverse effects associated with PPIs. It should be emphasized that the quality of the evidence underlying most of these associations is very low and the studies, by design, cannot ascribe cause and effect. These associations continue to be sensationalized in the media and misinterpreted by providers and patients. The unintended consequences are that patients who require PPIs, such as those taking dual antiplatelet agents, are not being prescribed or taking these necessary medications. In addition, physicians are spending an inordinate amount of additional time placing these findings into proper perspective for their patients and reassuring them upon initiating PPI treatment as well as at every follow-up visit.

Summary

Most of the recent publicized putative serious adverse effects attributed to PPIs rely on observational data and have not been confirmed in prospective randomized trials. Nevertheless, PPIs should be prescribed for valid indications and when prescribed long-term, they should be used at the lowest effective dose and the need for their use periodically reassessed.

### Nutritional consequences of long-term acid suppression; are they clinically important? [^112kiSgM]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

As acid suppression therapies with proton pump inhibitors are an extremely common practice for common acid-related diseases, there has been increased scrutiny on the safety of this class of therapy.

Recent Findings

There have been increasing reports of allegation of harm with the sustained use of proton pump inhibitors, in particular with potential adverse effects on vitamin and mineral absorption. This has prompted a number of product label changes directed by the US Food and Drug Administration, raising concerns for ongoing continued use among clinicians and patients.

Summary

This review highlights the most recent information around these controversies and provides evidence summaries to help guide care providers in their care plans as well as discussions with patients.

### AGA clinical practice update on De-prescribing of proton pump inhibitors: expert review [^1173mGcG]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — best practice advice on discontinuing proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) states that the decision to discontinue PPIs should be based solely on the lack of an indication for PPI use, and not because of concern for PPI-associated adverse events (PAAEs). It further specifies that the presence of a PAAE or a history of a PAAE in a current PPI user is not an independent indication for PPI withdrawal, and that the presence of underlying risk factors for the development of an adverse event associated with PPI use should also not be an independent indication for PPI withdrawal. Supporting context notes that reported associations between PPIs and PAAEs are not necessarily causal and that no RCT has yet demonstrated that PPI users have an increased incidence of any of the PAAEs.

### Proton pump inhibitors and risk of Clostridium difficile infection: association or causation? [^1174zLH7]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The rising burden of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) requires urgent identification of preventable risk factors. Observational studies suggest an association between proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) use and CDI risk.

Recent Findings

Key historical literature on PPI and CDI associations is reviewed as a prelude to evaluating the plausibility of a causative association. Impactful literature from the past 18 months is examined in detail and critically appraised through the lens of the Bradford Hill Criteria for determination of causality. The PPI and CDI association has been studied extensively and is valid. Nonetheless, causality is not proven due to extensive and difficult to control confounding in observational studies of CDI patient populations with complex comorbidities.

Summary

In the authors' opinion, systematic discontinuation of PPIs in patients at risk for CDI is not warranted based on current evidence. Well controlled prospective human studies are needed. Careful and repeated consideration should be given to all PPI prescriptions to avoid potential adverse effects.

### Risk of bias in non-randomized observational studies assessing the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors and adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review [^116pjru4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed as acid-suppression therapy. Some observational studies suggest that long-term use of PPIs is potentially associated with certain adverse kidney outcomes. We conducted a systematic literature review to assess potential bias in non-randomized studies reporting on putative associations between PPIs and adverse kidney outcomes (acute kidney injury, acute interstitial nephritis, chronic interstitial nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease).

Methods

We searched the medical literature within 10 years of 17 December 2020. Pre-specified criteria guided identification of relevant English language articles for assessment. Risk of bias on an outcome-specific basis was evaluated using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool by two independent reviewers.

Results

Of 620 initially identified records, 26 studies met a priori eligibility criteria and underwent risk of bias assessment. Nineteen studies were judged as having a moderate risk of bias for reported adverse kidney outcomes, while six studies were judged as having a serious risk of bias (mainly due to inadequate control of confounders and selection bias). We were unable to determine the overall risk of bias in two studies (one of which was assessed as having a moderate risk of bias for a different adverse kidney outcome) due to insufficient information presented. Effect estimates for PPIs in relation to adverse kidney outcomes varied widely (0.24–7.34) but associations mostly showed increased risk.

Conclusion

Using ROBINS-I, we found that non-randomized observational studies suggesting kidney harm by PPIs have moderate to serious risk of bias, making it challenging to establish causality. Additional high-quality, real-world evidence among generalizable populations are needed to better understand the relation between PPI treatment and acute and chronic kidney outcomes, accounting for the effects of varying durations of PPI treatment, self-treatment with over-the-counter PPIs, and potential critical confounders.

### Long-term use of proton-pump inhibitors: whole-of-population patterns in Australia 2013–2016 [^1117ZpRA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study shows that the proportion of people continuing PPIs beyond the guideline-recommended maximum of 12 weeks is greater than that which might be expected to have conditions indicated for longer-term PPI treatment. Around one third of people continuing on longer-term treatment step-down treatment to a lower strength PPI, however, most individuals do not deviate from their initiation strength. In light of this, prescribers may wish to consider the strength prescribed at initiation, as well as routine medicine reviews to ensure long-term treatment is indeed indicated. Given the many adverse events potentially associated with long-term PPI treatment, increased regulation of these medicines, such as the restrictions recently implemented in Australia, are warranted.

### Proton-pump inhibitors and cardiovascular adverse events: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113cFxa3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Some observational studies suggest a cardiovascular risk from proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment, but observational data may be subject to bias. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial data on cardiovascular events during PPI treatment.

Methods

Manufacturers of PPIs provided data from their PPI clinical trial programs. We included randomized trials with at least 100 subjects, treatment duration > 30 days, and a non-PPI comparator (active or placebo). We obtained person-time of exposure per trial, to calculate summary incidence rate ratios (primary analysis) and incident rate differences (secondary analysis). Our primary composite outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events-plus (MACE+), which included nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, fatal cardiovascular adverse events, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization; events were adjudicated blindly.

Results

Cardiovascular outcomes were infrequent in randomized trials of PPIs, and our primary analysis found no overall association (summary incident rate ratio, MACE+ events, PPI:placebo, 0.72) (95% confidence interval 0.42–1.26). There was some heterogeneity by indication category, and by the incidence rate difference metric, gastroesophageal reflux disorder trials had 1.04 (95% confidence interval 0.58–1.50) excess MACE+ events per 100 person-years of treatment vs placebo. Comparisons with active controls generally showed positive incidence rate differences with PPI treatment.

Discussion

Overall, we found no association of cardiovascular events with PPI treatment. Cardiovascular events appeared more frequent with PPI treatment in gastroesophageal reflux disorder trials, but results from this subgroup should be interpreted with the limitations of the analysis in mind, including sparse outcome counts and lack of individual patient data.

### Individualized prevention of proton pump inhibitor related adverse events by risk stratification [^112RYrcB]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are currently the first-line treatment for acid-related disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux disease. PPIs are one of the top ten most prescribed drugs worldwide. The global PPI market was evaluated at $2.9 billion in 2020 and is anticipated to grow by 6.9% annually from 2023 to 2030.

Although the pharmaceutical industry has made remarkable progress in novel drug discovery for safer and better PPIs, there has been a growing concern over the potential adverse effects of long-term PPI usage. In 2021, an umbrella review of 42 meta-analyses showed that long-term use of PPIs was associated with a variety of diseases, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and enteric infection. Moreover, the reporting of new PPI-associated adverse effects continues. In the past 2 years alone, epidemiological studies, for the first time, linked PPI use to increased risk of biliary tract cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, type-2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and cholelithiasis. The evidence for these associations was generally observational. Reporting of these adverse events attracted increasing attention to the appropriate use of PPIs, while it also resulted in fears and reduced adherence to PPI treatment in patients. The need for personalized strategies for reducing unnecessary PPI use has become an urgent subject to be addressed.

There are several weaknesses in existing studies. First, most of the previous studies only evaluated single outcomes within one population. Some studies might be limited by selective reporting or lack of validation in different populations. Second, a comprehensive evaluation of the overall safety profile and dose–response effects, particularly for major diseases with top global disease burden remains lacking. Finally, and more importantly, there exists a major knowledge gap on which group of people are more vulnerable to PPI-related adverse events. Thus, individualized treatment based on patients' underlying risk may confer benefits and reduce harms. Such a risk stratification approach, successfully implemented in selecting patients for antihypertensive and statin therapy, has also been applied to individuate avoidance of additional risks related to PPI use, such as type-2 diabetes, stroke, and cholelithiasis. However, its application for other PPI-associated adverse events remains unclear. To address these concerns and improve decision-making for the appropriate use of PPIs in the public, patients, clinicians, and industry, we comprehensively evaluated the overall safety profile, dose–response relationships, and individual risk stratification for PPI use and the top 30 causes of global disease burden based on five large cohorts from the US, the UK, and China.

### Proton pump inhibitors and the risk of gastric cancer: a systematic review, evidence synthesis and life course epidemiology perspective [^1173r7Ce]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

PPIs were associated with a 1.3 to 2.9 times increased RR of gastric cancer with all but one out of 22 meta-analyses providing statistically significant evidence. Considering the established role of H. pylori in gastric cancer development, it seems unlikely that PPIs are an independent, single-cause, carcinogen, but enhance the H. pylori carcinogenic pathway. Even if the overall balance between short and long-term harms and benefits pleads in favour of PPI for the individual regarding gastric cancer, many other adverse consequences have been associated with PPI use. It is important to evaluate how we use PPIs and to avoid long-term use if possible. Although PPIs are mostly used in older individuals representing the largest absolute risk, the relative risk for gastric cancer (and other potential adverse health effects) might be higher among younger individuals (children and young adults). Especially early life seems an important phase, with potential health consequences lasting over decades, and even potential intergenerational effects in case of antenatal exposure during pregnancy.
