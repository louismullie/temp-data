## Question

Cervical herniated disc

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about cervical herniated disc management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical presentation and differential diagnosis. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup and imaging strategy. Next, I will review the natural history to anchor conservative care. After that, I need to outline a stepwise treatment algorithm, including when to escalate to injections and surgery. Finally, I should consider special populations, prognostic modifiers, and synthesize a practical decision framework with outcome measures and follow-up intervals [^112NsLfB] [^112GyuyJ].

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and its mimics. Cervical radiculopathy typically presents with neck pain radiating in a dermatomal pattern to the arm or hand, often with paresthesias, sensory loss, weakness, and diminished reflexes in the involved root distribution; the most commonly affected levels are C6 and C7, reflecting foraminal encroachment or soft disc herniation, and the diagnosis remains primarily clinical with imaging used to confirm and localize pathology rather than to make the diagnosis itself [^111pEere] [^112GyuyJ] [^112JjCVH]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — cervical angina (pseudoangina), brachial plexopathies, entrapment neuropathies, and shoulder pathology can mimic radicular pain, so I need to ensure the history and exam map to a single nerve root and that red flags such as malignancy, infection, or inflammatory arthropathy are screened out before attributing symptoms to a herniated disc [^113rXQdj] [^112GyuyJ].

> I will now examine the diagnostic workup. MRI is the first-line imaging modality to confirm disc herniation or spondylotic foraminal stenosis and to exclude cord compression; accuracy for identifying the surgical lesion is high, and MRI correlates well with surgical findings in most series, though CT myelography may be reserved for patients with MRI contraindications or equivocal studies when clinical suspicion remains high [^111FvsKX] [^113XfXXA] [^112zDJ3q]. Wait, let me verify the role of adjunct tests — Spurling's maneuver has high sensitivity and specificity for soft disc herniation and can raise pretest probability before imaging, while electrodiagnostics are mainly useful to exclude peripheral neuropathies or polyneuropathy when the clinical picture is atypical or mixed [^112UBNZ4] [^114vxtmt].

> Next, I should review the natural history to calibrate expectations. Most patients with cervical radiculopathy improve spontaneously over weeks to months; long-term data suggest that roughly 43% become asymptomatic, 29% have only mild or intermittent symptoms, and about 27% have persistent disabling pain, with approximately 26% ultimately undergoing surgery over five years, underscoring the rationale for an initial conservative approach in the absence of progressive deficits [^116zvudM] [^112xvf5j]. Hmm, wait a minute — does this hold for myelopathy as well? No, I should correct that assumption; degenerative cervical myelopathy behaves differently, often progressing insidiously and rarely resolving spontaneously, so the threshold for surgical consultation is lower when cord signs are present [^1165Qbni].

> Let me consider first-line conservative management. A multimodal program including NSAIDs, short-course oral steroids for acute flares, neuropathic agents such as gabapentin or pregabalin, physical therapy emphasizing posture, scapular mechanics, and neural mobilization, and brief immobilization with a soft collar for comfort can be reasonable, recognizing that high-quality RCT evidence for individual modalities is limited but the overall conservative approach yields favorable outcomes in most patients [^112GyuyJ] [^117JhSZf]. I should double-check activity guidance — initially I thought strict bed rest might help, but that risks deconditioning; instead, activity modification with avoidance of heavy lifting and prolonged neck flexion plus graded activation is preferred, and traction may offer short-term relief in select cases while we monitor for neurologic change [^112GyuyJ].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of cervical epidural steroid injections. For persistent radicular pain beyond about 6–12 weeks despite conservative therapy, fluoroscopically guided cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injections have good evidence for disc herniation with radiculitis and can provide meaningful pain reduction and functional gains; transforaminal injections carry higher risk and should generally be avoided outside of specialized hands due to rare but catastrophic complications [^113gFtTN] [^115RPb2V]. I need to ensure patient selection is tight — contained soft herniations and moderate foraminal stenosis respond better, whereas severe foraminal stenosis or high cervical levels may predict poorer response and should temper expectations or redirect toward surgical options sooner [^116UkQKG].

> Now, I should review surgical indications and timing. Surgery is indicated for progressive motor weakness, intractable radicular pain despite appropriate conservative care (often after 6–12 weeks), or any evolving myelopathy; when radiculopathy is the target, anterior cervical discectomy with or without fusion and posterior foraminotomy yield comparable long-term outcomes, and emerging randomized data suggest that simple discectomy without fusion may suffice in select single-level soft disc cases, though patient selection and alignment goals matter [^116aK5jp] [^116CcqRS]. Wait, let me verify the comparative effectiveness signal — recent randomized trials show a modest but clinically meaningful advantage of surgery over structured nonsurgical care for disc herniation-induced radiculopathy at 12 months, whereas spondylotic radiculopathy shows no such advantage, reinforcing the need to match the pathology to the intervention [^113zVZz3].

> I will now examine minimally invasive and percutaneous options. Coblation nucleoplasty can reduce pain in contained cervical herniations and may delay or obviate open surgery in carefully selected patients, with observational series suggesting durable benefit, but I should confirm that evidence remains limited by the absence of high-quality RCTs comparing nucleoplasty to surgery or to injections, so it should be positioned as a bridge or alternative for contained soft discs after failed conservative therapy and before open surgery in shared decision-making discussions [^116G5kLh] [^115UTABN]. But wait, what if the herniation is sequestered or there is instability? Those are contraindications to percutaneous decompression, so I need to ensure MRI morphology is compatible before proceeding [^115SZmbf].

> Let me think about special populations and prognostic modifiers. Younger patients with acute soft disc herniations have high rates of spontaneous regression and excellent responses to conservative care, whereas older patients with chronic spondylotic foraminal stenosis may have a more indolent course and may benefit from earlier surgical decompression if symptoms persist; patients with high occupational physical demands or high psychological distress may accrue greater benefit from definitive decompression when conservative measures fail [^115hdpkj]. I should confirm that focal or median soft disc herniations are more likely to regress on MRI, which can support a longer conservative trial in mild myelopathy, while diffuse or lateral disease may be less likely to improve without surgery [^notfound].

> Next, I should review outcome measurement and follow-up cadence. Validated instruments such as the Neck Disability Index, VAS for neck and arm pain, and the SF-12 or SF-36 for general health should be captured at baseline and at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months to track trajectory and guide escalation decisions; a change of about 15 points on NDI represents a minimal clinically important difference and can help frame shared decision-making about surgery [^11427TJT] [^113zVZz3]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines endorse structured follow-up intervals — NASS emphasizes individualized reassessment at these timepoints to align treatment intensity with response and functional goals [^notfound].

> I need to ensure the decision algorithm is explicit. Start with clinical diagnosis and MRI confirmation; institute multimodal conservative care for 6–12 weeks; if pain persists or motor deficits evolve, offer cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injection as a therapeutic trial; if there is no meaningful improvement by about 12 weeks or if there is progressive weakness or myelopathy, proceed to surgical consultation with consideration of ACDF, ACD, posterior foraminotomy, or arthroplasty based on anatomy, alignment, and patient preference; reserve nucleoplasty for select contained soft discs as a bridge or alternative in shared decision-making, and avoid transforaminal cervical injections due to risk [^113gFtTN] [^115RPb2V]. Let me reconsider one nuance — early surgery may yield faster relief but long-term outcomes often converge with well-executed conservative care in radiculopathy without progressive deficits, so timing should be individualized to severity, occupational impact, and patient values [^113zVZz3] [^116zvudM].

> Finally, I should synthesize key principles. Accurate clinical diagnosis with judicious imaging correlation, respect for the favorable natural history of radiculopathy, and a stepwise escalation from conservative therapy to injections to surgery based on persistent disability or neurologic progression optimize outcomes; shared decision-making that incorporates patient goals, work demands, and risk tolerance is essential, and outcome tracking with validated measures ensures that we are truly improving function rather than merely treating images [^112GyuyJ] [^112NsLfB] [^113zVZz3].

Cervical herniated discs most often affect C5–C6 and C6–C7 [^111pEere] and typically present with neck pain, radicular arm pain, sensory changes, and weakness in a dermatomal pattern [^112GyuyJ]. MRI is the **preferred imaging modality** [^115AuZn7] to confirm the diagnosis and guide management [^111FvsKX]. Most patients improve with **conservative care** (NSAIDs, physical therapy, and selective nerve root blocks) [^112GyuyJ] [^116zvudM]; surgery is reserved for persistent radiculopathy, progressive neurologic deficits, or myelopathy [^117MRDea] [^1144zgVv]. ACDF is the standard surgical approach [^112zjz9U], with posterior foraminotomy or artificial disc replacement as alternatives; outcomes are generally favorable, though complications such as dysphagia, adjacent segment disease, and rare neurologic injury can occur [^113EfBaj] [^112zjz9U]. Prognosis is **favorable** with conservative care, and many patients recover fully; persistent symptoms may require intervention [^112GyuyJ] [^116zvudM].

## Epidemiology and risk factors

- **Prevalence**: Cervical disc herniation is common, with an annual incidence of 107.3 per 100,000 in men and 63.5 per 100,000 in women [^114rta1S].
- **Age**: Peak incidence occurs in the 50–54 age group [^notfound].
- **Risk factors**: Age, occupational strain, repetitive neck movements, smoking, and genetic predisposition [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical symptoms include **neck pain** — often the initial symptom and frequently accompanied by stiffness — and **radicular pain** that follows a dermatomal pattern (commonly C5–C6 or C6–C7) [^111pEere]. Sensory changes such as paresthesia or numbness in the affected dermatome are common, and motor weakness may present in muscles innervated by the compressed nerve root [^112GyuyJ]. The **Spurling test** has high sensitivity (92%) and specificity (95%) for detecting cervical radiculopathy [^112UBNZ4].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **MRI**: Preferred imaging modality; accurately identifies herniation and nerve root compression [^115AuZn7] [^111FvsKX].
- **CT myelography**: Useful when MRI is contraindicated or inconclusive [^113XfXXA] [^112g9vs2].
- **Electrophysiological studies**: Help differentiate radiculopathy from peripheral neuropathies [^114vxtmt].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative treatment is effective for many patients, with **NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and neuropathic agents** providing pain relief [^117JhSZf] [^112GyuyJ]. Physical therapy emphasizes neck strengthening, flexibility, and posture correction, while selective nerve root blocks offer temporary relief and aid diagnostic localization [^1123zsPB] [^1156UTFL] [^112GyuyJ]. Most patients improve with conservative care, though some require surgical intervention [^112GyuyJ] [^116zvudM].

---

## Surgical management

- **Indications**: Persistent radiculopathy despite conservative care, progressive neurologic deficits, or myelopathy [^117MRDea] [^1144zgVv].
- **ACDF**: Standard surgical approach with favorable outcomes [^112zjz9U].
- **Alternatives**: Posterior foraminotomy or artificial disc replacement [^116CcqRS] [^112zjz9U].
- **Complications**: Dysphagia, adjacent segment disease, infection, and rare neurologic injury [^113EfBaj] [^112zjz9U].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **generally favorable**; many patients recover fully with conservative care, though some have persistent symptoms requiring surgery [^112GyuyJ] [^116zvudM].

### Percutaneous treatment of cervical and lumbar herniated disc [^115SZmbf]. European Journal of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Therapeutic armamentarium for symptomatic intervertebral disc herniation includes conservative therapy, epidural infiltrations (interlaminar or trans-foraminal), percutaneous therapeutic techniques and surgical options. Percutaneous, therapeutic techniques are imaging-guided, minimally invasive treatments for intervertebral disc herniation which can be performed as outpatient procedures. They can be classified in 4 main categories: mechanical, thermal, chemical decompression and biomaterials implantation. Strict sterility measures are a prerequisite and should include extensive local sterility and antibiotic prophylaxis. Indications include the presence of a symptomatic, small to medium sized contained intervertebral disc herniation non-responding to a 4–6 weeks course of conservative therapy. Contraindications include sequestration, infection, segmental instability (spondylolisthesis), uncorrected coagulopathy or a patient unwilling to provide informed consent. Decompression techniques are feasible and reproducible, efficient (75–94% success rate) and safe (> 0.5% mean complications rate) therapies for the treatment of symptomatic intervertebral disc herniation. Percutaneous, imaging guided, intervertebral disc therapeutic techniques can be proposed either as an initial treatment or as an attractive alternative prior to surgery for the therapy of symptomatic herniation in both cervical and lumbar spine. This article will describe the mechanism of action for different therapeutic techniques applied to intervertebral discs of cervical and lumbar spine, summarize the data concerning safety and effectiveness of these treatments, and provide a rational approach for the therapy of symptomatic intervertebral disc herniation in cervical and lumbar spine.

### Surgical management of cervical and lumbosacral radiculopathies: indications and outcomes [^117MRDea]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The most common indication for the surgical management of compressive cervical and lumbar radiculopathies is a herniated disc in a patient who has not improved with conservative management. Even though a herniated disk is a common condition, it is paramount that the examining physician considers an extensive differential diagnosis when evaluating radiculopathies, especially in patients with a history of cancer, multiple medical illnesses, secondary gain, or advanced age. This consideration has become even more important as imaging studies have improved, because previously undetected degenerative changes are now clearly visualized on MRI and CT scans. These improved studies, however, do not replace a thorough history and physical examination, because a patient's signs and symptoms may not correlate with the radiographic findings. The authors have presented a series of surgical techniques used to manage cervical and lumbar discectomies to the most recent "minimally invasive" percutaneous techniques. Much debate and controversy surround these more recent techniques. There is no controversy, however, in stating that achieving good outcomes, regardless of technique, is predicated on proper patient selection. Because patient selection is the most important predictor of outcome and because serious complications have been reported with "minimally invasive" percutaneous procedures, the authors continue to advocate the proven traditional surgical approaches until prospective, randomized studies demonstrate a clear benefit to using alternative techniques.

### Cervical disc degeneration and neck pain [^113vpWcP]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Discogenic neck pain alone without cervical disc herniation or cervical spondylosis accounts for a large proportion of chronic neck pain, and the reported prevalence is between 16% and 41%. Although this pain is resolved in most patients through conservative therapy, there are patients who continue to have refractory neck pain. Some people are even told that they have nothing to do, and they must learn to live with it. For these patients, it is necessary to actively seek for more effective treatment. In this case, anterior cervical fusion or artificial cervical disc replacement may become the last option for surgeons. However, preoperative cervical discography can guarantee a better surgical outcome.

### Lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for cervical radiculopathy in conservative intervention studies: a systematic review [^112JjCVH]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cervical radiculopathy (CR) is a widespread diagnosis. Typically, CR is associated with symptoms of neck, shoulder, and upper limb pain as well as upper limb paraesthesia and weakness, which are attributed to cervical nerve root irritation. The clinical diagnosis of CR relies mainly on the outcome of history taking and a physical examination in which diminished muscle tendon reflexes, sensory disturbances, or motor weakness with dermatomal/myotomal distribution can be found.

Epidemiological data on CR are sparse. A population-based study indicated that CR had an annual incidence rate of 107.3 per 100,000 for men and 63.5 per 100,000 for women, while the age-specific annual incidence rate reached a peak of 202.9 for the age group 50–54 years. Another study reported a prevalence of 3.5 per 1,000 people and a peak annual incidence of 2.1 case per 1,000 people, which increased to a peak at age 50–59 years.

The aetiology in 70–75% of cases is a foraminal compression of the spinal nerve. This can be due to several factors, including reduction in disc height and anterior and posterior degenerative changes of the uncovertebral and zygapophyseal joints. The most common level of nerve root compression is C7, followed by C6; compression of roots C5 and C8 are less frequent. A herniated disc in the cervical spine accounts for only 20–25% of the cases of CR. CR as a direct result of cervical trauma or metastases is infrequent. Although CR is a common diagnosis, there is still no consensus on the definition. The differential diagnosis of CR can be extensive and includes many musculoskeletal or neurological conditions that may mimic the signs and symptoms of CR.

It has been suggested that CR is a diagnosis based on clinical impression, advanced testing, electrophysiology tests, or a combination of these tests. There are no generally accepted, well-defined clinical criteria for the diagnosis of CR. A clear definition of terms is required to establish definitive diagnostic criteria for evaluating the (cost)effectiveness of treatment of patients with CR. An unambiguous diagnostic classification of CR is necessary to be able to select a homogeneous patient population for daily practice and research. It will facilitate communication and help in identifying subgroups of patients differing from the overall population in prognosis or treatment benefit.

Therefore, this systematic review aims to assess the uniformity of diagnostic criteria and definitions used in intervention studies (with at least one conservative treatment group) to select patients with CR.

### Which kind of prognosis is better in the treatment of cervical and lumbar disc herniation with coblation nucleoplasty? [^113aT9Lz]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Cervical or lumbar discogenic pain affects more than 50% of patients, which severely impair quality of life and impose a huge socioeconomic burden. Various treatments are available for discogenic pain, such as medication, physical therapy, nerve block, behavior management, psychotherapy, minimally invasive interventions, and fusion or non-fusion surgery. However, these treatments have obvious limitations and complications, and do not always yield satisfactory results.

In CDH and LDH, the discs in the spine bulge or protrude from their normal positions, which can cause pain or numbness in the corresponding region. Disc herniation is primarily occurring at levels of C6/7, L4/5 and L5/S1. In consistent with this finding, our results showed that CDH was mostly observed at the levels of C5/6 (52.73%) and C6/7 (41.82%), whereas LDH was mainly detected at the levels of L4/5 (50.79%) and L5/S1 (42.86%). Conservative treatment is the first choice for most patients with disc herniation, including physical therapy, anti-inflammatory and epidural steroid injection. Decompression surgery may be considered when the conservative treatment fails to improve the condition, including discectomy for radiculopathy from herniated intervertebral disc, decompressive laminectomy for symptomatic spinal stenosis with or without degenerative spondylolisthesis, and fusion for nonradicular pain with degenerative changes.

### Cervical radiculopathy: nonoperative management of neck pain and radicular symptoms [^112GyuyJ]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy is a disease process marked by nerve compression from herniated disk material or arthritic bone spurs. This impingement typically produces neck and radiating arm pain or numbness, sensory deficits, or motor dysfunction in the neck and upper extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic myelography can confirm neurologic compression. The overall prognosis of persons with cervical radiculopathy is favorable. Most patients improve over time with a focused, nonoperative treatment course. There is little high-quality evidence on the best nonoperative therapy for cervical radiculopathy. Cervical collars may be used for a short period of immobilization, and traction may temporarily decompress nerve impingement. Medications may help alleviate pain and neuropathic symptoms. Physical therapy and manipulation may improve neck discomfort, and selective nerve blocks target nerve root pain. Although the effectiveness of individual treatments is controversial, a multimodal approach may benefit patients with cervical radiculopathy and associated neck pain.

Common Causes for LBP

Common causes for LBP include muscle spasm, disc pathology, nerve root impingement (resulting in radiculopathy), spinal stenosis (with or without neurogenic claudication), and joint issues involving the intraarticular facet or sacroiliac joints. More advanced pathological causes of acute and chronic LBP include vertebral fractures, axial spondyloarthropathies, cancer metastases, and spinal infections. However, most people suffer with CLBP that has no recognized specific cause. The cervical and lumbar paravertebral region contain many muscle groups, which control nearly all spinal motions and posture. Physical and mental stressors contribute to spasm of these muscles, with resulting postural changes and non-specific pain. There are a multitude of treatments available for nonspecific CLBP, some of which will be reviewed below. Chemical radiculitis may be the source of radiating leg pain in patients with discogenic disease without radiographic evidence of disc herniation. Imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) frequently document asymptomatic findings, including disc herniations in 20% of patients without LBP less than age 60 years and 36% above age 60. Symptomatic findings on MRI may include disc herniation or high-intensity zone lesions which are often considered as pain generators. While exact mechanisms are poorly understood, evidence indicates that multiple pathophysiological pathways are associated with non-specific LBP. For example, gluteal muscle spasm can lead to symptoms suggestive of radicular pain, or "pseudo-sciatica" symptoms often referred to as piriformis syndrome. Another challenging fact is that discogenic pain may only be axial in nature; studies have shown a correlation between vertebral endplate (Modic) changes seen on MRI scans and LBP.

### Surgical versus nonsurgical treatment for cervical radiculopathy [^113zVZz3]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cervical radiculopathy is typically caused by disc herniation or spondylosis. Few trials have compared the efficacy of surgical versus nonsurgical treatment for these conditions.

Methods

We conducted two randomized clinical trials among 180 patients presenting to the Oslo University Hospital in Norway with disabling radicular arm pain and cervical disc herniation (trial 1; n = 89) or spondylosis (trial 2; n = 91) proven by magnetic resonance imaging or computerized tomography. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either surgical or nonsurgical treatment. Surgery involved anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. Nonsurgical treatment involved three sessions with physical medicine/rehabilitation physicians and three sessions with physiotherapists for functional and cognitive behavioral support. The primary outcome in both trials was the Neck Disability Index (NDI) score (range, 0 to 100; higher scores indicate greater disability; minimal important difference is 15) at 12 months, which was self-reported by the patients.

Results

Among the 87 patients in the disc herniation trial with 12-month data (surgical group, n = 45; nonsurgical group, n = 42), the mean difference in NDI adjusted for baseline was 7.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 13.3; P = 0.01) in favor of surgical treatment. Among the 88 patients in the spondylosis trial with 12-month data (surgical, n = 44; nonsurgical, n = 44), the mean difference in NDI adjusted for baseline was 2.3 (95% CI, -4.9 to 9.6; P = 0.52). In the disc herniation trial, two patients in the nonsurgical group crossed over to have surgery. In the spondylosis trial, 11 patients in the nonsurgical group crossed over to have surgery. There were no serious adverse events.

Conclusions

In patients with cervical radiculopathy, we found a statistically significant difference for NDI at 12 months in favor of surgical versus nonsurgical treatment in the disc herniation trial, but no difference in the spondylosis trial.

Cervical disc herniation and radiculopathy — etiology and distribution indicate that the most common cause of cervical radiculopathy in 70% to 75% of cases is foraminal encroachment of the spinal nerve, whereas herniation of the nucleus pulposus is responsible for radiculopathy in approximately 20–25% of cases. Cervical disc herniations occur most often between the C5/6 and C6/7 cervical vertebral bodies.

### Cervical disc degeneration and neck pain [^112ugWiQ]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Cervical intervertebral disc has long been considered a common source of neck pain. However, the pain caused by the disc itself has not been clearly defined so far, and its diagnosis and treatment has always been controversial. Degenerative cervical disc has a rich supply of nerve fibers, is prone to inflammatory reactions, and is susceptible to pain that can be provoked by disc stimulation or distention, and can be eliminated by block. Overwhelming clinical evidence demonstrates that neck pain in patients with degenerative cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy can be subsided rapidly by anterior cervical surgery, further indicating that this neck pain stems from the pathology of cervical disc itself. Cervical discography is advocated as the only test that connects disease to symptoms, but the procedure remains controversial. If strict criteria and technique are maintained, discography can discriminate painful, symptomatic discs from nonpainful, asymptomatic discs. Discogenic neck pain alone without cervical disc herniation or cervical spondylosis accounts for a large proportion of chronic neck pain. For these patients who continue to have refractory neck pain and fail to respond to conservative treatment, anterior cervical fusion surgery or artificial cervical disc replacement may be a better choice, and preoperative cervical discography can guarantee the excellent surgical results. Existing basic and clinical studies have scientifically shown that cervical intervertebral disc degeneration can lead to neck pain.

### Cervical disc, mimicking nerve sheath tumor, with rapid spontaneous recovery: a case report [^117BPzi1]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The study design includes a case report and clinical discussion. The potential of acute disc herniations to regress spontaneously has been previously reported. However, the initial radiological presentation can be misleading, leading to therapeutic pitfalls, especially when the presence of myelopathy calls for early intervention. We present the case of a 46-year-old woman with a cervical intraspinal enhancing mass, associated enhancement of the C6 root and myelopathy, leading to the presumptive diagnosis of a nerve sheath tumor. The patient was offered surgery, which she denied. The patient returned 7 weeks later with significant clinical improvement. A subsequent magnetic resonance imaging depicted a herniated cervical disc and regression of myelopathy. Although spontaneous regression of disc prolapse and myelopathy have been previously reported, the initial radiological presentation and the short period of regression in this case highlight the need for a thorough understanding of the natural course of cervical disc herniations. Nonsurgical conservative observation should be considered an option for treatment for some cervical disc herniations that are likely to regress for very specific and predictable reasons.

### The CASINO trial: surgical versus conservative management in patients with cervical radiculopathy due to intervertebral disc herniation: a prospective cohort study [^114xJuEx]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cervical Radicular Syndrome is predominantly treated conservatively, but surgical treatment can be considered after shared decision-making. Knowledge about difference in outcome is scarce. The CASINO trial aims to enhance this knowledge to assist patients and physicians in optimizing treatment choices.

A multi-centre observational cohort study was conducted in patients visiting a neurologist or neurosurgeon with CRS and disc-herniation. Conservative and surgical treatment were discussed and in agreement a decision was made. 141 patients with cervical radiculopathy due to intervertebral disc herniations were included, 88 were surgically and 53 were conservatively treated. Visual Analogue Scale for arm pain and Neck Disability Index served as primary outcome parameters. Secondary outcome measures involved VAS neck pain and the EuroQol VAS. Data were collected at baseline, 6, 12, 26, 38, 52 and 104 weeks after inclusion, and analysed using linear mixed-effects models.

Results

At baseline, the surgical treatment-arm had more arm pain (VAS Arm Pain, p = .017) but other baseline parameters were comparable. However, during the two years follow up period the surgical arm fared better than the conservatively treated patients: VAS arm pain decreased 12 mm more in the surgical group than in the conservative group (p = .053), exceeding the Minimal Clinical Important Difference (MCID). VAS neck pain decreased 19 mm more in the surgical group than in the conservative group (p = .002), illustrating a significant and clinically relevant difference between the treatment arms.

Conclusion

During two years follow up, differences could be substantiated between the two treatment arms regarding arm and neck pain.

### Degenerative cervical radiculopathy: diagnosis and conservative treatment. A review [^114vxtmt]. European Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Degenerative cervical radiculopathy: clinical diagnosis and conservative treatment. A review. To provide a state-of-the-art assessment of diagnosis and non-surgical treatment of degenerative cervical radiculopathy a literature search for studies on epidemiology, diagnosis including electrophysiological examination and imaging studies, and different types of conservative treatment was undertaken. The most common causes of cervical root compression are spondylarthrosis and disc herniation. Diagnosis is made mainly on clinical grounds, although there are no well-defined criteria. Provocative tests like the foraminal compression test are widely used but not properly evaluated. The clinical diagnosis of degenerative cervical radiculopathy can be confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. The role of electromyography is mainly to rule out other conditions. Cervical radiculopathy is initially treated conservatively, although no treatment modality has been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.

### Degenerative disorders of the lumbar and cervical spine [^117BSnWs]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Degenerative disorders in the spine are normal, age-related phenomena and largely asymptomatic in most cases. Conservative management of lumbar and cervical spondylosis is the mainstay of treatment, and most patients with symptomatic degenerative changes respond appropriately with nonsurgical management. Surgical intervention can be considered an appropriate and viable option when conservative measures have failed. Treatment options should always be directed toward the specific nature and location of the patient's individual pathology. Although current standards in the surgical management of lumbar and cervical degenerative disorders include discectomy, neural decompression, and instrumented spinal arthrodesis, new approaches that address this often-challenging clinical entity are on the horizon.

### Efficacy of neck muscle activation versus strengthening for adults with chronic cervical radiculopathy: a study protocol for a randomised clinical trial [^1123zsPB]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Cervical radiculopathy, a condition characterised by nerve root compression in the neck, is a rising global concern. It leads to persistent pain, weakness and sensory changes, lasting beyond the typical healing period of 3–6 months. Neck pain, affecting over 30% of individuals annually, ranks as the fourth-leading cause of disability. Remarkably, 20%– 70% of people will experience neck pain disrupting their daily lives at some point. Recent data from the European Journal of Pain reveal that cervical radiculopathy results in disability for approximately 352.0 cases per 100 000 individuals worldwide over the past 3 decades. Notably, the incidence of cervical radiculopathy stands at 83.2 cases per 100 000 people, with the highest occurrence between ages 40 and 50. This translates to a yearly incidence of 107.3 cases per 100 000 men and 63.5 cases per 100 000 women.

Herniated cervical discs, mainly affecting the C6 or C7 nerve roots in 80% of cases, lead to cervical radiculopathy. Symptoms encompass neck discomfort, radiating arm or shoulder pain, numbness, tingling, upper-limb weakness and altered reflexes. Diagnosis relies on clinical assessment, MRI and a manual spurling's test. When substantial nerve root compression causes radiculopathy, it is expected to result in muscular weakness in the specific muscle innervated by that affected nerve root. Studies have confirmed increased muscle fatigue and reduced neck muscle function in patients with cervical radiculopathy. These statistics underscore the growing prevalence and impact of cervical radiculopathy, emphasising the need for effective management and prevention strategies. Therapeutic exercises, including muscle strengthening, stretching and stabilisation, are vital for mitigating these effects and promoting recovery in chronic neck and nerve pain.

### Do we really apply evidence-based-recommendations to spine surgery? Results of an international survey [^114jTUZS]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Various clinical scenarios

Table 3 summarizes the responses to the applicability of various medical approaches when making decisions about spinal pathologies. The rate of those who always or frequently refer to guidelines or scoring systems in their decisions was (94.3%). When no guideline or scoring system is used, the most commonly referred methods are "Literature search" and "Personal experience".

In patients with severe back pain, the most preferred initial approach chosen by participants was "Obtain MRI". In addition, there is a common belief that the spinal surgical approach and the addition of arthrodesis can improve clinical outcomes. There are some different opinions about whether to treat patients with low bone mineral density (BMD T < -2.5) before spine surgery, but there seems to be a trend to treat sometimes or always. There are also various opinions on prescribing high-dose methylprednisolone to patients with acute spinal cord injury. However, the rate of those who always or sometimes apply this treatment is relatively high. Most respondents stated that ACDF alone is sufficient in correcting sagittal alignment and that anterior discectomy has better outcomes than posterior when treating cervical radiculopathy. A majority of participants (68.3%) recommended physical and medical therapy to a patient with disc herniation in the absence of leg pain, whereas only 16% opted for no treatment.

Most Frequent Answers to Various Clinical Scenarios

Group comparisons

Gender

Since only a few women (12%) completed the survey, our authors avoided making conclusions about gender-wise comparisons from this data. The rate of those who know and understand EBM and use it in practice is relatively high in both men (67.0%) and women (72.2%). In the question about what is the best definition of EBM, the majority of both men (71.6%) and women (66.7%) participants gave the answer "combining personal clinical experience with the best evidence derived from medical, scientific research". In the case of decision-making in patients where no guideline or scoring system is used, the highest percentage relies on literature searches, with 54.5% for men and 58.3% for women. However, we observed a striking statistical difference concerning the opinions on the surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy is the higher agreement of women with the statement "The Neck Disability Index, SF-36, SF-12, and VAS are recommended outcome measures" compared to men (41.7% versus 20.8%, p = 0.013).

North American Spine Society (NASS) cervical radiculopathy guideline — scope and use — provides evidence-based recommendations to address key clinical questions for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders and outlines a reasonable evaluation and treatment options for adult patients. THIS GUIDELINE DOES NOT REPRESENT A "STANDARD OF CARE", nor is it intended as a fixed treatment protocol, and it states that there will be patients who will require less or more treatment than the average and that in atypical cases, treatment falling outside this guideline will sometimes be necessary. The guideline also notes it should not be seen as prescribing the type, frequency or duration of intervention, that treatment should be based on the individual patient's need and physician's professional judgment, that it should not be used as the sole reason for denial of treatment and services, and that it is not intended to expand or restrict a health care provider's scope of practice or to supersede applicable ethical standards or provisions of law.

### Cervical disc degeneration and neck pain [^1115sJWp]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neck pain is a significant public health problem worldwide. Cervical intervertebral disc has long been considered a common source of neck pain.–Although it has always been there, there has been no clear definition of pain from the disc itself, and its diagnosis and treatment has been highly controversial. The main factors contributing to this ambiguity may be deficient of understanding of its pathogenesis and lack careful observation and thorough reflection on some clinical studies. In a review of the causes of neck pain, Evanswrote "Although possible, there is no strong evidence that intervertebral discs (through degenerative or other changes) are a source of pain (discogenic pain). This area remains controversial". A systematic review and guidelines from the Bone and Joint 2000–2010 task force on neck pain insisted that "there is no evidence (that was deemed scientifically admissible) demonstrating that disc degeneration is a risk factor for neck pain". So, what is the truth? Is the degenerative cervical disc a source of neck pain? Can existing basic and clinical studies give an accurate answer scientifically?

### Pragmatic randomized controlled trial of pharmacopuncture therapy for cervical disc herniation: a pilot study [^114rta1S]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cervical disc herniation (CDH) results from the displacement of the nucleus pulposus within an intervertebral disc, with nerve root or spinal cord inflammation and compression, causing pain or neurological symptoms over a wide region, including the neck and upper extremities.CDH may be acute or chronic; acute CDH commonly occurs as a result of trauma, whereas chronic CDH occurs when the intervertebral disc degenerates and becomes desiccated during natural aging. A CDH epidemiology study reported a 107 and 63.5 annual incidence in men and women, respectively, per 100000 people. A study in Korea reported a trend of annual increases in CDH prevalence, with a higher occurrence in women than in men; however, the prevalence increased with age for both sexes. The study results are based on the responses of individuals who had CDH symptoms and received treatment; the actual figures are even higher when including patients with asymptomatic CDH. The increasing CDH prevalence translates into a substantial socioeconomic burden. According to the National Health Insurance Statistical Yearbook, medical care costs for CDH in 2022 were approximately KRW 337.1 billion, with CDH ranking 31 st in conventional (Western) medicine and 16 th in Korean medicine (KM) regarding frequent diagnosis requiring inpatient care. Furthermore, the frequency of surgical treatments, such as cervical discectomy and fusion, has increased owing to diagnostic and surgical tool development and rising CDH prevalence in an aging society.

CDH treatment is generally categorized into conservative and surgical therapies. Conservative CDH management includes pharmacotherapy, traction, physiotherapy, and spinal orthoses use. For conditions refractory to conservative therapies, surgical treatments, such as anterior or posterior cervical discectomy, for removing bone spurs and affected discs, combined with adjacent vertebrae fusion, are considered. However, these surgeries are invasive interventions that may lead to side effects and complications, such as nerve damage, vascular injury, and enhanced degenerative changes, in the adjacent segments. In addition, a study confirmed that surgical decompression is effective in the short term; however, no significant difference is observed in the long-term outcomes compared with those of conservative treatment. Recently, with increasing personal and socioeconomic losses due to CDH, more aggressive treatments, such as cervical epidural steroid injections and nerve blocks, such as stellate ganglion blocks, have been used as alternatives before surgery; however, their effectiveness remains controversial.

### Posterior cervical spine surgery for radiculopathy [^112FDevW]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

It is now common knowledge that cervical radiculopathy, frequently caused by disc herniation and/or degeneration, will often improve without surgical intervention. Only a small percentage of patients with the severity of symptoms necessitate surgical treatment. Surgery for radiculopathy is indicated for motor weakness, progressive neurological deficits, and progressive symptoms that do not improve with nonoperative treatment. Advantages and disadvantages exist for both ventral and dorsal approaches in the surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy. Indications and results for dorsal nerve root decompression are discussed, and a review of our preferred techniques, including use of minimally invasive technology, is presented.

### Cervical disc degeneration and neck pain [^115rXPiR]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical evidence

Although a number of studies have shown that the degenerative cervical disc is one of the main sources of chronic neck pain; however, some authoritative reviews always stated that there is a lack of consensus regarding causes or treatments for this neck pain alone without disc herniation or cervical radiculopathy.,

It is well accepted that anterior cervical surgery is an effective way for cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy caused by cervical disc herniation or spondylosis. The overwhelming clinical evidence–reveals that anterior cervical fusion surgery or artificial cervical intervertebral disc replacement can provide rapid relief of symptoms of axial neck pain and radiculopathy or myelopathy simultaneously by removing the source of nerve root or spinal cord compression for the patients with cervical disc herniation or cervical spondylosis. However, the treatment of intractable neck pain by anterior cervical surgery is not an accepted management. This is because the mechanism of postoperative pain relief is not clear. There was an increase in pain-related nerve fibers in both degenerative and herniated cervical discs. Because the contents of the nucleus pulposus are known to directly activate and sensitize nerve fibers, nerve fibers growing into degenerative and herniated discs might provide a potential explanation for these clinical findings. If anterior cervical fusion surgery to reduce axial neck pain is due to the elimination of mechanical instability secondary to bone fusion of the affected segment, artificial cervical intervertebral disc replacement will provide a better explanation for the reduction of this neck pain. The primary goals of cervical disc replacement in the treatment of cervical disc herniation or cervical spondylosis are to preserve motion, allow patients to quickly return to routine activities, and prevent later adjacent level degeneration after removing local disc pathology. Artificial cervical disc replacement can eliminate axial neck pain, further indicating that this neck pain is not from the pathology of other parts, such as the posterior facet joints and muscles, but from the pathology of cervical disc itself.

### Intermittent cervical traction and thoracic manipulation for management of mild cervical compressive myelopathy attributed to cervical herniated disc: a case series [^1178frhv]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case series.

Objective

To describe the management of 7 patients with grade 1 cervical compressive myelopathy attributed to herniated disc using intermittent cervical traction and manipulation of the thoracic spine.

Background

Intermittent cervical traction has been indicated for the treatment of patients with herniated disc and has been suggested to be helpful for patients with cervical compressive myelopathy. Manipulation of the thoracic spine has been utilized to safely improve active range of motion and decrease pain in patients with neck pain.

Methods and Measures

Seven women with neck pain, 35 to 45 years of age, were identified as having signs and symptoms consistent with grade 1 cervical compressive myelopathy. Symptom duration ranged from less than 1 week to 52 weeks. All patients were treated with intermittent cervical traction and thoracic manipulation for a median of 9 sessions (range, 2–12 sessions) over a median of 56 days (range, 14–146 days). Numeric Pain Rating Scale and Functional Rating Index scores served as the primary outcome measures.

Results

The median decrease in pain scores was 5 (range, 2–8) from a baseline of 6 (range, 4–8), and median improvement in Functional Rating Index scores was 26% (range, 10%-50%) from a baseline of 44% (range, 35%-71%). Dizziness was eliminated in 3 out of 4 patients and chronic headache symptoms were improved in 3 out of 3 patients. There were no adverse events or outcomes.

Conclusions

Intermittent cervical traction and manipulation of the thoracic spine seem useful for the reduction of pain scores and level of disability in patients with mild cervical compressive myelopathy attributed to herniated disc. A thorough neurological screening exam is recommended prior to mechanical treatment of the cervical spine.

### Treatment expectations towards different pain management approaches: two perspectives [^111Cs9Zo]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Development of Vignettes

The vignettes were designed according to international guidelines. All vignettes shared certain features: they had similar lengths (∼ 200 words), were formulated in present tense (except for history and background information), the content followed a narrative, story-line progression, and their structure followed a similar scheme. First, it started with a description of a typical patient with chronic low back pain who reported to be suffering from low back pain due to a herniated disk, spinal canal stenosis, or spondylolisthesis. Despite successful surgery, this back pain persisted for unspecific reasons (5–8 years). All patients were presented as having a similar age (50–55 years old). Gender and type of previous medical conditions were balanced across the three different treatment approaches. Second, the diagnostic procedure within the given treatment approach was described. Third, the corresponding treatment goals were formulated. Fourth, the respective treatment elements were outlined in a detailed description. The first draft of each treatment approach's vignette was written based on national treatment guidelines for chronic low back pain. Two experts adjusted the descriptions based on their clinical experience. An anesthetist and a psychologist, both specialists in chronic-pain management, provided comments and ideas for improvements. Lastly, a third expert on creating vignettes corrected the final descriptions.

### Effect of arthroplasty vs fusion for patients with cervical radiculopathy: a randomized clinical trial [^112zjz9U]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Cervical radiculopathy is a frequently encountered neurologic condition and is most often caused by encroachment of a cervical nerve root. It typically presents with neck and arm pain and sometimes sensory loss or loss of motor function in the affected nerve root distribution. The most common cause of cervical radiculopathy is degenerative features, including reduced disc height, osteophyte formation, and disc herniation.

Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion either as stand-alone implant surgical treatment or with the use of additional plating has for decades been the criterion standard treatment for cervical radiculopathy, and more than 100 000 patients receive this treatment in the US annually. Surgical treatment for cervical radiculopathy is increasing in most countries and is projected to increase by more than 10% in the next 20 years.

In recent years, arthroplasty (ie, artificial disc replacement) designed to maintain normal motion has gained use owing to the concern that fusion may cause adjacent segment disease. Many studies and meta-analyses have compared these 2 treatment options. Most authors presented results in favor of arthroplasty. However, many of the studies were industry sponsored, and few studies blinded patients and/or clinicians. The Norwegian Cervical Arthroplasty Trial (NORCAT)blinded both patients and clinicians and found equal and beneficial outcomes for arthroplasty and fusion at 2 years. The aim of this study was to present the 5-year outcomes and reoperation rates in patients who underwent surgical treatment for single-segment cervical radiculopathy with either arthroplasty or fusion.

### Clinical outcomes of integrative Korean medicine treatment in patients with neck pain following cervical disc surgery: a multi-center retrospective study [^113EfBaj]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cervical disc disorder is a clinical syndrome caused by structural abnormalities of the cervical spine, wherein the cervical intervertebral disc compresses the cervical nerve roots. It is a leading cause of neck pain. Affected individuals experience neck pain along with varying degrees of radiating arm pain, muscle weakness, and sensory abnormalities in the upper extremities, depending on the severity of cervical nerve root compression. The global prevalence of cervical disc disorder has been increasing, and, consequently, so have the associated socioeconomic costs on the patients and health care systems.

Conservative treatments for cervical disc disorder include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroid injections, physical therapy, and rest. Surgical treatment is performed on patients who do not respond to conservative treatments or who have progressive neurological symptoms, with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, and posterior laminectomy being standard procedures.

The number of cervical disc surgeries and the associated costs are increasing; however, surgery does not always yield satisfactory outcomes as neck pain, dysphagia, and paralysis, among other surgery-associated complications, have been reported post-operatively. Furthermore, there are many cases where symptoms do not improve post-surgery, necessitating rehospitalization or resulting in recurrence. Such persistent pain after surgery, often referred to as failed back or neck surgery syndrome, has been reported to occur in approximately 10–40%, of patients and represents a significant global health issue due to its considerable socioeconomic burden.

Medical and scientific consensus regarding the impact of the degree of disc herniation on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fusion surgery on postoperative prognosis remains inconsistent. Some studies have suggested that magnetic resonance image (MRI) signal changes in the cervical disc may serve as important indicators for postoperative prognosis after cervical spine surgery, whereas other studies have reported that the location and type of herniation itself do not have a significant impact. Regarding fusion surgery, although one study reported that baseline patient conditions have a greater influence on long-term prognosis, others have indicated that the cervical disc arthroplasty group showed significantly better outcomes in terms of pain and reoperation rates than the fusion surgery group.

### Cervical collar or physiotherapy versus wait and see policy for recent onset cervical radiculopathy: randomised trial [^114JGyDy]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Cervical radiculopathy is a common disorder characterised by neck pain radiating to the arm and fingers corresponding to the dermatome involved. On examination, diminished muscle tendon reflexes, sensory disturbances, or motor weakness with dermatomal/myotomal distribution can be found. The diagnosis is made primarily on clinical grounds. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine usually shows the cause of the radiculopathy, which is usually spondylarthrosis or a herniated disc.

Generally, degenerative cervical radiculopathy with subacute onset has a favourable prognosis, allowing a wait and see policy during the first six weeks. However, as pain is often excruciating during the first weeks to months, treatment to accelerate the improvement of pain and function would be highly valuable. Unfortunately, evidence is lacking for the effectiveness of any non-surgical treatment, including a wait and see policy, cervical collar, or physiotherapy. Two randomised trials comparing different non-invasive treatment methods in chronic cervical radiculopathy showed no benefit for physiotherapy or a cervical collar. Treatment in acute or subacute cervical radiculopathy has not yet been studied. Therefore, we evaluated the effectiveness of a semi-hard cervical collar in combination with taking as much rest as possible or physiotherapy and home exercises compared with a wait and see policy in recent onset cervical radiculopathy. We hypothesised that a treatment policy (collar or physiotherapy) would result in a faster decline in pain and improvement in function than would a wait and see policy.

### Which kind of prognosis is better in the treatment of cervical and lumbar disc herniation with coblation nucleoplasty? [^116G5kLh]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coblation nucleoplasty is a minimally invasive procedure developed for the treatment of symptomatic disc herniation.

Methods

We evaluated 118 cases of cervical and lumbar intervertebral discs treated with coblation nucleoplasty. The clinical results were assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS), modified MacNab criteria, and efficacy. Complications and the re-surgery rate were also evaluated. The procedure was carried out under CT guidance, and the patients were followed up for 1 day, 1 month, 6 months, and 5 years postoperative.

Results

At the 5-year follow-up, the VAS score in the cervical and lumbar groups significantly decreased from 6.20 to 2.43 and 6.11 to 3.29, respectively. While MacNab scores were indistinguishable at the 6-month follow-up, they differed significantly between the cervical (58.2%) and lumbar (34.9%) groups at the 5-year follow-up. At the 5-year follow-up, 6 patients in the cervical group and 11 in the lumbar group underwent conventional operation. The efficacy of coblation nucleoplasty at the 5-year follow-up was higher in cervical group (81.82%) compared with lumbar group (61.90%).

Conclusion

The results of this study suggest that coblation nucleoplasty is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with cervical and lumbar disc herniation. The long-term benefits of this procedure were more pronounced in patients with cervical disc herniation.

Clinical Trial Registration

The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (ChiCTR2400089145).

Clinical history, physical examination, and radiographic findings of two patients with intradural cervical disc herniation were described, and corpectomy was performed in both cases. A review of the literature was completed.

Result

The outcome of one case was gratifying, and at a 36-month follow-up, nearly a full recovery was obtained. But the other's condition was disappointing, whose postoperative MRI demonstrated high signal intensity in the spinal cord and adhesion of spinal cord to the posterior margin at C4 level.

Conclusion

Intradural cervical disc herniation is relatively rare, and the two additional cases updated the number of this condition to 29. It remains difficult to definitively diagnose the disease before surgery, but some indirect signs may indicate the cases. Corpectomy under a microscope as the first option in treatment of this disease is recommended once it is highly diagnosed. The pathogenesis of intradural cervical disc herniation remains to be further investigated. We presume that biochemical factors may play an important role in the pathogenesis.

### Natural history of radiculopathy [^115hdpkj]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Radicular pain is a frequent complaint of patients presenting to outpatient primary care and musculoskeletal clinics. Most cases of radiculopathy are self-limiting, and symptoms resolve over the course of weeks to months. There is spontaneous resolution of disc herniations, and clinical improvement correlates with morphologic resolution. Knowledge of the natural history of radiculopathy is crucial for the health care provider to appropriately counsel and treat patients with this disorder. Although each patient should be managed individually, the favorable prognosis of radiculopathy based on the natural history supports a conservative approach for the initial weeks to months for most patients.

### An algorithmic approach for clinical management of chronic spinal pain [^116VS9Pz]. Pain Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Interventional pain management, and the interventional techniques which are an integral part of that specialty, are subject to widely varying definitions and practices. How interventional techniques are applied by various specialties is highly variable, even for the most common procedures and conditions. At the same time, many payors, publications, and guidelines are showing increasing interest in the performance and costs of interventional techniques. There is a lack of consensus among interventional pain management specialists with regards to how to diagnose and manage spinal pain and the type and frequency of spinal interventional techniques which should be utilized to treat spinal pain. Therefore, an algorithmic approach is proposed, providing a step-by-step procedure for managing chronic spinal pain patients based upon evidence-based guidelines. The algorithmic approach is developed based on the best available evidence regarding the epidemiology of various identifiable sources of chronic spinal pain. Such an approach to spinal pain includes an appropriate history, examination, and medical decision making in the management of low back pain, neck pain and thoracic pain. This algorithm also provides diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to clinical management utilizing case examples of cervical, lumbar, and thoracic spinal pain. An algorithm for investigating chronic low back pain without disc herniation commences with a clinical question, examination and imaging findings. If there is evidence of radiculitis, spinal stenosis, or other demonstrable causes resulting in radiculitis, one may proceed with diagnostic or therapeutic epidural injections. In the algorithmic approach, facet joints are entertained first in the algorithm because of their commonality as a source of chronic low back pain followed by sacroiliac joint blocks if indicated and provocation discography as the last step. Based on the literature, in the United States, in patients without disc herniation, lumbar facet joints account for 30% of the cases of chronic low back pain, sacroiliac joints account for less than 10% of these cases, and discogenic pain accounts for 25% of the patients. The management algorithm for lumbar spinal pain includes interventions for somatic pain and radicular pain with either facet joint interventions, sacroiliac joint interventions, or intradiscal therapy. For radicular pain, epidural injections, percutaneous adhesiolysis, percutaneous disc decompression, or spinal endoscopic adhesiolysis may be performed. For non-responsive, recalcitrant, neuropathic pain, implantable therapy may be entertained. In managing pain of cervical origin, if there is evidence of radiculitis, spinal stenosis, post-surgery syndrome, or other demonstrable causes resulting in radiculitis, an interventionalist may proceed with therapeutic epidural injections. An algorithmic approach for chronic neck pain without disc herniation or radiculitis commences with clinical question, physical and imaging findings, followed by diagnostic facet joint injections. Cervical provocation discography is rarely performed. Based on the literature available in the United States, cervical facet joints account for 40% to 50% of cases of chronic neck pain without disc herniation, while discogenic pain accounts for approximately 20% of the patients. The management algorithm includes either facet joint interventions or epidural injections with surgical referral for disc-related pain and rarely implantable therapy. In managing thoracic pain, a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithmic approach includes either facet joint interventions or epidural injections.

### Spinal pathologies and management strategies associated with cervical angina (pseudoangina): a systematic review [^113rXQdj]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Cervical angina, or pseudoangina pectoris, is a noncardiac syndrome of chest pain that often mimics angina pectoris but is a disease of the spine. Diagnosis of cervical angina can be difficult and is often overlooked, although once identified, it can be successfully managed through conservative therapies and/or a variety of surgical interventions. Ultimately, cervical angina is an important component of the list of differential diagnoses in noncardiac chest pain. In the present study, the authors report the first comprehensive systematic review of the range of cervical and thoracic pathologies associated with cervical angina, as well as the different treatment methods used to manage this condition.

Methods

A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines and using PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases from database inception to April 29, 2020, to identify studies describing spinal pathologies related to cervical angina. The following Boolean search was performed: ("cervical" OR "thoracic") AND ("angina" OR "chest pain") AND ("herniation" OR "OPLL"). Variables extracted included patient demographics, cervical angina pain location, pathology and duration of symptoms, treatment and/or management method, and posttreatment pain relief.

Results

Upon careful screening, 22 articles published between 1976 and 2020 met the study's inclusion/exclusion criteria, including 5 case series, 12 case reports, and 5 retrospective cohort studies. These studies featured a total of 1100 patients, of which 95 met inclusion criteria (mean patient age 51.7 years, age range 24–86 years; 53.6% male). Collectively, symptom durations ranged from 1.5 days to 90 months. Cervical herniation (72.6%) accounted for the majority of cervical angina cases, and surgical interventions (84.4%) predominated over physical therapy (13.0%) and medical management strategies (9.1%). Every patient assessed at follow-up reported relief from symptoms related to cervical angina.

Conclusions

Cervical angina is a noncardiac syndrome of chest pain associated with a broad range of cervical and thoracic spinal pathologies, the most common of which is cervical disc herniation. Although difficult to diagnose, it can be successfully treated when identified through first-line conservative management or surgical interventions in refractory cases.

### Cervical disc degeneration and neck pain [^115XAqKH]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Cervical discography and surgery

Cervical disc degeneration is common in people without neck pain. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may identify a degenerative cervical disc, it will not differentiate a disc which is pathologically painful from one which is physiologically aging. The high prevalence of neck pain and disc abnormalities in asymptomatic people provides the conceptual appeal for discography, which is advocated as the only test that connects disease to symptoms, but the procedure remains controversial. The main criticism of cervical discography, as with any other provocation test, is that disc stimulation may provide pain in normal discs. However, a normal cervical disc often accept no contrast materials or as little as 0.1–0.2 mL. If strict criteria and technique are maintained, discography can discriminate painful, symptomatic discs from nonpainful, asymptomatic discs. In addition, patients have no pain reproduction response or present only a mild to moderate neck or shoulder pain during injection. MRI can be used as a screening test to demonstrate possible painful levels, whereas discography can be used as an adjunctive confirmatory test. Discography can prevent the levels from unnecessary surgery. The combination of clinical symptoms, MRI, and discography provides the most information for decision-making and can improve the management of cervical discogenic pain. A recent systematic review noted that there is strong evidence for the utility of cervical discography as an intervertebral disc imaging tool and that intradiscal distention can produce pain.

Anterior cervical surgery has not been used routinely for chronic neck pain probably because of a paucity of literature rather than because of poor results. From the numerous clinical studies that have been published, most patients with discogenic neck pain can benefit from anterior cervical fusion surgery.–The overall excellent and good rate is between 70% and 90%.–In general, surgeons who reported less favorable outcomes had not performed preoperative discography to determine surgical levels. However, high-quality studies of anterior cervical surgery for cervical discogenic pain without cervical disc herniation or radiculopathy is lacking. Rothfirst used analgesic discography to diagnose and locate painful cervical disc in 71 discogenic neck pain patients followed by anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, resulting in a 93% excellent and good recovery rate. Compared with other studies with a 76% excellent and good recovery rate used provocative discography, the author concluded that analgesic discography is the most effective test for diagnosis and location of pain-producing disc.

Cervical epidural injections — use, approaches, safety, and evidence: Cervical epidural injections have been used to treat radicular pain from herniated discs, spinal stenosis, chemical discs, chronic neck pain with or without radiculitis secondary to post cervical surgery syndrome, and chronic neck pain of discogenic origin, and are performed either by interlaminar or transforaminal approaches. Cervical epidural steroid injections, specifically utilizing the transforaminal approach, have been associated with devastating complications, though significant complications also have been reported with interlaminar epidurals with spinal cord damage and quadriparesis; complications of fluoroscopically guided interlaminar cervical epidural injections have been reported to be much less frequent and major complications are rare. The evidence for cervical interlaminar epidural injections has been a subject of debate and at best has had only moderate success in managing cervical radiculopathy, while there was no evidence available in the management of axial or discogenic neck pain, spinal stenosis, or post surgery syndrome at the time of these evaluations. A systematic review by Diwan et al included 7 randomized trials showing good evidence for cervical disc herniation and fair evidence for axial or discogenic pain, spinal stenosis, and post cervical surgery syndrome, and the authors identified 9 new studies published since that review.

### Long-term follow-up of inpatients with cervical myelopathy who received integrative Korean medicine treatment: a retrospective analysis and questionnaire survey study [^111ud84K]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cervical myelopathy (CM) is a commonly serious spinal cord dysfunction caused by compression of the nerves as a result of changes in the cervical area that occur due to enlarged yellow ligaments and osteophyte proliferation around the disc. The disease occurs secondary to a severely herniated intervertebral disc (HIVD) in the cervical spine, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), and cervical spondylosis. The most common early symptoms include cervical and upper extremity pain, weakness of the hand muscles, clumsiness, paresthesia, and ambulatory impairment caused by weakening of the lower extremity muscles. According to Clarke and Robinsonand Epstein et al, CM can progress rapidly. However, in most cases, it progresses slowly with cyclical episodes of improvement and exacerbation of symptoms. In general, once the symptoms develop, CM rarely resolves spontaneously.

CM is diagnosed based on characteristic clinical symptoms, such as weakening of the upper extremities, myelopathic hand, deep tendon hyperreflexia, and radiologic tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Radiological tests are needed for the accurate diagnosis and prediction of prognosis in CM. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is reported to be more useful than other tests for examining the pathology associated with CM and for assessing the related changes in the spinal cord.CM is treated either conservatively or surgically. Conservative treatment modalities include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physiotherapy, and cervical braces. Nevertheless, evidence-based standards of care are lacking. Surgical treatment generally involves anterior cervical decompression or fusion at an early stage. However, a prospective study that compared the effects of surgical and conservative treatment in patients with CM reported that there were no significant differences in the objective parameters between the two treatment groups at the 2-year follow-up. Similarly, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a 10-year follow-up failed to identify any significant differences in patients who did not experience rapid symptom onset. In addition, other studies have found that some CM patients have mild symptoms. In recent years, several case reports showed that Korean medicine (KM) treatments, such as acupuncture, moxibustion, herbal therapy, and Chuna therapy are effective in improving the symptoms associated with CM. However, as mentioned in several literature reviews, the potential of KM treatment as a conservative treatment has only been examined in a few low-quality RCTsand many case reports.

### Are foraminal stenosis severity and herniation level associated with the treatment success of cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injection? [^116UkQKG]. Pain Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Foraminal stenosis, defined as a narrowing of the cervical neural foramen, is one of the most common causes of upper extremity radicular pain.

Objectives

The aim of our study was to determine the effects of the severity of neural foraminal stenosis and spinal herniation level on treatment success in patients treated with interlaminar epidural steroid injections (ILESI) due to cervical disc herniation-related radiculopathy and their possible predictive roles.

Study Design

A retrospective assessment.

Setting

A university hospital interventional pain management center.

Methods

We performed our study between August 2017 and February 2019, retrospectively. All patients' demographic characteristics, clinical and demographic data, including pain scores before and after cervical ILESI in the first hour, third week, and third month follow-ups, presence of motor deficits, symptom side, symptom duration before cervical ILESI, and whether there was progression to surgery in the 3-month period after injection, were collected.

Results

We evaluated 61 patients in the final analysis. When the spinal herniation levels and foraminal stenosis grades were compared, there was a significant difference between the groups (P = 0.003, P = 0.005). We reported significant correlations between foraminal stenosis grade (odds ratio [OR], -0.425, P = 0.038) and spinal herniation level (OR, -0.925, P = 0.001) and treatment success.

Limitations

Our study's design was retrospective.

Conclusions

Cervical ILESI is a reliable treatment option that provides a significant reduction in pain of patients with cervical radiculopathy. However, the success of ILESI treatment may be negatively affected in these patients in the presence of high spinal level cervical disc herniation and severe foraminal stenosis. Therefore considering these 2 parameters in predicting the patient population who will benefit from cervical ILESI is of importance in terms of decreasing potential complications.

Key Words

Interlaminar epidural steroid injections, foraminal stenosis, spinal level, cervical disc herniation, radicular pain.

### Which kind of prognosis is better in the treatment of cervical and lumbar disc herniation with coblation nucleoplasty? [^113eApma]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intervertebral discs are complex joints that consist of fibrous cartilage. Due to their location, they are prone to injury, which can lead to a cascade of painful sequelae, including internal disc disruption, disc degeneration, and disc herniation. Disc herniation is the most common disc disease. According to the anatomical location, disc herniation classifies into cervical and lumbar disc herniation (CDH and LDH), which generally leads to neck or back pain and sciatica. Cervical vertebrae are more mobile and have narrower spinal canal and neural foramen than the lumbar ones. The different anatomical structures of cervical and lumbar disc may affect the therapeutic efficacy of disc herniation.

Since symptoms of disc herniation may subside with time, conservative therapy is recommended as the first-line treatment. Physical therapy and local analgesic drug injection are commonly used for this procedure. However, there is a lack of high-quality evidence to define the effectiveness of conservative therapy. Surgical treatment is recommended if conservative care fails. Surgical techniques, such as interbody fusion, entail long-term risks, including stress overload and chronic damage to the neighboring discs, and other complications like infection, bleeding, and risks related to general anesthesia. These risks have led to the development of several minimally invasive approaches to the treatment of cervical/lumbar disc herniation.

Coblation nucleoplasty (CN) was initially used to treat symptomatic contained herniation in the spine. This procedure was reported to be safe and was associated with acceptable clinical success. It is conducted by using an ablation and coagulation-based device, which performed disc decompression via a plasma-mediated process. The plasma-mediated devices use radiofrequency energy to excite electrolytes in conductive medium, such as normal saline, resulting in the generation of plasma. The plasma consists of charged particles that have sufficient energy to break molecular bonds and remove or dissolve soft tissue through chemical and thermal effects at temperatures ranging from 40 to 70 degrees Celsius. The devices have different settings to control the plasma formation and the tissue interaction. The plasma-forming settings are used for tissue ablation, while the non-plasma-forming settings are used for tissue coagulation.

Coblation nucleoplasty has shown effectiveness in both cervical and lumbar herniation. However, the comparative long-term clinical outcomes of this technique for the two spinal regions remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a five-year retrospective follow-up study to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients with cervical and lumbar disc herniation who received coblation nucleoplasty.

Cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders — manipulation/chiropractics: A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address the role of manipulation/chiropractics in the management of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders, while case reports and series describe serious vascular and nonvascular complications and adverse outcomes associated with manipulation including radiculopathy, myelopathy, disc herniation and vertebral artery compression; the true incidence of such complications is unknown and estimates vary widely, some complications have occurred in patients with previously unrecognized spinal metastatic disease who did not have premanipulation imaging, and most patients with serious complications require emergent surgical treatment. Recommendation: As the efficacy of manipulation in the treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders is unknown, careful consideration should be given to evidence suggesting that manipulation may lead to worsened symptoms or significant complications when considering this therapy. Pre-manipulation imaging may reduce the risk of complications.

### Operative treatment of the patient with neck pain [^1144zgVv]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Most patients with axial neck pain and cervical radiculopathy can be managed conservatively. Surgical intervention for radiculopathy is considered only when conservative management has failed unless the neurologic deficits are very significant. In cases of myelopathy, surgery may be considered earlier, but if the myelopathy is mild, conservative treatment and close observation are still appropriate. For patients with axial neck pain, surgery is generally not considered except for rare cases caused by single- or two-level degenerative disk disease with severe and unrelenting pain. There are many surgical options for the patients with the degenerative cervical spine, but the indications are different. Surgical intervention involves a complete understanding of the disease process both from physical examination and from radiographic studies. If surgery is undertaken without appropriate clinical correlation, poor results often occur. Although the operative planning is the responsibility of the surgeon. the referring physician should also have some awareness of the basic principles behind the different surgeries.

Cervical radiculopathy — imaging evaluation: In patients 50 years of age or older, plain spinal radiography together with standard laboratory tests are highly accurate in identifying the underlying systemic disease, but plain radiography is not a valuable tool for nonspecific neck pain; when applicable, the American College of Radiology recommends a cervical spine series of x-rays as the initial study including lateral, anteroposterior, and oblique views. MRI is the choice of imaging in the modern era, replacing myelography, CT scan, and CT myelography, and MRI is considered to be as accurate as CT myelography for detecting cervical nerve root compression, even though it may be slightly inferior for detecting bony impingement of nerve roots. Asymptomatic imaging abnormalities are common: in a study of asymptomatic subjects, 10% of patients under age 40 had disc herniations, and in patients over 40, 20% have foraminal stenosis and 8% had disc herniations; therefore, a diagnosis of cervical radicular pain is considered definite only after careful evaluation and corroboration of history, physical examination, imaging, electrodiagnostic and in some cases, diagnostic injectional studies.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy [^1165Qbni]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

What is degenerative cervical myelopathy?

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), earlier referred to as cervical spondylotic myelopathy, involves spinal cord dysfunction from compression in the neck. Patients report neurological symptoms such as pain and numbness in limbs, poor coordination, imbalance, and bladder problems. Owing to its mobility, the vertebral column of the neck is particularly prone to degenerative changes such as disc herniation, ligament hypertrophy or ossification, and osteophyte formation. These changes are more common with age(box 1) and are often collectively termed spondylosis (fig 1).

Box 1
How common is it?

The epidemiology of DCM is poorly understood, in part because of the difficulties in diagnosis.

The prevalence of surgically treated DCM is estimated as 1.6 per 100 000 inhabitants. The actual prevalence is likely to be much higher
The incidence of DCM is expected to rise with an ageing population. Most patients are first diagnosed in their 50s; DCM is uncommon before the age of 40
Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that incidental cervical cord compression is commonly detected on MRI, and becomes more common with age. In a series of randomly selected volunteers aged 40–80, incidental cervical cord compression was detected on MRI in 59% of individuals (108/183, ranging from 31.6% in the fifth decade to 66.8% in the eighth decade). Only two individuals reported related symptoms
A proportion of individuals with asymptomatic cord compression will go on to develop DCM. The exact figure is unknown. The only prospective study to consider this (n = 199) found that 8% of individuals with asymptomatic cord compression will develop DCM after one year and 22% in total over the observation period (median follow-up 44 months, range 2–12 years)
Many patients with DCM remain undiagnosed. A small study in 66 patients with hip fracture found 18% of patients who were previously undiagnosed to have clinical findings suggestive of DCM

### Relationships between outcomes of conservative treatment and magnetic resonance imaging findings in patients with mild cervical myelopathy caused by soft disc herniations [^112rFdZ4]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

A retrospective follow-up study of conservatively treated patients with mild cervical myelopathy caused by cervical soft disc herniation.

Objective

To investigate the outcome of conservative treatment for patients with mild myelopathy caused by cervical soft disc herniation and to evaluate usefulness of magnetic resonance findings in the prediction of the outcomes.

Summary Of Background Data

Recent studies on conservative treatment for cervical soft disc herniation have focused mainly on radiculopathy, and not on myelopathy.

Methods

Twenty-seven patients with mild cervical myelopathy secondary to cervical soft disc herniation were treated conservatively for more than 6 months by cervical bracing and restriction of daily activities. Of the 27 patients, 17 patients (Group A) underwent conservative treatment only and it was associated with improvement in their neurologic deficits, while the other 10 patients (Group B) ultimately underwent decompression surgery because of neurologic deterioration. Comparisons between the two groups were made in regard to JOA scores, patient satisfaction, and magnetic resonance findings, including location of the disc herniation (focal or diffuse in the sagittal plane, median or paramedian in the axial plane).

Results

The JOA scores were 13.6 ± 1.6 in Group A and 14.1 ± 1.6 in Group B before treatment, 14.9 ± 1.0 and 12.9 ± 2.1, respectively, at 3 months, and 16.2 ± 0.8 and 16.0 ± 1.2, respectively, at the final follow-up. The JOA scores at 3 months were significantly lower in Group B than in Group A. Satisfaction with the results of treatment at the final follow-up was reported by 77% of the patients in Group A and 90% in Group B. Focal-type herniation was present in 47% of the patients in Group A and 70% in Group B, while median-type herniation was diagnosed in 77% in Group A and 30% in Group B. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging of the patients in Group A showed spontaneous regression of a herniated mass in 10 patients (59%). Diffuse-type herniations were more likely to regress spontaneously than focal-type herniations (78% vs. 37%).

Conclusions

Conservative treatment is an effective treatment option for mild cervical myelopathy caused by cervical soft disc herniation. A good outcome can be expected in patients with a median-type and/or diffuse-type herniation on magnetic resonance imaging.

Future directions for research in cervical radiculopathy state that a prospective, multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) with minimum two year follow-up comparing surgical to medical/interventional treatment for the treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders would yield invaluable information regarding the relative outcomes of these two treatment options, and that future studies evaluating the effects of emotional, cognitive and work-related issues would add to our understanding of how these factors affect outcomes in patients with cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders.

Nucleoplasty and Coblation for disc herniation — prior reviews and letters characterize the evidence as follows: As of January 2007 there were no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for Coblation, and another review found no published RCTs assessing Coblation or nucleoplasty; a later systematic review reported "fair evidence for nucleoplasty in managing radicular pain due to contained disc herniation" based on one randomized trial and 14 observational studies, while a subsequent letter stated there were "no RCTs comparing nucleoplasty with open surgical procedures", concluded that nucleoplasty "significantly reduces pain… and also increases their functional capacity", and opined it "is an effective, safe, and minimally invasive treatment option in cervical, thoracic, and lumbar contained disc herniations", though this work was conducted by "the manufacturer of the nucleoplasty probe".

ASIPP — thoracic disc related pathology epidemiology and morphology: Thoracic disc herniation is rare, with an estimate of prevalence of 1 per million people or 0.0001%, constituting a small proportion of overall disc herniations of 40 to 50 per 100,000 population or 0.04% to 0.05%, and surgical procedures in the thoracic spine make up only 0.15% to 4% of the procedures for disc herniation. The cord/canal ratio in the thoracic spine is 40%, compared to 25% in the cervical spine. Presence of asymptomatic stenosis has been estimated 11% to 37%, thoracic disc herniations are located below T7-T8 in 75% of the cases, and only 4% are located above T3-T4. Thoracic disc herniation is labeled as 'giant' when it occupies more than 40% of medullary canal on computed tomography (CT) scan or MRI, and intradural extension is only present in 0.26% to 0.3% of all herniated discs. Thoracic disc herniations have also been found in 3% to 37% with a history of trauma.

Degenerative cervical radiculopathy — an analysis of 50 consecutive patients undergoing posterior foraminotomy with follow-up at one month and one year — reports that pain preceeded the arm/finger symptoms in 35 patients (70%) and was relieved early in 46 (92%). Sixty-one painful sites were noted before surgery (one in 39 patients, two in 11 patients). Following surgery, 27 patients reported complete pain relief, 23 had pain in 24 regions and seven reported no change, with seventeen pain sites new since surgery and all but one new site nuchal and suprascapular; at one year follow-up, 45 patients reported no pain while five patients had pain in six sites, three of which were the same as before surgery. Cervical disc herniation was found in 20 patients and stenosis in 30; patients who experienced pain with arm and finger symptoms underwent single level decompression with the level determined by concordant symptoms and imaging, and SNRB in five patients. Pain location-to-root patterns were noted — when the pain was suprascapular, C5 or C6 radiculopathy was frequent; when interscapular, C7 or C8 radiculopathy was frequent; when scapular, C8 was frequent — and conclusions relative to question state that pain in the suprascapular region indicates C5 or C6 radiculopathy, the interscapular region indicates C7 or C8 radiculopathy, and the scapular region indicates C8 radiculopathy.

Cervical radiculopathy — Spurling's test diagnostic performance is detailed as follows: Spurling's test with cervical extension, lateral flexion to the side of pain, and downward pressure on the head was performed on all patients; twenty-five patients underwent surgery (Group 1) and 25 were managed conservatively (Group 2). In Group 1 (25 patients), 18/18 with a positive Spurling's test had a soft disc herniation; of seven patients with a negative Spurling's test, two had a soft disc herniation and five had a hard disc. In Group 2 (25 patients), of the 10 patients with a positive Spurling's test, nine had a soft disc herniation, one had a hard disc; of the 15 patients with a negative Spurling's test, a hard disc was seen in seven, and MRI was normal in seven. The Spurling's test had a sensitivity of 92%, a specificity of 95%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 96.4% and a negative predictive value (NPP) of 90.9% for a soft disc herniation; the authors concluded that the test "can be used to increase the incidence of disease in patients undergoing MRI for cervical radiculopathy", and the work group concluded that "a positive Spurling's test can increase the incidence of compressive disease in patients undergoing evaluation for cervical radiculopathy".

### Contemporary management of symptomatic lumbar disc herniations [^116nGsZp]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Lumbar disc herniations are common clinical entities that may cause lumbar-related symptoms. The spectrum of treatment options is geared toward a patient's clinical presentation and ranges from nothing to surgical intervention. Many lumbar disc herniations cause no significant symptoms. In studies of asymptomatic individuals who have never experienced lumbar-related symptoms, 30% have been reported to have major abnormality on magnetic resonance imaging. The mainstay of treatment of patients with symptomatic disc herniations is accepted to be nonoperative (as long as there are no acute or progressive neurologic deficits); this includes medications, physical therapy, and potentially lumbar injection. For patients with symptomatic disc herniations who fail to respond appropriately to conservative measures, surgical intervention may be considered. For this population, lumbar discectomy is considered to be a good option.

Wilson et al — retrospective comparative evaluation of MRI accuracy in cervical radiculopathy reported surgical diagnoses of disc herniation in 32, spondylosis in two and a combination of the two in six; MRI identified the surgical lesion in 37/40 patients (92%), correctly locating herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) in 32/38 and spondylosis in two, with six HNP missed and interpreted as spondylosis. CT myelography (CTM) was performed in 13 patients and in five added information; outcomes showed complete recovery in 31/40 and incomplete recovery in 8/40, with one lost to follow-up. Authors concluded that MRI is the only preoperative test necessary in most cases, while CTM may be useful in patients with a negative MRI, positive EMG and neurologic deficits; the critique notes this provides Level III diagnostic evidence that MRI is accurate for initial preoperative evaluation.

4.4. Strengths and limitations

Our study has strengths. We used rigorous and appropriate methodology to investigate this phenomenon of interest, which provided confidence in the validity of the results. Furthermore, we reached saturation and recruited a diverse sample of participants experiencing different levels of disability according to their WHODAS 2.0 scores.,

Our study also has limitations. First, we were only able to recruit from nonsurgical settings, potentially limiting our conclusions for people with DCR from a surgical office. However, this representation reflects clinical practice as the majority of patients with DCR receive conservative management rather than surgical care. Second, restricting the eligibility age to 45 years and older would have led to people suffering from DCR to be excluded if they were younger than 45 years of age. However, restricting the age of participants was appropriate as individuals younger than 45 years of age are more likely to suffer from a disk herniation causing their symptoms as opposed to degenerative changes. Third, in comparison with a more disease-specific outcome measure, using a generic disability measure such as the WHODAS 2.0 may miss some disease-specific aspects of disability experienced in this population.

### Outcome after anterior cervical decompression and fusion – A nationwide finSpine register study of independent predictors of outcome at 12 months after surgery for degenerative cervical spine [^116HGm9E]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Degenerative cervical spine disease (DCSD) has become a significant socioeconomic burden, and its prevalence is increasing around the globe. In Finland, cervical disk herniations alone account for over 100,000 annual sick leave days in a population of 5.5 million. In the most recent disease burden report by the World Health Organization in 2021, neck and back pain caused the most disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in the Finnish population aged 40 to 54 years.

Most symptoms of DCSD can often be managed conservatively. – However, while there is a group of patients for whom surgery is indicated, identifying those who will benefit most from surgical intervention remains controversial. – Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), initially described by Cloward et al, in 1958, has since established its role as a main surgical treatment option for DCSD. ACDF can be used to treat both degenerative radiculopathy and myelopathy, regardless of whether the underlying cause is cervical disk herniation or degenerative spondylosis.

Previous studies have addressed independent factors that may predict clinical improvement or nonsuccess after ACDF for DCSD. – In this study, we aimed to find patient-related and treatment-related factors that predict outcomes after ACDF in a nationwide cohort of consecutive patients. The novelty of our study is the utilization of consecutive patient data from the Finnish nationwide spine register (FinSpine). The main question was: Who is most likely to benefit from ACDF surgery?

Cervical radiculopathy — single-level versus multi-level surgical decompression long term results lack comparative evidence, as a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this comparison. After this review, most patients with true radiculopathy suffer from one level and occasionally two level disease, and the incidence of multilevel disease without the additional presence of myelopathy is rare, leading to the conclusion that there is likely little to gain and a low probability of generating meaningful data to answer this question. For research prioritization, the work group would not recommend further pursuit of this question.

NECK

The NEtherlands Cervical Kinetics (NECK) Trial of 2019 was a significant study in spinal neurosurgery focusing on the effectiveness of different surgical techniques for cervical disc herniation. This double-blinded randomized controlled trial compared anterior cervical discectomy with or without interbody fusion and arthroplasty. It involved 109 patients with one-level herniated disc, randomized to receive one of three treatments: anterior cervical discectomy with disc prosthesis (ACDA), anterior cervical discectomy with fusion (ACDF) using an intervertebral cage, or anterior cervical discectomy without fusion (ACD). Clinical and radiological outcomes were measured up to two years after surgery, including Neck Disability Index (NDI), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for neck and arm pain, and radiographic evaluation of cervical curvature and adjacent segment degeneration. The results indicated no significant differences in clinical outcomes among the three surgical methods. All treatment groups showed improvement in NDI and VAS scores for arm and neck pain, with no clear advantage of one technique over the others. This suggests that single-level ACD without an intervertebral device may be a reasonable alternative to ACDF or ACDA, challenging the perceived necessity of intervertebral devices in certain cases of cervical disc herniation.

### Degenerative disc disease: what is in a name? [^111y5Ghr]. Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A systematic search and review OBJECTIVE.: The aim of this study was to investigate the term, degenerative disc disease, to elucidate its current usage and inform clinical, research, and policy recommendations.

Summary Of Background Data

Degenerative disc disease has long been a dominant concept in common, painful spinal disorders. Yet, despite its pervasiveness and important clinical consequences and controversies, there has not been a systematic examination of its use and meaning in the scientific literature.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search of publications using the term degenerative disc disease from 2007 through 2016 in Ovid MEDLINE (R), Embase, CINAHL, and Scopus. Two investigators independently reviewed all publications in the primary sample. Publication and author identifiers, and qualitative study descriptors were extracted. Finally, the definition of degenerative disc disease was placed in one of eight categories. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics.

Results

Degenerative disc disease appeared in the titles of 402 publications in the primary sample and increased in frequency by 189% from the first to the last 3 years of the decade. No single definition was used in the majority of publications, and most frequently, the term was used without any definition provided (30.1%). In other cases, degenerative disc disease specifically included radiculopathy or myelopathy (14.4%), or only back or neck pain (5.5%), or was equated with disc degeneration regardless of the presence of symptoms (15.4%), or with discogenic pain or disc degeneration as a presumed cause of axial pain (12.7%). Another 7.2% comprised a mix of broad ranging findings and diagnoses. The most notable differences in definitions occurred between surgeons and other disciplines, and when applied to cervical versus lumbar regions.

Conclusion

Despite longstanding use and important consequences, degenerative disc disease represents an underdeveloped concept, with greatly varying, disparate definitions documented. Such inconsistencies challenge clear, accurate communication in medicine and science, create confusion and misconceptions among clinicians, patients and others, and hinder the advancement of related knowledge.

Results

Patients

From May 2016 to June 2017, 118 patients suffered from CDH or LDH were selected from the pain department of our hospital. Figure 3 gives a graphical overview of the follow-up of the enrolled patients. This study included 55 patients with cervical disc herniation (CDH group) and 63 patients with lumbar disc herniation (LDH group). There was no significant difference of gender, age and preoperative VAS scores between two groups. The most common segments for cervical disc herniation were C4/5 (5.45%), C5/6 (52.73%) and C6/7 (41.82%), whereas the most common segments for lumbar disc herniation were L3/4 (6.35%), L4/5 (50.79%) and L5/S1 (42.86%). After CN, six patients (10.91%) in CDH group and 11 patients (17.46%) in LDH group suffered second decompression surgery during 5-years follow-up (Figure 3). The occurrence of re-surgery was lower in the CDH group. The detail information of patients was summarized in Table 1.

### Natural history… [^112xvf5j]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy leads to neck and radiating arm pain or numbness in the distribution of a specific nerve root. Often, this radicular pain is accompanied by motor or sensory disturbances. Although the causes of radiculopathy are varied, they all lead to compression and irritation of an exiting cervical nerve root. Natural History Most patients with cervical radiculopathy have a favorable prognosis. 1, 6 A large epidemiologic study demonstrated that over a five-year follow-up period, 31. 7 percent of patients with symptomatic cervical radiculopathy had symptom recurrence and 26 percent needed surgical intervention for intractable pain, sensory deficit, or objective weakness. 1 At final follow-up, however, nearly 90 percent of patients were asymptomatic or only mildly incapacitated by the pain.

Nonoperative Management Strategies In most patients with cervical radiculopathy, nonoperativetreatment is effective. In a one-year cohort study of 26 patients with documented herniated nucleus pulposus and symptomatic radiculopathy, a focused, non-operative treatment program was successful in 92 percent of patients. 7 Little high-quality evidence supports the use of an individual nonoperative treatment; however, a multimodal approach may alleviate symptoms. When approaching the nonoperative management of neck and radicular pain, it is important to distinguish the acuity of the process. Pain emanating from nerve compression by a soft disk herniation typically has a more acute presentation, with or without radiating extremity symptoms. Chronic, bilateral axial neck and radiating arm pain is usually caused by cervical spondylosis and may emanate from a variety of sources, including the degenerative disk or the facet joints.

22 Complications associated with cervical injections are rare. One study of a series of more than 1, 000 blocks showed a minor complication rate of 1. 66 percent and a major adverse events rate of less than 1 percent. 23 However, patients should be advised that these rare events may be severe. A recent review of the literature suggests that epidural corticosteroids may lead to short-term, symptomatic improvement of radicular symptoms.
24. Referral Approximately one third of patients with cervical radiculopathy who are treated nonoperatively have persistent symptoms.
