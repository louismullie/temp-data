## Question

treatment for small lipoma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for a small lipoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "small" and the baseline natural history of lipomas. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and when imaging is warranted. Next, I will consider the default management strategy for asymptomatic small lesions. After that, I need to outline indications for intervention, followed by a comparison of treatment options with attention to size, location, and patient goals. Finally, I should address special anatomic scenarios, recurrence risk, and synthesize a practical decision algorithm with follow-up recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and natural history so I don't over-treat a benign entity. Small lipomas are generally under 2 cm, slow-growing, and composed of mature adipocytes; they are benign, rarely symptomatic, and have minimal malignant potential, with transformation to liposarcoma being exceedingly rare, especially in small lesions, so I should not jump to aggressive therapy without a compelling reason [^117KHziP] [^notfound] [^116gWT3L].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic workup before discussing treatment. For a typical subcutaneous lesion under 5 cm, ultrasound is the first-line modality to confirm a fatty mass and distinguish it from cysts, vascular malformations, or solid tumors; MRI is reserved for deep, large, or atypical lesions where malignancy is a concern, and I should remember that imaging features of pure fat with thin septa favor a benign lipoma, whereas thick, irregular septa or nonadipose areas raise concern for atypical lipomatous tumor or liposarcoma and warrant referral to a sarcoma center [^115yFbPr] [^115cryLU] [^115QHLT9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about intervention. The default for small, asymptomatic lipomas is observation with reassurance; I should confirm stability over time and counsel that most do not require treatment unless they cause pain, cosmetic distress, functional limitation, or show concerning growth, which aligns with both surgical and dermatologic guidance for benign soft-tissue tumors [^113WFUz1] [^113okHVD].

> I will now examine when to intervene, and I need to ensure I'm aligning with consensus. Indications include symptoms such as tenderness, paresthesias, or nerve compression, cosmetic concerns in visible areas, functional impairment from location or size, and rapid growth or change that raises diagnostic uncertainty; importantly, European sarcoma centers show only modest consensus for resection of small, symptomatic, growing lesions, reinforcing that observation remains reasonable in many cases [^113WFUz1] [^116fTeiA].

> Next, I should review treatment options and match them to lesion size and location. For small subcutaneous lipomas, minimal incision extraction (the "squeeze" technique) is favored in many outpatient settings because it is quick, leaves a tiny scar, and provides tissue for histopathology; elliptical excision remains appropriate for larger or fibrous lesions; liposuction can debulk larger masses but risks incomplete removal and lacks a specimen; and injection lipolysis with deoxycholic acid is an off-label, office-based option for small, cosmetically sensitive areas, though I should confirm diagnosis and counsel on variable efficacy and potential contour irregularity [^117DsVDK] [^113j4zuY] [^116gWT3L] [^117KHziP] [^111sUuUU].

> But wait, what if the lipoma is in a special location where standard rules don't fully apply. In the gastrointestinal tract, small colonic or ileal lipomas under 2 cm are typically observed; larger or symptomatic lesions may require endoscopic resection using techniques like endoloop-assisted polypectomy or endoscopic submucosal dissection, balancing perforation risk against symptom relief; in the heart, even small cardiac lipomas are often resected due to potential arrhythmias or obstruction; and in the breast, small lipomas are usually excised when symptomatic or to confirm diagnosis, with oncoplastic techniques considered after large resections [^112hbzuY] [^111GTgYc] [^113Ffu9n] [^115Fg3Wb].

> I should double-check recurrence risk and how it influences technique selection. Recurrence after excision is uncommon, generally under 5%, and is usually due to incomplete removal; minimal incision extraction can be curative for small lesions, whereas liposuction without capsule removal carries a higher theoretical recurrence risk; if a lesion recurs or was incompletely excised, I need to reconsider the diagnosis and consider imaging or referral to exclude atypical lipomatous tumor or liposarcoma [^11665UiH] [^116gWT3L] [^1176Sdqw].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway and verify it aligns with evidence. If the lesion is under 2 cm, asymptomatic, and classic on exam or ultrasound, observation with patient education is appropriate; if symptomatic, cosmetically bothersome, or growing, discuss options including minimal incision extraction, standard excision, or injection lipolysis, tailoring to size, location, and patient preference; if the lesion is deep, larger than 5 cm, or has atypical imaging features, obtain MRI and consider referral to a sarcoma center before intervention to avoid inappropriate excision of a liposarcoma mimic [^113WFUz1] [^115yFbPr] [^115QHLT9].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and counseling are explicit. For observed small lipomas, periodic clinical review with photo documentation is reasonable; after excision, routine wound care and a brief check-in suffice given low recurrence; and I should advise patients to report rapid enlargement, new pain, skin changes, or functional symptoms promptly so we can reassess for atypia or alternative diagnoses [^11665UiH] [^113okHVD].

---

For small lipomas (< 2 cm), **observation is appropriate** because they are benign and rarely cause symptoms [^113ruqAp]. If treatment is desired for cosmetic reasons or mild symptoms, **minimal-incision excision** is preferred for its low recurrence, small scar, and high satisfaction [^111RmEwo]. Alternatives such as liposuction, steroid injections, or laser/microwave ablation may be considered for select cases but have higher recurrence or limited evidence [^116gWT3L] [^113j4zuY] [^114HDUMG]. Reserve excision for symptomatic, growing, or cosmetically bothersome lesions, and use ultrasound to confirm diagnosis and guide management [^115yFbPr].

---

## Indications for treatment

Although small lipomas are typically asymptomatic, **indications for treatment** include:

- **Cosmetic concerns**: Visible lesions causing psychological distress or aesthetic dissatisfaction.
- **Mild symptoms**: Discomfort, tenderness, or functional impairment due to location.
- **Patient preference**: Desire for removal despite minimal symptoms.

---

## Treatment options

Several **treatment options** are available for small lipomas, each with distinct advantages and limitations:

| **Treatment modality** | **Description** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Observation | Monitoring without intervention | - Non-invasive <br/> - No scarring <br/> - No recurrence | - Persistent cosmetic concern <br/> - Potential growth |
| Minimal-incision excision | Small incision with extraction | - Minimal scarring <br/> - Low recurrence <br/> - High satisfaction | - Minor surgical risk <br/> - Local anesthesia required |
| Liposuction | Suction removal via small incision | - Minimal scarring <br/> - Effective for larger lipomas | - Higher recurrence <br/> - Limited tissue for pathology |
| Steroid injections | Intralesional corticosteroids | - Non-surgical <br/> - Minimal scarring | - Variable efficacy <br/> - Potential atrophy |
| Laser/microwave ablation | Minimally invasive energy-based removal | - Minimal scarring <br/> - Rapid recovery | - Limited evidence <br/> - Recurrence risk |

---

Minimal-incision excision is **preferred** for small lipomas because it balances efficacy, minimal scarring, and low recurrence [^117DsVDK].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

Accurate diagnosis is essential to exclude malignancy and guide treatment. Ultrasound is the **first-line imaging** modality for small, superficial lipomas, helping differentiate them from other soft-tissue lesions [^115yFbPr]. MRI is reserved for atypical or deep lesions to confirm the diagnosis and assess extent [^115QHLT9].

---

## Recurrence rates and complications

Recurrence is uncommon after complete excision, typically **< 5%**. Incomplete removal or alternative techniques (e.g. liposuction) may increase recurrence risk [^11665UiH]. Complications are rare and include minor infection, hematoma, or transient sensory changes.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment choice should be **individualized**, considering age, comorbidities, cosmetic concerns, and preferences. Younger patients may prioritize minimal scarring, whereas older patients may prefer simple excision.

---

## Post-treatment care and follow-up

Post-treatment care is straightforward: keep wounds clean and dry, and remove sutures in 7–14 days. Follow-up is generally unnecessary unless recurrence or complications occur.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Observation is appropriate for asymptomatic small lipomas. Minimal-incision excision is **preferred** when treatment is desired for its low recurrence, minimal scarring, and high patient satisfaction. Alternative modalities (liposuction, steroid injections, laser/microwave ablation) may be considered in select cases but have higher recurrence or limited evidence.

Conclusion

Cardiac lipoma is a benign primary tumor of the heart. Nonetheless, it may present with clinical symptoms varying from mild discomfort to syncope. Overgrowth of lipoma and infiltration into the myocardium may indicate a more severe clinical presentation and unfavorable outcome. Accurate diagnosis and comprehensive evaluation of cardiac lipoma is highly dependent on multimodality imaging methods. Radical resection of the lipoma is the optimal method of treatment in symptomatic patients. Conservative management may be implemented for asymptomatic cardiac lipomas and prophylactic resection should also be considered.

Discussion

What makes this case interesting is the fact that even a benign pathology such as a lipoma progressed into a situation requiring delicate surgical management, both due to the technical aspect of the operation itself, and because of the patient's advanced age.

With no difference in prevalence across genders and a 40–60 years old average age, lipomas are the most frequent benign soft-tissue tumours. Whether isolated or multiple, congenital or post-traumatic, lipomas are frequent in our daily routine; some studies mention the genetic implication in more than 50% of them. Even with minimal risk of malignant evolution, the first step of imaging should be ultrasonography, sometimes associated with MRI for large or deep tumours. Various treatments can be suggested for mechanical or aesthetic concerns. Surgery is the most appropriate treatment, associated with other techniques(suction, soft-tissue reconstruction, flap and so on).

Various pathologies imitating lipomas, such as lipomatosis or lipodystrophy, should be distinguished from it. The WHO gives a standard classification for all types of lipomas.

Giant lipomas are a specific entity as their precise definition is only based on the general aspect of the tumour, with a specific size and weight cut-off given by Sanchez et al. In order for a lipoma to be called 'giant', the lesion must be at least 10 cm in one dimension or weigh a minimum of 1 kg. Based on recent literature, the case we report here is the second largest sub-cutaneous lipoma ever described (table 1).

Learning points

Giant lipomas are above all aesthetics concerns but in advanced form a functional problem.
Benign tumours with low risk of malignant evolution.
Surgery as if aesthetic or functional disorders.
The transformation of a large lipoma (> 10 cm) to a liposarcoma is rare.

### Report of a giant invasive, wall-penetrating cardiac lipoma [^113gdJ6d]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Pathologically, cardiac lipomas are benign tumors, yet they may occasionally manifest clinical signs suggestive of malignancy, including significant arrhythmias, valvular stenosis, intracardiac blockages, cardiac compression, and peripheral vascular embolism. Currently, there are no unified treatment guidelines based on extensive clinical cohort studies or randomized controlled trials. In clinical practice, physicians typically advise periodic monitoring for patients with small, asymptomatic cardiac lipomas. Conversely, tumors exhibiting pronounced symptoms, increased size, or hemodynamic alterations require surgical interventions. While surgical excision may alleviate symptoms caused by the compression of surrounding structures, and the risk of sudden death from ventricular arrhythmias may still exist. Our case underscores the clinical diversity of cardiac lipoma presentations, highlighting the importance of early disease recognition, diagnosis, treatment and long-term patient follow-up.

### A novel approach for treating lipomas: percutaneous microwave ablation combined with liposuction [^114HDUMG]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Lipomas, benign adipose tissue tumors, are a common occurrence but currently, the options for their treatment are limited, with surgical excision being the most frequently used management pathway. This scenario can often lead to unsatisfactory cosmetic results and significant patient discomfort. This paper introduces a novel technique, percutaneous microwave ablation with liposuction, to address these challenges. The innovative procedure aims to enhance patient satisfaction, minimize post-operative discomfort, and improve aesthetic outcomes. The technique involves two key steps: (1) the application of percutaneous microwave ablation to selectively disrupt the lipoma cells, followed by (2) a targeted liposuction procedure to remove the ablated lipoma tissue. Our approach optimizes the removal of the lipoma and preserves the surrounding healthy tissue, reducing the risk of local recurrence and improving the cosmetic result. The use of preoperative ultrasound imaging allows for precise localization and delineation of the lipoma, aiding in the planning and execution of the procedure. This novel approach to lipoma treatment is reliable, associated with minimal morbidity, and consistently yields effective results. Additionally, it provides a new perspective on lipoma management, potentially changing the paradigm of current treatment approaches.

### The general surgeon's quandary: atypical lipomatous tumor vs lipoma, who needs a surgical oncologist? [^115Xa3nU]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Differentiating large lipomas from atypical lipomatous tumors (ALT) is challenging, and preoperative management guidelines are not well defined. The diagnostic ambiguity leads many surgeons to refer all patients with large lipomatous masses to an oncologic specialist, perhaps unnecessarily.

Study Design

In this retrospective cohort study of patients with nonretroperitoneal lipomatous tumors, preoperative characteristics discernible without invasive diagnostic procedures were evaluated for diagnostic predictive value.

Results

We identified 319 patients (256 with lipomas, 63 with ALTs) treated between 1994 and 2012. Patients with ALTs were older (60.5 vs 53.5 years, p < 0.0001), had larger tumors (16.0 vs 8.3 cm, p < 0.0001), had tumors more often located on an extremity (88.9% vs 60.5% torso, p < 0.0001), and more frequently had a history of previous operations at the same site, exclusive of excision leading to diagnosis and referral (20.6% vs 5.9%, p = 0.001). Local recurrence was observed in 2 patients with lipomas (0.8%) vs 14 with ALTs (22.6%, p < 0.0001). No patients with ALTs developed distant metastases or disease-specific mortality, with a median follow-up of 27.4 months (range 0 to 164.6 months). On multivariate analysis, age ≥ 55 years, tumor size ≥ 10 cm, extremity location, and history of previous resections were predictors for diagnosis of ALT (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Characteristics of lipomatous masses associated with a diagnosis of ALT include patient age ≥ 55 years, tumor size ≥ 10 cm, previous resection, and extremity location (vs torso). These easily identifiable traits may guide surgical management or referral to a specialist.

### Endoscopic resection of a giant broad-based gastric lipoma in an adolescent: a case report and literature review [^115jzzmy]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastric lipomas are rare benign tumors, accounting for less than 1% of all gastric neoplasms. They are typically slow-growing and more common in adults, with large lipomas (> 4 cm) being exceptionally rare. Most small gastric lipomas are asymptomatic and managed conservatively. However, larger lesions may cause complications such as abdominal pain, luminal obstruction, gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, gastric outlet obstruction with vomiting, or even rare intussusception, necessitating intervention. The management of large gastric lipomas remains challenging due to the lack of standardized guidelines. This decision often depends on factors such as tumor size, location, and morphology, as well as the patient's clinical status. Traditional management relies on surgical resection, though endoscopic resection has emerged as a minimally invasive alternative in adults. However, endoscopic management in pediatric and adolescent patients remains undocumented, with no prior reports of technical success in this demographic. Here, we report the first case of endoscopic treatment for a giant, broad-based gastric lipoma (> 8 cm) in an adolescent and discusses its feasibility in conjunction with the literature.

### Successful removal of the largest reported intrathoracic lipoma with bilateral extension: a case report [^113bFVDj]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lipomas are the most prevalent benign mesenchymal tumors, while intrathoracic lipoma is a rare entity. On the other hand, giant lipoma involving both hemithorax is far more unusual, with only a few occurrences documented in the literature. Lipomas in the intrathoracic region often go unnoticed, especially if they are small. Despite the fact that a giant lipoma in the chest cavity might cause symptoms, it is frequently identified during a routine medical evaluation.

Surgical removal is still the primary line treatment for intrathoracic tumors with a good outcome. However, managing massive lipoma that involves both chest cavities is usually challenging, when considering the approach.

Here, we present our experience of surgical management of a case of a 46-year-old male with huge intrathoracic lipoma that extends bilaterally, displacing the lung upwards. To our knowledge, this is the largest reported intrathoracic lipoma with the bilateral extension, which was removed successfully through standard median sternotomy.

### Successful endoscopic management of adult ileocecal intussusception secondary to a large ileal lipoma [^111XzDun]. VideoGIE (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Adult intussusception accounts for only 1% to 5% of all bowel obstruction, and 75% to 80% are located in the small intestine. In general, a radiologically homogeneous low-density mass can be diagnosed as a lipoma. Although surgical resection has been the most common approach to treat intussusception, reports regarding endoscopic reduction and resection have increased over the last 2 decades. As a result, several endoscopic methods to remove lipomas have been developed, including standard polypectomy, endoloop polypectomy, endoscopic unroofing, endoscopic mucosal resection, and endoscopic submucosal dissection. To date, there is no consensus on treatment methods, and whether to complete resection is necessary remains controversial. However, given that resection of colonic lipomas 2 cm or larger is associated with a higher risk of perforation and bleeding, it is important to consider the risk and benefit for each patient. Our case demonstrates that it is feasible to reduce an intussusception and resect the responsible lesion endoscopically. Although the lesion was located in the ileum, where care should be taken to avoid perforation, it is important to select a monopolar snare instead of a bipolar snare when a lipoma is suspected. Short-term follow-up suggested that an incomplete resection is acceptable, especially among elderly patients. Endoscopic treatment is less invasive, and long-term adverse events related to surgical treatment can be avoided.

### Lipomas treated with subcutaneous deoxycholate injections [^117KHziP]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Lipomas are benign neoplasms of mature fat cells. Current treatments are invasive and carry the risk of scarring. Injections of phosphatidylcholine solubilized with deoxycholate, a bile salt, have been used to reduce unwanted accumulations of fat. Recent in vitro and ex vivo investigations indicate that deoxycholate alone causes adipocyte lysis.

Objective

We sought to report our experience treating lipomas using subcutaneous deoxycholate injections.

Methods

A total of 6 patients presenting with 12 lipomas were treated with intralesional injections of sodium deoxycholate (1.0%, 2.5%, and 5.0%) at intervals of 2 to 20 weeks. Tumor size, cutaneous reactions, and patients' subjective responses were recorded before and after treatment.

Results

All lipomas decreased in size (mean area reduction, 75%; range, 37%-100%) as determined by clinical measurement (with ultrasound confirmation in one lipoma) after an average of 2.2 treatments. Several lipomas fragmented or became softer in addition to decreasing in volume. Adverse effects, including transient burning, erythema, and local swelling, were associated with higher deoxycholate concentrations but resolved without intervention. There was no clear association between deoxycholate concentration and efficacy.

Conclusions

Our clinical experience supports our laboratory investigations demonstrating that deoxycholate, rather than phosphatidylcholine, is the active ingredient in subcutaneously injected formulas used to treat adipose tissue. This small series suggests that low concentration deoxycholate may be a relatively safe and effective treatment for small collections of fat. However, controlled clinical trials will be necessary to substantiate these observations.

### Novel method of minimally invasive removal of large lipoma after laser lipolysis with 980 nm diode laser [^111fhSub]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Lipomas are the most common benign tumor of the soft tissue, often presenting as soft, mobile subcutaneous masses. These lesions are often removed for cosmetic reasons, although they may be removed secondary to considerable discomfort or paresthesias. The large majority of lipomas appear as small, solitary lesions that are best removed by surgical excision. However, surgical removal of large (> 10 cm) or multiple lesions may result in significant scarring. Tumescent local anesthesia and liposuction of larger lesions has been successful in a number of cases although this technique can be hindered by overly fibrous lesions. Laser lipolysis, performed alone or before liposuction, can further facilitate removal of these lesions. This technique is a minimally invasive and effective method of lipoma removal, resulting in an excellent cosmetic outcome. This report describes step-by-step removal of a large lipoma located on the back, as well as a review of currently employed techniques for minimally invasive treatment of lipomas.

### From pathogenesis to treatment, a systemic review of cardiac lipoma [^116TkQfz]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

There is no guideline on the treatment of cardiac lipoma. Since the first successful removal of a pericardial lipoma reported in 1952, more and more symptomatic cardiac lipomas have been resected, especially after the introduction of the cardiopulmonary bypass technique into cardiac surgery. Radical resection was adopted to relieve symptoms caused by cardiac lipomas in most patients. Among the included reports, most symptomatic patients (83.7%, 123/147) underwent resection of cardiac lipomas. Although conservative management may be implemented in patients without symptoms related to cardiac lipoma, 56 patients with (68.3%, 56/82) asymptomatic cardiac lipomas also received prophylactic resection. Recurrence of cardiac lipomas after surgical resection is extremely rare but has been reported in few cases. In such cases, incomplete removal due to diffuse infiltration in the myocardium seems to be the contributing factor. Resection of the recurrent lipoma was extremely challenging and heart transplantation may provide the ultimate solution. Over all, radical resection should be considered in all patients with cardiac lipoma, as asymptomatic lipomas may undergo overgrowth and infiltration into the myocardium, and this may result in unfavorable outcomes upon resection. Additionally, close follow-up with imaging methods should be provided toall patients to monitor lipoma overgrowth or recurrence.

### A novel approach for treating lipomas: percutaneous microwave ablation combined with liposuction [^1138NUzY]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our technique presents a promising alternative to traditional surgical excision of lipomas, offering advantages in terms of invasiveness, recovery time, cosmetic outcomes, and patient satisfaction. As the medical community continues to embrace minimally invasive procedures, it is paramount that we evaluate not only the clinical efficacy but also the broader impacts on patient quality of life and healthcare economics. Our findings contribute to this evolving narrative, suggesting that percutaneous microwave ablation combined with liposuction could become a new standard for lipoma treatment in the near future.

To determine the optimal parameters for percutaneous microwave ablation combined with liposuction, large-scale controlled studies are still needed. Such studies could involve a larger number of patients and compare the treatment group with a control group, further evaluating the efficacy and advantages of this treatment method, and providing more scientific support for clinical practice.

### Radiation therapy for treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in adults: executive summary of an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^112s6Q9K]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Atypical lipomatous tumors — initial management without RT is supported for specific locations. Atypical lipomatous tumors are synonymous with well-differentiated liposarcomas, and when these tumors are located in the extremities or trunk, they rarely dedifferentiate and virtually never metastasize, and therefore initial treatment with surgery alone is considered appropriate for atypical lipomatous tumors, even in the setting of positive margins.

### A colonic submucosal lipoma presenting with recurrent intestinal obstruction attacks [^114YS2q4]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Colonic submucosal lipomas are rare benign tumours of the colon, which may be discovered incidentally at colonoscopy, through imaging such as CT or at autopsy. These tumours can cause complications such as bleeding, intussusception and bowel obstruction. We describe the case of a patient in whom a small submucosal lipoma was identified at the time of colonoscopy and who did not receive follow-up treatment. The patient presented 1 year later with intussusception and obstruction resulting from this polyp and required urgent surgery. With the increasing use of colonoscopy and CT, such lesions are likely to be discovered more often. As complications can ensue, guidelines should be developed to advise on the management of such polyps in order to prevent consequent complications.

### The clinical evaluation of soft tissue tumors [^113gLFdy]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Soft tissue tumors range from benign subcutaneous lipomas to malignant deep high-grade sarcomas. Patients are evaluated with a thorough history and physical examination followed by imaging studies. Magnetic resonance imaging is the modality of choice, although radiographs, computed tomography, and other modalities may be of value. Open or closed biopsy can be performed to establish a diagnosis. Treatment depends on the diagnosis and includes observation or marginal excision for benign lesions and wide resection for malignant masses, with radiation therapy or chemotherapy for large, high-grade tumors. An algorithm for the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of soft tissue tumors is presented.

### Endoscopic submucosal dissection of a huge lipoma of ileum assisted with in-vivo traction [^114b9kYN]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
a Colonoscopy revealed a giant mass obstructing the small bowel lumen. b A clip with one elastic ring was inserted into the lumen through the biopsy channel of the scope and fixed onto the lipoma. c The root of the lipoma was shaped into a triangular configuration. d A C-shaped mucosal incision was made using a DualKnife. e The size of the tumor was determined to be 5.0 cm by 6.0 cm.

The lipoma of the ileum can cause intestinal intussusception. Large-sized lipomas may have malignant potential or be difficult to distinguish from other malignant tumors. Surgical resection, including laparoscopic surgery, is a common treatment for lipomas of the small bowel. Small bowel tumors present a higher degree of complexity for endoscopic resection, and surgical treatment is sometimes required in cases of incomplete resection or major adverse events (mAEs). However, advances in small bowel evaluation and therapeutic endoscopy will increase detection and resection rates of small bowel tumors, reducing the need for surgical intervention in often complicated clinical scenarios. We successfully performed ESD of the lipoma of the ileum with in-vivo traction assistance. Our study provides a novel technique for the treatment of small bowel lesions.

MEN1 cutaneous lesions — nonsurgical management is noted: Management of lipomas is conservative, and when surgically removed for cosmetic reasons, they typically do not recur. Treatment of facial angiofibromas and collagenomas is usually not required but may include surgical excision and other therapies, and lipomas are the most common nonendocrine MEN1-associated cutaneous tumors and many cases do not require surgery.

### A novel approach for treating lipomas: percutaneous microwave ablation combined with liposuction [^114tYtYk]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Lipomas are benign soft tissue tumors composed of mature adipocytes and are among the most common mesenchymal tumors. However, for lipomas located in areas such as the head and neck that cannot be covered by clothing, exploring alternative approaches to traditional surgical excision becomes crucial. Initially, liposuction was proposed as an alternative to conventional surgery. This method has been proven effective in removing lipomas with a diameter exceeding 4 centimeters, as well as adjacent multiple lipomas. The liposuction technique requires only one incision site, significantly reducing the number of postoperative scars. However, the efficacy of this method in removing small lipomas is limited, leading to its limited application.

Another study on non-invasive removal of lipomas involved the use of lipostabil, which is based on phosphatidylcholine. However, injecting excessive doses of the lipolytic agent into poorly perfused or scarred tissues, or injecting it at incorrect anatomical levels, can potentially lead to serious adverse reactions, such as hematoma, muscle damage, nerve injury, skin ulceration, necrosis, or blistering.

The ablation has been widely applied in the treatment of benign nodules in the thyroid, liver, and lungs. In 2018, Ji Yeon Hong successfully demonstrated the reduction of facial lipomas using radiofrequency ablation. However, tissue aspiration was not performed after ablation, which strictly speaking, carries a significant risk of recurrence. In the context of our study on lipoma surgery, the strategic modulation of microwave emission — both in terms of power and duration — according to the specific dimensions and positioning of the tumor is paramount. This ensures effective ablation outcomes with minimal impact on adjacent healthy tissues. Additionally, the adoption of pulsed rather than continuous microwave emission significantly reduces the thermal load on surrounding tissues. This approach effectively decreases the risk of thermal damage to sensitive areas. Moreover, whenever feasible, we strongly recommend the intraoperative employment of nerve monitoring technologies. These devices enable the real-time identification and preservation of vital neural structures in the vicinity of the lipoma, adding an extra layer of safety to the ablation process. Collectively, these carefully considered measures bolster the precision and safety of MWA, striking a delicate balance between achieving therapeutic efficacy and preserving critical anatomical features.

### The largest reported intrathoracic lipoma: a case report and current perspectives review [^116GuhVg]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The tumor was symptomatic and relatively huge when detected during a medical checkup. This enabled the successful tumor resection of via conventional thoracotomy surgery. Although intrathoracic lipomas are histologically benign, careful observation and follow-up are crucial due to the possibility of recurrence.

### Noninvasive lipoma size reduction using high-intensity focused ultrasound [^1119vtP6]. Dermatologic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Lipomas are common benign mesenchymal tumors commonly removed using excision, but in certain cases, surgery is undesirable or ineffective. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) offers a noninvasive tumor ablation tool increasingly used in the clinic.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a noninvasive lipoma size reduction technology using HIFU.

Materials & Methods

Twelve lipomas in nine patients were treated. Patients underwent four treatment sessions with a 3-week interval between treatments. Blood and urine tests and tolerability based on a standard visual analogue scale (VAS) were used to monitor patients for adverse effects. Lipoma volume was determined by measuring width and length (manually) and depth (ultrasonically).

Results

The range of lipoma size was 2.7–169.4 cm3 before treatment and 0.2–119.8 cm3 after treatment. Mean volume reduction was 58.1 ± 22.8%. When palpated, the lipomas felt much softer than before treatment. The average VAS score was 4.1 ± 2.4. No significant adverse effects were noted.

Conclusion

The treatment was shown to be effective in noninvasively reducing lipoma size. The average volume reduction was substantial and statistically significant. The treatment was safe and well-tolerated. HIFU may be an alternative treatment modality in cases of lipoma.

### Surgical management of lipomas: proposal of the Z-incision design and surgical algorithm based on tumor size [^116xKDTp]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for lipomas. However, linear incision methods or minimal extraction techniques often do not provide a sufficient surgical view. Therefore, removing large lipomas is often difficult. To present the Z-incision and half Z-incision designs for lipoma extraction, this retrospective study analyzed lipomas surgically excised at our institution between September 2015 and December 2018. The area of surgical field exposed by the Z-incision versus that exposed by the linear incision was calculated using a schematic model. Cure rate, complications, and surgical field area were investigated. A total of 84 lipomas were included. A Z- or half Z-incision was used to treat 30 lipomas, while a linear incision was used to treat 54 lipomas. The mean diameter of the mass in the Z- or half Z-incision group was 47.7mm (range, 15–160mm), larger than that in the linear incision group (25.5mm; range, 7–59mm) (p < .001). The Z-incision involved making rectangular windows by lifting 2 triangular flaps. According to our mathematical model, the Z-incision provided a larger surgical field area than that provided by the linear incision based on stretched angles (1.81 times larger at 30° and 3.14 times larger at 15°). The Z- and half Z-incisions were successfully performed in all but 1 lipoma (29 lipomas, 96.7%). There was 1 lipoma that resulted in postoperative complications (seroma, 3.3%). The Z-incision design can be a useful alternative technique for the extirpation of lipomas, especially large lipomas. Here, we proposed a surgical algorithm for lipoma surgery based on tumor size.

### Surgical management of complex spinal cord lipomas: how, why, and when to operate. A review [^112FCEQx]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

This review summarizes the classification, anatomy, and embryogenesis of complex spinal cord lipomas, and it describes in some detail the new technique of total lipoma resection and radical reconstruction of the affected neural placode. Its specific mission is to tackle two main issues surrounding the management of complex dysraphic lipomas: whether total resection confers better long-term benefits than partial resection and whether total resection fares better than conservative treatment-i.e., no surgery-for asymptomatic lipomas. Accordingly, the 24-year progression-free survival data of the author and colleagues' series of over 300 cases of total resection are compared with historical data from multiple series (including the author and colleagues' own) of partial resection, and total resection data specifically for asymptomatic lesions are compared with the two known series of nonsurgical treatment of equivalent numbers of patients. These comparisons amply support the author's recommendation of total resection for most complex lipomas, with or without symptoms. The notable exception is the asymptomatic chaotic lipoma, whose peculiar anatomical relationship with the neural tissue defies even this aggressive surgical approach and consequently projects worse results (admittedly of a small number of cases) than for the other two lipoma subtypes of dorsal and transitional lesions. Prophylactic resection of asymptomatic chaotic lipomas is therefore not currently endorsed.

### Minimal-scar segmental extraction of lipomas: study of 122 consecutive procedures [^111RmEwo]. Dermatologic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical extirpation of lipomas that occur in cosmetically conspicuous areas of the body leaves a visible scar that is usually disfiguring. Minimal-scar segmental extraction (MSE) employs a much smaller incision and extraction and is particularly useful in exposed parts of the body. It can be easily performed in an office setting.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the merits of MSE in clinical practice. Unlike other reports in the literature that describe, anecdotally, minimally invasive methods of lipoma removal, our study examined a new method by carefully measuring the results in a larger group of consecutive patients treated using this technique.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective study was performed using data from 91 consecutive patients with a total of 122 lipomas that were treated using MSE. MSE of lipomas consists of a small stab incision and blind dissection of the tumor followed by its extraction in a segmental fashion. This procedure involves small instrumentation, minimal dissection with preservation of contour, and complete removal of the lipoma, including substantial portions of the capsule. Clinical data, including complications, outcomes, and recurrence rates, were recorded.

Results

The procedure was well tolerated by patients, who were pleased with the results, particularly the small scar. The incidence of complications was 1.6% (n = 2) and consisted of hematoma (n = 1) and seroma (n = 1). The recurrence rate was 0.8% (n = 1). No long-term morbidity was noted.

Conclusions

The technical ease with which the MSE can be performed, coupled with a low recurrence rate, makes it a very cost-effective operation. The smaller postoperative scars, rapid healing, and low morbidity allow for better patient acceptance. We recognize the advantages and limitations of this procedure and encourage its use in selected patients.

### From pathogenesis to treatment, a systemic review of cardiac lipoma [^112RYPqA]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Clinical manifestations of 255 patients with cardiac lipomas

Cardiac lipomas at different sites may cause clinical presentation by different pathways. For lipomas within cardiac cavities, obstruction of blood flow may cause symptoms varying from fatigue to even syncope. Large pericardial lipomas can be symptomatic by compressing cardiac chambers, vessels or coronary arteries. Myocaridal lipomas are prone to cause conduction abnormalities by compression or infiltration of the conduction system. The size of the cardiac lipoma varied with distribution. In general, pericardial lipomas may grow extensively within the pericardial sac and shared larger size (median, 10.0 cm) than intracavitary (3.5 cm) and myocardial lipomas (4.0 cm). Their size is also closely related to the clinical presentation. Median size of symptomatic lipomas is much larger than those found incidentally (6.1 cm vs 3.0 cm) (Fig. 4). However, small lipomas at special sites such as cardiac valves may also cause severe symptoms.

Fig. 4
Comparison of size between intracardiac, intramyocardial and intrapericardial lipomas

Diagnosis

Historically, cardiac lipomas were incidental findings during autopsy and cardiothoracic surgery. Noninvasive detection of cardiac masses including lipomas in vivo was not possible until the clinical application of X-ray imaging methods. Lipomas within cardiac cavities may be detected as intracavitary filling defects in cardioangiography, while lipomas within pericardial space may show nonspecific signs of an enlarged heart on chest radiograph resembling pericardial effusion. Application of echocardiography made the detection of cardiac masses including lipoma a big step forward. Echocardiography has incomparable advantages of ready availability, convenient operation and radiation-free and it remains the preferred screening method for cardiac masses. Cardiac lipomas usually present as homogenous hyperechoic masses within cardiac chambers or hypoechoic masses within the pericardium. Although most cardiac lipomas can be sensitively detected and accurately located by echocardiography, their nature cannot be determined based on acoustic property. Acoustic characteristics of lipomas may help exclude cardiac malignancies, and differentiation with other benign lesions such as myxoma is difficult.

### Esophageal lipoma: a rare tumor [^116RcDVU]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Esophageal lipomas are rare tumors, making up 0.4% of all digestive tract benign neoplasms. Most of these lesions are clinically silent as a result of their small size, however, the majority of lesions over 4 cm have been reported to cause dysphagia, regurgitation and/or epigastralgia. We report a case of a 53 year-old African American female who presented with dysphagia. Computed tomography of the chest and esophagram confirmed esophageal lipoma as the cause of the patient's symptoms. Accurately diagnosing an esophageal lipoma is crucial in order to rule out potential malignant lesions, relieve patient symptoms and plan the appropriate treatment.

### Safe endoscopic treatment of large colonic lipomas using endoscopic looping technique [^113YrY7g]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Colonic lipomas are benign, submucosal tumours that are usually asymptomatic. Typically, they are incidentally diagnosed during colonoscopy. Due to a low prevalence, the natural history of lipomas remains largely unknown. While large (> 2 cm) lesions can cause symptoms and complications, their endoscopic treatment is not routinely recommended because of prior reports of a high rate of perforation.

Methods

We used a standardized technique of polypectomy, using endoscopic looping to resect large colonic lipomas in 8 patients and followed their clinical outcomes.

Results

The mean lipoma size was 3.8 ± 1.2 cm (range 2.5–6 cm). No patient developed bleeding or perforation. On follow-up (mean = 13.5 months, range 2–29), there was one small residual lesion.

Conclusion

Colonic lipomas larger than 2 cm can be safely and efficaciously removed using endoloop assisted polypectomy technique.

### Rapidly enlarging lipoma [^113ruqAp]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Lipoma is a common subcutaneous tumour composed of fat tissue. It may occur as a sporadic solitary lesion or as multiple lesions. They often grow very slowly. They vary between 2 and 10cm in size. There are rarely any subjective symptoms. Lipomas do not usually require treatment unless they are big enough to be symptomatic. We reported a 75-year-old man with a rapidly enlarging and ulcerated mass on his right upper thigh.

### Intralesional deoxycholic acid: a potential therapeutic alternative for the treatment of lipomas arising in the face [^111sUuUU]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lipomas are common benign tumors of mature fat cells. Although most lipomas are asymptomatic, patients often seek their removal for cosmetic reasons. The current treatment modalities, including surgical excision and liposuction, are highly effective but have a high risk of scarring. When occurring in cosmetically sensitive areas such as the face, noninvasive treatment modalities should be considered to minimize the risk of scarring associated with traditional treatment options. Intralesional injections of deoxycholic acid are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the removal of excessive submental fat, and the use of this compound for the treatment of lipomas is mainly off-label, with only a handful of cases documenting such use having been reported in the literature. We report the successful use of intralesional deoxycholic acid in the treatment of a facial lipoma, in which the clinical resolution was achieved with no need for surgery.

### Soft tissue sarcoma, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112Q5du4]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Soft tissue sarcoma (NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025) — stage I management states that surgical wide resection (with intent to obtain negative margins) is the primary treatment for stage IA and IB and is considered definitive if margins are greater than 1 cm or the fascial plane is intact; if the surgical margins are 1.0 cm or less and without an intact fascial plane, re-resection may be necessary, and treatment options including revision surgery versus observation should be presented at an experienced multidisciplinary sarcoma tumor board. Postoperative radiotherapy (RT) is recommended for patients with final surgical margins of 1.0 cm or less and without an intact fascial plane (category 2B for stage IA tumors and category 1 for stage IB), whereas RT may not be necessary in patients with small low-grade lesions (5 cm or less), and observation is included as an option for patients with stage IA disease with final surgical margins of 1.0 cm or less and with an intact fascial plane. General RT considerations note local control rates approaching 95% with preoperative RT at 50 Gy and negative margins, but RT is not a substitute for suboptimal surgical resection and re-resection is preferred for patients with positive surgical margins. For atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (ALT/WDLS), en bloc resection with negative margins is generally sufficient and RT is not indicated in most cases; in a report reviewing 91 patients, positive surgical margins were associated with reduced local recurrence-free survival, suggesting that function-preserving re-resection when possible or adjuvant RT could be considered for selected patients with positive margins, and RT may also be an appropriate option for selected patients with recurrent disease or deeply infiltrative primary lesions with a risk of local recurrence depending on tumor location and patient's age.

### Endoscopic ligation ("Loop-and-let-go") is effective treatment for large colonic lipomas: a prospective validation study [^113BRw6d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Colonic lipomas (CL) are rare benign adipose tumours usually found incidentally during colonoscopy. Endoscopic resection of symptomatic large CL remains controversial, since significant rates of perforation have been reported. In recent years, a novel technique for removal of large CL has been described, consisting of looping and ligating the lipoma with a nylon snare. The aim of our study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the "loop and let go" technique for large colon lipomas in a large case series.

Methods

Consecutive patients referred to our institution for colonoscopy were eligible for the study. The diagnosis of CL was confirmed endoscopically by "pillow" and "naked fat" signs. Following diagnosis, lipomas were looped and ligated by endoloop. Follow-up colonoscopies were scheduled at 1- and 3-months interval.

Results

A total of 11 patients with large CL were enrolled in study. The indications for the colonoscopy included altered bowel habits (7 patients, 64%), screening for colorectal neoplasm (3 pts, 27%) and lower gastrointestinal bleeding (1 pts, 9%). The median lesion size was 3 cm (range 2,5–6 cm). Lesions were located at the hepatic flexure in 4 patients (36%), cecum and ascending colon (4 pts, 36%), rectosigmoid (2 pts, 18%) and transverse colon (1 pts, 9%). There were no immediate and late complications. On follow-up (median follow-up time 11,9 months, range 8–24), there was one small residual lipoma (< 1 cm).

Conclusion

The results of this study confirm that "loop-and-let-go" technique is safe and efficacious treatment of large colonic lipomas.

### Loop-and-let-go technique for the management of symptomatic large colonic lipoma [^117SPcVK]. VideoGIE (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colonic lipomas are adipose tumors that originate from the submucosal layer. While often asymptomatic, larger lipomas can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits, thought to be secondary to intermittent intussusception. When large tumors begin to instigate obstructive symptoms, resection is warranted to alleviate symptom burden. While smaller lipomas can be removed endoscopically, larger ones often carry risk of adverse events from electrocautery such as hot snare polypectomy or EMR. Recent developments in endoscopic techniques have revealed a promising alternative described as the "loop-and-let-go" technique. This involves looping and ligating the lipoma at the base, then subsequently allowing for auto-amputation and passage of the tumor thus ameliorating the need for electrocautery. This case describes the first video documentation of this technique removing a large colonic lipoma.

### Endoscopic ligation ("Loop-and-let-go") is effective treatment for large colonic lipomas: a prospective validation study [^116jswtC]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective cohort study we demonstrated that the "loop and let go" technique using the endoloop is an effective endoscopic therapy for large CL. Although there are other studies documenting this technique, our study stands out for being prospective and encompassing a relatively large number of patients. Indeed, we are not aware of any larger study using this technique. Thus, our data add to the existing literature on the utility of endoloop to treat submucosal tumors.

Since its initial development by Hachisu, for prevention of delayed bleeding following snare polypectomy of large polyps with thick stalks, detachable snares have become an important part of the endoscopic armamentarium in a variety of therapeutic procedures. Ligation with detachable snare has been successfully deployed in the arresting and control of bleeding of oesophageal, gastric varices, GIST, as well as in the management of the large penduculated submucosal tumors and ileal lipoma. Despite these publications the utilisation of endoloop for treating submucosal lesions has been mainly reflected by single case reports or small case series.

Although the term "loop and let go" is a misnomer, since it is the virtue of ligation and not the looping that produces an asymptomatic, slow mechanical transection of the lesion, the term has gained far more acceptance in the literature, than the proper form of "ligate and let go".

In general, endoloop ligation of gastrointestinal lesions without resection is conceptually simple and has the potential to eliminate the risk of perforation or bleeding inherent to the electrocautery. However, only those lesions capable of resulting in problems and complications should be targeted, whereas lipomas smaller than 2 cm and asymptomatic warrant no treatment.

There are some drawbacks of the ligation technique in regard to the management of large symptomatic colonic lipomas. In order to effectively ligate the lipoma, the stalk needs to be clearly seen, preferably at 5–7 o'clock position. If not, reposition of the patient is required, which may be cumbersome in some situations. Furthermore, the endoscopic ligation should not be attempted in the treatment of broad based or sessile colonic lipomas. In these circumstances, endoscopic or surgical resection may be appropriate. Finally, a potential disadvantage of this technique is that the entire lesion is not recovered for histopathologic evaluation.

### Intrathoracic giant pleural lipoma: case report and review of the literature [^11665UiH]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

But most authors argued surgical resection, if possible, would be recommended for diagnostic and therapeutic considerations.

In this case of large lipomas, surgical exeresis is then inevitable to diagnose and to treat prior to progression stage when complications may happen. It is also the reason why we did not performed fine-needle aspiration biopsy, which was such a less invasive method.

Surgical resection can easily be performed via muscle-sparing or an open typical thoracotomy, as in our case. Video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has become a common technique for thoracic tumor which was pedunculated in form and small enough in size because there is no infiltrating growth in this type. It is an effective well-tolerated procedure that is associated with less morbidity and mortality. Recently, successful extirpation of a pleural lipoma with a single-port VATS has been reported.

The outcome of resection of lipomas is usually good. Recurrence rates after surgical excision have been reported to be less than 5%. Most cases of recurrence are probably attributed to incomplete resection of the lesion. Factors such as infiltration of adjacent structures like the brachial plexus may impede complete resection of the lipoma and predispose to its recurrence.

Incomplete surgical resection might be performed rather than complete extirpative procedures which may cause a serious functional disorder. Wurlitzer and colleagues reported several cases in which the tumor stopped growing after incomplete surgical tumor removal.

### The use of suction-assisted surgical extraction of moderate and large lipomas: long-term follow-up [^116gWT3L]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Solitary lipomas and familial multiple lipomatosis are the most common benign tumors and are very well encapsulated. They are very slow growing and have the potential for recurrence if incompletely excised and a very remote chance for malignant changes. These can be freed from surrounding tissue without difficulty, but because of the fibrous nature of the capsule, its violation is more likely with suction technique and may result in an inadequate resection, possibly leading to recurrence. Furthermore, liposuction alone will not allow histopathological study of the swellings. Therefore, we report here the treatment of moderate (> 4–10 cm) and large (> 10 cm) lipomas with liposuction-assisted surgical extraction of the capsule via the same wound (1 cm in length). This capsule extraction is aimed at avoiding recurrence and evaluating the histopathological nature of these swellings. 16 patients (nine men and seven women) presented with solitary lipomas (in 11 patients) and multiple lipomas (in five patients) have been successfully treated. Methods involved 1-cm incision for both liposuction and surgical removal of the capsule. Another 1-cm counter-incision may be needed in case of large size lipomas. High patient satisfaction was achieved because of the good cosmetic results due to the small postoperative residual scar and the smooth postoperative course. There has been no recorded recurrence in six years postoperative followup.

### Lipomatous soft-tissue tumors [^115QHLT9]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

Lipomatous soft-tissue tumors are the most common neoplasms encountered by physicians. They range from benign lipomas to high-grade liposarcomas. Unplanned excisions of sarcomas are commonly due to the presumptive diagnosis of lipoma and can be avoided by understanding their diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging appearance. Magnetic resonance images should be obtained for all soft-tissue masses that are deep to fascia or those > 5 cm in subcutaneous tissue. Atypical lipomatous tumors present as large deep fatty masses and have a propensity for local recurrence and a small risk of malignant transformation. Well-differentiated liposarcomas are histologically identical to atypical lipomatous tumors but have a markedly worse prognosis secondary to their anatomic location. Masses that lack isointense signal to subcutaneous fat on MRI may represent a sarcoma and require a biopsy before definitive treatment. Large deep lipomatous masses and liposarcomas should be sent to a sarcoma referral center for definitive treatment.

### Small bowel emergency surgery: literature's review [^1131Y3WN]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Small bowel neoplasms

Tumors of the small bowel are a very rare entity, accounting for only 1% of all gastrointestinal neoplasms and 0,3% of all tumors. The most common modes of presentation are intestinal obstruction and occult gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Occasionally, the presentation involves the development of a palpable but otherwise asymptomatic mass, whereas perforation and gross bleeding are rare. Small bowel tumors are usually located in the proximal small bowel, with the exception of adenocarcinoma in the contest of ileal Crohn's disease and NETs.

Adenomas are the most common benign tumors of jejunum and ileum. Their histological subtype are either tubular adenomas with low malignant potential or villous adenomas with high malignant potential. Lipomas are more frequent in the ileum, have no malignant potential and do not require a surgical excision unless symptomatic.

Malignant neoplasm present similarly to benign lesions. Diagnosis is often delayed conducing to advanced tumors, for whom surgical resection is rarely curative. Adenocarcinomas represent 50% of all small bowel malignancies. Most lesions are located in the proximal bowel, except in the setting of Crohn's disease in which most are ileal. Resection is the best treatment but overall the prognosis is poor due to late presentation in most patients (15% to 35% 5-year survival). Lymphomas represent 10% to 20% of small bowel malignant tumors. The ileum is the most common site of involvement because of the greatest amount of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Primary small-bowel lymphoma is the most common extranodal form of lymphoma. Most are non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and predominantly B-cells in origin. Patients commonly present with fatigue, weight loss and abdominal pain, whereas perforation, bleeding, obstruction or intussusceptions are less frequent. Treatment in such emergent cases is surgical and consists in resection along with a wedge of mesentery. Adjuvant therapy is recommended for patients with positive margins. Survival for completely resected intestinal lymphomas is about 50%.

### Endoclip-assisted giant colon lipoma resection [^112hbzuY]. VideoGIE (2019). Medium credibility.

Not infrequently, endoscopists encounter colon lipomas during colonoscopy. These lipomas are usually small (< 2 cm) and appear as yellowish, soft, submucosal nodules. Colon lipomas are 90% submucosal only, and in up to 10% of cases, muscularis propria or subserosal layers are involved. As lipomas grow in size, with intestinal peristalsis, they can become pedunculated or form a pedicle or stalk. The vast majority of lipomas are an incidental finding, and they do not cause any symptoms. Endoscopic removal is not indicated or necessary. Medium-to-large (2–4 cm) colon lipomas can potentially cause obstructive symptoms such as pain, bloating, constipation, postobstructive diarrhea, intussusception, or bleeding. According to a recent review, giant lipomas (> 4 cm) are usually symptomatic. For symptomatic lipomas, endoscopic or surgical resection is needed. For large and giant pedunculated lipomas, the normal muscular propria layer of the colon surrounding the pedicle can be evaginated into the stalk, forming a pseudopedicle. Endoscopic resection of these large and giant lipomas carries a perforation risk as high as 8%. We report a case of symptomatic giant sigmoid colon lipoma (7-cm × 6-cm) that was successfully removed with endoclip-assisted dissection.

### Successful removal of the largest reported intrathoracic lipoma with bilateral extension: a case report [^116csF29]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Intrathoracic lipomas are rare benign tumor in contrast of subcutaneous lipoma which is very common. They typically grow very slowly over years without any symptoms and signs. They often found in routine investigations incidentally when they become large. Whereas CT and MRI are usually diagnostic. Although pleural lipoma never evolves towards liposarcoma, surgical resection is still necessary and must be resected completely to prevent further recurrence.

### Axillary giant lipoma: a report of two cases and published work review [^1173mrRA]. The Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Lipomas are common, benign, small-sized, soft-tissue tumors. However, giant lipomas are uncommon and the tumor size can cause pain and nerve compression syndrome. The axilla is an extremely rare location for development of giant lipomas. We report two cases of axillary giant lipoma. A 47-year-old man (case 1) and a 42-year-old woman (case 2) presented with a large mass in the axillary region. Case 2 had tenderness in the shoulder and numbness in the upper arm. Magnetic resonance imaging of each tumor showed a homogenous soft-tissue mass in the axillary region, suggestive of lipoma. In case 2, the tumor extended from the axilla to the supraclavicular region and split and compressed the neurovascular bundle. Each lesion was successfully excised surgically without serious complications and recurrence. In case 2, the tenderness and numbness disappeared. Histologically, each lesion was composed of multilobulated, mature adipose cells, which led to a diagnosis of benign lipoma. Axillary giant lipoma is preferably excised surgically to avoid damage caused by tumor compression to the major vessels or nerves, to offer better local control and to establish a correct final diagnosis.

### Breast reshaping with dermaglandular flaps after giant lipoma removal: versatility of oncoplastic techniques [^115Fg3Wb]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Lipomas of the breast are benign lesions that do not raise great interest in the literature and their incidence is unclear. They usually are small, benign soft tissue tumors of fat cells that can be treated by simple excision. Although lipoma is a banal condition, it often causes diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty. The first reason for this is the normal fatty composition of the breast. Second, it may be difficult to distinguish a lipoma from other benign or malignant lumps. This report presents a rare case involving giant lipoma of the breast that compromised most of the mass of the breast. After resection, the remaining breast was reshaped using multiple dermaglandular flaps to restore the breast mound, and contralateral breast mammaplasty was performed for symmetry. This case is a good illustration of the oncoplastic reconstruction options available after wide local excision.

### Endoscopic unroofing and mucosal resection for a large colonic lipoma with intussusception: an effective hybrid technique [^111x1Kj9]. VideoGIE (2021). Medium credibility.

Lipomas account for 4% of benign subepithelial tumors of the GI tract and are found mainly in the colon (65%-75%). Colonic lipomas are often found incidentally during colonoscopy and are often asymptomatic and < 20 mm in size and therefore do not require routine colonoscopy or treatment. However, in rare cases, colonic lipoma may grow to the point of being symptomatic.

If the size of a colonic lipoma is > 40 mm, 75% of patients may develop symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation, bleeding, and intussusception. There are several endoscopic treatment options for these large lipomas, each with its own pros and cons. Some recommend an endoscopic polypectomy, but the risk of perforation is high. Moreover, if the lipoma is too large, the field of view and maneuverability may be compromised, and it may not be possible to apply a snare. Others recommend endoscopic unroofing, a procedure reported in 1997 that involves the removal of the upper third of a large lipoma. This is reportedly a useful and safe method for the treatment of lipomas.

In a systematic review, perforation with unroofing was found in 0% of patients, whereas perforation was found in 9.7% and 3.5% of patients with EMR and loop-assisted techniques, respectively. However, unroofing alone can leave tumor remnants behind, and the results in large lipomas may not be as good as expected. Here, we present the 2-step treatment of a large lipoma by endoscopic unroofing and additional mucosal resection (EMR) as a safe and effective treatment option even for lipomas large enough to cause intussusception (Video 1, available online at).

A 74-year-old woman with a history of ovarian cysts and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy presented with intermittent abdominal pain and hematochezia. She was on atenolol but otherwise had no other significant medical history. All of the hematologic parameters were within normal limits, including tumor markers. A CT scan revealed a tumor measuring 52 × 30 mm at the sigmoid colon, with findings of large-bowel intussusception (Fig. 1).

### Spontaneous expulsion from rectum: a rare presentation of intestinal lipomas [^113X5jT4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Lipomas are rare, subserosal, usually solitary, pedunculated small lesions appearing mainly in the large intestine with a minimal malignancy potential. They usually run asymptomatic and become symptomatic when they become enlarged or complicated causing intestinal obstruction, perforation, intusucception or massive bleeding. In rare cases they can be self-detached and expulsed via the rectum as fleshy masses. This event mainly occurs in large, pendunculated lipomas which detach from their pedicle. The reason for this event remains in most of cases unclear although in some cases a predisposing factor does exist. Abdominal pain and obstructive ileus may be observed while in many cases bleeding occurs. The expulsed mass sets the diagnosis and in most of the cases all symptoms subside. Diagnosis is rarely established before surgery with the use of barium enema, computed tomography and colonoscopy which additionally provides measures of treatment and diagnosis. In atypical cases though, in cases where the malignancy can not be excluded or in complicated cases, surgery is recommended. Usually the resection of the affected intestinal part is adequate. If during surgery a lipoma is encountered simple lipomatectomy seems also to be adequate.

### A novel approach for treating lipomas: percutaneous microwave ablation combined with liposuction [^1142acDY]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Before injection, clinicians need to exclude malignant connective tissue tumors and other possible causes of soft tissue masses. These reasons may include liposarcoma, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, cutaneous metastatic malignancies, as well as epidermoid cysts, foreign body granulomas, rheumatoid nodules, gouty stones, etc. To exclude malignant tumors, a diagnosis of lipoma must be made and sufficient data collected before liposuction. Atypical lipomas or liposarcomas may have a similar appearance, which should always be kept in mind. Diagnostic methods such as fine-needle aspiration and ultrasound imaging can be helpful. These examinations can assist doctors in determining the nature and origin of the mass, thus formulating further treatment plans. Therefore, performing these examinations before injection is important to ensure patient safety and treatment accuracy. Although our series did not encounter any cases ultimately diagnosed as liposarcoma in the postoperative pathological examination, we uphold the belief that for patients whose postoperative pathology confirms liposarcoma, an extended radical surgery is imperative. This involves the surgical removal of surrounding tissues to eliminate any remaining malignant cells and reduce the risk of recurrence. Should it be necessary, the treatment plan may also incorporate chemotherapy or radiation therapy to further ensure the thorough eradication of malignant cells and to minimize the potential for recurrence.

### Endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal lipomas: a single-center experience [^111GTgYc]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal (GI) lipomas are benign, slow-growing subepithelial tumors. Most lipomas are detected incidentally at endoscopy, but they can cause GI bleeding, abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction, and intussusception, particularly if they are larger than 2 cm in diameter. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy, safety, and long-term prognosis of endoscopic treatment of GI lipomas.

Methods

A total of 28 GI lipomas treated endoscopically from January 2005 to June 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Endoscopic treatment was performed by four methods: the unroofing technique, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), EMR after precutting (EMR-P), and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).

Results

Of 28 GI lipomas, 5 were located in the stomach, 2 in the duodenum, and 21 in the colon. Thirteen lipomas were < 2 cm in diameter (small lipoma), and the other 15 were ≥ 2 cm (large lipoma). The unroofing technique was performed in 2 cases, EMR in 17 cases, EMR-P in 4 cases, and ESD in 5 cases. En bloc resection was performed with 21 lesions (75%), and endoscopic complete resection was achieved with 26 lesions (93%). Incomplete resection occurred in the 2 cases treated by the unroofing technique. On pathologic examination, complete resection was achieved with 21 lesions (75%). Delayed bleeding was observed in one patient. There were no serious complications such as perforation or post-procedural stricture. During the mean follow-up period of 19 months (range 2–91 months), no recurrence was observed.

Conclusions

Endoscopic treatment appears to be a safe and effective treatment for GI lipomas, including large lipomas (≥ 2 cm in diameter).

### A novel approach for treating lipomas: percutaneous microwave ablation combined with liposuction [^1143n6ex]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lipoma is the most common benign tumor in clinical practice, originating from adipose cells and often presenting with no apparent symptoms. The incidence rate of lipoma ranges from approximately 1 to 3%. Most lipomas grow in subcutaneous tissues, commonly found in the abdomen, back, neck, and limbs. Various factors are believed to contribute to the development of lipomas, including obesity, unhealthy lifestyle, genetic factors, compression of soft tissues, radiation exposure, and certain medication usage. While lipomas themselves are not malignant, they can have significant negative impacts on patients' psychological well-being if they grow on the face or in areas that may affect their appearance, if they exert pressure on surrounding tissues or organs due to their large size, or if they form encapsulated structures in critical locations. Currently, surgical excision is the main treatment for lipomas. However, it still carries certain risks, such as scar hypertrophy, infection, and bleeding, which can affect patients' quality of life to some extent.

Microwave ablation, a minimally invasive treatment method, utilizes microwave energy to generate high temperatures and destroy tumors and other abnormal tissues. The principle of microwave ablation involves using a microwave generator to produce ultra-short electromagnetic waves at frequencies of 915 or 2450 MHz and delivering the microwave energy into the tumor tissue via an electrode needle. Under the influence of the microwave field, polar molecules (such as water molecules) within the tumor tissue rapidly move and generate heat through friction, thereby inducing coagulative necrosis in cells and ultimately disrupting the lesion.

Liposuction was first introduced in 1975 and has become a common surgical procedure. Recently, liposuction has been employed for the operative management of lipomas. It has several indications, such as lipodystrophy, gynecomastia, axillary hyperhidrosis, body asymmetry, and lipomas.

Therefore, to achieve optimal aesthetic outcomes, we propose a novel approach of percutaneous microwave ablation-assisted liposuction under ultrasound guidance for the treatment of certain head and neck lipomas.

### Breast reconstruction with parenchymal cross after giant lipoma removal [^115FJtUU]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Lipomas are benign tumors composed of mature fat, usually encapsulated. A literature review showed that the vast majority of lipomas are small, weighing only a few grams, and grow slowly. According to Hawary et al. (Ann Saudi Med 19(2):174–176, 1999) a giant breast lipoma is characterized by a lesion of at least 5 cm in one dimension and weighs more than 500 g. We present a rare case of a giant breast lipoma with slow growth over 22 years that compromised the entire hemithorax through the right iliac fossa. A 49-year-old woman was referred to our plastic surgery unit because of complaints of severe breast asymmetry due to an enormous mass in the right breast. Twenty-two years earlier she had noticed a soft, mobile, nonpulsatile mass in the inferior quadrant of her right breast. She did not look for medical treatment for all those years for fear of it being cancer. Ultrasound suggested a lipomatous lesion. Open mass biopsy revealed lipoma. The patient underwent a whole mass resection, reconstruction with a parenchymal cross flap, and left breast symmetrization with an inverted T technique. An excellent result with a high degree of patient satisfaction was achieved with the procedure. Parenchymal cross flaps seem to be an option in these situations.

### A comparative study on the short-term and long-term efficacy of endoscopic lipolysis, liposuction, and traditional open excision in gynecomastia treatment [^117Enpy3]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Male mammary dysplasia, commonly referred to as gynecomastia, is characterized by abnormal hyperplasia of male breast tissue. This condition can arise from various factors, including hormonal imbalances, medication side effects, genetic predisposition, or underlying health conditions. Gynecomastia may cause not only physical discomfort — such as breast pain and sensitivity — but also psychological distress and social embarrassment.

Two primary surgical interventions for male breast development are endoscopic liposuction and traditional open excision. Endoscopic liposuction, a relatively novel technique, offers several advantages, including minimal trauma, faster recovery times, and reduced scarring. Laparoscopic liposuction is particularly favored in the treatment of gynecomastia due to its straightforward operation, minimal invasiveness, and low anesthesia requirements. The application of a liposuction solution facilitates quicker detachment of the local skin flap, minimizes skin flap damage, and achieves complete anesthetic infiltration, thereby alleviating patient discomfort. During this procedure, surgeons introduce endoscopes and specialized instruments through small incisions, allowing for the dissolution and removal of excess adipose tissue. The use of smaller incisions results in an aesthetically favorable postoperative appearance with minimal scarring, making this approach particularly appealing to patients concerned about aesthetics.

In contrast, traditional open excision represents a more conventional surgical approach, generally reserved for severe cases of gynecomastia. This method involves the direct removal of excess breast and adipose tissue through larger incisions. While this technique effectively eliminates pathological tissue and is associated with a theoretically low recurrence rate, its drawbacks include increased trauma, prolonged recovery periods, and more noticeable scarring post-operation.

Endoscopic liposuction offers distinct advantages in terms of short-term effectiveness. The use of small incisions reduces both operative and hospitalization times while minimizing postoperative discomfort, facilitating a smoother recovery. This technology allows patients to resume their daily activities and work sooner, thereby enhancing their quality of life and alleviating the economic and social burdens associated with prolonged rehabilitation.

Another significant benefit of small incision surgery is the reduction in intraoperative bleeding, which directly contributes to surgical safety and expedites postoperative recovery. By minimizing blood loss, the risks during surgery are decreased, operation times are shortened, and potential complications — such as infection and hematoma formation — are mitigated. Furthermore, reduced bleeding helps maintain a clear surgical field, enhancing precision during procedures, particularly in cases requiring meticulous techniques to avoid damage to vital tissues or structures.

### Well-circumscribed type of intramuscular lipoma in the chest wall [^115TRQo3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of intramuscular lipoma is suggested when a painless, slow-growing, well-demarcated lesion occurs in the chest, although this type of lesion is rare. The liposarcoma that has a same histologic and clinical appearance must be excluded and surgical excision should be carefully performed. Patient follow-up is of critical importance due to its high recurrence rate.

### Lipoma or liposarcoma? A cautionary case report [^1176qyWA]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

MERRF syndrome (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibres) is a mitochondrial encephalomyopathy characterised by a mixed seizure disorder and myoclonus. The condition is associated with multiple large cervical lipomas that often require surgical excision. Comprehensive clinical examination combined with pre-operative radiographic imaging is vital in such cases to help differentiate benign fatty masses from potential liposarcomas. We describe a case in which a lipoma-like liposarcoma was identified following excision of what was expected, on clinical and radiological grounds, to be a lipoma. This case highlights the potential for sarcomatous changes in suspicious lipomas, and the key role that imaging plays in differentiating benign from malignant.

### A national survey of the current management of nonmalignant lipomatous tumours and a proposal for unified UK guidelines for practice [^115vg9n4]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Although there exists clear guidance to determine which lipomatous lesions should be referred to a sarcoma multidisciplinary team (MDT) for discussion, subsequent guidelines for management advice are only focused on malignant lesions. This study aimed to address the management of benign and intermediate lipomatous lesions with reference to the available literature, precedent from 15 of the 17 UK sarcoma MDTs, and local experience. Fifteen mock cases were presented to each MDT to determine local management pathways. This revealed significant heterogeneity within the management of these benign and intermediate lipomatous lesions across the UK. After combining this data with the available evidence in the literature, we developed recommendations for management of these lesions with the aim to reduce national variability. We propose the first set of national management guidelines specific to benign lipomatous lesions, which stratifies resources according to lipomatous tumour type.

### "Left ventricular lipoma… a rare case", case report [^117KWbJs]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Cardiac lipomas are rare benign primary cardiac tumors, accounting for 2–8% of all benign cardiac tumors. The typical 'age at presentation' of patients is between 40 and 60 years of age, but the presentation can occur at any age. There is no gender predilection.

Cardiac lipomas are usually indolent and asymptomatic, particularly in the early stages. They are usually incidentally-discovered during cardiac investigations that are performed for other reasons. Symptoms such as dyspnea, pre-syncope, syncope or palpitations can occur if the tumor grows and causes LV inflow or outflow obstruction, LV dysfunction or invasion of the conduction system. Sudden cardiac death has been reported, but the true incidence is unknown given the rarity of this cardiac tumor. The most common location for cardiac lipomas is the inter-atrial septum, followed by endocardium of RA and LV. Other, less common, sites of involvement are the myocardium, sub-epicardium and pericardium. On cardiac imaging, cardiac lipomas typical appear as a well-defined encapsulated mass. This encapsulated appearance is what differentiates cardiac lipomas from lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum (LHIS) and adipo-sarcomas. Moreover, adipo-sarcomas have a tendency to invade the myocardium. Echocardiography is the initial investigation of choice. Subsequently, Cardiac Computed Tomography and CMR can be pursued to provide useful information regarding tissue characterization and the extent of myocardial infiltration.

On CMR, lipomas have a homogeneous appearance of increased signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging, with a reduction in signal intensity in fat-saturated sequences. Cardiac lipomas do not enhance with the administration of intravenous contrast. However, cardiac imaging fails to confirm the diagnosis in some cases, and surgical excision and histopathologic examination is required.

As the prevalence of cardiac lipomas is very low, there are no randomized clinical trials or large prospective cohorts to provide guidance or insight into the optimal treatment. For large lesions that are causing obstruction, surgical resection is usually therapeutic and curative. Given the encapsulated nature of these tumors, they are not usually associated with embolization; and that is a rare indication for their surgical resection. However, the general consensus is that surgical resection is commonly-pursued for all cardiac lipomas, regardless of symptoms or obstruction, due to the several reports in the literature of an associated risk of sudden cardiac death. Cardiac lipomas are easy to resect as they are encapsulated and rarely invade the myocardium.

### Dual-wavelength laser lipolysis treatment of lipomas: a case report [^1111ae7C]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Lipomas, which occur in 1% of the population, can be cosmetically unacceptable to patients. Excision of these benign tumors may leave visually unacceptable scars. The authors report a case of lipomas that were treated with laser lipolysis followed by digital extraction via a 1.5 mm opening thereby decreasing the risk of scarring.

### Largest reported lipoma in the United States of America [^117ANb1p]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A woman in her early 60s presented for evaluation of an asymptomatic left groin mass. CT imaging noted a large fatty tumour replacing the majority of the abdominal and pelvic cavities. The patient underwent uneventful resection of a 53×36×9 cm mass of the retroperitoneal (RP) space. The pathology report was compatible with a lipoma. This is the largest noted RP lipoma in the US literature. In this case report, we also offer a literature review of the diagnosis and management of fat-containing retroperitoneal masses.

### From pathogenesis to treatment, a systemic review of cardiac lipoma [^113Ffu9n]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Cardiac lipoma is an uncommon primary cardiac tumor. With the advancement of diagnostic methods and treatment techniques, more cases of cardiac lipomas have been reported and suggest that the entity previously widely thought to display classic features may also show atypical findings. A systemic review of the rare cardiac tumor was done by searching the literature of cardiac lipoma. We endeavor to summarize the clinical features of the rare disease from pathogenesis to treatment. Literature of cardiac lipoma was retrospectively searched through PubMed and 255 cases of cardiac lipoma were included into this analysis. Cardiac lipomas can occur anywhere within the heart, 53.1% were located within the cardiac chambers, 32.5% in the pericardium, 10,7% within the myocardium and 3.7% involved multiple structures. More than half of the reported cardiac lipomas (66%) may be clinically symptomatic, presenting with symptoms ranging from chest discomfort to syncope depending on their size and location as well as extent of myocardial involvement. Noninvasive cardiac imaging has replaced the role of autopsy and cardiothoracic surgery in detection and diagnosis of cardiac lipomas. Most symptomatic patients (83.7%) were treated by resection of cardiac lipomas and 68.3% of asymptomatic patients also underwentprophylactic resection. Overgrowth and myocardial infiltration of lipomas may result in unsuccessful resection. Recurrence of cardiac lipomas was rare but reported in a few cases. The early detection and accurate diagnosis of cardiac lipoma is of great significance in clinical management, to avoid an unfavourable outcome due to overgrowth.

### A novel approach for treating lipomas: percutaneous microwave ablation combined with liposuction [^116A3xEP]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

None of the patients in this study experienced severe complications; however, percutaneous microwave ablation combined with liposuction still carries potential risks, such as bleeding, fat embolism, uneven liposuction area, postoperative chronic pain, hematoma, wound infection, nerve damage, and pigment changes. During postoperative follow-up, some patients with loose skin could feel the mass in the original treatment area which was different from the surrounding tissue texture, and a few patients could still see a slight protrusion in the original treatment area. This condition usually disappears within 3 months after the operation, so we speculate it may be a postoperative hematoma.

The management of lipomas has traditionally relied on surgical excision, which, despite its efficacy, possesses several limitations, including potential for scarring, pain, and a longer recovery period. In contrast, our novel technique — percutaneous microwave ablation combined with liposuction — offers a less invasive alternative, which aligns with the current trend toward minimally invasive procedures in surgical oncology and soft tissue management. Unlike conventional surgical excision, which typically removes the lipoma in its entirety but risks significant scarring and longer recovery, our technique utilizes microwave ablation to selectively heat and destroy lipoma cells. This is followed by liposuction to remove the liquefied tissue, minimizing the surgical footprint and preserving surrounding healthy tissue. This method mitigates the risk of large scars and has shown a lower complication rate, placing it as a competitive alternative to traditional approaches. Studies have reported the safety and effectiveness of microwave ablation in other contexts, such as liver and kidney tumor management, underscoring the potential for its application in lipoma treatment. Modern patient care increasingly prioritizes not only treatment efficacy but also quality of life and cosmetic outcomes. Our technique directly addresses this trend by offering superior cosmetic results with less postoperative pain and quicker recovery times. In our study, patient satisfaction scores were notably higher for those treated with microwave ablation and liposuction compared to historical cohorts undergoing traditional excision, reflecting the importance of cosmetic outcomes in patient-centered care. While the initial cost of microwave ablation equipment may be higher than the tools required for conventional surgical excision, the overall cost savings derived from shorter hospital stays, reduced need for postoperative care, and quicker return to daily activities make our technique economically attractive. Moreover, the reduced risk of complications and subsequent interventions further underscores the cost-effectiveness of our approach.

### Ileocolic intussusception – A rare cause of acute intestinal obstruction in adults; case report and literature review [^113Wj68P]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Benign lesions account for almost 25% cases of intussusception in adults. The commonest benign lesion is a lipoma in the colon. These are solitary submucosal lesions with 75% occurring in the right colon. Small lipomas are asymptomatic. Other benign lesions include adenomatous polyps and Peutz-Jeghers polyps. However in more than two thirds of cases there is a malignant tumour in the colon or small bowel resulting in intussusception.

Operative intervention is required in all cases of adult intussusception and unlike children conservative treatment does not work. This usually involves segmental colonic resection. The optimal treatment for adult intussusception is slightly controversial. The type of procedure depends upon the location of intussusception, pre-operative diagnosis and condition of the intestine at the time of laparotomy. A few authors have described intra-operative reduction of intussusception before resection. However most authors do not recommend this due to a higher incidence of malignancy in these cases and hence the risk of tumour embolisation and seedling.

In most cases of adult colonic intussusception, primary resection without reduction should be performed particularly in those more than 60 years of age due to a higher risk of malignancy. In cases of small bowel intussusception reduction before resection should be carried out only if there is a pre-operative diagnosis of benign etiology, the bowel is viable or it entails resecting massive lengths of small bowel with the risk of short gut syndrome.

### Total endoscopic left ventricle lipoma removal [^114eS8cs]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac lipoma is a rare primary cardiac tumor. Origin in the left ventricle is seen in 33% of cases, with 57% of these cases the primary site being intracavity. Almost two thirds of patients become symptomatic due to the mass effect. A broad variety of symptoms from chest pain to memory loss has been reported, though dyspnea is the most common. Diagnosis is made by ultrasonography supplemented by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Radical resection is indicated in all cases of cardiac lipomas even when asymptomatic, due to the risk of overgrowth and infiltration in adjacent structures. Surgical resection is usually done by either full or partial resection. We propose a minimally invasive, non-sternotomy approach.

### Lipoma and its doppelganger: the atypical lipomatous tumor / well-differentiated liposarcoma [^1176Sdqw]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Lipomatous tumors are among the most common soft tissue lesions encountered by the general surgeon. Shared history and clinical presentation make differentiation between benign lipomas and low-grade liposarcomas a diagnostic dilemma. This article reviews the epidemiology, clinical history, diagnostic workup, management, natural history, and surveillance of benign lipomas and atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas. Although it is important that aggressive, potentially malignant atypical lipomatous tumors and liposarcomas be managed in a multidisciplinary, preferably high-volume setting, it is equally as important for the nonspecialist general surgeon to be familiar with lipoma and its doppelganger-the well-differentiated liposarcoma.

### Suprascapular nerve entrapment secondary to a lipoma [^114zekHR]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2003). Low credibility.

Many causes of suprascapular nerve entrapment have been described including a small spinoglenoid notch, a tight ligament, boney spurs, and ganglion cysts. In the current patient, suprascapular nerve entrapment was caused by a lipoma in the suprascapular notch. The patient presented with painful shoulder motion that could have been attributed to rotator cuff and acromioclavicular joint disease. However, magnetic resonance imaging and electromyography were consistent with suprascapular nerve entrapment. Treatment of the rotator cuff disease and excision of the lipoma led to resolution of the patient's symptoms. This case is presented as an unusual cause of suprascapular nerve entrapment with a review of its course and anatomy.

### The largest reported intrathoracic lipoma: a case report and current perspectives review [^113PE6LL]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The huge size intrathoracic lipomas are very rare. Few cases have been reported worldwide. To our knowledge, this presented case is one of the few cases reported. Here we report a single case as very huge intrathoracic lipoma compressing the right lung and displacing the diaphragm and liver downward. It has been managed by right posterolateral thoracotomy and complete excision, with excellent outcome.

Case Presentation

A 32-year-old male presented with a symptomatic right intrathoracic mass, which was confirmed to be a lipomatous tumor using computed tomography. A penduculated tumor originating from the mediastinal pleura was resected through the conventional right posterior thoracotomy. Pathological examination indicated a diagnosis of fibrolipoma.

Conclusion

The tumor was symptomatic and relatively huge when detected during a medical checkup. This enabled the successful tumor resection via conventional thoracotomy approach. Although intrathoracic lipomas are histologically benign, careful observation and follow-up are crucial due to the possibility of recurrence.

A female patient, 75 years old, presenting lesion in the right oral vestibule where excisional biopsy was performed. The professional must diagnose this type of injury as soon as possible and treat it so that it does not take large proportions, which can result in esthetic and functional sequelae to the patient.

### Guide to early surgical management of lip hemangiomas based on our experience of 214 cases [^115pczPz]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Hemangiomas are the most common vascular lesions in infancy. The majority of hemangiomas occur on the face and cause significant parental distress because of their high visibility. Traditionally, they have been managed by a "watch and wait" approach due to their known propensity to improve significantly over time. This is a particularly difficult approach for hemangiomas of the lips due to their high visibility and their tendency to leave residual deformity even after resolution.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients who underwent surgical excision of upper and lower lip hemangiomas at Children's Hospital Los Angeles between 1992 and 2006.

Results

The authors identified 214 patients with an average age of 23.6 months at the time of surgery. All patients had improvements in lip appearance, with minimal complications. No transfusions were required, and all but two patients (lip switch flaps for major tissue loss) were managed on an outpatient basis. Overall, complications were minimal, with a high degree of parent satisfaction.

Conclusion

The authors conclude that many children would benefit from early excision and present guidelines for the early surgical management of lip hemangiomas.

### Incidental finding of left ventricle lipoma in the setting of metastatic cancer: is the decision of surveillance appropriate based on imaging alone? [^1154sqjz]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Medium credibility.

Delayed excision of benign primary cardiac tumor in the setting of metastatic disease.

Central Message

Preliminary diagnosis of cardiac tumor using history and imaging characteristics can justify surveillance over immediate operative intervention in the appropriate setting.

Primary cardiac tumors are rare lesions that are often benign. Incidence of these tumors in multiple autopsy series range from 0.2% to 0.4%. Pathology of benign cardiac tumors include myxoma, rhabdomyoma, fibroma, hemangioma, and lipoma. Cardiac lipomas account for ∼8.4% of these tumors and have been documented in all chambers of the heart and valve leaflets. Few cases to date have documented cardiac lipomas with papillary muscle involvement (see the E-References).

### Spontaneous expulsion from rectum: a rare presentation of intestinal lipomas [^113j5Xt4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis of intestinal lipoma, if not accidental, is usually established during surgery for possible intestinal cancer or for treatment of lipoma complications.

In barium enema, an ovoid, well delineated, smooth and radiolucent mass is usually observed. The size and the shape of the mass may be changed with bowel movements with the elongation of the mass being the foremost appearance ("squeeze sign"). In most cases, typical signs of intramular, extramucosal tumors are usually observed with a markely greater radiolucency because of the adipose tissue presence. Diagnosis is achieved in less than 20% of cases.

Computed tomography will also show a spherical, ovoid, pear shaped mass with sharp margins with density of -40 to -120 Housfield units in uncomplicated cases. In cases however with intusucception atypical imaging appearance may be encountered.

In colonoscopy, a normal lipoma may be visualized and therefore establish the diagnosis. In more atypical cases, different observations may cause suspicion of the diagnosis; the elevation of the mucosa over the mass with forceps ("tent sign"), the indentation of the lipoma with forceps ("cushion sign") or fat extrusion after biopsy ("naked fat sign"). Colonoscopy apart from diagnosis can provide a treatment modality especially in small lipomas less than 2 cm in diameter. However, different approaches concerning the removal of the lipoma involve either the use of diathermia by which the stalk vessels can be thrombosed or use of clips or loops. The fact that fat is an inefficient electric current conductor and consequently hemorrhage may evolve should always be considered. Additionally, the possibility of perforation seems to rise during colonoscopy and again should be considered. Nevertheless, some authors believe that diagnosis is not eventually established because since lipomas are submucosal the biopsy performed will not involve tissue originating from deeper tissues.

MRI may provide additionally information but is not yet considered as a potential diagnosis indicator.

Despite all imaging modalities preoperative diagnosis is established in 62% of patients.

### Benign skin lesions: lipomas, epidermal inclusion cysts, muscle and nerve biopsies [^113okHVD]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Lipomas are benign skin tumors composed of mature fat cells and are the most common subcutaneous tumors. Although many of these can be removed in the surgical clinic or minor operating room, some require more advanced preoperative planning and more complicated resection. The diagnosis, pathology, and treatment of benign tumors, and other commonly associated tumors that may require a more substantial workup and operative intervention, are discussed. Muscle and nerve biopsies are used for the diagnosis of a variety of medical problems. Although there are other genetic and biochemical markers now available that can diagnose diseases previously proven by biopsy, these surgical techniques still have appropriate uses. Although the procedures are straightforward, there are important technical issues to assist in getting the best specimen to avoid confounding disease diagnosis.

### Successful endoscopic submucosal dissection for a huge lipoma in the terminal ileum [^111BJ3kK]. VideoGIE (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure. 2
A, A yellowish tumor came into view during the dissection. B, Dissection was performed carefully, without damaging the tumor. C, Ulcer floor after the endoscopic submucosal dissection. D, Complete closure was achieved with endoclips. E, Resected specimen; en bloc resection was achieved. F, Histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of lipoma (H & E, orig. mag. ×200).

Resection of huge lipomas is recommended because of the risk of bowel obstruction, intussusception, and malignancy. In addition, lipomas tend to become symptomatic when they arise in the small intestine because of its narrow lumen. Our patient was considered eligible for resection because his lipoma was determined to be a huge tumor that caused intermittent abdominal pain. Previously, such tumors were treated surgically, but if endoscopic resection is possible, the physical burden on the patient is reduced. ESD was selected as the method of endoscopic resection instead of endoscopic unroofingor endoscopic mucosal resectionbecause the tumor was huge and fully occupied the ileal lumen, and there was not enough space to deploy a snare at the place. The following are considered to be the 2 key points in the treatment of our patient. First, because there was not enough space for treatment in the ileum, all of the procedures were performed in the cecum. Second, incision and adequate dissection on the ileal side were performed first so the lesion would not become stuck in the ileum during the procedure.

ESD is more technically challenging in the ileum, and there have been only 2 reports of ESD for a huge lipoma in the ileum. One report described perforation by ESD, leaving the operator with no choice but to switch the procedure to a combination of unroofing and ESD. There have been no reports accompanied by a video that clearly showed the strategies for safely and efficiently removing the tumor.

ESD is a feasible treatment for huge lipomas in the terminal ileum and can be a useful treatment option for these tumors because of its minimally invasive nature and reliable en bloc resection.

### A comparative study on the short-term and long-term efficacy of endoscopic lipolysis, liposuction, and traditional open excision in gynecomastia treatment [^117EwyA3]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

While the short-term benefits of endoscopic surgery are well-documented, including reduced operation times, lower complication rates, and expedited recovery, data regarding its long-term efficacy and recurrence rates remain limited. This gap has fueled ongoing debate within the medical community concerning the significant differences in long-term outcomes between these surgical methods. Specifically, understanding the long-term recurrence rates and patient satisfaction associated with endoscopic liposuction compared to traditional open excision is a key area of current research.

Therefore, this study aims to compare the short-term and long-term effectiveness of endoscopic liposuction and traditional open excision in managing gynecomastia. The objective is to provide clinicians with a comprehensive framework to guide treatment decisions.

### Lipoedema: from clinical presentation to therapy. A review of the literature [^111gZF2C]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Lipoedema is an infrequently recognized disorder in women. Lipoedema is characterized by bilateral enlargement of the legs due to abnormal depositions of subcutaneous fat associated with often mild oedema. There is substantial variability in disease severity. The diagnosis should be made as early as possible to prevent complications of the disorder, which is associated with increasing functional and cosmetic morbidity.

### From pathogenesis to treatment, a systemic review of cardiac lipoma [^111cBoeD]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Emergence of cross-sectional imaging methods including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially the latter one, made noninvasive diagnosis of cardiac lipoma possible. Lipomas have entirely the same composition with mature adipose tissue, they show the same imaging appearances with subcutaneous fat in CT and MRI on all sequences (Fig. 5). On CT, they present as homogenous hypodense encapsulated masses with or without linear septa (Hounsfield measurement < − 50). Signal features of cardiac lipomas show consistence with subcutaneous fat in all MR sequences. Specifically, the complete signal loss of the mass on fat suppression sequence is characteristic for the diagnosis of lipoma. Of note, the black boundary sign in cine sequence due to chemical shift effect is of great help in diagnosing small lipomas. Recently, the tissue mapping technique applied in cardiac imaging has shown great potential to quantitatively diagnose cardiac lipoma. Hemodynamic state, which is commonly evaluated by echocardiography, can also be assessed in cardiac MRI real-time cine sequence. Over all, myocardial infiltration of lipoma can be sensitively detected with cardiac MRI. Like lipoma elsewhere, diagnosis of cardiac lipomas can be established with plain scan, and they do not demonstrate any enhancement on contrast scanning. Though imaging features of cardiac lipoma are highly specific on CT and MRI, it is occasionally necessary to differentiate this benign entity from liposarcoma. The presence of nonuniformly thick septa and mass-like nonadipose areas may suggest the diagnosis of liposarcoma. The differentiation between mature cardiac lipomas and well-differentiated liposarcoma may occasionally be difficult by imaging. In summary, echocardiography plays an irreplaceable role in screening of cardiac lipoma, while CT and MRI (particularly MRI), is indispensable for accurate diagnosis and comprehensive evaluation.

### Management of stromal lesions [^1179PjWH]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Breast stromal lesions include fibroadenomas, phyllodes tumors, pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia, periductal stromal tumors, and lipomas. Most of these lesions are benign and can be managed with observation or surgical excision. Phyllodes tumors, however, are subcategorized into benign, borderline, and malignant. Benign phyllodes tumors may be removed without a margin of breast tissue while borderline and malignant phyllodes tumors need a wide excision with a greater than 1 cm margin. Because malignant phyllodes tumors have a poor prognosis, efforts should be made to discuss their treatment in a multidisciplinary setting and enrollment in a clinical trial should be considered.

### Clinical features of intussusception in children secondary to small bowel tumours: a retrospective study of 31 cases [^114j6mjA]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Lymphoma can manifest in various locations, necessitating a thorough examination of the entire small bowel. The serosal surface of adenomyoma exhibits bubble-like protrusions, while the mucosal surface appears as smooth protrusions. Lipomas, on the other hand, present as polypoid lesions protruding from the mucosal surface, occasionally with ulceration at the base, making them challenging to distinguish from polyps. Nevertheless, based on their gross morphology, adenomyomas and lipomas can be identified as benign tumors. Depending on their size, segmental intestinal resection or wedge resection may be performed.

Subsequently, the prognosis of SBT in children is contingent upon its pathological type. Chemotherapy emerges as the primary treatment option for gastrointestinal lymphoma, while surgery is generally reserved for patients facing challenging diagnoses, gastrointestinal perforations, and intestinal obstruction. Complete resection remains the principal treatment modality for other tumor types, with incomplete resection standing as a significant contributor to recurrence.

### Surgical treatment of multiple symmetric lipomatosis with ultrasound-assisted liposuction [^117DJp6g]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Multiple symmetric lipomatosis (MSL) is a rare disease of unknown etiology, characterized by the presence of multiple, symmetrical, noncapsulated lipomas, mostly in the neck and upper trunk. To date, there is no effective medical treatment of MSL. Surgical treatment is based on 2 options, namely, lipectomy and/or liposuction. In this retrospective study, we compare traditional lipectomy with ultrasound-assisted liposuction. Our initial experience demonstrates that the ultrasound-assisted liposuction procedure can be applied to patients with MSL, allowing simultaneous treatment of multiple areas in a single session and the removal of a substantial amount of fat, thus improving aesthetic results. If lipomas are circumscribed and isolated, traditional lipectomy is probably to be preferred.

### Practical surgical technique using the SMISS approach for lip reduction in involuted lip infantile hemangiomas [^1151GfhP]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

IHs occur with a high frequency in the central facial area and nearly 20% of them have lip involvement. Lip IHs are usually associated with functional, aesthetic, and psychosocial implications. In the recent decade, propranolol is considered a well-tolerated and effective drug that can keep IHs from rapid proliferation and can further shrink the existing lesions. However, the obvious residue was still reported in some cases of lip IHs. Concerning the central position and symmetric pattern of the lips, even relatively minor remnants of the involuted IH are noticeable, which will lead to persistent deformity. A retrospective study reviewing 76 localized lip IHs demonstrated that only 10% reached complete regression and the remainder required subsequent treatment, the majority of which were advised to receive the surgical therapy. The growth of IHs tends to cause soft tissue expansion, necessitating the volumetric reduction by surgical excisions. Besides, in contrast to oncologic resection which requires extended excision to achieve clear resection margins, normal size, natural contour, and improved appearance should be taken as the priority of the surgical process for lip IHs. Thus, to address the functional and aesthetic concerns of the patient and parents, we have modified the relevant surgical technique (Fig. 5).

### Intraoral excision of a huge cheek lipoma [^116P4n2x]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Lipomas are benign tumors of mature adipocytes unusual in the oral and maxillofacial region. The average size of cheek lipomas in the literature ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 cm, with the maximum size of 5 cm. Their etiology remains unclear. Lipomas present, clinically, as well circumscribed, slow growing, painless masses, usually treated by complete excision. The aim of this paper is to present a 78-year-old Caucasian male patient with a huge cheek lipoma compromising facial esthetics and treated through an intraoral excision. Postoperative period was uneventful with no signs of recurrence. Concluding, the intraoral approach is a relatively simple technique that should be taken into account when considering the surgical removal of cheek lipomas.

### A novel approach for treating lipomas: percutaneous microwave ablation combined with liposuction [^112vLey4]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study was designed as a non-randomized controlled trial comparing the outcomes of conventional lipoma excision surgery in 29 patients with those of 17 patients treated using a novel approach of percutaneous microwave ablation combined with liposuction for lipoma treatment. Ethical oversight was ensured through approval by Ethics Committee of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, affirming our commitment to uphold the principles of ethical research practice. Prior to treatment, informed consent was obtained from all participants, ensuring they were fully informed about the study's purposes, the nature of the procedures involved, and their rights to data protection and voluntary participation. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age over 18 years; (2) presence of a suspected lipoma based on color ultrasound examination; (3) absence of any underlying comorbidities, including known chronic diseases, cardiac conditions, and skin diseases in the treatment area; (4) no use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anticoagulants, platelet inhibitors, immunosuppressants, or similar medications within 2 months prior to enrollment.

A total of 46 patients were included in the follow-up. Among them, 17 patients underwent percutaneous microwave ablation-assisted liposuction for lipoma, while the remaining 29 patients underwent traditional surgical excision. The patients undergoing traditional surgical excision of lipoma were assigned to Group 1, while those receiving percutaneous microwave ablation-assisted liposuction were assigned to Group 2.

### Large sublingual lipoma: a case report [^115fY7Z9]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Lipomas are benign soft tissue tumors frequently observed throughout the body. Lipomas rarely cause health concerns; however, when symptomatic, it is often related to their location and size. A 65-year-old male patient presented with a non-tender, enlarging mass in the anterior floor of the mouth, which was otherwise asymptomatic. Computed tomography evaluation revealed an unusually large hypolucent mass, posterior to the inner table of the right anterior mandible. Surgical excision was uncomplicated. Upon follow-up, the right anterior floor of the mouth wound healed without compromise of the lingual or hypoglossal nerves or Wharton's duct. This discussion highlights the infrequent occurrence of lipomas in the oral cavity, particularly in the floor of the mouth, including patient presentation, preoperative evaluation, and surgical planning.

### Endoscopic resection of giant GI lipoma: a case series [^116LfpRr]. VideoGIE (2016). Low credibility.

Patient 4

A 39-year-old man consulted us because of abdominal pain and recurrent episodes of subacute intestinal obstruction. Colonoscopy showed a giant sessile lipoma 6 cm in diameter. It was located in the cecum near the valvula and was probably associated with the patient's symptoms. The resection began with preventive hemostasis by use of an Endoloop deployed around the base of the lipoma, which was very large. Then the lipoma was removed with a jumbo polypectomy snare and the application of Endocut Current. Hemostasis was completed by placing clips on the resection area. Overall, the mean diameter of the lipomas was 6.8 cm (range, 5–10 cm). We did not observe any perioperative adverse event, and the postoperative course was uneventful, with complete resolution of GI bleeding and symptoms of obstruction.

### A rapidly expanding massive lipoma of the toe [^111YbnYp]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Lipoma is one of the most common benign soft tissue tumors. The most common location of lipomas is in areas of abundant adipose tissue. Reports of a lipoma in the foot exist, but toe lipomas are rare. The case presented is one of a large, expanding lipoma engulfing the lateral aspect of the third toe and the whole of the third web space. It measured 10 cm in diameter. This was successfully removed surgically. To the best of our knowledge, the size of this lipoma is probably one of the largest ever reported in the toes of an adult.

### Our experience with the so-called pull-through technique combined with liposuction for management of gynecomastia [^112oh5R4]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Gynecomastia is a benign enlargement of male breast, common in adolescents and adults. To treat this deformity, we have been carrying out liposuction through small cutaneous incisions placed in the axilla and on the sternum. If necessary, we performed a surgical excision of glandular tissue through a periareolar incision. From 1995, we started to perform surgical excision of glandular tissue, if necessary, through the small incisions made for liposuction, thus avoiding the periareolar scars. We describe our experience with this technique, which we believe excellent for the correction of glandular and fatty glandular gynecomastia, obtaining excellent esthetic results and minimal local scarring.

### Atypical lipomatous tumors: should they be treated like other sarcoma or not? Surgical consideration from a bi-institutional experience [^115MfbbK]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

To identify the best surgical approach to atypical lipomatous tumors we reviewed 171 patients who underwent surgery at two sarcoma referral centers with different surgical policies.

Methods

Of the 151 patients (88%) with primary tumors, 95 were treated at Institution A and 76 were treated at Institution B. At Institution A, a wide surgical resection, including a slight cuff of soft tissue around the mass, was adopted, which was defined as marginal resection (MR) according to the Enneking classification. At Institution B, a simple tumor resection (SR), according to the Enneking classification, was employed. En bloc surgical resection was the goal in both centers. The primary outcomes of the study were local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), incidence of secondary dedifferentiation at recurrence, and presence of residual tumor after re-excision.

Results

Sixteen patients (9%) had local recurrence. The 10-year LRFS was 82%. No cases of secondary dedifferentiation were observed. Residual tumor after re-excision was found in 46% of cases. In univariate analysis, sclerosing subtype, tumor rupture, and SR were unfavorable prognostic factors for LRFS. Sclerosing subtype and tumor rupture were independent prognostic factors for LRFS in multivariate analysis. SR was significantly associated with tumor rupture.

Conclusions

Sclerosing subtype and tumor rupture are unfavorable prognostic factors for local recurrence. MR is associated with a lower risk of tumor rupture than SR. Neurovascular and major muscle resections are not necessary in principle. Re-excision after unplanned surgery is not always mandatory. A preoperative core needle biopsy could be useful in identifying the sclerosing subtype.

### Report of a giant invasive, wall-penetrating cardiac lipoma [^111p47it]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiac lipoma, a seldom-encountered benign tumor positioned beneath the endocardium, has the potential to impair electrophysiological functions. Diagnosis is principally based on imaging modalities. The uniqueness of this case lies in the tumor's extension both internally and externally within the right atrium, rendering it of special interest. From a clinical standpoint, surgical removal is commonly advocated, wherein early intervention is pivotal in improving patients' long-term prognoses.

Case presentation

A 35-year-old male was admitted to the hospital for treatment subsequent to the identification of a cardiac mass two days prior. Initial diagnostic assessments, encompassing CT scans and echocardiography, identified a space-occupying lesion within the heart. The patient underwent surgical excision of the cardiac tumor, utilizing mild hypothermic extracorporeal circulation via femoral vessel access. Intraoperative findings revealed adipose-like tissue of a "dumbbell-shaped" configuration situated both within and external to the right atrium, measuring approximately 8 cm*9 cm internally and 7 cm*6 cm externally, with the extracardiac mass being marginally larger. Postoperative pathological analysis confirmed a cardiac lipoma diagnosis. A follow-up echocardiogram conducted three months post-surgery exhibited no notable abnormalities. The patient is under continuous observation to monitor for any recurrence or potential long-term complications.

Conclusion

In this case report, we detail with precision a rare cardiac pathology manifested by an expansive infiltrative lipoma that pervades the endocardial and epicardial layers of the right atrium. After thorough preoperative diagnostic workup and evaluation, we contend that surgical intervention represents the optimal therapeutic approach for managing such conditions, with the goal of preemptively reducing the likelihood of cardiac compression or intracardiac obstruction.

### Successful removal of the largest reported intrathoracic lipoma with bilateral extension: a case report [^117Xbbpk]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Although intrathoracic lipoma is usually detected incidentally in a chest X-ray, a homogeneous fat attenuation mass (50–150 HU) that creates obtuse angles with the chest wall and displaces neighboring pulmonary parenchyma and arteries on a chest CT permits a conclusive diagnosis. Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly with fat saturation, is supportive in determining the lipomatous nature of the tumor. Furthermore, MRI helps to distinguish between lipomas and well-differentiated liposarcomas based on margins, signal homogeneity, and septa or nodules. Preoperative percutaneous biopsy and FNAC may not always show the presence of malignant cells due to inadequate sample and cannot completely able to exclude the presence of sarcoma.

When possible, total en-bloc excision of lipoma is the definitive treatment choice for preventing future recurrences. Complete surgical excision using the lateral thoracotomy or standard median sternotomy is the most applied surgical approach for intrathoracic lipoma. Clamshell thoracotomy has also been employed to remove the bilateral intrathoracic lipoma. Whereas, median sternotomy allows complete assessment of both chest cavities and the mediastinum, which ensures en-bloc removal of the encapsulated tumor. In our experience, lateral thoracotomy may affect the exposure in case of a large tumor, resulting in rupture of the capsule. We believe exposure is the main key to ensure en-bloc resection and choosing surgical exposure. In our previous case we did piecemeal excision of the mass through lateral thoracotomy which caused prolong intrathoracic drain. Though clamshell thoracotomy was mentioned in different articles for bilateral intrathoracic tumor, we avoided it due to our concern of upper limit of the tumor and previous disastrous postoperative experiences related to this particular approach. In the literature, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been suggested as a technique for thoracic tumors that are usually pedunculated, tiny in size, and do not have infiltrating growth.

Intraoperative problems are not infrequent because of severe adhesions with important structures caused by the mass's chronic existence in the thoracic cavity, as in our instance, where it was firmly connected to the innominate vein and superior venacva. Local recurrence of intrathoracic or mediastinal lipomas after resection is infrequent. They may, however, recur locally, and the risk of recurrence following an excision has been documented in the literature to be less than 5%. Despite the fact that intrathoracic lipomas are histologically benign, close monitoring and follow-up are required to identify any recurrence.

### Madelung disease affecting scrotal region [^112VoP1H]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Madelung disease is an uncommon disease characterized by large subcutaneous adipose masses. Mediterranean countries show higher disease incidence. We review the current concepts concerning this pathology, including etiology, diagnosis, and treatment. Madelung disease usually affects the upper half of the body, but we describe a patient with scrotal lipomas. As this location is rare, we review the cases found in literature, as well as the specific nuances regarding local symptoms and treatment.

### Atypical lipomatous masses of the extremities: outcome of surgical treatment [^1168hBkn]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2002). Low credibility.

Atypical lipomatous tumors occur predominantly in middle-aged patients and often present as painless, slow-growing masses in the extremities. The clinical outcomes of surgically treated superficial or deep atypical lipomas of the extremities were reviewed. Thirty-one patients were included in this study. There were 16 men and 15 women, with an average age of 57 years (range, 32–87 years). The mean followup was 7 years (range, 1–28.8 years). Twenty-five tumors occurred in the lower extremity and six in the upper extremity. Sixteen patients (52%) had a recurrence at an average of 4.7 years after resection. Twelve (39%) patients required additional surgical procedures to treat their tumor. Occurrence of a deep lesion and positive margins at the time of the initial surgery correlated closely with the rate of recurrence and need for additional surgical treatment. Dedifferentiation to high-grade liposarcoma developed in four (13%) patients. Atypical lipomas have a high propensity for local recurrence and a potential for malignant dedifferentiation. Patients with atypical lipomas require careful evaluation, complete surgical excision when possible, and close clinical followup extending beyond 5 years.

### Treatment… [^113j4zuY]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Lipomas are slow-growing, nearly always benign, adipose tumors that are most often found in the subcutaneous tissues. Steroid injections result in local fat atrophy, thus shrinking the lipoma. Injections are best performed on lipomas less than 1 inch in diameter. A one-to-one mixture of 1 percent lidocaine and triamcinolone acetonide, in a dosage of 10 mg per mL, is injected into the center of the lesion; this procedure may be repeated several times at monthly intervals. 8 The volume of steroid depends on the size of the lipoma, with an average of 1 to 3 mL of total volume administered. The number of injections depends on the response, which is expected to occur within three to four weeks. Complications, which are rare, are the result of the medication or the procedure, and can be prevented by injecting the smallest total amount possible and by positioning the needle so that it is in the center of the lipoma.

ENUCLEATION Small lipomas can be removed by enucleation. A 3-mm to 4-mm incision is made over the lipoma. A curette is placed inside the wound and used to free the lipoma from the surrounding tissue. Once freed, the tumor is enucleated through the incision using the curette. Sutures generally are not needed, and a pressure dressing is applied to prevent hematoma formation. EXCISION Larger lipomas are best removed through incisions made in the skin overlying the lipoma. The incisions are configured like a fusiform excision following the skin tension lines and are smaller than the underlying tumor. The central island of skin to be excised is grasped with a hemostat, or Allis clamp, which is used to provide traction for the removal of the tumor. Dissection is then performed beneath the subcutaneous fat to the tumor. Any tissue cutting is performed under direct visualization using a no. 15 scalpel or scissors around the lipoma.

Care must be taken to avoid nerves or blood vessels that may lie just beneath the tumor. Once a portion of lipoma has been dissected from the surrounding tissue, hemostats or clamps can be attached to the tumor to provide traction for removal of the remainder of the growth. Once it is freed, the lipoma is delivered as a whole.

### Techniques and tips for lipoma excision… [^111hnN3x]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

to the editor: I would like to compliment Dr. Salam on his lucid article, "Lipoma Excision. " 1 I would add a few minor facts and modifications in surgical techniques that I have found useful. Before excising a lipoma, it is important to delineate the plane of the tumor. Once that is defined, it is useful to incise through all the overlying tissues right to the pseudocapsule before attempting to dissect the tumor from the surrounding tissues. Also, as in other soft tissue tumors, I have found it easier to get to one edge of the swelling, free the base from the deeper tissues, and then tilt the tumor out of the wound. This minimizes dissection and trauma, hematoma formation, and surgical time. Lipomas at the nape of the neck are better left alone, unless they are a significant problem. In general, lipomas of the neck and back are more poorly defined than in other areas and there is no clear delineation between the subcutaneous fat and the tumor.

I prefer not to excise the overlying skin initially as Dr. Salam has indicated; rather, I would save this step until redundancy is demonstrated at the end of the procedure. By tucking one edge of the skin over the other, the exact extent of excess skin can be defined and excised. I would also like to mention a few techniques that may be advantageous. One is the "squeeze technique, " in which a small incision is made over the tumor, which is literally squeezed out through the incision. 2 Fat, being fluid at body temperature, allows itself to be manipulated in this fashion. If multiple tumors need to be excised in one sitting, this is a useful technique to master. The other is the "pot-lid" technique, which is useful in cosmetically challenging areas such as the face. 3 Using a punch to remove a circular piece of skin overlying the tumor, the lipoma is extruded through the hole. The piece of skin is then positioned over the defect and acts as a graft and minimizes scarring.

Pereira and Schonauer 4 suggest passing a gynecologic forceps through an incision placed in an aesthetically advantageous site to remove these fatty tumors to minimize unsightly scarring. Dumbbell extensions are not uncommon in lipomas and should be actively sought to avoid incomplete excision and "recurrence".

### Minimal incision extraction of lipomas… [^117DsVDK]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

© 2024 Lipomas are benign proliferations of mature fat that are occasionally tender. Common treatment approaches include elliptical excision, liposuction, and injection lipolysis. For most lipomas, we favor the minimal incision or "squeeze" technique, whereby lipomas are expressed through a small scalpel or punch incision. 1, 2 To our knowledge, the utilization rate of this simple, effective technique has not been previously studied. A survey was distributed to all 233 members of the Ohio Dermatological Association to determine if they treat lipomas. The preferred technique in several clinical scenarios was queried. Treatment choices included elliptical excision, linear incision extraction, minimal incision extraction, referral, or "other technique".

Minimal incision extraction has been adopted by many dermatologists because it is an office procedure with minimal complications, a specimen is produced to confirm the lesion's benign nature, and lipomas are slow growing and unlikely to recur quickly, even if not completely removed. Minimal incision extraction is favored compared with elliptical excision because it is quick, easily and safely performed in the office setting, and allows removal during a standard visit rather than rescheduling patients for a more time-consuming elliptical excision. Lipoma extraction through MIE is particularly easy and practical in patients with multiple painful lipomas. Our survey revealed a significant difference between the rate of dermatologist use of MIE for 1-cm and 3-cm lipomas, suggesting that practitioners find removing larger lipomas more difficult with this technique.

Certainly, larger lipomas may require dissection, piecemeal removal, or more hemostasis, and are more time consuming, but MIE is still possible and more efficient than elliptical excisions in most cases. 2 We have used MIE on lipomas of up to 14 cm. Limitations of this study include a geographically limited study population and the lack of data to discern whether respondents would choose different techniques based on body location.
