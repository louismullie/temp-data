## Question

Integrelin when why and how is yhis used

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when, why, and how Integrelin (eptifibatide) is used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what Integrelin is and its mechanism of action. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled indications and the strength of evidence. Next, I will examine when it is used in practice, including ACS and PCI scenarios, and reconcile this with contemporary guideline positions. After that, I need to check dosing, special populations, and safety, especially bleeding and thrombocytopenia. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and note any controversies or evolving evidence that might change practice.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and mechanism. Integrelin is the brand name for eptifibatide, a cyclic heptapeptide that reversibly blocks the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, thereby preventing fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation; it is rapidly reversible with a half-life around 2.5 hours and predominantly renally cleared, which matters for dosing and reversal in bleeding scenarios [^115UXutd] [^111RjbxD].

> I need to verify the labeled indications. The FDA label indicates eptifibatide to decrease death or MI in acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina/NSTEMI), whether managed medically or with PCI, and to decrease death, MI, or urgent intervention in patients undergoing PCI, including stenting; this is the regulatory foundation for its use in ACS and PCI settings [^116eVUfW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about routine use in ACS. Historically, trials like PURSUIT and ESPRIT showed benefit in ACS and PCI, respectively, supporting early eptifibatide use to reduce ischemic events, but contemporary guidelines have narrowed its role. The 2023 ESC ACS guidelines advise against pretreatment with GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors before PCI, and the 2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP guideline recommends not using GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors routinely in ACS due to lack of ischemic benefit and increased bleeding; thus, routine upfront use has fallen out of favor despite earlier positive data [^111QDg1H] [^113HEqCk] [^111cCFmj] [^1178VCsk] [^1162Mpw7].

> Let me consider when it is still appropriate. Guidelines suggest selective use in high-risk PCI scenarios with large thrombus burden, no-reflow, or distal embolization, where short-course GP IIb/IIIa inhibition may mitigate peri-procedural ischemic complications; this is a bailout or problem-solving role rather than routine pretreatment, and it aligns with the pharmacologic rationale of rapid, potent platelet inhibition in thrombotic milieus [^115t8Bsv] [^115MPDUm].

> I should double-check dosing and administration. The standard regimen is a 180 microgram/kg IV bolus, followed 10 minutes later by a second 180 microgram/kg bolus, with a continuous infusion at 2 microgram/kg/min for 18–24 hours, typically stopping after PCI when hemostasis is secured; this double-bolus strategy was designed to achieve and sustain high-grade platelet inhibition and is supported by pharmacodynamic and clinical outcome data [^1178VCsk] [^114Lnn8R].

> Wait, let me verify special populations. In obesity, standard dosing caps at 121 kg, but data suggest that using actual body weight without a cap yields higher plasma concentrations and greater platelet inhibition; however, this remains investigational and not label-defined, so I should caution that institutional protocols vary and evidence is limited pending larger studies [^116eVUfW].

> I need to ensure renal dosing is correct. Because eptifibatide is about 50% renally cleared, dose reduction is recommended in significant renal impairment; while the exact thresholds vary by protocol, many clinicians reduce the infusion rate by half for CrCl < 50 mL/min, and this aligns with the pharmacokinetic profile and safety considerations in kidney disease [^116eVUfW].

> Next, I should review safety, especially bleeding and thrombocytopenia. Meta-analyses show GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors increase risks of mild and severe thrombocytopenia, with eptifibatide having a relatively lower thrombocytopenia signal than abciximab or tirofiban, though the absolute risk remains nonzero; bleeding risk rises with femoral access, prolonged infusion, and concomitant anticoagulation, so radial access, careful sheath management, and timely de-escalation mitigate harm [^1119Y6sM] [^117LZ4NT].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. Do not use eptifibatide routinely for ACS without a plan for immediate PCI; reserve it for high-risk PCI with large thrombus, slow flow/no-reflow, or distal embolization, where a short, guideline-concordant course may reduce peri-procedural MI and bailout events. Always pair with aspirin and heparin per PCI protocols, monitor platelets for thrombocytopenia, and adjust for renal function to limit bleeding [^115t8Bsv] [^115MPDUm] [^116eVUfW].

> But wait, what if the patient is having an acute ischemic stroke? I should confirm that GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are not indicated there. The AHA/ASA stroke guideline states insufficient evidence for IV tirofiban or eptifibatide in acute ischemic stroke and advises against abciximab, so eptifibatide should not be used for stroke thrombolysis or neuroprotection outside trials [^1146S1LU].

> In summary, I need to emphasize the shift in practice: eptifibatide remains a niche, rapidly reversible GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor for selective PCI rescue in high-thrombotic-risk scenarios, grounded in FDA labeling and supported by older outcome trials, but current guidelines discourage routine ACS pretreatment because of bleeding hazards and limited incremental benefit in the modern era of potent oral P2Y12 inhibition and radial access; use it when the ischemic threat clearly outweighs the bleeding risk and follow dosing, renal adjustment, and monitoring best practices [^116eVUfW] [^111QDg1H] [^113HEqCk] [^111cCFmj].

Integrelin (eptifibatide) is a **glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor** used to prevent platelet aggregation in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [^116eVUfW]. It is indicated for **ACS without ST-elevation** (unstable angina/NSTEMI) and for **PCI**, including stenting, to reduce death, MI, or urgent revascularization [^116eVUfW]. It is given as a **double-bolus regimen** (180 mcg/kg IV bolus, then 180 mcg/kg IV bolus 10 minutes later) with a continuous infusion at 2 mcg/kg/min for 18–24 hours, adjusting for renal function and body weight [^1178VCsk] [^111RjbxD]. Use is limited by bleeding risk; monitor for thrombocytopenia and avoid in patients with active bleeding, recent major surgery, or severe renal impairment [^1119Y6sM] [^116eVUfW].

---

## Mechanism of action

Eptifibatide **reversibly blocks the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor**, preventing fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation [^112gji16]. This provides rapid, short-acting inhibition that reverses within 4–8 hours after stopping the infusion [^115UXutd].

---

## Clinical indications

Eptifibatide is **FDA-approved** for the following indications:

| **Indication** | **Clinical context** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) | Unstable angina (UA) or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), managed medically or with PCI | Reduces death or new MI [^116eVUfW] |
| Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) | Patients undergoing PCI, including intracoronary stenting | Reduces death, new MI, or urgent intervention [^116eVUfW] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **selective use** of eptifibatide:

- **ESC 2023**: Do not administer GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors routinely for pretreatment before PCI; consider only if no-reflow or thrombotic complications occur during PCI [^111QDg1H] [^115t8Bsv].
- **ACC/AHA/ACEP 2025**: Do not administer GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors routinely in ACS due to lack of ischemic benefit and increased bleeding risk [^111cCFmj].

---

## Dosage and administration

The **standard regimen** is:

- **Bolus**: 180 mcg/kg IV bolus administered immediately before PCI or at ACS diagnosis.
- **Second bolus**: 180 mcg/kg IV bolus 10 minutes after the first bolus.
- **Infusion**: 2 mcg/kg/min continuous IV infusion for 18–24 hours, concluding after PCI when hemostasis is secured.

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Reduce infusion to 1 mcg/kg/min if creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min.
- **Obesity**: Use actual body weight for dosing; capped at 121 kg in some protocols, though higher weights may require individualized dosing [^111RjbxD].
- **Platelet monitoring**: Check platelet count within 4 hours of initiation and periodically thereafter due to thrombocytopenia risk [^notfound].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **active bleeding**, a history of bleeding diathesis, severe uncontrolled hypertension, major surgery within 6 weeks, severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), or hypersensitivity to eptifibatide or its components. Use with caution in elderly patients, those with low body weight, or when combined with other anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents.

---

## Adverse effects

The most significant adverse effect is **bleeding**, including major hemorrhage and access-site complications [^117LZ4NT]. Thrombocytopenia, including severe forms, can occur and requires close monitoring [^1119Y6sM]. Hypersensitivity reactions are rare but possible.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting use

Key trials demonstrate benefit: **PURSUIT** showed reduced death or MI in ACS [^1162Mpw7], and **ESPRIT** showed reduced ischemic complications in elective PCI [^1178VCsk]. However, more recent studies and meta-analyses suggest limited incremental benefit in the era of potent oral P2Y12 inhibitors and routine radial access, reinforcing selective use [^117LZ4NT].

---

## Comparison with other glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors

Eptifibatide is **non-immunogenic and rapidly reversible**, with a shorter half-life than abciximab, allowing faster recovery of platelet function after discontinuation [^115UXutd]. Unlike abciximab, it does not cause sustained platelet inhibition or immunogenic reactions.

---

## Current role in clinical practice

Eptifibatide is now used **selectively**, primarily for high-risk PCI scenarios with large thrombus burden, no-reflow, or distal embolization, rather than routinely in ACS or elective PCI [^115t8Bsv]. Its role has diminished with the widespread adoption of potent oral P2Y12 inhibitors and radial access techniques that reduce bleeding risk [^117LZ4NT].

---

Integrelin (eptifibatide) is a **rapidly reversible GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor** used selectively in ACS and PCI to reduce ischemic events, with dosing tailored to renal function and body weight. Its use is limited by bleeding risk, and current guidelines recommend selective, rather than routine, administration.

### Maintaining fluoroquinolone class efficacy: review of influencing factors [^111cmv3k]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

An approach designed to reduce the rate at which antibiotic resistance develops is antibiotic cycling or rotation. It has been used with some success in intensive-care units (ICUs), where one class of agent has been predominantly used for a predefined period, usually 3 months, followed by use of another class for 3 months. Although not widely used, rotation has been used succesfully by Kollef et al. A second approach is the use of combination therapy, whereby the additive or synergistic action of two or more drugs is exploited. Overall, resistance potential is theoretically minimized by this technique since these agents are typically from different antimicrobial classes, and different sites in the bacterial cell are targeted. Finally, a more focused approach of using the agents that demonstrate the best pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile against suspected pathogens might also reduce antimicrobial resistance. The objective of this approach is to predictably eradicate bacteria so that resistant clones are not selected.

The fluoroquinolone class of antimicrobial agents is being used empirically in an increasing number of patients because resistance has developed to the more traditional empiric agents. Fluoroquinolones are active against a wide range of multiresistant pathogens since their mode of action is against different molecular targets than other antimicrobial classes. Moreover, mechanisms of resistance to fluoroquinolones, apart from two unusual exceptions, are unlike almost all other class resistance mechanisms, being neither plasmid nor integron mediated.

We propose a strategy to preserve susceptibilities to this important antimicrobial class. Appropriate and targeted use of the fluoroquinolone class is discussed and analyzed within the context of in vitro, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic activity. The epidemiologic and clinical aspects of fluoroquinolone usage are outlined in an attempt to identify outcome-optimizing drug selection strategies. Finally, once fluoroquinolone therapy has been chosen, evidence-based strategies for how this antimicrobial class can be used to minimize development of drug resistance are discussed.

### Platelet glycoprotein IIb / IIIa antagonists: lessons learned from clinical trials and future directions [^112gji16]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Platelets play an important role in the pathophysiology of acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and ischemic stroke. The expression of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (alphaIIb/beta3 integrin) receptor on the surface of activated platelets constitutes the common pathway for platelet aggregation. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa has low affinity for its soluble ligands (fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor) in resting platelets. In the setting of vascular injury, platelet activation occurs after binding of the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V receptor to von Willebrand factor in the extracellular matrix (at high shear rate) and binding of soluble agonists to specific platelet membrane receptors. The ensuing inside-out signaling increases several-fold the affinity and avidity of alphaIIb/beta3 for its ligands. High affinity ligand binding to alphaIIb/beta3 triggers outside-in signaling, causing microskeletal contraction and platelet retraction. The signaling pathways for inside-out and outside-in signaling are incompletely understood. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists were developed under the premise that these agents would abrogate platelet aggregation while preserving platelet monolayer deposition at sites of injury. A number of parenteral and oral agents have been developed and evaluated in clinical trials. Three of them are approved in the United States and other countries: abciximab (ReoPro; the Fab fragment of a chimeric human-mouse antibody), eptifibatide (Integrelin; a cyclic heptapeptide), and tirofiban (Aggrastat; a tyrosine-derived nonpeptide molecule). The greatest clinical impact of these parenteral agents (used in conjunction with aspirin and heparin) has been in the prevention of ischemic complications after percutaneous coronary intervention. In contrast, oral agents have yielded disappointing results in the secondary prevention of acute coronary syndromes, and none of them are approved at present. Eptifibatide and tirofiban are specific for alphaIIb/beta3, whereas abciximab also exhibits cross-reactivity with the alphavbeta3 and alphaMbeta2 integrins. Although alphaIIb/beta3 is unique to platelets and megakaryocytes, alphavbeta3 is more widely distributed and mediates several functions, including endothelial cell migration, monocyte adhesion, angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis. alphaMbeta2 mediates leukocyte-platelet interactions. In the percutaneous coronary intervention trials, abciximab has been more efficacious than the other parenteral agents, perhaps because of cross-reactivity with these other integrins, the pharmacodynamic profile of abciximab, or other effects. Other documented effects of abciximab include acute dethrombosis, reduction of thrombin generation, and improved flow in the coronary microcirculation after percutaneous coronary intervention. Abciximab is presently under evaluation in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Promising data have been obtained in experimental models of tumor angiogenesis and sickle cell anemia.

Overall Incidence

A meta‐analysis of 29 randomized studies of 123 419 patients treated with the currently available intravenous agents and 4 oral agents that were studied but never approved for clinical use found unweighted incidence values for mild thrombocytopenia (< 100 000 platelets/μL) of 3.3% in GPI‐treated patients and 2.2% in placebo‐treated patients (relative risk [RR], 1.63 [95% CI, 1.48–1.79]); for severe thrombocytopenia (< 50 000 platelets/μL) the results were 0.8% and 0.2% (RR, 3.51 [95% CI, 2.68–4.58]). An analysis limited to the 3 approved GPIs, abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban, found similar RR values of 1.61 (95% CI, 1.46–1.78) and 3.9 (95% CI, 3.08–4.95), respectively, for mild and severe thrombocytopenia. Subgroup analyses identified increased RR of mild thrombocytopenia for abciximab (2.93 [95% CI, 2.43–3.52]) and tirofiban (2.79 [95% CI, 1.17–6.63]), but not eptifibatide (1.05 [95% CI, 0.86–1.29]). One confounding factor in comparing different trials is the higher rate of thrombocytopenia in the placebo groups of studies of patients with acute coronary syndromes compared with studies of patients undergoing elective PCI. The difference has been postulated to be due to longer duration heparin therapy in the former studies and the known impact of heparin on developing mild thrombocytopenia. If GPIs prevent some of the mild thrombocytopenia associated with heparin therapy, comparing the rates of thrombocytopenia in the GPI group to the placebo group may underestimate the frequency of GPI‐associated thrombocytopenia. Consistent with such a hypothesis is the finding that in the 9217‐patient PURSUIT (Platelet Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin Therapy) acute coronary artery study, although the overall frequency of thrombocytopenia was indistinguishable between eptifibatide‐treated and control patients, the onset of thrombocytopenia was more rapid with eptifibatide treatment. For context, all 3 GPIs appear on lists of the drugs most commonly associated with thrombocytopenia.

### Differential antiplatelet effects of various glycoprotein IIb-IIIa antagonists [^111ARgtR]. Thrombosis Research (2001). Low credibility.

The blockade of platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (GPIIb-IIIa) was recently introduced as a new antiplatelet strategy. At present, various GPIIb-IIIa inhibitors are available to treat patients with acute coronary syndrome or when undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions. The current study systematically evaluates the antiplatelet effects of GPIIb-IIIa inhibitors in clinical use. Using conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies [ligand-induced binding sites (LIBS-1), PMI-1] and flow cytometry, we showed that the GPIIb-IIIa antagonists abciximab, integrelin, lamifiban, and tirofiban, but not EMD 122347 or YM 337, induced LIBS activity of platelet GPIIb-IIIa. The LIBS activity of GPIIb-IIIa antagonists correlates with a proaggregatory response of fixed platelets pretreated with GPIIb-IIIa antagonists (intrinsic activity). All tested GPIIb-IIIa antagonists completely inhibit concentration-dependent ADP (20 micromol/l)-induced aggregation. In contrast, substantial TRAP (25 micromol/l)-induced platelet aggregation still occurs even at high inhibitor concentrations of the tested GPIIb-IIIa antagonists. In addition, we show that GPIIb-IIIa antagonists are poor inhibitors of platelet release reaction (ATP and P-selectin secretion) especially when strong agonists such as TRAP are used to activate platelets. Inhibition of platelet procoagulant activity (thrombin generation) by GPIIb-IIIa antagonists is dependent on the type and concentration of antagonists and on the strength of stimulus (thrombin, tissue factor) used to induce platelet-dependent thrombin generation. The present data show that significant pharmacological differences exist between GPIIb-IIIa antagonists that may have consequences for antithrombotic strategies and for future drug development.

### Comparison of effectiveness of enoxaparin versus unfractionated heparin to reduce silent and clinically apparent acute myocardial infarction in patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome [^111icsTX]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Electrocardiographic (ECG) estimates of myocardial infarct size based on the Selvester ECG score have been shown to predict mortality and left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This score has also been used to identify not clinically apparent AMI ("silent" AMI) and to determine treatment effect, suggesting it could serve as a clinical trial end point. The objective of this study was to compare the rate of silent AMI as measured by the Selvester QRS score in patients with a non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome treated with enoxaparin versus intravenous unfractionated heparin who were participating in a continuous ECG monitoring substudy of the Efficacy and Safety of Subcutaneous Enoxaparin in Non-Q-wave Coronary Events study (ESSENCE) and INTegrelin and Enoxaparin Randomized Assessment of acute Coronary syndrome Treatment trial (INTERACT). Enoxaparin was associated with a 56% relative risk decrease in silent AMI at 96 hours compared with unfractionated heparin (2.7% vs 6.1% p = 0.03). Similarly, enoxaparin decreased Holter-detected myocardial ischemia compared with unfractionated heparin (18.7% vs 35.9%, p = 0.03). In conclusion, enoxaparin significantly decreased the composite of silent AMI or clinical AMI and death at 1 year (9.3% vs 21%, p = 0.0001).

### Optimal duration of eptifibatide infusion in percutaneous coronary intervention (an ESPRIT substudy) [^111DSYCY]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Although randomized trials have clearly demonstrated the clinical efficacy with regimens of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists that result in > 80% inhibition of baseline platelet aggregation in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), there are no data available concerning the optimal duration of infusion of these agents. In an era when the length of hospitalization has a major impact on health care costs, the determination of the optimal duration of the infusion of these drugs after PCI is of great relevance. The investigators therefore sought to determine the optimal length of the infusion of eptifibatide after PCI by analyzing the outcomes of patients enrolled in the Enhanced Suppression of the Platelet IIb/IIIa Receptor With Integrilin Therapy trial who were randomized to treatment with eptifibatide.

### Eptifibatide and low-dose tissue plasminogen activator in acute myocardial infarction: the integrilin and low-dose thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction (INTRO AMI) trial [^113AoJPG]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that eptifibatide and reduced-dose tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) will enhance infarct artery patency at 60 min in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Background

Combination fibrin and platelet lysis improves epicardial and myocardial reperfusion in AMI.

Methods

Patients were enrolled in a dose finding (Phase A, n = 344) followed by a dose confirmation (Phase B, n = 305) protocol. All patients received aspirin and weight-adjusted heparin and underwent angiography at 60 and 90 min. In Phase A, eptifibatide in a single or double bolus (30 min apart) of 180, 180/90 or 180/180 microg/kg followed by an infusion of 1.33 or 2.0 microg/kg per min was sequentially added to 25 or 50 mg of t-PA. In Phase B, patients were randomized to: 1) double-bolus eptifibatide 180/90 (30 min apart) and 1.33 microg/kg per min infusion with 50 mg t-PA (Group I); 2) 180/90 (10 min apart) and 2.0 g/kg per min with 50 mg t-PA (Group II); or 3) full-dose, weight-adjusted t-PA (Group III).

Results

In Phase A, the best rate of Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade 3 was achieved using 180/90/1.33 microg/kg per min eptifibatide with 50 mg t-PA: 65% and 78% at 60 and 90 min, respectively. In Phase B, the incidence of TIMI flow grade 3 at 60 min was 42%, 56% and 40%, for Groups I through III, respectively (p = 0.04, Group II vs. Group III). The median corrected TIMI frame count was 38, 33 and 50, respectively (p = 0.02). TIMI major bleeding was reported in 8%, 11% and 6%, respectively; intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 1%, 3% and 2% of patients (p > 0.5 for both). The incidences of death (4%, 5% and 7%), reinfarction or revascularization at 30 days were similar among the three treatment groups.

Conclusions

In comparison with standard t-PA regimen, double-bolus eptifibatide (10 min apart) with a 48-h infusion and half-dose t-PA (Group II) is associated with improved quality and speed of reperfusion. The safety profile of this therapy is similar to that of other combination regimens.

Extrapolation to other indications

Another question raised regarding biosimilars relates to the extrapolation of clinical data, a process that may allow the approval of a product for use in indications in which it has not been evaluated in clinical trials. The validity of data extrapolation is dependent on the biosimilar having the same mechanism of action as the originator, and the mechanism of action being the same in different indications. As such, data extrapolation is generally considered rational and appropriate by the EMA when comparability between a biosimilar and originator in one indication can be reasonably assumed to be extended to other indications for which the originator is approved.

In the case of biosimilar G-CSF, approval has been primarily on the basis of studies in healthy volunteers and for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. However, since approval is given for the same indications as the originator, biosimilar G-CSF can also be used for peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilisation, including neutrophil recovery after stem cell transplantation. Extrapolation to all indications of the reference product was considered acceptable on the basis of phase I data especially since comparable receptor site kinetics of the two products indicate that the mode of action is the same for both, i.e. direct stimulation of bone marrow cells through the G-CSF surface receptor.

### Novel dosing regimen of eptifibatide in planned coronary stent implantation (ESPRIT): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^1178VCsk]. Lancet (2000). Excellent credibility.

Background

The platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, although effective in reducing ischaemic complications of percutaneous coronary intervention, are used in few coronary stent implantation procedures. ESPRIT (Enhanced Suppression of the Platelet IIb/IIIa Receptor with Integrilin Therapy) is a randomised, placebo-controlled trial to assess whether a novel, double-bolus dose of eptifibatide could improve outcomes of patients undergoing coronary stenting.

Methods

We recruited 2064 patients undergoing stent implantation in a native coronary artery. Immediately before percutaneous coronary intervention, patients were randomly allocated to receive eptifibatide, given as two 180 microg/kg boluses 10 min apart and a continuous infusion of 2.0 microg/kg/min for 18–24 h, or placebo, in addition to aspirin, heparin, and a thienopyridine. The primary endpoint was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, urgent target vessel revascularisation, and thrombotic bailout glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy within 48 h after randomisation. The key secondary endpoint was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, or urgent target vessel revascularisation at 30 days.

Findings

The trial was terminated early for efficacy. The primary endpoint was reduced from 10.5% (108 of 1024 patients on placebo [95% CI 8.7–12.4%]) to 6.6% (69 of 1040 [5.1–8.1%]) with treatment (p = 0.0015). The key 30 day secondary endpoint was also reduced, from 10.5% (107 of 1024 patients on placebo [8.6–12.3%]) to 6.8% (71 of 1040 [5.3–8.4%]; p = 0.0034). There was consistency in reduction of events across all components of the composite endpoint and among the major subgroups. Major bleeding was infrequent but arose more often with eptifibatide than placebo (1.3%, 13 of 1040 [0.7–2.1%]) vs 0.4%, 4 of 1024 [0.1–1.0%]; p = 0.027).

Interpretation

Routine glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor pretreatment with eptifibatide substantially reduces ischaemic complications in coronary stent intervention and is better than a strategy of reserving treatment to the bailout situation.

### The kinetics of integrilin limited by obesity: a multicenter randomized pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic clinical trial [^111RjbxD]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

KILO tested 2 novel weight-based eptifibatide dosing strategies compared with standard dosing in obese patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Eptifibatide dosing is weight adjusted for patients up to 121 kg. Patients above this weight receive the same maximal dose, although it is unknown if this provides adequate eptifibatide concentration or platelet inhibition.

Methods

Sixty-seven patients weighing ≥ 125 kg undergoing elective PCI were randomized to 1 of 3 eptifibatide dosing regimens: standard dosing using a weight of 121 kg, actual body weight (ABW)-based dosing with no upper limit, or ideal body weight (IBW)-based dosing. Boluses of 180 μg/kg were given 10 minutes apart, followed by a 2.0 μg/kg per minute infusion. Plasma eptifibatide concentrations were drawn at 12 to 18 hours after initiating the infusion. Platelet aggregation was assessed at baseline and 10 minutes after the second bolus.

Results

Sixty-seven patients were randomized to standard (n = 22), ABW (n = 23), or IBW (n = 22) dosing. The median (25th, 75th) steady-state plasma eptifibatide concentrations were 1,740 ng/mL (1,350, 2,350), 1,780 ng/mL (1,510, 2,350), and 1,055 ng/mL (738, 1,405), respectively (P < .001). Ten-minute median (25th, 75th) platelet aggregation units were 7 (0, 21), 2 (0, 8), and 14 (8, 20), respectively (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Actual body weight eptifibatide dosing leads to higher plasma concentrations and greater platelet inhibition than standard or IBW dosing in obese patients undergoing PCI. Current recommendations for eptifibatide dosing may be inadequate in patients > 121 kg. Further study is warranted to define the optimal dosing of eptifibatide and other medications in obese patients.

### Telavancin hydrochloride (Vibativ) [^114fggR7]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Telavancin is a semisynthetic, lipoglycopeptide antibiotic. Telavancin exerts concentration-dependent, bactericidal activity against Gram-positive organisms in vitro, as demonstrated by time-kill assays and MBC/MIC (minimum bactericidal concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration) ratios using broth dilution methodology. In vitro studies demonstrated a telavancin post-antibiotic effect ranging from 1 to 6 hours against S. aureus and other Grampositive pathogens.

Mechanism of Action

Telavancin inhibits cell wall biosynthesis by binding to late-stage peptidoglycan precursors, including lipid II. Telavancin also binds to the bacterial membrane and disrupts membrane barrier function.

Interactions with Other Antibacterial Drugs

In vitro investigations demonstrated no antagonism between telavancin and amikacin, aztreonam, cefepime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, rifampin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole when tested in various combinations against telavancin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci. This information is not available for other bacteria.

Cross-Resistance

Some vancomycin-resistant enterococci have a reduced susceptibility to telavancin. There is no known crossresistance between telavancin and other classes of antibacterial drugs.

Antibacterial Activity

Telavancin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the Indications and Usage section [see Indications and Usage (1)]:

Gram-Positive Bacteria

Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant isolates)

Entero c occus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only)

Streptococcus agalactiae

Streptococcus anginosus group (includes S. anginosus, S. intermedius, and S. constellatus)

Streptococcus pyogenes

Greater than 90% of the following microorganisms exhibit an in vitro MIC less than or equal to the telavancinsusceptible breakpoint for organisms of similar genus. The safety and effectiveness of telavancin in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Gram-Positive Bacteria

Enterococcus faecium (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only)

Staphylococcus haemolyticus

Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis

Staphylococcus epidermidis

### Primary percutaneous coronary angioplasty with and without eptifibatide in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a safety and efficacy study of integrilin-facilitated versus primary percutaneous coronary intervention in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (ASSIST) [^111JUnRM]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Primary percutaneous coronary intervention, if performed promptly, is the preferred strategy to restore flow to the infarct-related artery in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. We sought to determine whether eptifibatide, a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, given before catheterization would improve clinical outcomes in patients referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention.

Methods and Results

We randomly assigned a total of 400 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention to treatment initiated before cardiac catheterization, with either heparin plus eptifibatide (201 patients) or heparin alone (199 patients), in addition to oral aspirin (160 mg) and high-dose clopidogrel (600 mg). The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause, recurrent myocardial infarction, or recurrent severe ischemia during the first 30 days after randomization. At 30 days, the primary end point was reached by 13 patients (6.47%) assigned to heparin plus eptifibatide and by 11 patients (5.53%) assigned to heparin alone (relative risk, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.52 to 2.70; P = 0.69). The rates of major or minor bleeding were higher in patients assigned to heparin plus eptifibatide than that in patients assigned to heparin alone (22.4% versus 14.6%; relative risk, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.83; P = 0.04).

Conclusions

In patients pretreated with high-dose clopidogrel who were referred for primary PCI, treatment with heparin plus eptifibatide, when compared with heparin alone, did not improve clinical outcomes and was associated with more bleeding complications.

### Early angioplasty in acute coronary syndromes without persistent ST-segment elevation improves outcome but increases the need for six-month repeat revascularization: an analysis of the PURSUIT trial. platelet glycoprotein IIB / IIIA in unstable angina: receptor suppression using integrilin therapy [^115dmFcH]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

We explored the effect of timing of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) without persistent ST-segment elevation on the need for repeat revascularization, and we related this effect to other events.

Background

Percutaneous coronary intervention is widely used to treat ACS without persistent ST-segment elevation. Moreover, restenosis and subsequent revascularization after PCI are more frequent in ACS than in stable angina. The optimal timing of PCI in ACS without persistent ST-segment elevation is unknown.

Methods

In the Platelet glycoprotein IIB/IIIA in Unstable angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin Therapy (PURSUIT) database, patients were stratified by the time of PCI. In the PURSUIT trial, 9,461 patients received a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, eptifibatide or placebo for 72 h. The investigators decided on other treatments.

Results

A total of 2,430 patients underwent PCI within 30 days. Repeat revascularization (during 165 days) was notably higher for PCI within 24 h of enrollment (n = 620 [19%]) than for PCI at 24 to 72 h (n = 624 [16.7%]), 3 to 7 days (n = 614 [13.2%]), or 8 to 30 days (n = 561 [7.7%]; p < 0.001), regardless of eptifibatide use. This gradual reduction in the revascularization rate for later PCI was also observed after multivariate analysis correcting for baseline characteristics and with time as a continuous variable.

Conclusions

Percutaneous coronary intervention within 24 is associated with improved outcome (other analysis) but more repeat revascularization. Prospective analyses are needed to test the hypothesis that rapid PCI in ACS with a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist reduces myocardial infarction (and possibly death) and is therefore most suited for patients at highest risk of infarction, despite a higher need for repeat revascularization.

### Prognostic importance of concomitant heparin with eptifibatide in acute coronary syndromes. PURSUIT investigators. platelet glycoprotein IIb / IIIa in unstable angina: receptor suppression using integrilin therapy [^116WQHeR]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors have been extensively studied in the treatment of patients with ischemic heart disease. Data regarding the use of these agents in the absence of concomitant intravenous heparin have been conflicting. We sought to determine, using propensity analysis, whether the benefit of eptifibatide, a IIb/IIIa inhibitor, in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes is affected by the concurrent administration of heparin. By trial design, patients were randomized to either eptifibatide or placebo, whereas use of intravenous heparin was left to the discretion of treating physicians. The effect of eptifibatide on the 30-day composite end point of death or myocardial infarction was studied in patients who received heparin and those who did not. Propensity analysis methods were used to control for confounding and presumed selection biases. Among 5,576 patients who were receiving heparin when the bolus dose of the study drug was administered, eptifibatide was associated with a reduced composite end point rate (13%) compared with that of placebo (14.5% vs 16.6%, p = 0.03). In contrast, among 1,441 patients who were not receiving heparin, there was no difference in 30-day event rates with eptifibatide compared with placebo (13.7% vs 13.1%, p > 0.7). After a propensity score for use of heparin was developed, however, use of heparin did not affect the reduced risk associated with eptifibatide (adjusted relative risk [RR] for heparin-eptifibatide interaction term 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61 to 1.32, p > 0.5), but the propensity for heparin use was a strong predictor of events (adjusted RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.17, p < 0.001). The use of eptifibatide independently predicted a lower risk of events (adjusted RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.93, p = 0.04). Thus, the apparent positive impact of heparin on the benefits of eptifibatide therapy was largely due to confounding and bias.

### Effect of eptifibatide on angiographic complications during percutaneous coronary intervention in the IMPACT – (integrilin to minimize platelet aggregation and coronary thrombosis) II trial [^111Gojda]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

We sought to determine whether eptifibatide reduces elevation of creatine kinase (CK)-MB isoenzyme release during coronary intervention by preventing angiographic complications, by minimizing the sequelae of angiographic complications once they occur, or by other mechanisms. In the Integrilin to Minimize Platelet Aggregation and Coronary Thrombosis trial, patients underwent coronary intervention during treatment with placebo versus the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor eptifibatide. Eptifibatide decreased ischemic complications at 24 hours and 30 days. CK-MB elevations and in-laboratory angiographic complications (including major dissection, distal embolization, residual thrombus, abrupt closure, residual stenosis > 50%, and side branch occlusion) were prospectively recorded. The incidence of any angiographic complication was lower in eptifibatide-treated patients (33%) than in placebo-treated patients (38%, p = 0.019). For patients with angiographic complications, there was a trend toward a reduced incidence of any elevation in CK-MB in the first 24 hours (29%, 135/0.75 eptifibatide dose; 33%, 135/0.5 eptifibatide dose; 37%, placebo). Among patients without angiographic complications, there was a similar trend toward fewer abnormal CK-MB levels in patients receiving eptifibatide (17% and 18% in eptifibatide arms vs 21% placebo). Thus, eptifibatide reduces angiographically evident complications during coronary intervention, but this effect accounts for only 1/3 of the reduced frequency of CK-MB elevations observed with eptifibatide. When angiographic complications occur, eptifibatide reduces rates of subsequent CK-MB elevation, accounting for another 1/3 of the reduction in CK-MB elevations. Finally, eptifibatide reduces the incidence of periprocedural CK-MB elevations in patients without angiographically evident complications, accounting for 1/3 of eptifibatide's overall effect in reducing of CK-MB elevations in patients undergoing percutanous coronary intervention.

### Assessing the role of eptifibatide in patients with diffuse coronary disease undergoing drug-eluting stenting: the INtegrilin plus STenting to avoid myocardial necrosis trial [^111mBpNw]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal antiplatelet regimen in elective patients undergoing complex percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) is uncertain. We aimed to assess the impact of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GpIIb/IIIa) inhibition with eptifibatide in clinically stable subjects with diffuse coronary lesions.

Methods

Patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing PCI by means of implantation of > 33 mm of drug-eluting stent were single-blindedly randomized to heparin plus eptifibatide versus heparin alone. The primary end point was the rate of abnormal post-PCI creatine kinase-MB mass values. Secondary end points were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) (ie, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or urgent revascularization) and MACE plus bailout GpIIb/IIIa inhibitor use.

Results

The study was stopped for slow enrollment and funding issues after including a total of 91 patients: 44 were randomized to heparin plus eptifibatide, and 47, to heparin alone. Analysis for the primary end point showed a trend toward lower rates of abnormal post-PCI creatine kinase-MB mass values in the heparin-plus-eptifibatide group (18 [41%]) versus the heparin-alone group (26 [55%], relative risk 0.74 [95% CI 0.48–1.15], P = 0.169). Similar nonstatistically significant trends were found for rates of MACE, their components, or MACE plus bailout GpIIb/IIIa inhibitors (all P > .05). Notably, heparin plus eptifibatide proved remarkably safe because major bleedings or minor bleeding was uncommon and nonsignificantly different in both groups (all P > .05).

Conclusions

Given its lack of statistical power, the INSTANT study cannot definitively provide evidence against or in favor of routine eptifibatide administration in stable patients undergoing implantation of multiple drug-eluting stent for diffuse coronary disease. However, the favorable trend evident for the primary end point warrants further larger randomized studies.

### Antistaphylococcal agents [^113F7t6A]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

These are interesting times in the treatment of infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, with shifting epidemiology of antibiotic resistance; changing prevalence of clinical syndromes (probably reflecting changes in virulence of circulating strains); and the recent availability of a variety of new agents with activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive cocci. The abundance of riches in new drugs for the multidrug-resistant gram-positive space is timely, and these agents show great potential, but as yet have incompletely tested durability and comparative efficacy. This article reviews the advantages and disadvantages of a variety of antistaphylococcal agents by providing basic information including mechanism of action; mechanisms of resistance; clinical use (including dosing for and data supporting common indications); drug toxicities; and major drug interactions.

### Design and methodology of the ESPRIT trial: evaluating a novel dosing regimen of eptifibatide in percutaneous coronary intervention [^112kdNxb]. American Heart Journal (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical trials of the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors have shown that these potent antiplatelet agents are effective in reducing the ischemic complications of percutaneous coronary interventions. However, even though stents are now implanted in > 75% of percutaneous interventional procedures, only one study, a trial of the monoclonal antibody abciximab, has formally evaluated adjunctive GP IIb/IIIa inhibition in this setting.

Methods and Results

Eptifibatide, a nonimmunogenic and rapidly reversible inhibitor of the platelet receptor integrin IIb/IIIa, has also undergone evaluation as an adjunct to coronary intervention. In clinical trials performed heretofore, however, it has appeared to have less relative clinical efficacy than the monoclonal antibody abciximab. Since the early seminal trials, it has been recognized that the doses of eptifibatide previously used achieved only 30% to 50% of maximal platelet GP IIb/IIIa integrin inhibition. This is considerably less than the 80% level of receptor inhibition that has been proposed to prevent coronary thrombus formation in animal models and that has been achieved in clinical trials with abciximab.

Conclusions

The Enhanced Suppression of the Platelet IIb/IIIa Receptor with Integrilin Therapy (ESPRIT) trial was designed to test the safety and efficacy of a high-dose, "180/2.0/180" double-bolus regimen of eptifibatide (a 180-microg/kg bolus followed 10 minutes later by a second 180-microg/kg bolus of eptifibatide combined with a 2.0-microg/kg per minute infusion) as an adjunct to nonacute percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation. In this report, we review the rationale, design, and methods of this clinical investigation.

### Combination reperfusion therapy with eptifibatide and reduced-dose tenecteplase for ST-elevation myocardial infarction: results of the integrilin and tenecteplase in acute myocardial infarction (INTEGRITI) phase II angiographic trial [^1172oCtK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to evaluate combinations of eptifibatide with reduced-dose tenecteplase (TNK) in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Background

Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors enhance thrombolysis. The role of combination therapy in clinical practice remains to be established.

Methods

Patients (n = 438) with STEMI < 6 h were enrolled. In dose-finding, 189 patients were randomized to different combinations of double-bolus eptifibatide and reduced-dose TNK. In dose-confirmation, 249 patients were randomized 1:1 to eptifibatide 180 microg/kg bolus, 2 microg/kg/min infusion, and 180 microg/kg bolus 10 min later (180/2/180) plus half-dose TNK (0.27 mg/kg) or standard-dose (0.53 mg/kg) TNK monotherapy. All patients received aspirin and unfractionated heparin (60 U/kg bolus; infusion 7 U/kg/h [combination], 12 U/kg/h [monotherapy]). The primary end point was Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 3 epicardial flow at 60 min.

Results

In dose-finding, TIMI grade 3 flow rates were similar across groups (64% to 68%). Arterial patency was highest for eptifibatide 180/2/180 plus half-dose TNK (96%, p = 0.02 vs. eptifibatide 180/2/90 plus half-dose TNK). In dose-confirmation, this combination, compared with TNK monotherapy, tended to achieve more TIMI 3 flow (59% vs. 49%, p = 0.15), arterial patency (85% vs. 77%, p = 0.17), and ST-segment resolution (median 71% vs. 61%, p = 0.08) but was associated with more major hemorrhage (7.6% vs. 2.5%, p = 0.14) and transfusions (13.4% vs. 4.2%, p = 0.02). Intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 1.0%, 0.6%, and 1.7% of patients treated with any combination, eptifibatide 180/2/180 and half-dose TNK, and TNK monotherapy, respectively.

Conclusions

Double-bolus eptifibatide (180/2/180) plus half-dose TNK tended to improve angiographic flow and ST-segment resolution compared with TNK monotherapy but was associated with more transfusions and non-cerebral bleeding. Further study is needed before this combination can be recommended for general use.

### Early eptifibatide improves TIMI 3 patency before primary percutaneous coronary intervention for acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: results of the randomized integrilin in acute myocardial infarction (INTAMI) pilot trial [^1166eaBr]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

Adjunctive therapy with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors has been shown to reduce ischaemic complications and improve clinical outcome in patients with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute ST elevation myocardial infarction. Little is known about the use of eptifibatide in this setting.

Methods and Results

One hundred and two patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction < 12 h scheduled for primary percutaneous intervention were randomly assigned to early eptifibatide given in the emergency room (early) or optional eptifibatide at the time of PCI (late or no). Primary endpoint was the patency of the infarct vessel before PCI. Patients in the early group received their first eptifibatide bolus, a mean of 45 min before angiography. TIMI 3 patency before PCI was observed in 34% in the early group and 10% in late or no group (P = 0.01). The incidence of complete ST resolution 1 h after PCI was 61% in early group and 66% in the late or no group, respectively (P = n.s.). There were no significant differences in the rates of TIMI 3 flow after PCI, death, reinfarction, stroke, and major bleeding complications until day 30.

Conclusion

In this pilot trial, double bolus eptifibatide given in the emergency room improved TIMI 3 grade flow of the infarct-related coronary artery before PCI. These results should be confirmed in a larger trial and whether this advantage translates into an improvement in clinical outcome should be tested in a trial with primary clinical endpoints.

### Unmasking the ancestral activity of integron integrases reveals a smooth evolutionary transition during functional innovation [^113QDWaM]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Tyrosine (Y)-recombinases mediate recombination between two specific DNA sites to deliver a variety of biological functions (for a review see (ref.)). They are present in the three domains of life but are most widespread among prokaryotes, where they play fundamental roles such as the integration/excision of viral genomes, the alternation of gene expressionand the resolution of deleterious chromosome dimers arising during replication. Members of this family show a conserved fold of the catalytic domain including a three-dimensional clustering of highly conserved RKHRH residues. Y-recombinases typically recognize specific DNA sites comprising two inverted binding domains separated by a 6–8 bp spacer. The recombination reaction is a stepwise process that starts with the cleavage and transfer of one strand, leading to the transient formation of a Holliday junction (HJ) that is further resolved through a second exchange of strands. This sequence of steps, which we will refer to as the classical pathway (Fig. 1a), is highly conserved among Y-recombinases. Type IB topoisomerases and telomere resolvases share the fold and catalytic chemistry, and can therefore be considered as distant relatives within the same superfamily, despite sequence divergence. This implies that recombinases have evolved to deliver mechanistically distinct reactions (for example, the cleavage of only one strand by topoisomerases), and to recognize structurally different substrates (for example, hairpins in telomeres). Such evolvability is likely facilitated by the robustness of the fold(its capacity to accommodate mutations while preserving its tertiary structure), as well as the modularity of protein function through the combination of different functional domains. Nevertheless, information on evolutionary pathways that enable functional innovation among these enzymes is scarce.

Homocysteinuria is a rare inborn error of metabolism known to be associated with an increased risk of vascular events. A 36-year-old Caucasian man presented with a 2 day history of epigastric discomfort associated with nausea and sweating. He has a history of homocysteinuria and had been poorly compliant with treatment. An ECG showed ST-segment elevation and Q-waves in anterior leads. Blood tests showed markedly elevated high-sensitivity troponin and high homocysteine levels. He had a failed primary percutaneous coronary intervention due to extensive thrombus in the left anterior descending artery, which was aspirated and he received integrelin infusion for 48 h. Echocardiogram showed mild-to-moderate impairment of left ventricular function with apical akinesis extending to the mid-portion of anteroseptal walls consistent with anterior myocardial infarction. He was started on homocysteine-lowering treatment with betaine and folic acid. He is now on follow-up with clinical chemistry and cardiac rehabilitation.

### Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of higher-dose, double-bolus eptifibatide in percutaneous coronary intervention [^114Lnn8R]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmacodynamics of eptifibatide, a cyclic heptapeptide antagonist of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, are substantially altered by anticoagulants that chelate calcium, resulting in overestimation ex vivo of the in vivo effects of this agent. We conducted a dose-ranging study to characterize the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of eptifibatide under physiological conditions.

Methods and Results

Patients (n = 39) undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention were randomly assigned to an eptifibatide bolus followed by an infusion (180-microgram/kg bolus followed by 2 microgram/kg per minute or 250-microgram/kg bolus followed by 3 microgram/kg per minute) for 18 to 24 hours. In a 2:1 ratio, these patients received either a second bolus of eptifibatide (90 microgram/kg or 125 microgram/kg for the initial 180-microgram/kg or 250-microgram/kg groups, respectively) or placebo 30 minutes after the initial bolus. Bleeding times, ex vivo platelet aggregation, receptor occupancy, and plasma eptifibatide levels at baseline and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours were evaluated. Platelet inhibition was dose dependent and > 80% in all groups by steady state. The single-bolus regimens had a transient loss of inhibition at 1 hour, consistent with rapid distribution and drug elimination. Pharmacokinetic modeling suggested that optimal dosing of eptifibatide would be obtained with a 180-microgram/kg bolus and a 2-microgram/kg per minute infusion followed by a second 180-microgram/kg bolus 10 minutes later.

Conclusions

A novel higher-dose, double-bolus regimen of eptifibatide in coronary intervention attains and maintains > 90% inhibition of platelet aggregation in > 90% of patients, providing the pharmacodynamic construct for the design of the Enhanced Suppression of the Platelet IIb/IIIa Receptor with Integrilin Therapy (ESPRIT) trial of adjunctive eptifibatide in coronary stent implantation.

### Therapeutic value of eptifibatide at community hospitals transferring patients to tertiary referral centers early after admission for acute coronary syndromes. PURSUIT investigators [^1162Mpw7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to evaluate the benefits of the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antagonist, eptifibatide, after patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) were admitted to hospitals that approach revascularization for ACS through early transfer to tertiary referral centers.

Background

Across a variety of hospital settings, GP IIb/IIIa inhibition, after patients were admitted to the hospital for non-ST segment elevation ACS, is associated with a reduction in death or myocardial infarction (MI) before and during a percutaneous coronary intervention.

Methods

The outcomes of 429 patients from 153 sites in the Platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in unstable angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin Therapy (PURSUIT) trial, who were transferred during study drug infusion ("transfer patients"), were compared with those of 1,987 patients who either remained in the hospital at those sites or were transferred after study drug termination ("nontransfer patients").

Results

The baseline characteristics of transfer and nontransfer patients were similar. Patients receiving eptifibatide were transferred less frequently than those receiving placebo (16% vs. 20%, p = 0.014). Transfer patients underwent more procedures and experienced a greater 30-day incidence of death or MI, as compared with nontransfer patients (21% vs. 12%, p = 0.001). Eptifibatide was associated with a reduction in death or MI through 30 days, independent of transfer status (2.5% absolute reduction), as well as for those transferred (5.5% absolute reduction).

Conclusions

For patients with ACS admitted to community hospitals, eptifibatide is associated with a reduced need for transfer and improved clinical outcomes.

### The clinical use of ivabradine [^113fKr11]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical use of ivabradine has and continues to evolve along channels that are predicated on its mechanism of action. It selectively inhibits the funny current (I f) in sinoatrial nodal tissue, resulting in a decrease in the rate of diastolic depolarization and, consequently, the heart rate, a mechanism that is distinct from those of other negative chronotropic agents. Thus, it has been evaluated and is used in select patients with systolic heart failure and chronic stable angina without clinically significant adverse effects. Although not approved for other indications, ivabradine has also shown promise in the management of inappropriate sinus tachycardia. Here, the authors review the mechanism of action of ivabradine and salient studies that have led to its current clinical indications and use.

### Naftifine hydrochloride (naftin) [^114x2WHD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Naftifine is an antifungal that belongs to the allylamine class. Although the exact mechanism of action against fungi is not known, naftifine hydrochloride appears to interfere with sterol biosynthesis by inhibiting the enzyme squalene 2, 3-epoxidase. The inhibition of enzyme activity by this allylamine results in decreased amounts of sterols, especially ergosterol, and a corresponding accumulation of squalene in the cells.

Mechanism of Resistance

To date, a mechanism of resistance to naftifine has not been identified.

Naftifine has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following fungi, both in vitro and in clinical infections, as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section:

Trichophyton rubrum
Trichophyton mentagrophytes
Epidermophyton floccosum

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (Augmentin ES-600) [^112c53gw]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Amoxicillin is a semisynthetic antibacterial with a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Amoxicillin is, however, susceptible to degradation by beta-lactamases, and therefore, its spectrum of activity does not include organisms which produce these enzymes. Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam, structurally related to penicillin, which possesses the ability to inactivate a wide range of beta-lactamase enzymes commonly found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. In particular, it has good activity against the clinically important plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases frequently found responsible for transferred drug resistance.

The clavulanic acid component of AUGMENTIN ES-600 protects amoxicillin from degradation by beta-lactamase enzymes and effectively extends the antibacterial spectrum of amoxicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to amoxicillin and other beta-lactam antibacterials. Thus, AUGMENTIN ES-600 possesses the distinctive properties of a broad spectrum antibacterial and a beta-lactamase inhibitor.

Antimicrobial Activity

Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Gram-Positive bacteria:

Streptococcus pneumoniae (including isolates with penicillin MICs less than or equal to 2 mcg/mL)

Gram-Negative bacteria:

Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing isolates)

Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase-producing isolates)

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following microorganisms exhibit in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. However, the safety and efficacy of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in treating infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled trials.

Gram-Positive bacteria:

Staphylococcus aureus (including beta-lactamase-producing isolates)

Staphylococci which are resistant to methicillin/oxacillin must be considered resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.

Streptococcus pyogenes

S. pyogenes do not produce beta-lactamase, and therefore, are susceptible to amoxicillin alone. Adequate and well-controlled clinical trials have established the effectiveness of amoxicillin alone in treating certain clinical infections due to S. pyogenes.

### Mupirocin (Pirnuo) [^114tumKF]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mupirocin is an RNA synthetase inhibitor antibacterial produced by fermentation using the organism Pseudomonas fluorescens.

Mechanism of Action

Mupirocin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly and specifically binding to bacterial isoleucyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase.

Mupirocin is bactericidal at concentrations achieved by topical administration. Mupirocin is highly protein bound (greater than 97%) and the effect of wound secretions on the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of mupirocin has not been determined.

Resistance

When mupirocin resistance occurs, it results from the production of a modified isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, or the acquisition of, by genetic transfer, a plasmid mediating a new isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. High-level plasmid-mediated resistance (MIC ≥ 512 mcg/mL) has been reported in increasing numbers of isolates of S. aureus and with higher frequency in coagulase-negative staphylococci. Mupirocin resistance occurs with greater frequency in methicillin-resistant than methicillin-susceptible staphylococci.

Cross Resistance

Due to its mode of action, mupirocin does not demonstrate cross resistance with other classes of antimicrobial agents.

Antimicrobial Activity

Mupirocin has been shown to be active against susceptible isolates of S. aureus and S. pyogenes, both in vitro and in clinical trials [see Indications and Usage (1)]. The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Mupirocin is active against most isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis.

Susceptibility Test Methods

High-level mupirocin resistance (≥ 512 mcg/mL) may be determined using standard disk diffusion or broth microdilution tests.1,2Because of the occurrence of mupirocin resistance in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), it is appropriate to test MRSA populations for mupirocin susceptibility prior to the use of mupirocin using a standardized method.3,4,5

### Tigecycline: a new glycylcycline for treatment of serious infections [^1134i2sv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Tigecycline is a new semisynthetic glycylcycline for the treatment of serious infections. Of the glycylcyclines, tigecycline is the most studied and appears to hold promise as a new antimicrobial agent that can be administered as monotherapy to patients with many types of serious bacterial infections. For patients with serious infections, the initial choice for empirical therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics is crucial, and, if the choice is inappropriate, it may have adverse consequences for the patient. Tigecycline has been designed to overcome many existing mechanisms of resistance among bacteria and confers broad antibiotic coverage against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and many species of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria. Tigecycline has been efficacious and well tolerated in human clinical phase 2 studies, which warranted further evaluation of tigecycline in larger studies for treatment of many indications, including complicated skin and skin-structure infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections, and infections of the lower respiratory tract.

### Unmasking the ancestral activity of integron integrases reveals a smooth evolutionary transition during functional innovation [^113abhqs]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Tyrosine (Y)-recombinases have evolved to deliver mechanistically different reactions on a variety of substrates, but these evolutionary transitions are poorly understood. Among them, integron integrases are hybrid systems recombining single- and double-stranded DNA partners. These reactions are asymmetric and need a replicative resolution pathway, an exception to the canonical second strand exchange model of Y-recombinases. Integron integrases possess a specific domain for this specialized pathway. Here we show that despite this, integrases are still capable of efficiently operating the ancestral second strand exchange in symmetrical reactions between double-stranded substrates. During these reactions, both strands are reactive and Holliday junction resolution can follow either pathway. A novel deep-sequencing approach allows mapping of the crossover point for the second strand exchange. The persistence of the ancestral activity in integrases illustrates their robustness and shows that innovation towards new recombination substrates and resolution pathways was a smooth evolutionary process.

### Cangrelor: clinical data, contemporary use, and future perspectives [^112NGaVp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Indications and Dosage

Cangrelor is currently available in the United States and most European countries. According to the Food and Drug Administration, cangrelor is approved as an adjunct to PCI for reducing the risk of periprocedural MI, repeated coronary revascularization, and ST in patients not treated with an oral P2Y 12 inhibitor and not planned to receive a GPI. Cangrelor should be administered as a bolus of 30 µg/kg, before initiation of the PCI procedure, followed by an infusion of 4 µg/kg per minute for at least 2 hours or through the duration of the intervention, whichever is longer. To maintain platelet inhibition after discontinuation of cangrelor infusion, an oral P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor should be administered as follows: clopidogrel, 600 mg, immediately after discontinuation of cangrelor; prasugrel, 60 mg, immediately after discontinuation of cangrelor; or ticagrelor, 180 mg, at any time during cangrelor infusion or immediately after discontinuation. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines do not provide any recommendations on the use of cangrelor because the drug was approved only after the most recent guideline updates(Figure 3).

Figure 3
Use of cangrelor in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

MI indicates myocardial infarction; NSTEMI, non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction; OS, oral somministration; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention; and STEMI, ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction.

Cangrelor was approved by European Medical Agency for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with CAD undergoing PCI who have not received an oral P2Y 12 inhibitor before PCI and in whom oral therapy with P2Y 12 inhibitors is not feasible or desirable. The European Medical Agency additionally specifies that the infusion must not exceed 4 hours. The 2020 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the management of ACS without persistent ST‐segment elevation suggest the use of cangrelor during PCI (class of recommendation IIb; level of evidence A)and confirm that the timing of administration of oral P2Y 12 inhibitors in patients receiving cangrelor infusion at the time of PCI should be drug specific.

This cross-sectional study included all anticancer drugs approved by the FDA from January 2009 to December 2020. The mechanism of action of each drug was extracted from FDA labels. Supportive-care treatments were excluded.

Exposures

Name of drug approved, date of approval, indication, tumor type, mechanism of action, broad pharmaceutical class, and biological target. Approvals considering all tumor types and each tumor type separately were classified in 3 nonoverlapping categories: new mechanism of action, next in class, or subsequent approval.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The number of all approvals each year; the number of approvals based on a new mechanism of action, either by drug (considering all tumor types) or by indication (considering tumor types separately); and the frequency of these numbers over time.

Results

Overall, 332 approvals were included. Between 2009 and 2020, there was an increase in the total number of approvals from 8 to 57. We found that 209 approvals (63%) were for a next-in-class indication in a new tumor type (84 [25%]) or a subsequent indication of the same drug in the same tumor type (195 [59%]). When considering each tumor type separately, 123 approvals (37%) were based on a new mechanism of action.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, approvals based on a new mechanism of action represented a minority of all approvals. Further consideration of incentives for drug development are needed to prioritize novel or highly innovative and transformative anticancer drugs.

### Polymyxin B hemoperfusion: a mechanistic perspective [^115AxBiQ]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

PMX-DHP is a well-tolerated and safe treatment for septic shock with a long history of clinical experience and both clinical and basic science data to support efficacy in endotoxemia. Its principle mechanism of action is through the removal of circulating endotoxin, although its effects are likely pleiotropic. In an era of numerous failed clinical trials in sepsis, it is easy to be cynical. However, this personalized, targeted approach to a disease with unacceptable mortality, with a treatment with a long history of clinical use and strong supporters around the globe truly may represent a step forward in improving patient care.

EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF

In randomized studies conducted before 2013 involving more than 30 000 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), treatment with a GPI significantly reduced mortality and the combined end point of mortality and reinfarction, with greater benefits in patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing angioplasty and stent implantation. These same studies found an association of GPI use with an increased risk of major bleeding. Some of the increase in bleeding at the vascular access site, the most common site of bleeding, could be ameliorated by transitioning from femoral to radial artery access. More recent studies involving patients who were also treated with oral inhibitors of the platelet P2Y12 ADP receptor also support a benefit from routine use of GPIs. Meta‐analyses indicate that early therapy with a GPI after the onset of symptoms in patients with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) may be especially efficacious. Nevertheless, current European and American guidelines recommend GPI use only in restricted situations, such as the presence of a large thrombus burden or distal embolization.

### P2Y (12) inhibitors: differences in properties and mechanisms of action and potential consequences for clinical use [^113DVVDY]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Currently, clopidogrel is recommended for treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome and/or percutaneous coronary intervention. However, the delayed onset of the effect and the occurrence of poor platelet inhibition responders with clopidogrel as well as non-compliance to dual antiplatelet treatment are associated with a raised risk of stent thrombosis. The molecular target of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and several emerging antiplatelet treatments is the P2Y(12) receptor, which is the main platelet receptor responsible for ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Active metabolites of the thienopyridine prodrugs (ticlopidine, clopidogrel, and prasugrel) covalently bind to the P2Y(12) receptor and are irreversible, indirect platelet inhibitors. The newer, direct-acting P2Y(12) inhibitors (cangrelor and ticagrelor) change the conformation of the P2Y(12) receptor, resulting in reversible, concentration dependent inhibition of the receptor. An understanding of the similarities and differences in the properties and mechanisms of action of these new inhibitors compared with clopidogrel is needed in order to optimize the development and use of these agents in clinical practice. The objectives of this systematic review are to summarize the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenetics of the different P2Y(12) inhibitors and to discuss the clinical implications for treatment of patients.

Dipyridamole mechanism of action — antiplatelet and vascular effects are described as follows: Dipyridamole is a pyrimidopyrimidine derivative with vasodilator and antiplatelet properties, and its antiplatelet mechanism is controversial; inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and blockade of adenosine uptake have been suggested, while direct stimulation of PGI2 synthesis and protection against its degradation require concentrations exceeding those achieved with conventional oral doses (100–400 mg/d); it also differentially inhibits expression of inflammatory genes by platelet-leukocyte aggregates.

Arachidonic acid metabolism and aspirin mechanism — Arachidonic acid, a 20-carbon fatty acid containing four double bonds, is liberated from the sn2 position in membrane phospholipids and is converted by cytosolic prostaglandin H synthases to the unstable intermediate prostaglandin H2; the synthases are colloquially termed "cyclooxygenases" and exist in two forms, COX-1 and COX-2. Low-dose aspirin selectively inhibits COX-1, and high-dose aspirin inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2, and prostaglandin H2 is converted by tissue-specific isomerases to multiple prostanoids that activate specific cell membrane receptors.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^114xJzrh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 2.2 — Selecting antibiotics for organisms at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production: The suggested approach states that several β-lactam antibiotics are at moderate risk of inducing ampC genes and that both induction potential and stability to AmpC β-lactamase hydrolysis should be considered when selecting therapy. The rationale notes a spectrum of induction among β-lactams; aminopenicillins (amoxicillin, ampicillin), narrow-spectrum first-generation cephalosporins, and cephamycins are potent ampC inducers, and both low-risk (S. marcescens) and moderate-risk (E. cloacae) organisms hydrolyze these drugs even at basal ampC expression levels, so such AmpC-E isolates will generally test as resistant. Imipenem is also a potent ampC inducer but generally remains stable to AmpC-E hydrolysis; the induction potential of ertapenem and meropenem has not been formally investigated but, similar to imipenem, they are generally stable to AmpC hydrolysis. Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, and aztreonam are relatively weak ampC inducers, yet available evidence indicates that their susceptibility to hydrolysis makes them less likely to be effective for infections by organisms at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production.

### Extended duration of dual-antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention: how long is too long? [^115eYUqy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The most recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on duration of dual‐antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug‐eluting stents (DESs) give a class I recommendation to continue DAPT for at least 12 months after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and at least 6 months after revascularization in the setting of stable ischemic heart disease. 1 These guidelines also give a class IIb recommendation for continuation of DAPT beyond 6 and 12 months in patients with stable ischemic heart disease and ACS, respectively, if these patients have tolerated DAPT without a bleeding event and are at low risk for bleeding in the future. 1 However, they do not provide any guidance with respect to how long DAPT should be continued and leave it to the clinician to discuss the risks versus benefits with the patient and individualize antiplatelet therapy. Therefore, in clinical practice, we often see patients on DAPT several years after a PCI as they are instructed by their providers to never discontinue them. In fact, given how much the importance of taking DAPT in the early period after PCI is emphasized, patients at times are uncomfortable stopping the second antiplatelet agent at any time. The lack of a clear recommendation is not surprising, despite multiple recent randomized controlled trials 2, 3, 4, 5 evaluating differing durations of extended DAPT given several evolving factors and the overall risk/benefits of DAPT.

Guidelines commenting on DAPT duration have largely included trials using clopidogrel and early‐generation stents. The advent of more potent P2Y 12 inhibitors, such as prasugrel and ticagrelor, has reduced major adverse cardiovascular events, but at the cost of increased bleeding. 6, 7 On the other hand, the newer‐generation DESs, with their thinner stent struts, a more biocompatible polymer, and favorable drug‐eluting characteristics, have considerably decreased the risk of stent thrombosis, particularly late stent thrombosis. 8 Although extended DAPT duration has been associated with reduction in recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiovascular death, there are statistically significant increases in major bleeding events. 2, 5 With the increased recognition of bleeding events and advancements in DES technology, it has been hypothesized that shorter durations of DAPT may be more appropriate. The European and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines have already reduced the minimum absolutely required duration of DAPT by incorporating short DAPT into their recommendations. 1, 9 However, the question about the value of extended DAPT duration in selected patients still remains to be answered.
