## Question

What is the recommended hydroxyzine dose?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended hydroxyzine dose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative sources and confirm on-label dosing for hydroxyzine hydrochloride and hydroxyzine pamoate. Then, I should delineate adult dosing by indication, followed by pediatric dosing including the weight-based sedation dose. Next, I will review special populations, especially elderly, renal, and hepatic impairment, and verify any needed adjustments. After that, I need to check formulation-specific issues and clarify any differences between hydrochloride and pamoate salts. Finally, I will examine key safety parameters and contraindications, integrate practice nuances for conditions like chronic urticaria and driving safety, and synthesize a clear, individualized dosing recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the most authoritative sources so I do not over-rely on lower-credibility data. The FDA labeling for hydroxyzine hydrochloride and hydroxyzine pamoate provides on-label dosing by indication and age and will serve as the primary anchor, supplemented by SPL entries that reiterate dosing and special population cautions, while clinical studies will nuance safety and practical considerations like sedation and urticaria management.

> I will now examine standard adult dosing by indication to ensure accuracy. For anxiety and tension in adults, the labeled dose is 50 to 100 mg four times daily, which implies a daily maximum of 400 mg when using 100 mg QID and should be individualized to response and tolerability. For pruritus due to allergic conditions, the adult dose is 25 mg three to four times daily. For sedation as premedication or post-anesthesia, the adult dose is 50 to 100 mg as a single dose, with oral dosing permissible following initial intramuscular administration if used. I should confirm that all sources emphasize individualization of dose to response; yes, the labels explicitly state dose should be adjusted according to clinical response [^112yYPEt] [^111otgxY] [^111ViXm7].

> Next, I should review pediatric dosing carefully, and I need to ensure I get the age bands and sedation weight-based dose right. For children under 6 years, the labeled total daily dose is 50 mg in divided doses across indications, and for those 6 years and older, the labeled total daily dose is 50 to 100 mg in divided doses. For procedural sedation as premedication or following anesthesia, the pediatric dose is 0.6 mg/kg as a single dose. Hold on, I should verify whether this pediatric sedation regimen is consistent with contemporary pediatric sedation data; a recent RCT for EEG sedation supports hydroxyzine as a reasonable option with acceptable efficacy and safety compared with triclofos, which aligns with the labeled sedation framework, though it does not change the labeled dose itself [^112yYPEt] [^111ajqi1] [^111Ndw6D].

> Special populations are often where errors occur, so I should double-check renal, hepatic, and geriatric adjustments. Initially, I thought both renal and hepatic impairment required a 50% dose reduction, but wait, let me verify that. For renal impairment with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min, dose reduction by 50% is recommended for both hydrochloride and pamoate salts. For hepatic impairment, no dose reduction is required; however, the dosing interval should be increased to every 24 hours in patients with primary biliary cholangitis, which is a nuance I need to preserve. For older adults, I need to start at the low end of the dosing range due to increased susceptibility to confusion and oversedation, monitor closely, and titrate cautiously, as labeling repeatedly emphasizes careful selection and monitoring in geriatrics [^116nC3Bh] [^1137nD4d] [^113BV6Uw] [^1131ez8J] [^111ddGeH] [^112mQKpm].

> Hold on, I should verify whether hydrochloride and pamoate salts differ in any meaningful way for dosing or clinical effect. The dosing recommendations are identical across hydrochloride and pamoate formulations by indication and age, and the choice is generally guided by availability and patient tolerance rather than differential dosing, with rapid gastrointestinal absorption and onset of clinical effects typically within 15 to 30 minutes for oral administration, which supports similar practical use across salts [^111ajqi1] [^112yYPEt] [^117DFYkE] [^117RXHtD].

> I need to ensure the key safety parameters and contraindications are front and center, given hydroxyzine's sedative and cardiac risk profile. Hydroxyzine is contraindicated in early pregnancy and in patients with prolonged QT interval or known hypersensitivity to hydroxyzine and its metabolites cetirizine or levocetirizine, with labeling also warning of torsade de pointes and QT prolongation risk, particularly in the presence of other QT-prolonging drugs or cardiac conditions. Hydroxyzine may rarely cause acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis; patients should be counseled to stop immediately if rash or AGEP symptoms occur, and avoid cetirizine or levocetirizine thereafter due to cross-sensitivity. CNS depression and somnolence are common; extra caution is warranted when combining with other CNS depressants, and patients should avoid driving or operating machinery, with controlled driving data showing severe real-world impairment after a single 50 mg hydroxyzine dose and only partial tolerance over time [^113Gt7JS] [^113VYtjs] [^1156Lirv] [^112mQKpm] [^112mQKpm] [^114si9UN] [^117PFcZh].

> But wait, what if the clinical question relates to chronic urticaria where antihistamine strategies differ from simple pruritus dosing; I should review that nuance. First-generation sedating H1 antihistamines like hydroxyzine are generally not recommended for chronic urticaria because they increase daytime somnolence without improving efficacy when added to a second-generation agent, and guidelines favor updosing nonsedating antihistamines up to fourfold before considering combinations, which limits the role of hydroxyzine to selected situations where sedation is specifically desired at night and risks are acceptable [^116YPeKx] [^1129cT5F].

> I should now synthesize a practical, individualized dosing recommendation while keeping the label boundaries and safety cautions explicit. For adults with anxiety, start 25 to 50 mg and titrate to 50 to 100 mg four times daily as tolerated, with 400 mg/day representing the common labeled upper bound, adjusting to response and sedation burden. For adults with pruritus, use 25 mg every 6 to 8 hours, adjusting per effect and tolerability. For adult premedication or post-anesthesia sedation, use 50 to 100 mg as a single dose. For children under 6 years, target 50 mg/day in divided doses across indications; for children 6 years and older, use 50 to 100 mg/day in divided doses; for pediatric premedication or post-anesthesia sedation, use 0.6 mg/kg once. In all cases, titrate based on clinical response and adverse effects, and consider the need for lower initial doses in frail or sensitive patients [^111ajqi1] [^112yYPEt] [^111otgxY] [^111ViXm7].

> Let me reconsider whether I have clearly integrated special population adjustments into the final plan, because missing those can create safety issues. In elderly patients, begin at the low end of dosing, monitor closely for confusion and oversedation, and titrate cautiously; in renal impairment with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min, reduce all doses by 50%; in hepatic impairment, do not reduce the dose but extend the dosing interval to every 24 hours in primary biliary cholangitis; avoid use in early pregnancy and in patients with prolonged QT or significant QT risk factors, and counsel about rash or AGEP, drug interactions that prolong the QT, and CNS depressant co-administration that may potentiate sedation [^111ddGeH] [^116nC3Bh] [^1137nD4d] [^113BV6Uw] [^1131ez8J] [^113Gt7JS] [^114si9UN].

> Finally, I should double-check that I have addressed practical safety counseling, since this often dictates whether a dose is truly "right" for a given patient beyond the numbers. Patients should be warned about drowsiness and advised not to drive, particularly early in therapy, given documented driving impairment even after single 50 mg doses; they should avoid concurrent QT-prolonging agents and report palpitations or syncope promptly; they should avoid hydroxyzine in early pregnancy and discontinue at the first sign of rash or pustular eruption suggestive of AGEP; and all dosing should proceed with a start-low, go-slow principle tailored to response and adverse effects, with a typical adult anxiety ceiling at 100 mg four times daily when necessary and tolerated [^117PFcZh] [^113Gt7JS] [^113qa3m7] [^111ajqi1].

Hydroxyzine dosing **varies by indication, age, and formulation** [^112yYPEt]. For adults, typical dosing is **25–100 mg per dose** for anxiety [^116eKwyD], pruritus [^111otgxY], or sedation [^111ViXm7], with a maximum of 400 mg/day [^111ajqi1]. Pediatric dosing is weight- or age-based, and older adults should start at lower doses [^111ddGeH] due to **increased sensitivity and QT risk** [^114si9UN]. Dose adjustments are needed for renal impairment [^116nC3Bh] [^1137nD4d] and chronic liver disease. Hydroxyzine is **contraindicated in early pregnancy** [^113Gt7JS], in patients with prolonged QT [^1156Lirv], or in those with hypersensitivity to hydroxyzine or related drugs [^113VYtjs].

## Geriatric dosing considerations

Begin at the lower end of the adult dose range, as older adults are more sensitive [^111ddGeH] and at **increased risk of QT prolongation** [^114si9UN]. Monitor closely for sedation [^117PFcZh], confusion, and cardiac effects [^111ddGeH].

---

## Dose adjustments in special populations

In renal impairment (CrCl < 50 mL/min) [^116nC3Bh], **reduce the dose by 50%** [^1137nD4d]. In hepatic impairment, no dose change is needed [^113BV6Uw]; however, extend the dosing interval to every 24 hours in primary biliary cholangitis [^1131ez8J].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **early pregnancy** [^113Gt7JS], **prolonged QT** [^1156Lirv], and hypersensitivity to hydroxyzine, cetirizine, or levocetirizine [^113VYtjs]. Use caution with concomitant CNS depressants [^114si9UN] and in patients with **QT risk factors** [^113VYtjs].

---

## Adverse effects and overdose

Common adverse effects include drowsiness, dry mouth [^113qa3m7], headache, and QT prolongation. Overdose may result in severe CNS depression, respiratory depression, and **cardiac arrhythmias** [^113qa3m7].

---

Hydroxyzine dosing **should be individualized** to the indication, age, and comorbidities, with careful monitoring for adverse effects and interactions [^112yYPEt].

### Night-time sedating H1-antihistamine increases daytime somnolence but not treatment efficacy in chronic spontaneous urticaria: a randomized controlled trial [^116YPeKx]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

The primary result of this study was that both levocetirizine monotherapy and therapy with levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine were similarly effective in reducing urticarial symptoms, reducing night-time sleep disturbances, and improving quality of life (QoL). In contrast, daytime sedation was significantly less with levocetirizine monotherapy compared to levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine.

The effectiveness of levocetirizine in relieving the symptoms of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and improving QoL confirms previous findings. It is of particular relevance in this study that the subjective element of the Urticaria Activity Score (UAS), the severity of pruritus, was similarly reduced by both treatment regimens, suggesting that the central effects of hydroxyzine do not contribute to the overall antipruritic effect. This aligns with the hypothesis that histamine is primarily involved in the peripheral genesis of itch. Furthermore, both treatment regimens having a similar effect in reducing night-time sleep disturbances again indicates that it is the peripheral antipruritic effect of the nonsedating second-generation H1-antihistamine that is of prime importance, rather than any central sedative effects.

### Chlorpromazine HCI [^117L7evv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosage & administration for adults**: Adjust the dosage to the individual and the severity of their condition. Note that the milligram-for-milligram potency relationship among all dosage forms has not been precisely established clinically. It is important to increase the dosage until symptoms are controlled. Dosage should be increased more gradually in debilitated or emaciated patients. During continued therapy, gradually reduce the dosage to the lowest effective maintenance level after symptoms have been controlled for a reasonable period. Increase parenteral dosage only if hypotension has not occurred. Before using IM, see dosage & administration: important notes on injection.

- **Elderly patients**: In general, dosages in the lower range are sufficient. As elderly patients appear to be more susceptible to hypotension and neuromuscular reactions, they should be observed closely. The dosage should be tailored to the individual, with response carefully monitored and dosage adjusted accordingly. Dosage increases should be more gradual in elderly patients.

- **Psychotic disorders**: Increase the dosage gradually until symptoms are controlled. Maximum improvement may not be seen for weeks or even months. Continue with the optimum dosage for 2 weeks, then gradually reduce the dosage to the lowest effective maintenance level. A daily dosage of 200 mg is not unusual. Some patients require higher dosages, with 800 mg daily not uncommon in discharged mental patients.

### Antihistamines: Do they work? Further well-controlled trials involving larger samples are needed [^111RPkEM]. Allergy (2004). Low credibility.

Histamine plays a crucial role in the phlogistic allergic reaction due to its activity through binding to specific receptors on the cellular surface. H1-receptors of the second generation are the most commonly prescribed drugs for allergic diseases because of their high selectivity, minimal or no central sedative effect, rapid onset of action, and long half-lives. Antihistamines can modulate some immunological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation. They achieve this by reducing mediator release, expressing adhesion molecules, and regulating the release of cytokines and chemokines, which in turn affects the recruitment of inflammatory cells. The anti-inflammatory effects of cetirizine, desloratadine, and levocetirizine are reviewed in this context. Quality of life is also considered a main parameter in the global evaluation of the antihistamine's effects.

### SPL drug information for hydroxyzine pamoate [^112TV9Pk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Unknown frequency adverse reactions associated with the use of hydroxyzine pamoate PO (also known as Vistaril) include acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, dry mouth, hallucinations, headache, priapism, increased QT interval, seizure, skin rash, somnolence, torsade de pointes, tremor, and urticaria.

### Hydroxyzine hydrochloride [^111ddGeH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

A determination has not been made whether controlled clinical studies of hydroxyzine included sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to define a difference in response from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

The extent of renal excretion of hydroxyzine has not been determined; because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection.

- **Sedating drugs**: May cause confusion and oversedation in the elderly. Elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of hydroxyzine and observed closely.

- **Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP)**: Hydroxyzine may rarely cause acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, a serious skin reaction characterized by fever and numerous small, superficial, non-follicular, sterile pustules, arising within large areas of edematous erythema. Inform patients about the signs of AGEP, and discontinue hydroxyzine at the first appearance of a skin rash, worsening of pre-existing skin reactions which hydroxyzine may be used to treat, or any other sign of hypersensitivity. If signs or symptoms suggest AGEP, use of hydroxyzine should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered.

### Chlorpromazine HCl [^114rx5tM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

For hospitalized patients, as with outpatients, start with low doses and increase dosage gradually. In severe behavior disorders, higher dosages (50–100 mg daily, and in older children, 200 mg daily or more) may be necessary. There is little evidence that behavior improvement in severely disturbed mentally retarded patients is further enhanced by doses beyond 500 mg per day. Maximum IM Dosage: Patients up to 5 years (or 50 lbs.), not over 40 mg/day; 5–12 years (or 50–100 lbs.), not over 75 mg/day except in unmanageable cases.

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Dosage and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the severity of the symptoms and response of the patient. The duration of activity following intramuscular administration may last up to 12 hours. Subsequent doses may be given by the same route if necessary. IM: 1/4 mg/lb body weight q6–8h, prn. Maximum IM Dosage: Pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years (or 50 lbs.), not over 40 mg/day; 5–12 years (or 50–100 lbs.), not over 75 mg/day except in severe cases.

- **During surgery**: IM: 1/8 mg/lb body weight. Repeat in 1/2 hour if necessary and if no hypotension occurs. IV: 1 mg per fractional injection at 2-minute intervals and not exceeding recommended IM dosage. Always dilute to 1 mg/mL, i.e. 1 mL (25 mg) mixed with 24 mL of saline.

### New onset delusional infestation following abrupt cessation of hydroxyzine [^116SCTLR]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

We concluded that this presentation of delusional infestation (DI) was likely caused by hydroxyzine withdrawal. Using the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale, the patient earned a total of 4 points as follows: 3 points for the temporal nature of symptoms correlating with drug withdrawal and reintroduction, 1 point for previous reports of sedative withdrawal correlating with DI, and another 1 point for objective evidence of the adverse event (matchbox sign). However, he lost 1 point for the possibility that DI could be due to another cause, such as unsuspected illicit drug use. Historically, this patient has never reported alcohol use, and throughout our follow-ups over the years, we neither suspected illicit drug use nor had a reason to perform drug screening, although a negative screen would have been ideal. Another potential confounding factor was that the patient's sister had passed away just weeks before, and psychological stress could have contributed to his acute presentation of DI, but it is unlikely for this to abate in such a rapid fashion.

DI may be caused by stimulating medications or substances, such as amphetamines and cocaine, or withdrawal of sedative medications or substances like opioids, benzodiazepines, and alcohol. One case report describes new-onset DI following acute withdrawal from the pharmacologic sedative trazodone. To our knowledge, we report the first known case of DI caused by the cessation of hydroxyzine, a histamine-1 receptor (H1R) antagonist. Hydroxyzine and other first-generation antihistamines are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and target H1Rs throughout the brain.

### A retrospective comparison of haloperidol and hydroxyzine combination therapy with haloperidol alone in the treatment of overactive delirium [^111FhLt7]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Low credibility.

For the treatment of delirium, antipsychotics such as haloperidol are used as standard treatments. However, haloperidol has little sedative effect and may not be sufficiently effective in controlling overactive delirium. Hydroxyzine, an antihistamine, may be used in combination with haloperidol to supplement its sedative effect.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of haloperidol alone or in combination with hydroxyzine on the improvement of overactive delirium retrospectively.

- **Method**: Delirium was assessed from medical records using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). The number of patients and days with an ICDSC score of < 4, indicating an absence of delirium after haloperidol alone or haloperidol and hydroxyzine, was surveyed for six days.

- **Results**: A total of 157 patients were diagnosed with delirium from April 2019 to July 2021. Of these, 18 patients received haloperidol alone, and 21 patients received the combination of haloperidol and hydroxyzine for overactive delirium. The number of patients with a mean ICDSC score of < 4 on days 1–6 was two patients (11%) in the haloperidol group and two patients (10%) in the combination of haloperidol and hydroxyzine group (P = 0.999). The days with an ICDSC score of < 4 on days 1–6 were 0.8 (1.3) and 0.8 (1.5), respectively (P = 0.848).

- **Conclusion**: Haloperidol alone and haloperidol plus hydroxyzine are both effective in the treatment of overactive delirium. However, the concomitant use of hydroxyzine with haloperidol may not improve the efficacy of treatment for overactive delirium.

### Hydroxyzine versus triclofos for sedation for electroencephalography recording in children: A noninferiority randomized controlled trial [^111Ndw6D]. Pediatric Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Triclofos is commonly used for sedation in children for electroencephalography (EEG) recording. A noninferiority randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of hydroxyzine as an alternate drug for sedation.

- **Methods**: Children aged six months to five years who did not sleep naturally for EEG recording were randomly assigned to receive either hydroxyzine or triclofos in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was successful EEG completion, defined by achieving at least 40 minutes of sleep during a one-hour EEG recording. Secondary outcomes included Ramsay sedation score, time taken for sedation, need for a second dose of sedative agent, yield of abnormal EEG records, incidence of adverse events, technologist and caregiver satisfaction score (based on a Likert scale), neurologist assessment of motion artifacts (based on a visual analog scale), and effect of the drug on the amplitude and frequency of the background rhythm. Parents were interviewed telephonically regarding any adverse effects within the next 24 hours.

- **Results**: Successful EEG completion was achieved in 82.6% of the hydroxyzine arm and in 90.2% of the triclofos arm, with a mean difference of -7.66 (95% confidence interval: -16.5 to 1.2, P = 0.092). Secondary outcomes, such as time taken to sleep, need for a second dose of sedation, yield of abnormal EEG records, adverse effect profile, neurologist grading of motion artifacts, and effect on background rhythm, were comparable between both groups.

- **Conclusion**: Hydroxyzine may be a safe, acceptable, and efficacious alternative for sedation in children undergoing EEG recording.

### Ranolazine: A contemporary review [^116jZEBP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Ranolazine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2006 in 500 mg and 1000 mg extended-release doses, advising 500 mg BID as a starting dose and 1000 mg BID as the maximum dose. The European Medicine Agency approved ranolazine in 2008 in three different extended-release doses (375–500–750 mg), advising 375 mg BID as a starting dose and 750 mg BID as the maximum dose. Up-titration was recommended after 2 to 4 weeks. Despite the recognized burden of refractory angina in the Canadian population, ranolazine has not been approved for use. Physicians must apply through the Special Access Program through Health Canada for use.

### Hympavzi [^115paTw9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

For subcutaneous use only. The recommended dosage of Hympavzi for adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older is as follows:

- **Loading dose**: Administer 300 mg (two 150 mg subcutaneous injections). If more than one injection is required to deliver a complete dose, administer each injection at a different injection site.

- **Maintenance dose**: One week after the loading dose, initiate maintenance dosing of 150 mg every week by subcutaneous injection on the same day each week, at any time of day.

- **Dose adjustment during treatment**: Consider a dose adjustment to 300 mg subcutaneous injection weekly in patients weighing greater than or equal to 50 kg when control of bleeding events is judged to be inadequate by the healthcare provider. Safety and efficacy of Hympavzi at doses above 300 mg weekly have not been established. If more than one injection is required to deliver a complete dose, administer each injection at a different injection site.

- **Missed doses**:
	- **For patients on a maintenance dose of 150 mg**: If a dose is missed, administer as soon as possible before the day of the next scheduled dose, and then resume the usual 150 mg subcutaneous weekly dosing schedule (same schedule as prior to the missed dose or new schedule based on the date of administration of the missed dose). If more than 13 days have passed since the last dose was administered, administer a loading dose of 300 mg by subcutaneous injection followed by a resumption of 150 mg by subcutaneous injection once weekly thereafter.

	- **For patients on a maintenance dose of 300 mg**: If one or more doses are missed,…

### Acute and subchronic effects of bilastine (20 and 40 mg) and hydroxyzine (50 mg) on actual driving performance in healthy volunteers [^117PFcZh]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2011). Low credibility.

Bilastine is a new second-generation H1 antagonist. Although bilastine has been demonstrated to produce little or no performance impairment in laboratory tests, it cannot be excluded that it produces impairments in real-life performance such as driving. This study aims to assess the effects of two doses of bilastine (20 and 40 mg) on actual driving after single and repeated administration. Hydroxyzine 50 mg was included as an active control.

Twenty-two participants (11 females, 11 males) were tested in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, four-way cross-over design. Participants were treated with once-daily doses for eight consecutive days. On days 1 and 8 of each treatment period, participants performed an actual highway driving test. The primary variable was the standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP), a measure of weaving. Results demonstrated that hydroxyzine significantly increased SDLP on days 1 and 8 of treatment. Bilastine did not affect SDLP.

It is concluded that hydroxyzine produces severe driving impairment after single doses and that this impairment only partly mitigates over time due to a lack of complete tolerance. Bilastine did not produce any driving impairment after single and repeated doses and can be safely used in traffic in doses up to 40 mg.

### Management of urticaria: Not too complicated, not too simple [^1129cT5F]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Given the safety of most antihistamines, doses can be increased up to four times the standard dose on an individual basis.

- **Can switching from one antihistamine to another attain an individualized response**: According to the British, American, and EAACI 2014 guidelines, all patients should be offered a choice between two or more nonsedating H1-antihistamines, because individual differences in response and tolerance to different antihistamines have been reported.

- **Is it useful to combine different antihistamines (i.e. sedating and nonsedating)**: In patients with severe, recalcitrant urticaria for whom the standard dose is not effective, combinations of antihistamines are frequently used as another way of updosing. This might involve, for example, two different second-generation antihistamines, or a second-generation antihistamine in the morning and a first-generation antihistamine in the evening. However, first-generation antihistamines are no longer recommended in chronic urticaria, and the clinical benefit of combining antihistamines is probably limited when H1-receptors are already occupied by another H1-antihistamine.

There are no studies that demonstrate that treatment with the combined use of sedating and nonsedating antihistamines is more effective than updosing the same antihistamine.

- **Is it useful to combine H1- and H2-antihistamines**: Several relatively small studies have shown that combined use of H1-antihistamines and H2-antihistamines (cimetidine, ranitidine) may be more effective than using H1-antihistamines alone.

### Effects of intravenous hydroxyzine versus haloperidol monotherapy for delirium: A retrospective study [^115ZA3TC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

Although antipsychotics are commonly used for delirium, they increase the risk of mortality in elderly patients and those with dementia. Hydroxyzine has sedative and anxiolytic effects and can be used in the treatment of delirium. We conducted a retrospective study to compare the effects of intravenous hydroxyzine and haloperidol monotherapy on delirium.

- **Methods**: Patients admitted to a university hospital from April 1, 2017, to September 30, 2022, who received either hydroxyzine or haloperidol intravenously as monotherapy for delirium treatment, were included. The time to and rate of delirium improvement were compared. Improvement was defined as a negative result on the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) or Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) for three consecutive days.

- **Results**: Among 5,555 patients with delirium, 71 (1.3%) and 82 (1.5%) received intravenous hydroxyzine and haloperidol monotherapy, respectively. The time to delirium improvement was 7.0 days (95% CI, 5.7–8.3 days) for hydroxyzine and 8.2 days (95% CI, 7.6–8.8 days) for haloperidol, with no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.059). However, the rate of delirium improvement was 23.9% for hydroxyzine and 8.5% for haloperidol, with a significant difference favoring the hydroxyzine group (P = 0.009).

We showed that intravenous hydroxyzine monotherapy was not inferior in terms of time to delirium improvement and superior in the rate of delirium improvement compared to intravenous haloperidol monotherapy.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: A proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^113Y9mTf]. BMC Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine that is described in the sleep disturbances section, which can also be an effective option for acute anxiety or for chronic anxiety. For acute use, on an as-needed basis, 10 mg is an appropriate starting dose and can be given up to 3 times per day. For chronic anxiety, 10 mg twice daily is an appropriate starting dose, and this can be increased by 10 mg per day until an effective dose is reached or until the maximum daily dose is reached. The recommended maximum daily dose for patients younger than six years is 25 mg up to 2 times/day. The recommended maximum daily dose for patients between 6–12 years is 25 mg up to 4 times/day. For patients 12 years and older, the recommended maximum daily dose is 50 mg up to 4 times/day. As noted previously, the safety of long-term use of antihistamines in young children has yet to be studied, and thus, hydroxyzine is not recommended for long-term use for young children.

Duloxetine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that is FDA-approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in non-autistic adults and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in non-autistic children, adolescents, and adults. Currently, there are no published RCTs evaluating the use of duloxetine in the ASD population. Duloxetine is recommended as a first-line option for co-occurring anxiety and depression and as a second-line option for anxiety alone. Side effects of duloxetine may include headache, drowsiness, fatigue, nausea, sexual impairments, constipation, reduced appetite, diarrhea, low blood sodium (hyponatremia), and, more rarely, ris.

### Hydroxyzine pamoate [^112mQKpm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Hydroxyzine may rarely cause acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), a serious skin reaction characterized by fever and numerous small, superficial, non-follicular, sterile pustules, arising within large areas of edematous erythema. Inform patients about the signs of AGEP, and discontinue hydroxyzine at the first appearance of a skin rash, worsening of pre-existing skin reactions which hydroxyzine may be used to treat, or any other sign of hypersensitivity. If signs or symptoms suggest AGEP, use of hydroxyzine should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. Avoid cetirizine or levocetirizine in patients who have experienced AGEP or other hypersensitivity reactions with hydroxyzine, due to the risk of cross-sensitivity.

- **Geriatric use**: A determination has not been made whether controlled clinical studies of hydroxyzine pamoate included sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to define a difference in response from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

The extent of renal excretion of hydroxyzine pamoate has not been determined. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection.

### SPL drug information for hydroxyzine pamoate [^114si9UN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of hydroxyzine pamoate PO (also known as Vistaril):

- **Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as hydroxyzine has rarely been associated with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis.

- **CNS depression**: Use extreme caution when using concurrently with CNS depressants, such as narcotics, non-narcotic analgesics, and barbiturates.

- **Somnolence**: Use extreme caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.

- **Torsade de pointes**: Use caution in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation, congenital long QT syndrome, a family history of long QT syndrome, other conditions predisposing to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia, or taking other QT-prolonging drugs, as well as recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, and bradyarrhythmias.

### Hydroxyzine pamoate [^113Gt7JS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Contraindications**: Hydroxyzine, when administered to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, induced fetal abnormalities in rats and mice at doses substantially above the human therapeutic range. Clinical data in humans are inadequate to establish safety in early pregnancy. Until such data are available, hydroxyzine is contraindicated in early pregnancy.

Hydroxyzine is contraindicated in patients with a prolonged QT interval. Hydroxyzine pamoate is contraindicated for patients who have shown a previous hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. It is also contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to hydroxyzine products, and in patients with known hypersensitivity to cetirizine hydrochloride or levocetirizine hydrochloride.

### Hydroxyzine for generalised anxiety disorder [^1136REKF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common chronic long-term psychiatric disorder, particularly frequent in primary care. There are several treatment options available, both non-pharmacological (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy) and pharmacological. Among the pharmacological interventions, antidepressants, buspirone, and benzodiazepines (BDZs) have been studied in GAD. Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine medication that has been used in the treatment of anxiety.

- **Objectives**:
	- To determine the efficacy of hydroxyzine in comparison with placebo or any other active agent in alleviating the acute symptoms of GAD. Additionally, the study aims to review the acceptability of treatment with hydroxyzine in comparison with placebo or any other active agent and to investigate the adverse effects of hydroxyzine in comparison with other active agents.

- **Search strategy**:
	- The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety, and Neurosis Group's controlled trial registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) were searched on 1 March 2010. The author team conducted complementary searches on MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO and checked reference lists of included studies, previous systematic reviews, and major textbooks on anxiety disorders. Personal communication with pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field was also undertaken.

- **Selection criteria**:
	- Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with GAD to hydroxyzine versus placebo and/or any other anxiolytic agent.

- **Data collection and analysis**:
	- Two authors independently extracted data. Information extracted included study characteristics and participant characteristics.

### Vistaril [^117DFYkE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Vistaril® (hydroxyzine pamoate) is unrelated chemically to the phenothiazines, reserpine, meprobamate, or the benzodiazepines. It is not a cortical depressant, but its action may be due to a suppression of activity in certain key regions of the subcortical area of the central nervous system.

- **Clinical effects**:
	- Vistaril demonstrates primary skeletal muscle relaxation experimentally. Additionally, bronchodilator activity, as well as antihistaminic and analgesic effects, have been demonstrated both experimentally and confirmed clinically. An antiemetic effect has been demonstrated using both the apomorphine test and the veriloid test. Pharmacological and clinical studies indicate that hydroxyzine, in therapeutic dosages, does not increase gastric secretion or acidity and, in most cases, has mild antisecretory activity. Hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and Vistaril's clinical effects are usually noted within 15 to 30 minutes after oral administration.

### New onset delusional infestation following abrupt cessation of hydroxyzine [^1152uMX5]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Delusional infestation (DI) is a psychocutaneous condition characterized by a fixed and false belief that an individual is infested with insects or parasites, despite evidence to the contrary. In this article, we present a case of DI that emerged after the abrupt discontinuation of long-term use of the H1 antihistamine hydroxyzine.

### Hydroxyzine for lowering patient's anxiety during prehospital morphine analgesia: A prospective randomized double blind study [^112w5Raf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine drug used for the symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension. We hypothesized that managing patients' anxiety with severe pain by adding hydroxyzine to conventional intravenous morphine titration would relieve their pain more effectively.

- **Methods**: This was a randomized, double-blind, controlled group study involving prehospital patients with acute pain scored greater than or equal to 6 on a 0–10 verbal numeric rating scale (NRS). Patients' anxiety was measured with the self-reported Face Anxiety Scale (FAS), ranking from 0 to 4. The percentage of patients with pain relief (NRS score ≤ 3) 15 minutes after the first injection was the primary outcome.

- **Results**: One hundred forty patients were enrolled. Fifty-one percent (95% CI 39% to 63%) of patients receiving hydroxyzine versus 52% (95% CI 40% to 64%) of those receiving placebo reported a pain numeric rating scale score of 3 or lower at 15 minutes. Ninety-one percent (95% CI 83% to 98%) of patients receiving hydroxyzine reported no more severe anxiety versus 78% (95% CI 68% to 88%) of patients with placebo (p > 0.05). Adverse events were minor, with no difference between groups (6% in hydroxyzine patients and 14% in placebo patients).

- **Conclusion**: The addition of hydroxyzine to morphine in the prehospital setting did not reduce pain or anxiety in patients with acute severe pain and therefore is not indicated based on our results.

### New onset delusional infestation following abrupt cessation of hydroxyzine [^112JyFde]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

As hydroxyzine is a frequently prescribed medication for pruritus, dermatologists should be aware of the possibility of developing delusional infestation (DI) without prudent tapering. Dermatologists are also encouraged to preferentially utilize second-generation H1 antihistamines (cetirizine, fexofenadine, and loratadine) for their more benign side-effect profile.

### Chlorpromazine dose for people with schizophrenia [^112kt3tz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) Model Lists of Essential Medicines lists chlorpromazine as one of its five medicines used in psychotic disorders.

- **Objectives**: To determine chlorpromazine dose response and dose side-effect relationships for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials on December 2008, October 2, 2014, and December 19, 2016.

- **Selection criteria**: All relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing low doses of chlorpromazine (≤ 400 mg/day), medium doses (401 mg/day to 800 mg/day), or higher doses (> 800 mg/day) for people with schizophrenia, which reported clinical outcomes.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We included studies meeting review criteria and providing usable data. Review authors extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated fixed-effect risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and their 95% CIs based on a fixed-effect model. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and graded trial quality using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

- **Main results**: As a result of searches undertaken in 2014, we found one new study, and in 2016, more data for already included studies. Five relevant studies with 1132 participants (585 are relevant to this review) are now included. All are hospital-based trials and, despite over 60 years of chlorpromazine use, have durations of less than six months and all are at least of moderate quality.

### Second international consensus study of antipsychotic dosing (ICSAD-2) [^113sr21u]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

Since the introduction of chlorpromazine and haloperidol seven decades ago, the number of drugs for psychosis has steadily increased with new drug entities and formulations resulting in dozens of treatment options for schizophrenia and other major psychiatric disorders. Competent use of drugs for psychosis requires clinical experience and knowledge of sound dosing practices. Such practice routinely includes dose increases to achieve symptomatic and functional improvement, gradual dose reduction to find tolerable and effective maintenance doses, and switching among agents and formulations, as occurs in 15%–20% of patients treated with drugs for psychosis each year.

Remarkably, however, consensus remains elusive on how to dose individual drugs for psychosis, including changing from one to an approximately equivalent dose of another, especially with newer agents. Establishing clinically equivalent dose estimates and dosing recommendations contributes to optimizing the use of drugs for psychosis in clinical practice, informing practice guideline development, and designing and interpreting clinical research.

Methods of estimating dosing equivalencies and establishing dosing recommendations have limitations and can yield values that vary substantially. Equivalent doses for many older drugs for psychosis, such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, were supported by dose–effect relationships based on laboratory pharmacodynamic data, such as in vitro affinity at cerebral dopamine receptors. This preclinical approach does not account for important interactions in the clinical setting.

### Adult male patient with severe intellectual disability caused by a homozygous mutation in the HNMT gene [^116QaaKq]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Treatment: Because of the demonstrated homozygous mutation in the HNMT gene resulting in the complete absence of a functional HNMT, treatment with the antihistaminergic drug hydroxyzine in a daily dose of 25 mg and a histamine-restricted diet was prescribed. Since their efficacy was doubtful, it was advised to stop the use of psychotropics, as mentioned before, with the exception of omeprazole.

### Chlorpromazine for schizophrenia: A Cochrane systematic review of 50 years of randomised controlled trials [^112KtPfa]. BMC Medicine (2005). High credibility.

The studies were mostly either 6 or 12 weeks long, but the range was large (24 hours to 3 years). The great majority of participants in nearly all of the trials were diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia. These studies reported on more than 5,276 people, 3,318 of whom were allocated to the chlorpromazine-placebo comparison. Eleven of the 50 trials described the diagnostic criteria used, or the symptoms required for people to be included. Otherwise, entry to most of the included studies was based on a pragmatic diagnosis of schizophrenia. The trials ranged in size from 21 to 838 participants. Most people were hospitalized at the time of the study. The lowest dose of chlorpromazine tested was 25 mg/day, and the highest was 2,000 mg/day. One trial included both a placebo and a no-drug group, which we combined. Another study included both a placebo group and a "routine conventional hospital treatment" group. Data from the latter were not used in this review, as individuals in this group were likely administered antipsychotic drugs.

### Efficacy and safety of hydroxyzine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: a 3-month double-blind study [^115n5avw]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) represents an important public health issue. Hydroxyzine, an antagonist of histamine receptors, has shown both efficacy and safety in previous short-term double-blind studies over placebo in this condition. The aim of the study was to confirm these positive results over a 3-month period in adult outpatients.

- **Method**: This multicenter, parallel (hydroxyzine [50 mg/day]; bromazepam [6 mg/day]), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 2 weeks of single-blind run-in placebo, 12 weeks of double-blind randomized treatment, and 4 weeks of single-blind run-out placebo. Three hundred thirty-four of 369 selected outpatients with a diagnosis of GAD according to DSM-IV criteria and a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score ≥ 20 were randomized before entering the double-blind period. The primary outcome criterion was the change in the HAM-A score from baseline to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with hydroxyzine compared with placebo.

- **Results**: In the intent-to-treat analysis, the mean ± SD change in HAM-A scores from baseline to endpoint was -12.16 ± 7.74 for hydroxyzine and -9.64 ± 7.74 for placebo (p = .019). Results at endpoint for percentage of responders (p = .003) and remission rates (p = .028), Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale score (p = .001), maintenance of efficacy (p = .022), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score on day 84 (p = .008) also confirmed the efficacy of hydroxyzine over placebo. The study showed no statistically significant difference be…

### Chlorpromazine versus atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia [^117QTV6j]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Chlorpromazine is an aliphatic phenothiazine, which is one of the widely-used typical antipsychotic drugs. It is reliable for its efficacy and is one of the most tested first-generation antipsychotic drugs. Chlorpromazine has been used as a 'gold standard' to compare the efficacy of older and newer antipsychotic drugs. Expensive new-generation drugs are heavily marketed worldwide as a better treatment for schizophrenia, but this may not be the case and can be an unnecessary drain on very limited resources.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effects of chlorpromazine with atypical or second-generation antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of people with schizophrenia.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register up to 23 September 2013.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared chlorpromazine with any other atypical antipsychotic drugs for treating people with schizophrenia. Adults (as defined in each trial) diagnosed with schizophrenia, including schizophreniform, schizoaffective, and delusional disorders, were included in this review.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently screened the articles identified in the literature search against the inclusion criteria and extracted data from included trials. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we determined the mean difference (MD) values and 95% CIs. We assessed the risk of bias in included studies and rated the quality of the evidence.

### Chlorpromazine versus placebo for schizophrenia [^116ch2mN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Chlorpromazine, formulated in the 1950s, remains a benchmark treatment for people with schizophrenia.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of chlorpromazine for schizophrenia in comparison with placebo.

- **Search strategy**: We updated previous searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (October 1999), Biological Abstracts (1982–1995), the Cochrane Library (1999, Issue 2), EMBASE (1980–1995), MEDLINE (1966–1995), and PsycLIT (1974–1995), by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (June 2002). References of all identified studies were searched for further trial citations. Pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials were contacted.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chlorpromazine with placebo, relevant to people with schizophrenia and non-affective serious/chronic mental illness, irrespective of mode of diagnosis, were included. Primary outcomes of interest were death, violent behaviors, overall improvement, relapse, and satisfaction with care.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Citations and, where possible, abstracts were inspected independently by reviewers; papers were ordered, re-inspected, and quality assessed. Data were extracted by BT and JR. CA and GA independently checked a 10% sample for reliability. Dichotomous data were analyzed using random effects relative risk (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) around this was estimated. Where possible, the number needed to treat (NNT) or number needed to harm statistics (NNH) were calculated. Continuous data were excluded if more than 50% of people were lost to follow up.

### Eltoprazine counteracts l-DOPA-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease: a dose-finding study [^112qXJqi]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

The prespecified primary objective of this study was to determine the effective dose of eltoprazine on the suppression of LIDs in Parkinson's disease patients treated with l-DOPA, while maintaining the normal treatment effect of l-DOPA. Efficacy measures included: (i) dyskinesia ratings calculated as CDRS AUC 0–3 (area under the curve 3 hours post-dose) after l-DOPA and study medication intake, and (ii) the highest observed change in UPDRS III score up to 3 hours after study medication being used to detect any deterioration of the normal treatment effect of l-DOPA. The highest observed change was defined as the difference between the maximum UPDRS III score 3 hours post-dosing and the UPDRS III prior to any study medication.

- **Secondary objectives**: The prespecified secondary objectives of this study were:
	- Number, frequency, and severity of any adverse events recorded during the five test episodes that differ between eltoprazine and placebo;
	- Dyskinesia ratings calculated as RDRS AUC 0–3 after l-DOPA and study medication intake;
	- Dyskinesia ratings scored as the maximum score for CDRS ratings over 3 hours after l-DOPA and study medication intake;
	- Changes in the diary data between baseline and placebo at any of the three study medication dosages;
	- Change of the HADS score after study medication compared with placebo;
	- Development of depression over the course of the study period determined by the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and clinical judgement.

### Chronic unremitting urticaria: Is the use of antihistamines above the licensed dose effective? A preliminary study of cetirizine at licensed and above-licensed doses [^115iReEd]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Recently, several authors have suggested an off-label increase of antihistamine dosage for patients with chronic urticaria (CU) not responding to the usual recommended doses, to achieve better disease control. However, this recommendation is not evidence-based. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of increased antihistamine doses in patients with CU who show poor control at recommended doses. In total, 22 adult patients with moderate/severe CU not controlled with the usual antihistamine doses were studied. These subjects recorded urticaria severity on a visual analogue scale (range 0–10) for 2 weeks.

During the first week, they were treated with cetirizine at the licensed dose (10 mg/day) and with a three-fold increased dose (10 mg x 3/day) during week 2. Only 1 patient (5%) responded satisfactorily to the increased dosage of antihistamine; in the remaining 21 subjects, urticaria scores did not change. These patients had to be treated with steroids, ciclosporin, and, in 1 case, with cyclophosphamide. Disease control was eventually gained in all cases.

This study suggests that the proportion of patients with severe CU who may gain better control of their disease with high, off-label doses of antihistamines is probably small, and that most patients will eventually require more aggressive treatments.

### Hydroxyzine hydrochloride [^113VYtjs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Hydroxyzine hydrochloride is contraindicated in the following situations:

- **Allergic reactions**: It should not be used in patients with known hypersensitivity to hydroxyzine hydrochloride products, cetirizine hydrochloride, or levocetirizine hydrochloride.

- **Cardiac issues**: Patients with a prolonged QT interval should avoid its use.

- **Pregnancy considerations**: When administered to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, hydroxyzine induced fetal abnormalities in rats and mice at doses substantially above the human therapeutic range. Clinical data in humans are inadequate to establish safety in early pregnancy; therefore, hydroxyzine is contraindicated during this period.

- **Previous hypersensitivity**: Hydroxyzine should not be administered to patients who have previously shown a hypersensitivity to it.

### Prochlorperazine [^112cJ4Zk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Dosage & administration - adults**: Dosage should be increased more gradually in debilitated or emaciated patients.

	**Elderly patients**: In general, dosages in the lower range are sufficient for most elderly patients. Since they appear to be more susceptible to hypotension and neuromuscular reactions, such patients should be observed closely. Dosage should be tailored to the individual, response carefully monitored, and dosage adjusted accordingly. Dosage should be increased more gradually in elderly patients.
	1. **To control severe nausea and vomiting**: Adjust dosage to the response of the individual. Begin with the lowest recommended dosage.

		- **Oral dosage - tablets**: Usually one 5 mg or 10 mg tablet 3 or 4 times daily. Daily dosages above 40 mg should be used only in resistant cases.

	2. **In adult psychiatric disorders**: Adjust dosage to the response of the individual and according to the severity of the condition. Begin with the lowest recommended dose. Although response ordinarily is seen within a day or two, longer treatment is usually required before maximal improvement is seen.

		- **Oral dosage - non-psychotic anxiety**: Usual dosage is 5 mg 3 or 4 times daily. Do not administer in doses of more than 20 mg per day or for longer than 12 weeks.

### Quzyttir [^1112M1yG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Cetirizine hydrochloride, a human metabolite of hydroxyzine, is an antihistamine. Its principal effects are mediated via selective inhibition of peripheral H1-receptors. The antihistaminic activity of cetirizine hydrochloride has been clearly documented in a variety of animal and human models.

- **In vivo and ex vivo animal models**: Show negligible anticholinergic and antiserotonergic activity. However, in clinical studies, dry mouth was more common with cetirizine hydrochloride than with placebo.
- **In vitro receptor binding studies**: Demonstrate no measurable affinity for receptors other than H1-receptors.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^112MExti]. Resuscitation (2021). Low credibility.

The safety and efficacy of the dosing regimen have been established in clinical practice for over 20 years. In children, a dose of 0.01 mg/kg (max 500 micrograms), titrated to clinical response, is recommended in international guidelines. Many guidelines, including those from EAACI, WAO, and RCUK, simplify the dosing regimen to age categories based on what is considered safe and practical to draw up and inject in an emergency. This pragmatic approach, which matches the licensed doses used for auto-injectors, seems to be effective and safe.

Four small crossover RCTs have been published comparing different doses of IM adrenaline. One study in children weighing 15–30 kg compared doses of 150/300 micrograms, while three studies compared doses of 300/500 micrograms in teenagers or adults. In all four studies, the higher dose had a more favorable absorption profile. However, how this impacts clinical response in patients with anaphylaxis is unknown. While the certainty of evidence with respect to dose is low, the working group concluded that a strong recommendation was appropriate given these doses have been widely used globally for many decades. Additionally, we did not identify any new evidence to challenge dosing recommendations.

In terms of the practicalities of IM administration, the EAACI 2020 systematic review identified one study where untrained caregivers were more able to administer adrenaline correctly using a prefilled syringe than when using an adrenaline auto-injector (AAI) (OR 4.07, 95%CI 1.29–12.86; low certainty). A study with radiologists found that using an AAI.

### Rapid response of omalizumab-resistant chronic urticaria to acalabrutinib [^115yfAmQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

- **Figure caption**: Representative images of chronic urticaria while on several failed treatment regimens. Edematous wheals on lower extremities were observed while the patient was taking (A) omalizumab 300 mg every 2 weeks, dapsone 100 mg daily, and hydroxyzine 50 mg daily; (B) sulfasalazine 1000 mg twice daily; (C) fexofenadine 360 mg twice daily, omalizumab 300 mg every 2 weeks, and hydroxyzine 50 mg daily.

The patient had failed numerous antihistamine regimens, including nonsedating antihistamines at doses of up to 4 times daily (fexofenadine 180 mg, cetirizine 10 mg, levocetirizine 5 mg) with sedating antihistamines at night (hydroxyzine 50 mg, diphenhydramine 25 mg) and cimetidine 400 mg twice daily. Omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks was administered for approximately 6 months, followed by 300 mg every 2 weeks for an additional 6 months. A partial response was observed only during the first 2 months, and she was unable to taper antihistamines. Her symptoms only improved with the addition of short courses of prednisone (up to 40 mg daily), which she required several times. Multiple third-line medications were trialed but discontinued due to side effects or lack of efficacy: hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily for 4 months, cyclosporine 100 mg twice daily for 1 week, mycophenolate mofetil 1000 mg twice daily for 2 months, dapsone 100 mg daily for 1 month, and sulfasalazine 1000 mg twice daily for 3 months.

### Hydroxyzine pamoate [^117RXHtD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Hydroxyzine pamoate is unrelated chemically to the phenothiazines, reserpine, meprobamate, or the benzodiazepines. It is not a cortical depressant, but its action may be due to the suppression of activity in certain key regions of the subcortical area of the central nervous system. Primary skeletal muscle relaxation has been demonstrated experimentally. Additionally, bronchodilator activity, as well as antihistaminic and analgesic effects, have been demonstrated experimentally and confirmed clinically. An antiemetic effect has been demonstrated by both the apomorphine test and the veriloid test. Pharmacological and clinical studies indicate that hydroxyzine, in therapeutic dosage, does not increase gastric secretion or acidity and in most cases, has mild antisecretory activity. Hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and its clinical effects are usually noted within 15 to 30 minutes after oral administration.

### Chlorpromazine dose for people with schizophrenia [^111PFtN5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Chlorpromazine is one of the three antipsychotic drugs on the WHO Essential Drug List. It is used worldwide. The optimal dose has been the subject of evaluative research, but summaries of this work are rare.

- **Objectives**: To determine chlorpromazine dose response and dose adverse effect relationships for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (December 2008). References of all included studies were examined for further trials.

- **Selection criteria**: All relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fixed doses of chlorpromazine for people with schizophrenia and reporting clinical outcomes.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated fixed-effect relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) based on a fixed-effect model.

- **Main results**: We included four relevant studies (1012 participants) in this review. They are all hospital-based trials, have a duration of less than six months, and are at moderate risk of bias. When a low dose (≤ 400 mg/day) was compared with a medium dose (401–800 mg/day), mental state data were very few and difficult to interpret (n = 22, 1 RCT, WMD 'withdrawal retardation' -2.00 CI -3.76 to -0.24). More people left for inefficacy of treatment in the low dose group (n = 48, 1 RCT, RR 4.24 CI 0.24 to 74.01). In the short term, all measured extrapyramidal adverse effects tended to be lower in the low dose group (n = 70, 2 RCTs).

### Hydroxyzine pamoate [^111ajqi1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosage**: For symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis, and as an adjunct in organic disease states where anxiety is manifested: In adults, the dosage is 50 to 100 mg, taken four times daily. For children under 6 years, the recommended dosage is 50 mg daily in divided doses, and for those over 6 years, 50 to 100 mg daily in divided doses.

	- For managing pruritus caused by allergic conditions such as chronic urticaria and atopic and contact dermatoses, as well as histamine-mediated pruritus: Adults should take 25 mg three or four times daily. Children under 6 years should have a daily dosage of 50 mg in divided doses, while those over 6 years should take between 50 to 100 mg daily in divided doses.

	- **As a sedative when used as premedication and following general anesthesia**: The recommended dosage for adults is 50 to 100 mg, while for children it is 0.6 mg/kg.

When treatment is initiated intramuscularly, subsequent doses may be administered orally. As with all medications, the dosage should be adjusted according to the patient's response to therapy.

### Chlorpromazine equivalent doses for the newer atypical antipsychotics [^11485Ar3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Several clinical and research applications require an estimation of therapeutic dose equivalence across antipsychotic medications. Since the advent of the newer atypical antipsychotics, new dose equivalent estimations have been needed.

- **Method**: The reported minimum effective dose was identified for each newer atypical antipsychotic medication and for haloperidol across all available fixed-dose placebo-controlled studies. Reported minimum effective dose equivalence ratios to haloperidol were then converted to chlorpromazine equivalents using the "2 mg of haloperidol equals 100 mg of chlorpromazine" convention.

- **Data sources and study selection**: To identify the fixed-dose studies, the following sources were searched until June 2002: MEDLINE, the bibliographies of identified reports, published meta-analyses and reviews, Cochrane reviews, Freedom of Information Act material available from the Food and Drug Administration, and abstracts from several scientific meetings from 1997 to 2002.

- **Results**: Doses equivalent to 100 mg/day of chlorpromazine were 2 mg/day for risperidone, 5 mg/day for olanzapine, 75 mg/day for quetiapine, 60 mg/day for ziprasidone, and 7.5 mg/day for aripiprazole.

- **Conclusion**: These equivalency estimates may be useful for clinical and research purposes. The source of the dose equivalency estimation is evidence-based and consistent across medication.
