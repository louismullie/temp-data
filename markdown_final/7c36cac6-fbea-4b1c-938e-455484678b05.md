## Question

Is chlorthalidone appropriate for blood pressure control in a patient with an eGFR of 43?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether chlorthalidone is appropriate for blood-pressure control in a patient with chronic kidney disease and an eGFR around 43 mL/min/1.73 m². Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the CKD stage and how thiazide-like diuretics perform as kidney function declines. Then, I should verify the trial evidence for efficacy and risks in advanced CKD. Next, I will check regulatory labeling and guideline recommendations to ensure alignment. After that, I need to consider dosing strategy, potency, and monitoring to mitigate adverse effects. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation with contingencies for special situations like volume overload or concomitant therapies [^1131CjHu] [^113jY41P] [^113upVBB] [^115K9ArS] [^1162LoMg].

> Let me first confirm the clinical framing: an eGFR of approximately 43 mL/min/1.73 m² corresponds to CKD stage 3b, which still permits the antihypertensive effect of thiazide-like diuretics, though natriuretic efficiency may wane as GFR falls further; importantly, data show chlorthalidone retains BP-lowering efficacy even into stage 4 CKD, suggesting it should remain effective at an eGFR of 43 mL/min/1.73 m² [^1131CjHu] [^115yW9gx].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence for efficacy in low eGFR settings; the CLICK randomized, double-blind trial in stage 4 CKD (mean eGFR ~23) demonstrated that chlorthalidone starting at 12.5 mg and titrated up to 50 mg reduced 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP by about 10–11 mmHg versus placebo at 12 weeks and substantially reduced albuminuria, indicating clinically meaningful antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effects even with advanced renal impairment [^113jY41P] [^113upVBB] [^114iszGH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about renal function effects; I initially recalled a small decline in eGFR with diuretic-induced volume shifts, but the provided summary notes a modest improvement in eGFR at week 12 in CLICK while still reporting transient rises in creatinine during titration, so I should reconcile that by acknowledging short-term hemodynamic changes with a neutral to slightly favorable 12-week eGFR signal alongside robust BP and albuminuria benefits in that population [^113jY41P] [^113upVBB] [^116AZZc7].

> I need to check safety and tolerability signals carefully; hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hyperuricemia, and transient creatinine increases were more frequent with chlorthalidone in advanced CKD trials and cohorts, which underscores the need for early lab surveillance after initiation and dose changes, and at an eGFR of 43 these risks remain relevant but manageable with prudent dosing and monitoring [^113jY41P] [^113upVBB] [^114kSK7x] [^113Qw3rs].

> Let me verify regulatory guidance; the FDA labeling for chlorthalidone indicates use with caution when creatinine clearance is 10–30 mL/min and avoidance when CrCl is below 10 mL/min, so at an eGFR around 43 mL/min/1.73 m² this agent is not contraindicated, though careful monitoring is still warranted; I initially thought the label discouraged use under 30 mL/min outright, but wait, it actually specifies caution rather than prohibition in the 10–30 mL/min range, which supports appropriateness in stage 3b CKD [^115K9ArS] [^112WxL4f] [^116vmf8Q].

> For dosing, I should confirm an approach that balances potency with safety; chlorthalidone is roughly threefold more potent than hydrochlorothiazide on a milligram-to-milligram basis, and low doses have demonstrated 24-hour ambulatory BP benefits, so starting at 12.5 mg daily (or 25 mg every other day) with 2–4 week titration is a prudent strategy at eGFR 43 to limit electrolyte shifts and creatinine bumps, particularly if combined with RAAS blockade or a loop diuretic where applicable [^111sJRxc] [^116RjkFR] [^1139wFbm] [^115EaUxs].

> I should confirm guideline alignment; KDIGO recommends ACE inhibitor or ARB as foundational therapy in CKD with albuminuria and cautions against dual RAAS blockade, while ESC 2024 advises initiating BP-lowering therapy at or above 130/80 mmHg in moderate-to-severe CKD if tolerated; both frameworks allow addition of a thiazide-like diuretic such as chlorthalidone when BP remains above target or as an alternative when RAAS agents are contraindicated or not tolerated [^1131CjHu] [^115CA32Y] [^1162LoMg].

> But wait, what if there is concomitant volume overload or resistant hypertension; I will now examine combination strategies in advanced CKD where a loop diuretic may be needed, and data suggest bumetanide plus chlorthalidone can further reduce volume and BP in stage 4–5 CKD, though close monitoring is critical; similarly, in tacrolimus-treated kidney transplant recipients, chlorthalidone achieved BP reductions comparable to amlodipine and reduced proteinuria, albeit with transient renal and metabolic laboratory changes, supporting its utility across complex CKD contexts when used carefully [^111sHuxv] [^117Xvy8e] [^117TNxRN].

> I should double-check the monitoring plan; baseline electrolytes, creatinine/eGFR, glucose, and uric acid should be obtained before initiation, rechecked within 1–2 weeks after starting or uptitrating, and then periodically, with earlier assessment if symptoms of hypokalemia or hyponatremia occur; given the higher risk of electrolyte disturbances relative to HCTZ observed in comparative studies, patient education and timely lab follow-up are essential to safe use in CKD [^114kSK7x] [^113Qw3rs].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation: chlorthalidone is appropriate at an eGFR of about 43 mL/min/1.73 m² for BP control, ideally layered onto guideline-directed therapy when indicated, beginning at 12.5 mg daily with cautious titration and early laboratory monitoring; avoid use only in anuric states or when CrCl is below 10 mL/min, and apply extra caution if CrCl approaches 30 mL/min, with vigilance for hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hyperuricemia, and transient creatinine changes that can often be managed with dose adjustment, supplementation, or regimen modification [^115K9ArS] [^113jY41P] [^113upVBB] [^1131CjHu] [^1162LoMg].

> Bottom line, after reviewing the evidence and verifying labeling and guidelines, I conclude that chlorthalidone can be safely and effectively used for hypertension in stage 3b CKD at eGFR ≈ 43 mL/min/1.73 m², provided it is started low, titrated thoughtfully, and monitored closely, with its efficacy in even stage 4 CKD and its known risk profile guiding a careful, reference-consistent implementation plan [^113jY41P] [^113upVBB] [^115K9ArS] [^1131CjHu].

Yes, chlorthalidone is advisable for BP lowering at **eGFR 43 mL/min/1.73 m²**. It **remains effective in stage 3b CKD**, with evidence of ~10 mm Hg systolic reduction [^113jY41P] and albuminuria lowering in advanced CKD. Use **low starting doses (12.5–25 mg/day)** [^113jY41P], monitor for hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hyperuricemia [^111EyFYE], and adjust as needed. Chlorthalidone is preferred over hydrochlorothiazide for its longer half-life and greater potency [^111sJRxc] [^116RjkFR], but loop diuretics may be needed if volume overload or eGFR declines further [^111sHuxv].

## Efficacy of chlorthalidone in CKD stage 3b

In the **CLICK trial** (stage 4 CKD; mean eGFR ~23 mL/min/1.73 m²), chlorthalidone reduced 24-hour systolic BP by ~10 mm Hg [^113jY41P] and decreased albuminuria by ~50% over 12 weeks. At an **eGFR of 43**, chlorthalidone is expected to be effective [^115yW9gx] because thiazide-like diuretics retain antihypertensive efficacy down to ~30 mL/min/1.73 m².

---

## Safety considerations

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Monitor for hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hyperuricemia; these are more common in CKD and may require dose adjustment or supplementation [^111EyFYE].

- **Renal function monitoring**: Regularly check renal function, especially with other nephrotoxic drugs or RAAS inhibitors.

- **Dose adjustment**: Start low (12.5–25 mg/day) and titrate cautiously based on response and labs [^113jY41P].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

According to **KDIGO 2021**, thiazide-like diuretics are appropriate for hypertension in CKD, with monitoring of electrolytes and renal function. ESC 2024 recommends initiating **BP-lowering therapy** in moderate-to-severe CKD (including stage 3b) when BP is ≥ 130/80 mm Hg, if tolerated [^1162LoMg].

---

## Comparison with other antihypertensive agents

| **Attribute** | **Chlorthalidone** | **Loop diuretics** | **ACE inhibitors/ARBs** | **Calcium channel blockers** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Efficacy in CKD stage 3b | Effective; reduces BP and albuminuria [^113jY41P] | Effective, especially with volume overload [^111sHuxv] | Effective; reduce proteinuria and slow CKD progression [^1131CjHu] | Effective; minimal renal impact [^113H6sFS] |
| Safety considerations | Monitor electrolytes and renal function | Monitor electrolytes and renal function | Monitor for hyperkalemia and renal function | Monitor for edema and hypotension |
| Clinical recommendations | Recommended with monitoring | Preferred if eGFR < 30 or volume overload | First-line in CKD with proteinuria | Alternative or adjunctive therapy |

---

## Clinical scenarios where chlorthalidone may not be advisable

- **Severe renal impairment**: eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or CrCl < 10 mL/min [^112WxL4f] [^116vmf8Q].

- **Severe electrolyte disturbances**: Persistent hypokalemia or hyponatremia despite correction [^111EyFYE].

- **Gout**: History of frequent flares due to hyperuricemia risk [^111sJRxc].

- **Allergy**: Known hypersensitivity to sulfonamide-derived diuretics.

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Initial dose**: 12.5–25 mg once daily [^113jY41P].

- **Monitoring**: Check serum electrolytes and renal function within 1–2 weeks of initiation or dose change.

- **Dose titration**: Adjust based on BP response and labs; consider potassium supplementation or a potassium-sparing diuretic if hypokalemia occurs [^111poCTc].

- **Combination therapy**: Consider with loop diuretics if volume overload or resistant hypertension [^111sHuxv].

---

Chlorthalidone is effective at **eGFR 43** for BP control, with evidence of BP and albuminuria reduction in advanced CKD [^113upVBB]. Use low doses, monitor electrolytes and renal function, and adjust therapy as needed.

### Meta-analysis of dose-response relationships for hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, and bendroflumethiazide on blood pressure, serum potassium, and urate [^111sJRxc]. Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are widely used in the management of hypertension. However, recently, the equivalence of hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone for blood pressure (BP) lowering and the prevention of cardiovascular disease has been questioned. We performed a meta-analysis to characterize the dose-response relationships for three commonly prescribed thiazide diuretics: hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, and bendroflumethiazide, on BP, serum potassium, and urate.

Randomized, double-blind, parallel placebo-controlled trials were identified using Embase (1980–2010 week 50), Medline (1950–2010 November week 3), metaRegister of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Central. These trials met the following criteria: ≥ 2 different monotherapy dose arms, follow-up duration ≥ 4 weeks, and baseline washout of medication ≥ 2 weeks. A total of 26 trials examined hydrochlorothiazide, 3 examined chlorthalidone, and 1 examined bendroflumethiazide. Studies included a total of 4,683 subjects in over 53 comparison arms.

Meta-regression of the effect of thiazides on systolic BP showed a log-linear relationship with a potency series: bendroflumethiazide > chlorthalidone > hydrochlorothiazide. The estimated dose of each drug predicted to reduce systolic BP by 10 mm Hg was 1.4 mg, 8.6 mg, and 26.4 mg, respectively. There was no evidence of a difference in the maximum reduction of systolic BP by high doses of different thiazides. Potency series for diastolic BP, serum potassium, and urate were similar to those seen for systolic BP. Hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, and bendroflumethiazide have markedly different potencies.

### Parallel-group 8-week study on chlorthalidone effects in hypertensives with low kidney function [^115yW9gx]. Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Short-term effects of chlorthalidone in individuals with low kidney function are unknown. An 8-week treatment with 25 mg of chlorthalidone was compared between hypertensive patients with low kidney function and those with normal function, as assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Each participant was already on ongoing treatment with three antihypertensive drugs and did not have severe hypertension or severe comorbidities. The treatment period consisted of five visits at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Post-treatment laboratory evaluations were performed 3 to 4 days before the week-8 visit.

The two groups differed in baseline eGFR (low kidney function and control: n = 60 and 60; mean eGFR, 39 and 76; range, 15–59 and 60–104) but were similar in sex, age, and baseline blood pressure. Week-8 blood pressure changes showed a decrease in both groups, though there was no significant difference between them (low kidney function and control: systolic pressure, -20 and -23; 95% confidence interval, -22/-18 and -26/-19; diastolic pressure, -9 and -10; 95% CI, -11/-7 and -13/-8). The incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups (15.0% and 16.7%).

Baseline eGFR did not predict blood pressure changes and adverse events in either group (P > 0.6).

### Outcomes in hypertensive black and nonblack patients treated with chlorthalidone, amlodipine, and lisinopril [^113H6sFS]. JAMA (2005). High credibility.

Few cardiovascular outcome data are available for blacks with hypertension treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or calcium channel blockers (CCBs). The objective of this study was to determine whether an ACE inhibitor or CCB is superior to a thiazide-type diuretic in reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence in racial subgroups.

This research involved a prespecified subgroup analysis of the ALLHAT trial, a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, clinical outcome trial conducted between February 1994 and March 2002. It included 33,357 hypertensive patients from the US and Canada, aged 55 years or older, with at least one other cardiovascular risk factor. Notably, 35% of the participants were black.

In the interventions, antihypertensive regimens were initiated with a CCB (amlodipine) or an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril), compared against a thiazide-type diuretic (chlorthalidone). Additional medications were used to achieve target blood pressures of less than 140/90 mm Hg.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcome was combined fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), analyzed by intention-to-treat. Secondary outcomes comprised all-cause mortality, stroke, combined CVD (including CHD death, nonfatal MI, stroke, angina, coronary revascularization, heart failure [HF], or peripheral vascular disease), and end-stage renal disease.

- **Results**: No significant difference was found between treatment groups for the primary CHD outcome in either racial subgroup. For amlodipine vs. chlorthalidone, heart failure was the only prespecified clinical outcome that differed significantly, with an overall relative risk (RR) of 1.37 (95% confidence interval).

### Effect of the combination of bumetanide plus chlorthalidone on hypertension and volume overload in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 4–5 KDIGO without renal replacement therapy: A double-blind randomized HEBE-CKD trial [^111sHuxv]. BMC Nephrology (2022). High credibility.

The co-administration of loop diuretics with thiazide diuretics is a therapeutic strategy in patients with hypertension and volume overload. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of treatment with bumetanide plus chlorthalidone in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4–5 KDIGO.

- **Methods**: A double-blind randomized study was conducted. Patients were randomized into two groups: bumetanide plus chlorthalidone group (intervention) and the bumetanide plus placebo group (control) to evaluate differences in total body water (TBW), extracellular water (ECW), and ECW/TBW between baseline and 30 days of follow-up. Volume overload was defined by bioelectrical impedance analysis as fluid volume above the 90th percentile of a presumed healthy reference population.

- **Results**: Thirty-two patients with a mean age of 57.2 ± 9.34 years and a median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 16.7 mL/min/1.73 m² (range 2.2–29) were included. There was decreased volume overload in the liters of TBW on Day 7 (intervention: -2.5 vs. control: -0.59, p = 0.003) and Day 30 (intervention: -5.3 vs. control: -0.07, p = 0.016); and in liters of ECW on Day 7 (intervention: -1.58 vs. control: -0.43, p < 0.001) and Day 30 (intervention: -3.05 vs. control: -0.15, p < 0.000). There was also a decrease in systolic blood pressure on Day 7 (intervention: -18 vs. control: -7.5, p = 0.073) and Day 30 (intervention: -26.1 vs. control: -10, p = 0.028) and in diastolic blood pressure on Day 7 (intervention: -8.5 vs. control: -6.3, p < 0.05).

### Chlorthalidone vs. hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension-cardiovascular events [^111EyFYE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Whether chlorthalidone is superior to hydrochlorothiazide for preventing major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension is unclear.

- **Methods**: In a pragmatic trial, we randomly assigned adults 65 years of age or older who were patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs health system. These patients had been receiving hydrochlorothiazide at a daily dose of 25 or 50 mg and were assigned to continue therapy with hydrochlorothiazide or to switch to chlorthalidone at a daily dose of 12.5 or 25 mg. The primary outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure resulting in hospitalization, urgent coronary revascularization for unstable angina, and non-cancer-related death. Safety was also assessed.

- **Results**: A total of 13,523 patients underwent randomization. The mean age was 72 years. At baseline, hydrochlorothiazide at a dose of 25 mg per day had been prescribed to 12,781 patients (94.5%). The mean baseline systolic blood pressure in each group was 139 mm Hg. At a median follow-up of 2.4 years, there was little difference in the occurrence of primary-outcome events between the chlorthalidone group (702 patients [10.4%]) and the hydrochlorothiazide group (675 patients [10.0%]) (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.16; P = 0.45). There were no between-group differences in the occurrence of any of the components of the primary outcome. The incidence of hypokalemia was higher in the chlorthalidone group than in the hydrochlorothiazide group (6.0% vs. 4.4%, P < 0.001).

In conclusion, this large pragmatic trial of thiazide diuretics suggests…

### Efficacy of low-dose chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide as assessed by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring [^116RjkFR]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). High credibility.

Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretic agents are being increasingly used at lower doses. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in the 12.5-mg dose remains the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive agent in the United States.

- **Objectives**: This study compared chlorthalidone, 6.25 mg daily, with HCTZ, 12.5 mg daily, by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring and evaluated efficacy. Because HCTZ has been perceived as a short-acting drug, a third comparison with an extended-release formulation (HCTZ-controlled release [CR]) was added.

- **Methods**: This 12-week comparative, double-blind, outpatient study randomized 54 patients with stage 1 hypertension to receive either chlorthalidone, 6.25 mg, (n = 16); HCTZ, 12.5 mg (n = 18); or HCTZ-CR, 12.5 mg (n = 20). ABP monitoring was performed at baseline and after 4 and 12 weeks of therapy.

- **Results**: All three treatments significantly (p < 0.01) lowered office BP at weeks 4 and 12 from baseline. At weeks 4 and 12, significant reductions in systolic and diastolic 24-h ambulatory and nighttime BP (p < 0.01) were observed with chlorthalidone but not with HCTZ. At weeks 4 (p = 0.015) and 12 (p = 0.020), nighttime systolic ABP was significantly lower in the chlorthalidone group than in the HCTZ group. With HCTZ therapy, sustained hypertension was converted into masked hypertension. In contrast to the HCTZ group, the HCTZ-CR group also showed a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in 24-h ABP. All three treatments were generally safe and well tolerated.

- **Conclusions**: Treatment with low-dose chlorthalidone, 6.25 mg daily, significantly reduced m

### Chlorthalidone for hypertension in advanced chronic kidney disease [^113upVBB]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Little evidence has been available to support the use of thiazide diuretics to treat hypertension in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease and poorly controlled hypertension, as confirmed by 24-hour ambulatory blood-pressure monitoring, in a 1:1 ratio to receive chlorthalidone at an initial dose of 12.5 mg per day. Increases were made every 4 weeks if needed, up to a maximum dose of 50 mg per day, or placebo; randomization was stratified according to previous use of loop diuretics. The primary outcome was the change in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included changes from baseline to 12 weeks in the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level, plasma renin and aldosterone levels, and total body volume. Safety was also assessed.

- **Results**: A total of 160 patients underwent randomization, of whom 121 (76%) had diabetes mellitus and 96 (60%) were receiving loop diuretics. At baseline, the mean (± SD) estimated glomerular filtration rate was 23.2 ± 4.2 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body-surface area, and the mean number of antihypertensive medications prescribed was 3.4 ± 1.4. At randomization, the mean 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure was 142.6 ± 8.1 mm Hg in the chlorthalidone group and 140.1 ± 8.1 mm Hg in the placebo group, with the mean 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure being 74.6 ± 10.1 mm Hg and 72.8 ± 9.3 mm Hg, respectively. The adjusted change in 24-hour systolic blood pressure continued from baseline.

### Thiazide diuretics alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics to treat hypertension: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111poCTc]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Thiazide diuretics and thiazide-like diuretics (e.g. chlorthalidone and indapamide) were the primary drugs tested in landmark randomized controlled trials (RCTs). These trials demonstrated the high degree of efficacy of blood pressure (BP) lowering in preventing major cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. However, there are no RCTs comparing the efficacy of different thiazides, alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics, to prevent cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension. Indirect comparisons through meta-analyses and evidence from observational studies returned conflicting results.

Comparisons of the BP-lowering effect of several thiazides, alone and associated with potassium-sparing agents, have been rarely investigated in head-to-head clinical trials. The effect of amiloride and triamterene on BP remained uncertain and was not identified in a systematic review of six double-blind RCTs with a total of 496 participants. However, in two isolated trials, amiloride increased the BP-lowering effect of hydrochlorothiazide. Amiloride may be effective in resistant hypertension, particularly at higher doses. Potassium supplementation has a BP-lowering effect, and the replacement of a proportion of sodium chloride with potassium chloride in meals reduced BP. A pioneering nutritional RCT showed that replacing 25% of the sodium chloride content with potassium chloride was associated with reducing the incidence of major cardiovascular events and death. The antihypertensive efficacy of spironolactone and eplerenone has been well documented.

The study aimed to compare the blood pressure (BP)-lowering efficacy of a chlorthalidone/amiloride combination pill with losartan during the initial management of stage I hypertension.

In a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial, 655 participants were followed for 18 months across 21 Brazilian academic centers. The trial included adult volunteers aged 30–70 years with stage I hypertension (BP 140–159/90–99 mmHg) after 3 months of a lifestyle intervention. Participants were randomized to receive either 12.5/2.5 mg of chlorthalidone/amiloride (N = 333) or 50 mg of losartan (N = 322). If BP remained uncontrolled after 3 months, the study medication dose was doubled, and if it remained uncontrolled after 6 months, amlodipine (5 and 10 mg) and propranolol (40 and 80 mg twice daily) were added as open-label drugs in a progressive fashion. At the end of follow-up, 609 participants (93%) were evaluated.

The results showed a difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) during the 18 months of follow-up of 2.3 mmHg (95% confidence interval: 1.2 to 3.3), favoring the chlorthalidone/amiloride group. Compared with those randomized to the diuretic, more participants allocated to losartan had their initial dose doubled, and more used add-on antihypertensive medication. Levels of blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and incidence of diabetes were similar between the two treatment groups. However, serum potassium was lower and serum cholesterol was higher in the diuretic arm. Microalbuminuria tended to be higher in patients with diabetes allocated to losartan (28.5 ± 40.4 mg versus 16.2 ± 26.7 mg, P = 0.09).

### Evidence-based diuretic therapy for improving cardiovascular prognosis in systemic hypertension [^115ojWaM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Diuretics are among the most commonly prescribed cardiovascular (CV) medications. The strength of evidence supporting the effectiveness of diuretics in lowering blood pressure and for preventing major adverse CV events in patients with hypertension varies considerably among diuretic classes and even among agents within the same class. Unfortunately, common prescribing habits among American physicians, including specialists in CV diseases, are not in line with the existing evidence regarding diuretic therapy for improving CV prognosis. In conclusion, although hydrochlorothiazide is the standard diuretic used for hypertension, the outcomes data suggest that chlorthalidone, indapamide, and possibly even the aldosterone receptor blockers (spironolactone and eplerenone) may be superior agents.

### Usefulness of urinary potassium to creatinine ratio to predict diuretic response in patients with acute heart failure and preserved ejection fraction [^115ttjvL]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

- **Comparison of natriuresis among diuretic strategies for K/Cr below the median (< 0.56)**: Estimates, represented as least squares means (LSM) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), were derived from linear mixed models for changes in natriuresis according to treatment during the 72-hour follow-up period. This included the treatment x visit interaction term (24 and 72 hours visits) and was adjusted for urinary sodium (uNa) at baseline, age, total dose of furosemide, and baseline glomerular filtration rate. The upper section of the bar charts displays the LSM value, and the lines' limits represent the corresponding 95% CI.

- **Comparison of natriuresis among diuretic strategies for K/Cr equal to or above the median (≥ 0.56)**: Estimates, again represented as LSM with 95% CI, were derived from linear mixed models for changes in natriuresis according to treatment during the 72-hour follow-up period, including the treatment x visit interaction term (24 and 72 hours visits). Adjustments were made for urinary sodium (uNa) at baseline, age, total dose of furosemide, and baseline glomerular filtration rate. The LSM value is displayed in the upper section of the bar charts, with the corresponding 95% CI represented by the upper and lower limits of the lines. K/Cr refers to the urinary potassium to creatinine ratio.

- **Estimates of covariates included in the final model for natriuresis and diuresis at 72 hours**: Multivariate analyses revealed a significant increase in 72-hour cumulative diuresis irrespective of K/Cr status in those on chlorthalidone.

### Effects of spironolactone and chlorthalidone on cardiovascular structure and function in chronic kidney disease: A randomized, open-label trial [^114Bb7rE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, treatment with spironolactone in early-stage CKD reduced left ventricular mass and arterial stiffness compared with placebo. It is not known if these effects were due to BP reduction or specific vascular and myocardial effects of spironolactone.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: A prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point study was conducted in four UK centers (Birmingham, Cambridge, Edinburgh, and London) comparing spironolactone 25 mg to chlorthalidone 25 mg once daily for 40 weeks in 154 participants with nondiabetic stage 2 and 3 CKD (eGFR 30–89 ml/min per 1.73 m²). The primary end point was a change in left ventricular mass on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Participants were on treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and had controlled BP (target ≤ 130/80 mm Hg).

- **Results**: There was no significant difference in left ventricular mass regression; at week 40, the adjusted mean difference for spironolactone compared with chlorthalidone was -3.8 g (95% confidence interval, -8.1 to 0.5 g, P = 0.08). Office and 24-hour ambulatory BPs fell in response to both drugs with no significant differences between treatments. Pulse wave velocity was not significantly different between groups; at week 40, the adjusted mean difference for spironolactone compared with chlorthalidone was 0.04 m/s (-0.4 m/s, 0.5 m/s, P = 0.90). Hyperkalemia (defined as ≥ 5.4 mEq/L) occurred more frequently with spironolactone (12 versus two participants).

### Atenolol and chlorthalidone [^115k7nVP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In man, the absorption of an oral dose is rapid, consistent, but incomplete. Approximately 50% of an oral dose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with the remainder being excreted unchanged in the feces. Peak blood levels are reached between 2 and 4 hours after ingestion. Unlike propranolol or metoprolol, but like nadolol, hydrophilic atenolol undergoes little or no metabolism by the liver, with the absorbed portion eliminated primarily by renal excretion. Atenolol differs from propranolol as only a small amount (6% to 16%) is bound to plasma proteins. This kinetic profile results in relatively consistent plasma drug levels with about a fourfold interpatient variation. There is no information available on the pharmacokinetic effect of atenolol on chlorthalidone.

The elimination half-life of atenolol is approximately 6 to 7 hours, and there is no alteration of the kinetic profile of the drug by chronic administration. Following doses of 50 mg or 100 mg, both beta-blocking and antihypertensive effects persist for at least 24 hours. When renal function is impaired, the elimination of atenolol is closely related to the glomerular filtration rate; however, significant accumulation does not occur until creatinine clearance falls below 35 mL/min/1.73 m² [see prescribing information for atenolol].

- **Atenolol geriatric pharmacology**: In general, elderly patients present higher atenolol plasma levels, with total clearance values about 50% lower than in younger subjects. The half-life is markedly longer in the elderly compared to younger subjects.

### Effectiveness of chlorthalidone plus amiloride for the prevention of hypertension: The PREVER-Prevention randomized clinical trial [^11231a7E]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). High credibility.

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, treatment using low doses of a thiazide-type diuretic combined with a potassium-sparing agent prevented the incidence of hypertension by almost 50% in patients with prehypertension. Moreover, the intervention appeared to be safe and resulted in a small but nominally significant reduction in left ventricular mass (LVM), as estimated by ECG. The incidence of new-onset hypertension was reduced by approximately 4% per year, corresponding to a number needed to treat of about 25. During 18 months of follow-up, blood pressure (BP) reduction was modest and would be of insufficient magnitude to demonstrate a significant reduction in clinical complications over a 5- to 10-year period of follow-up, even in a study with a very large sample size. Nonetheless, the consequences of hypertension occur over several decades. If maintained, effects of the size noted in our trial would likely place many patients on a different track for increasing BP with age, promoting lower age-related levels of BP, prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes, and potentially avoiding the need for high doses of antihypertensive medications later in life.

### Association between more intensive vs less intensive blood pressure lowering and risk of mortality in chronic kidney disease stages 3 to 5: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115WzKdb]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Trials in patients with hypertension have demonstrated that intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality but may increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) incidence and progression. Whether intensive BP lowering is associated with a mortality benefit in patients with prevalent CKD remains unknown.

- **Objectives**: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to investigate if more intensive compared with less intensive BP control is associated with reduced mortality risk in persons with CKD stages 3 to 5.

- **Data sources**: Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, Science Citation Index, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov electronic databases.

- **Study selection**: All RCTs were included that compared two defined BP targets (either active BP treatment vs placebo or no treatment, or intensive vs less intensive BP control) and enrolled adults (≥ 18 years) with CKD stages 3 to 5 (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) exclusively or that included a CKD subgroup between January 1, 1950, and June 1, 2016.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Two of us independently evaluated study quality and extracted characteristics and mortality events among persons with CKD within the intervention phase for each trial. When outcomes within the CKD group had not previously been published, trial investigators were contacted to request data within the CKD subset of their original trials.

- **Main outcome and measure**: All-cause mortality during the active treatment phase.

### A randomized, multicenter, open-label, blinded end point trial comparing the effects of spironolactone to chlorthalidone on left ventricular mass in patients with early-stage chronic kidney disease: Rationale and design of the SPIRO-CKD trial [^111pYSoa]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The effect of thiazide-like drugs on left ventricular (LV) mass in early-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) has not previously been examined, although they are effective in lowering blood pressure in this group. The study will also provide evidence on the safety of both spironolactone and chlorthalidone in subjects with early-stage CKD, offering valuable data on the effects of both drugs on kidney function measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and on changes in serum potassium and sodium concentrations. If safety and efficacy are confirmed, a rationale would be provided for a larger clinical trial designed to examine the effects of mineralocorticoid receptor blocker (MRB) drugs on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality end points.

It is acknowledged that the nonblinded study design increases the risk of bias, but the prospective randomized open-blinded end point (PROBE) design maintains the benefits associated with a strict randomization procedure, while the blinded end points help to eliminate bias. In a meta-analysis of trials of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), changes in mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in double-blind and PROBE trials were not significantly different.

### Edarbyclor [^115Wkvwz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Chlorthalidone produces diuresis with increased excretion of sodium and chloride. The site of action appears to be the distal renal tubule (early convoluted part), inhibiting NaCl reabsorption (by antagonizing the Na+-Cl-cotransporter) and promoting Ca++ reabsorption (by an unknown mechanism). The enhanced delivery of Na+ and water to the cortical collecting tubule and/or the increased flow rate leads to increased secretion and elimination of K+ and H+. The diuretic effects of chlorthalidone lead to decreased extracellular fluid volume, plasma volume, cardiac output, total exchangeable sodium, glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma flow. Although the mechanism of action of chlorthalidone and related drugs is not wholly clear, sodium and water depletion appear to provide a basis for its antihypertensive effect.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Edarbyclor tablets have been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure. Both azilsartan medoxomil and chlorthalidone lower blood pressure by reducing peripheral resistance but through complementary mechanisms.

Azilsartan inhibits the pressor effects of an angiotensin II infusion in a dose-related manner. An azilsartan single dose equivalent to 32 mg azilsartan medoxomil inhibited the maximal pressor effect by approximately 90% at peak, and approximately 60% at 24 hours. Plasma angiotensin I and II concentrations and plasma renin activity increased while plasma aldosterone concentrations decreased after single and repeated administration of azilsartan medoxomil to healthy subjects.

### Long-term effects of chlorthalidone versus hydrochlorothiazide on electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy in the multiple risk factor intervention trial [^112ds7QP]. Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Chlorthalidone (CTD) reduces 24-hour blood pressure more effectively than hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), but whether this influences electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy is uncertain. One source of comparative data is the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial, which randomly assigned 8,012 hypertensive men to special intervention (SI) or usual care. SI participants could use CTD or HCTZ initially; previous analyses have grouped clinics by their main diuretic used (C-clinics: CTD; H-clinics: HCTZ). After 48 months, SI participants receiving HCTZ were recommended to switch to CTD, in part because higher mortality was observed for SI compared with usual care participants in H-clinics, whereas the opposite was found in C-clinics.

In this analysis, we examined change in continuous measures of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy using both an ecological analysis by previously reported C- or H-clinic groupings and an individual participant analysis where use of CTD or HCTZ by SI participants was considered and updated annually. Through 48 months, differences between SI and usual care in left ventricular hypertrophy were larger for C-clinics compared with H-clinics (Sokolow-Lyon: -93.9 versus -54.9 μV, P = 0.049; Cornell voltage: -68.1 versus -35.9 μV, P = 0.019; Cornell voltage product: -4.6 versus -2.2 μV/ms, P = 0.071; left ventricular mass: -4.4 versus -2.8 g, P = 0.002). At the individual participant level, Sokolow-Lyon and left ventricular mass were significantly lower for SI men receiving CTD compared with HCTZ through 48 months and 84 months of follow-up.

### Effect of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring guided antihypertensive treatment on renal progression in patients with chronic kidney disease: a randomized comparative study [^116QapKE]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). High credibility.

Adequate blood pressure (BP) control is pivotal for managing chronic kidney disease (CKD). The optimal approach for monitoring BP to delay CKD progression is not yet clear. Patients with hypertension and CKD stage 3–4 were randomized into ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) or office BP groups. All patients had ABPM at baseline and 18 months, and the ABPM group additionally underwent ABPM at 3 and 6 months. Each ABPM result was notified only for the ABPM group. The BP target was daytime ABP less than 135/85 mmHg for the ABPM group and office BP less than 140/90 mmHg for the office BP group. The primary outcome was a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) during 18 months.

A total of 146 patients were randomized into the ABPM (n = 69) and office BP groups (n = 77). Although office BP was comparable in the two groups at baseline, daytime ABP was higher in the ABPM group (median 140 vs. 132 mmHg). Initial eGFR was 35.7 ± 12.5 ml/min per 1.73 m² in the ABPM group and 34.6 ± 12.0 ml/min per 1.73 m² in the office BP group. eGFR change was -5.5 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) -7.7 to -3.4] ml/min per 1.73 m² in the ABPM group and -5.0 (95% CI -6.9 to -3.0) ml/min per 1.73 m² in the office BP group (P = 0.704). Renal events occurred in 10 patients (15.6%) from the ABPM group and five (7.1%) from the office BP group (P = 0.120).

The present study did not show a beneficial effect of ABPM for controlling hypertension in CKD compared with conventional office BP monitoring in terms of renal outcomes.

### Are diuretics a clandestine risk factor for patients with treatment-resistant hypertension [^115d76VK]? Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

Controlling blood pressure in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension is essential and often involves thiazide or loop diuretics to enhance renal salt excretion and reduce body fluid volumes. However, in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, using diuretics without suppressing aldosterone production and mineralocorticosteroid receptor (MR) activation may be insufficient to prevent heart failure, excessive cardiovascular mortality, and chronic kidney disease progression. This review explores the possibility that diuretic therapy for treatment-resistant hypertension constitutes a risk factor for preventable cardiovascular and renal disease progression, potentially hidden by the strong offsetting effects of reduced blood pressure. Achieving full benefits from diuretic therapy in treatment-resistant hypertension may require earlier prescription of MR antagonists alongside diuretics, rather than delaying their use to fourth-line agents in uncontrolled cases. This approach requires testing in appropriate clinical trials.

### Chlorthalidone versus amlodipine for hypertension in kidney transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus: A randomized crossover trial [^117TNxRN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Chlorthalidone is a very effective antihypertensive drug, but it has not been studied prospectively in kidney transplant recipients with hypertension. Recent data indicate that calcineurin inhibitors activate the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter, providing further rationale to test thiazides in this population.

- **Study design**: Randomized noninferiority crossover trial (noninferiority margin -2.8 mmHg).

- **Setting & participants**: Hypertensive kidney transplant recipients using tacrolimus (median duration, 2.4 years after transplantation; mean estimated glomerular filtration rate, 63 ± 27 [SD] mL/min/1.73 m²; mean systolic blood pressure [SBP], 151 ± 12 mmHg).

- **Intervention**: Amlodipine (5–10 mg) and chlorthalidone (12.5–25 mg) for 8 weeks (separated by 2-week washout).

- **Outcomes**: Average daytime (9 am to 9 pm) ambulatory SBP.

- **Measurements**: Blood pressure and laboratory parameters.

- **Results**: 88 patients underwent ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, of whom 49 (56%) with average daytime SBP > 140 mmHg were enrolled. 41 patients completed the study. Amlodipine and chlorthalidone both reduced ambulatory SBP after 8 weeks (mean changes of 150 ± 12 to 137 ± 12 [SD] vs 151 ± 12 to 141 ± 13 mmHg; effect size, -4.2 [95% CI, -7.3 to 1.1] mmHg). Despite these similar blood pressure responses, chlorthalidone reduced proteinuria by 30% (effect size, -65 [95% CI, -108 to -35] mg/g) and also reduced physician-assessed peripheral edema (22% to 10%; P < 0.05 for both). In contrast, chlorthalidone temporarily reduced kidney function and increased both serum uric acid and glycated hemoglobin levels.

The study, known as the Diuretic Comparison Project, was published by Areef Ishani and colleagues in 2022 in the journal N Engl J Med. This research is related to hypertension.

In the Diuretic Comparison Project study, the trial question was: Is chlorthalidone superior to hydrochlorothiazide for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension?

- **Study design**: Multi-center, open-label, RCT.
- **Population**: 13,523 patients (431 female, 13,092 male).
- **Inclusion criteria**: Adult patients aged ≥ 65 years receiving hydrochlorothiazide at a dose of 25–50 mg/day.
- **Exclusion criteria**: Receipt of blood pressure medication containing hydrochlorothiazide combined with other agents.
- **Interventions**:
	- n = 6756 Chlorthalidone (at a daily dose of 12.5–25 mg)
	- n = 6767 Hydrochlorothiazide (at a daily dose of 25–50 mg)

The primary outcome showed no significant difference in the composite outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure resulting in hospitalization, urgent coronary revascularization for unstable angina, and non-cancer-related death (10.4% vs. 10%; HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.16).

Secondary outcomes indicated no significant difference in myocardial infarction (2.1% vs. 2.1%; HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.28) and no significant difference in hospitalization due to heart failure (3.6% vs. 3.4%; HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25).

### Effect of blood pressure control on long-term risk of end-stage renal disease and death among subgroups of patients with chronic kidney disease [^115Rw2Xx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The 2017 American Heart Association guidelines recently lowered the blood pressure (BP) level that defines hypertension from 140/90 to 130/80 mm Hg for all patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). These guidelines were strongly influenced by the results of the recent SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), which demonstrated lower cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality among patients with and without CKD at elevated cardiovascular risk who were randomized to a lower systolic BP target of < 120 mm Hg. However, the results of SPRINT have sparked considerable debate over optimal BP targets for individuals with different risk factors.

Despite the cardiovascular and mortality benefit seen with intensive BP lowering, SPRINT did not demonstrate a benefit of strict BP control on renal outcomes before the trial was stopped early by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board. There were only a small number of kidney events in SPRINT. The results of SPRINT are consistent with those of other trials in nondiabetic CKD, which also failed to demonstrate in their primary analyses a benefit to intensive BP lowering over a relatively short time period on renal or mortality outcomes. Post hoc analyses of SPRINT have suggested potential harm with an intensive BP-lowering approach among patients with CKD, including a higher risk for acute kidney injury, although most patients with CKD did recover from these acute kidney injury episodes, and acute kidney injury was not a primary outcome in SPRINT.

### Effect of blood pressure control on long-term risk of end-stage renal disease and death among subgroups of patients with chronic kidney disease [^1132BuxH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Because the duration of most clinical trials of intensive blood pressure (BP) control has been short (mean duration, ≈3 years), trials that are stopped early may have exaggerated effect sizes, and lower BP targets may be difficult to achieve in all patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). There is a need for longer‐term studies of the effect of intensive BP control on CKD and mortality outcomes, which may occur over many years. In particular, there is a paucity of trial‐based evidence to support appropriate BP targets among patients with advanced CKD (stage 4 or beyond) and among young patients with CKD (e.g. 18–40 years of age) because of their underrepresentation in most clinical trials.

There have also been few studies that have examined whether the effect of intensive BP lowering is more pronounced among patients who have other metabolic or cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity, a known risk factor for both CKD progression and death. Furthermore, guidelines suggest that the selection of BP targets be based on the estimated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, but the available risk estimators have not been validated and may not be applicable to patients under 40 years of age.

### A randomized, multicenter, open-label, blinded end point trial comparing the effects of spironolactone to chlorthalidone on left ventricular mass in patients with early-stage chronic kidney disease: Rationale and design of the SPIRO-CKD trial [^116MePwR]. American Heart Journal (2017). High credibility.

The trial started recruitment in June 2014 and aimed to recruit 350 patients over a 2-year period. However, the rate of recruitment was slower than anticipated, and it became evident by November 2015 that recruitment of this number would not be completed within the funded time. A decision was made to change the study design to one with the single primary end point of change in left ventricular (LV) mass. This adjustment allowed a sample size that could be recruited within the funded time frame (see sample size calculations section). This decision was made following discussions with the funder, the British Heart Foundation; the Trial Management Group; and the Trial Steering Committee, who remain blind to any interim data analyses.

Ethical approval for this study was awarded by the West Midlands National Research Ethics Service Committee in September 2013 (13/WM/0304). The study is funded by the British Heart Foundation (SP/12/8/29620) and is registered with Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (Clinical Trials Authorization No. 21761/0295/001–0001). The authors are solely responsible for the design and conduct of this study, all study analyses, the drafting and editing of the article, and its final contents.

Recruitment of 154 patients was completed by 31 December 2016. Eligible patients were identified using hospital and primary care medical records. All recruitment took place within hospital outpatient clinics in the aforementioned institutions in two stages.

### Chlorothiazide [^1167KPSd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Clinical pharmacology: The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. Chlorothiazide does not usually affect normal blood pressure. Chlorothiazide affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. At maximal therapeutic dosage, all thiazides are approximately equal in their diuretic efficacy. Chlorothiazide increases the excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium and bicarbonate. After oral use, diuresis begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours, and lasts about 6 to 12 hours. Following intravenous use of chlorothiazide sodium, the onset of the diuretic action occurs in 15 minutes, and the maximal action occurs in 30 minutes.

- **Pharmacokinetics and metabolism**: Chlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidney; 96 percent of an intravenous dose is excreted unchanged in the urine within 23 hours. The plasma half-life of chlorothiazide is 45 to 120 minutes. Chlorothiazide crosses the placental barrier but not the blood-brain barrier and is excreted in breast milk.

### Thiazide and the thiazide-like diuretics: Review of hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, and indapamide [^117XP6yg]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

The term thiazide is universally understood to refer to diuretics that exert their principal action in the distal tubule. The thiazide class is heterogeneous and can be further subdivided into compounds containing the benzothiadiazine ring structure — the thiazide-type (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide) — and those lacking the benzothiadiazine ring — the thiazide-like (e.g. chlorthalidone and indapamide) drugs. Thiazide-like agents are longer acting and constitute the diuretics used in most of the cardiovascular outcome trials that established the benefits of treatment with diuretics, but pragmatic aspects, such as lack of availability in convenient formulations, limit their use. Regardless of class heterogeneity, thiazides have retained importance in the management of hypertension for over 60 years. They are reliably effective as monotherapy in a majority of hypertensive patients and augment the efficacy of other classes of antihypertensives when used in combination. Importantly, a thiazide-based treatment regimen lowers cardiovascular events, and their sturdy effect reinforces their place among the recommended first-line agents to treat hypertension in major domestic and international hypertension guidelines. There are few head-to-head comparisons within the class, but potential differences have been explored indirectly as well as in non-blood pressure mechanisms and potential pleiotropic properties. Until proven otherwise, the importance of these differences remains speculative, and clinicians should assume that cardiovascular events will be lowered similarly across agents when equivalent doses are used.

### Comparative antihypertensive effects of hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone on ambulatory and office blood pressure [^1139wFbm]. Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Low-dose thiazide-type diuretics are recommended as initial therapy for most hypertensive patients. Chlorthalidone has significantly reduced stroke and cardiovascular endpoints in several landmark trials; however, hydrochlorothiazide remains favored in practice. Most clinicians assume that the drugs are interchangeable, but their antihypertensive effects at lower doses have not been directly compared.

We conducted a randomized, single-blinded, 8-week active treatment crossover study comparing chlorthalidone 12.5 mg/day (force-titrated to 25 mg/day) and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day (force-titrated to 50 mg/day) in untreated hypertensive patients. The main outcome, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring, was assessed at baseline and week 8, along with standard office BP readings every 2 weeks.

Thirty patients completed the first active treatment period, whereas 24 patients completed both. An order-drug-time interaction was observed with chlorthalidone; therefore, data from only the first active treatment period were considered. Week 8 ambulatory BPs indicated a greater reduction from baseline in systolic BP with chlorthalidone 25 mg/day compared with hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg/day (24-hour mean = -12.4 ± 1.8 mm Hg versus -7.4 ± 1.7 mm Hg; P = 0.054; nighttime mean = -13.5 ± 1.9 mm Hg versus -6.4 ± 1.8 mm Hg; P = 0.009). Office systolic BP reduction was lower at week 2 for chlorthalidone 12.5 mg/day versus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day (-15.7 ± 2.2 mm Hg versus -4.5 ± 2.1 mm Hg; P = 0.001); however, by week 8, reductions were statistically similar.

### Effectiveness of chlorthalidone plus amiloride for the prevention of hypertension: The PREVER-Prevention randomized clinical trial [^112m8Dq3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

All study investigators and research staff members were trained and certified in the methods used to implement our trial protocol during regional and individual center meetings. Study data were collected locally using a web-based system, with central monitoring of the variables collected, periodic reports for review by the participating centers, and a direct check of 15% to 20% of the records in every center. Study performance was monitored electronically, and inconsistencies in the database were reviewed and resolved promptly. Monitoring visits onsite were conducted at each center a minimum of three times by a study coordinator and twice by the two principal investigators (S.C.F. and F.D.F.). Laboratory quality control was supervised by the central laboratory according to standard procedures.

A sample size of 568 participants per group was originally planned with the expectation that this number would provide 85% power to detect a 40% reduction in the incidence of hypertension for participants in the chlorthalidone/amiloride group, assuming a cumulative incidence rate of 14% in the placebo group, with 2-sided α = 0.05. The sample size was rounded to 625 per group to compensate for losses during follow-up.

### Prediction of cardiovascular outcome by estimated glomerular filtration rate and estimated creatinine clearance in the high-risk hypertension population of the VALUE trial [^115Nn47C]. Journal of Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Reduced renal function is predictive of poor cardiovascular outcomes, but the predictive value of different measures of renal function is uncertain.

- **Methods**: We compared the value of estimated creatinine clearance, using the Cockcroft-Gault formula, with that of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula, as predictors of cardiovascular outcomes. This study involved 15,245 high-risk hypertensive participants in the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) trial. For the primary endpoint, three secondary endpoints, and all-cause death, outcomes were compared for individuals with baseline estimated creatinine clearance and estimated GFR of ≥ 60 ml/min using hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. The model included covariates such as coronary heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, age, sex, and treatment effects.

- **Results**: For each endpoint considered, the risk in individuals with poor renal function at baseline was greater than those with better renal function. Estimated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault) was significantly predictive only of all-cause death (hazard ratio = 1.223, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.076–1.390; P = 0.0021), whereas estimated GFR was predictive of all outcomes except stroke. Hazard ratios (95% CIs) for estimated GFR were: primary cardiac endpoint, 1.497 (1.332–1.682), P < 0.0001; myocardial infarction, 1.501 (1.254–1.796), P < 0.0001; congestive heart failure, 1.699 (1.435–2.013), P < 0.0001; stroke, 1.152 (0.952–1.394), P = 0.

### Hydrochlorothiazide [^115qB3xy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Hydrochlorothiazide affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. At maximal therapeutic dosage, all thiazides are approximately equal in their diuretic efficacy. Hydrochlorothiazide does not usually affect normal blood pressure. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown.

Hydrochlorothiazide increases the excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium and bicarbonate. After oral use, diuresis begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours, and lasts about 6 to 12 hours.

- **Pharmacokinetics and metabolism**: Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidney. When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours, the plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 5.6 and 14.8 hours. At least 61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier and is excreted in breast milk.

### Association between chlorthalidone treatment of systolic hypertension and long-term survival [^115sWPau]. JAMA (2011). High credibility.

In the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) trial, conducted between 1985 and 1990, antihypertensive therapy with chlorthalidone-based stepped-care therapy resulted in a lower rate of cardiovascular events compared to placebo; however, effects on mortality were not significant.

- **Objective**: To study the gain in life expectancy of participants randomized to active therapy at the 22-year follow-up.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A National Death Index ascertainment of death in the long-term follow-up of a randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial (SHEP) of patients aged 60 years or older with isolated systolic hypertension. Recruitment was between March 1, 1985, and January 15, 1988. After the end of a 4.5-year randomized phase of the SHEP trial, all participants were advised to receive active therapy. The time interval between the beginning of recruitment and the ascertainment of death by National Death Index (December 31, 2006) was approximately 22 years (21 years 10 months).

- **Main outcome measures**: Cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality.

- **Results**: At the 22-year follow-up, life expectancy gain, expressed as the area between active (n = 2365) and placebo (n = 2371) survival curves, was 105 days (95% CI, -39 to 242; p = 0.07) for all-cause mortality and 158 days (95% CI, 36–287; p = 0.009) for cardiovascular death. Each month of active treatment was therefore associated with approximately 1 day extension in life expectancy. The active treatment group had higher survival free from cardiovascular death versus the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95%).

Regarding the use of atenolol/chlorthalidone PO (also known as Tenoretic) in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) between 15–35 mL/min: reduce the dose. The maximal dose is 50 mg/25 mg, and it should not exceed a frequency of once daily.

### Aldosterone-targeted therapies: Early implementation in resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease [^112DGCT3]. European Heart Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Chlorthalidone, a thiazide-like diuretic, is often used to lower blood pressure (BP) and may help mitigate the risk of hyperkalaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the CLICK trial, which included 160 patients with uncontrolled hypertension and Stage 4 CKD, the addition of chlorthalidone at 12.5 mg/day versus placebo lowered 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP by 10–14 mmHg and decreased albuminuria levels over 12 weeks. However, chlorthalidone also significantly increased plasma renin and aldosterone levels, and co-administration of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) has been suggested. Switching from hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide, to chlorthalidone resulted in additional BP reduction in several studies. However, in a trial of 13,523 hypertensive patients on hydrochlorothiazide, the rates of primary cardiovascular (CV) outcomes and acute kidney injury-related hospitalizations were similar between those who continued hydrochlorothiazide and those switched to chlorothiazide.

Furthermore, in patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², an adequately up-titrated loop diuretic is an option for managing treatment-resistant hypertension (TRH). Torsemide, a long-acting loop diuretic, inhibited aldosterone secretion by adrenal cells in a preclinical study and may be preferable to shorter-acting agents such as bumetanide or furosemide.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^116VhNKh]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

With respect to patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the JNC 8 2014 guidelines recommend initiating an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) as the initial or add-on antihypertensive treatment. This approach is suggested to improve kidney outcomes in adult patients with CKD regardless of race or diabetes status.

### Patterns and correlates of baseline thiazide-type diuretic prescription in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial [^115qv9rd]. Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Thiazides and thiazide-type diuretics are recommended as first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension, but contemporary information on their use in clinical practice is lacking. We examined patterns and correlates of thiazide prescription in a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from participants enrolled in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). We examined baseline prescription of thiazides in 7,582 participants receiving at least one antihypertensive medication by subgroup, and used log-binomial regression to calculate adjusted prevalence ratios for thiazide prescription (versus no thiazide).

Forty-three percent of all participants were prescribed a thiazide at baseline, but among participants prescribed a single agent, the proportion was only 16%. The prevalence of thiazide prescription differed significantly by demographic factors, with younger participants, women, and blacks all having higher adjusted prevalence of thiazide prescription than other corresponding subgroups. Participants in the lowest category of kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m^2) were half as likely to be prescribed a thiazide as participants with preserved kidney function. In conclusion, among persons with hypertension and heightened cardiovascular risk, we found that thiazide prescription varied significantly by demographics and kidney disease status, despite limited evidence about relative differences in effectiveness.

### Blood pressure and kidney outcomes in patients with severely decreased glomerular filtration rate: A nationwide observational cohort study [^1119v9En]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

Association between baseline achieved SBP (a) and DBP (b) blood pressure on estimated glomerular filtration rate slope is explored.

- **Baseline achieved SBP**: The association between baseline achieved SBP in mmHg on eGFR slope is measured in ml/min per 1.73 m². It is adjusted for baseline eGFR, albumin, calcium, phosphate, hemoglobin, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, and angiotensin receptor blockers/angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Blood pressure is expressed in mmHg, and the eGFR slope is expressed in ml/min per 1.73 m².

- **Baseline achieved DBP**: The association between baseline achieved DBP in mmHg on eGFR slope is similarly measured.

We observed a more rapid eGFR decline with increasing albuminuria. Lower achieved SBP and DBP were associated with slower eGFR decline in patients with albuminuria grade A3: −1.29 (−1.49 to −1.10) ml/min per 1.73 m² per year for SBP 100–120 mmHg, −2.01 (−2.18 to −1.83) ml/min per 1.73 m² per year for SBP 130–140 mmHg, and −2.22 (−2.41 to −2.04) ml/min per 1.73 m² per year for at least 160 mmHg (P trend < 0.001). A DBP less than 70 mmHg was associated with slower eGFR decline in patients with albuminuria grade A2 compared with all higher DBP. There was a tendency toward slower eGFR decline in those with lower SBP and albuminuria A1 that did not reach statistical significance. Merging the patients in the A1 and A2 categories did not substantially change the relationship between SBP and eGFR decline. However, the association between lower DBP and slower eGFR decline was now statistically significant.

### Blood pressure-lowering efficacy of monotherapy with thiazide diuretics for primary hypertension [^1179wYUi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Although it is established that low-dose thiazides reduce mortality as well as cardiovascular morbidity, the dose-related effect of thiazides in decreasing blood pressure has not been subject to a rigorous systematic review. It is not known whether individual drugs within the thiazide diuretic class differ in their blood pressure-lowering effects and adverse effects.

- **Objectives**: To determine the dose-related decrease in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure due to thiazide diuretics compared with placebo control in the treatment of patients with primary hypertension. Secondary outcomes included the dose-related adverse events leading to patient withdrawal and adverse biochemical effects on serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose, and lipids.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to February 2014), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to February 2014), and ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Selection criteria**: We included double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fixed-dose thiazide diuretic monotherapy with placebo for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in the treatment of adult patients with primary hypertension.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently screened articles, assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, and determined risk of bias. We combined data for continuous variables using a mean difference (MD), and for dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the relative risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).

### Hydrochlorothiazide is America's most popular thiazide, but should it be [^114T3Cvz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

These key pharmacologic differences have contributed to the long-standing debate among clinicians and hypertension experts about whether chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide is superior. Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have previously demonstrated that the thiazide-like diuretics better prevent cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality compared with the thiazide-type diuretics. These systematic reviews and meta-analyses, however, included many RCTs conducted before 1990 and few RCTs of indapamide. Consequently, the generalizability of the findings to the current era may be limited as the prevalence and nature of cardiovascular disease risk factors have evolved, and as we have refined our knowledge about which classes should be used first line for hypertension treatment.

Observational studies have provided contrasting conclusions on this debate, with one finding no difference between chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide, whereas another one showed better outcomes with hydrochlorothiazide, not chlorthalidone. However, the follow-up period in these observational studies was probably too brief to detect differences in clinical end points, and the conflicting findings are likely due to residual confounding. For these reasons, the available meta-analyses and observational studies offer little practical guidance in thiazide selection. Instead, what may be more helpful for clinicians is to recall the findings from more recent, large RCTs that have critically appraised these agents.

### Blood pressure and kidney outcomes in patients with severely decreased glomerular filtration rate: a nationwide observational cohort study [^116vTPmc]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

The mean annual loss of eGFR was −1.49 ml/min per 1.73 m² per year (95% confidence interval −1.55 to −1.44 ml/min per 1.73 m² per year). The unadjusted eGFR decline per year increased gradually from −0.93 ml/min per 1.73 m² per year (−1.13 to −0.74 ml/min per 1.73 m²) in those with an achieved SBP less than 120 mmHg at baseline to −2.14 ml/min per 1.73 m² (−2.39 to −1.89 ml/min per 1.73 m²) in those with achieved BP greater than 160 mmHg. Similarly, eGFR decline increased with higher achieved DBP. The differences in eGFR remained after adjustment for confounders in all categories.

- **Blood pressure and decline in renal function**: Adjusted for baseline eGFR, albumin, calcium, phosphate, hemoglobin, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, and angiotensin receptor blockers/angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Blood pressure expressed in mmHg, eGFR slope expressed in ml/min per 1.73 m².

### Effect of the combination of bumetanide plus chlorthalidone on hypertension and volume overload in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 4–5 KDIGO without renal replacement therapy: a double-blind randomized HEBE-CKD trial [^117Xvy8e]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

One of the main adverse effects reported in the literature associated with thiazide use is hydroelectrolytic imbalance, hyperuricemia, or an increased diabetes risk. Our results did not show any significant differences in uric acid risk (there was no gout attack in any group), blood glucose, potassium, or sodium levels at the end of follow-up. There was one case of acute myocardial infarction in the intervention group, which required endoprosthesis insertion via catheterization. Cardiovascular function improved significantly following intervention; however, kidney function remained unchanged, with final GFR readings similar to baseline.

This study has some other limitations. First, the follow-up in our study was short; therefore, further prospective trials are needed to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of this regimen. Second, there was patient noncompliance with dietary recommendations, even though all patients were evaluated and counseled in terms of renal nutrition, with an emphasis on sodium dietary restriction, as it is known that sodium excretion is directly proportional to kidney function and sodium dietary intake. Third, this trial was done at a single center, which could limit generalizability. Fourth, this study does not include hard clinical outcomes, which may be interesting to investigate in future studies. Finally, most of our patients did not have a baseline echocardiogram at the time of enrollment. Having an estimate of ventricular function beforehand may have allowed us to identify the presence of cardiac failure or changes in left ventricular ejection fraction.

### Chlorthalidone for poorly controlled hypertension in chronic kidney disease: an interventional pilot study [^116AZZc7]. American Journal of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

To test the hypothesis that thiazide-type diuretics effectively lower blood pressure (BP) in moderate to advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD; estimated GFR 20–45 ml/min/1.73 m²), chlorthalidone was added to existing medications in a dose of 25 mg/day, after confirming poorly controlled hypertension with 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. The dose was doubled every 4 weeks if the BP remained elevated. The average age of the 14 subjects was 67.5 years. A median of 4 antihypertensive drugs were used, and the estimated GFR was 26.8 ± 8.8 ml/min/1.73 m². Twelve subjects completed the 12-week treatment phase, and the 24-hour BP, which was 143.1/75.1 mm Hg at baseline, was reduced by 10.5/3.1 mm Hg (p = 0.01/p = 0.17).

Home BP prior to initiating chlorthalidone was 152.4/82.6 mm Hg and fell at 4, 8, and 12 weeks by 10.2/4.8, 13.4/6.0, and 9.4/3.7 mm Hg (all p < 0.05). Maximal reduction in body weight and total body volume (measured by air displacement plethysmography) was seen at 8 weeks, coinciding with the maximal elevation in serum creatinine concentration and plasma renin activity. Albuminuria was significantly reduced by 40–45%.

Adverse events were seen following chlorthalidone therapy in 7 subjects who experienced 18 events, including hypokalemia (n = 4), hyperuricemia (4), hyponatremia (3), transient creatinine changes (3), dizziness (2), hyperglycemia (1), and constipation (1). One subject had an ischemic stroke during the study.

In conclusion, among people with moderate to advanced CKD with poorly controlled hypertension, chlorthalidone may significantly reduce BP via volume reduction and other mechanisms.

### Antihypertensive efficacy of hydrochlorothiazide vs chlorthalidone combined with azilsartan medoxomil [^116yN2Ue]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Chlorthalidone has proven efficacy to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, yet it is infrequently used in practice. This study provides a direct comparison of chlorthalidone with hydrochlorothiazide, each combined with the angiotensin receptor blocker azilsartan medoxomil, on blood pressure reduction and control rates.

- **Methods**: This is a randomized, double-blind, titrate-to-target blood pressure trial comparing the single-pill combination of azilsartan medoxomil and chlorthalidone versus co-administration of azilsartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide in participants with stage 2 primary hypertension. After 2 weeks of treatment with azilsartan medoxomil 40 mg alone, all participants also received 12.5 mg of diuretic for 4 weeks (up to week 6) and were titrated to 25 mg for another 4 weeks (up to week 10) if they failed to achieve target blood pressure. The primary endpoint was change in clinic systolic blood pressure. Target blood pressure was defined as clinic blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg for participants without diabetes or chronic kidney disease or < 130/80 mm Hg for participants with diabetes or chronic kidney disease.

- **Results**: The mean age of the 609 participants was 56.4 years, and the mean baseline clinic blood pressure was 164.6/95.4 mm Hg. The primary endpoint analysis at week 6 demonstrated a greater reduction of clinic systolic blood pressure for the chlorthalidone (-35.1 mm Hg) versus hydrochlorothiazide combination (-29.5 mm Hg) (mean difference, -5.6 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -8.3 to -2.9; P < 0.001).

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^113Qw3rs]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The importance of this study is underscored by the current recommendation of chlorthalidone as the preferred thiazide diuretic for treating hypertension, despite the absence of direct trials comparing its risks and benefits with hydrochlorothiazide.

The objective was to compare the effectiveness and safety of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide as first-line therapies for hypertension in a real-world setting.

The design, setting, and participants involved a Large-Scale Evidence Generation and Evaluation in a Network of Databases (LEGEND) observational comparative cohort study. It utilized large-scale propensity score stratification, negative-control, and synthetic positive-control calibration on databases spanning from January 2001 through December 2018. The study analyzed outpatient and inpatient care episodes of first-time antihypertensive monotherapy users in the United States, based on two administrative claims databases and one collection of electronic health records. Analysis commenced in June 2018.

The exposures compared were chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcomes included acute myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and a composite cardiovascular disease outcome that included the first three outcomes and sudden cardiac death. Fifty-one safety outcomes were measured.

The results indicated that out of 730,225 individuals (mean [SD] age, 51.5 [13.3] years; 450,100 women [61.6%]), 36,918 were dispensed or prescribed chlorthalidone and experienced 149 composite outcome events. Meanwhile, 693,337 were dispensed or prescribed hydrochlorothiazide, with 3,089 composite outcome events. No significant difference was found in the associated risk of myocardial infarction, although further details are truncated.

### Design and baseline characteristics of the chlorthalidone in chronic kidney disease (CLICK) trial [^114Twp3o]. American Journal of Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Hypertension often accompanies chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diuretics are widely prescribed to reduce blood pressure (BP). Chlorthalidone (CTD) is a thiazide-like diuretic and an effective antihypertensive drug, yet little data exist to support its use in treating hypertension in individuals with advanced CKD.

- **Methods**: Chlorthalidone in Chronic Kidney Disease (CLICK) is a phase II, single-institution, multicenter, double-blind randomized control trial to test the hypothesis that CTD improves BP through reduction of extracellular fluid volume and results in target organ protection in patients with stage 4 CKD and poorly controlled hypertension. After a single-blind placebo run-in for 2 weeks and confirmation of hypertension by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), patients are randomized to either placebo or CTD 12.5 mg once daily (QD) followed by dose escalation. Randomization is stratified by prior loop diuretic use, and the double-blind phase lasts 12 weeks. With a total of 160 patients, the study will have ≥ 80% power to detect a 6 mm Hg difference in systolic 24-hour ABP between the two treatment groups.

- **Results**: Between June 2016 and October 2019, 131 patients have been randomized. The baseline characteristics are as follows: average age 65.8 years, 79% men, 36% Black, 79% with diabetes, mean eGFR 23.2 mL/min/1.73 m², median urine albumin/creatinine ratio 923 mg/g, average number of BP medications 3.4, 60% on loop diuretics, and 24-hour ABP averaged 141.7/73.8 mm Hg.

- **Conclusion**: Among patients with stage 4 CKD and uncontrolled hypertension, CLICK should an

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^114kSK7x]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Our findings based on currently available data and the most recent advances in observational research do not support the use of chlorthalidone over hydrochlorothiazide. This study found that chlorthalidone use was not associated with significant cardiovascular benefits when compared with hydrochlorothiazide, while its use was associated with a greater risk of renal and electrolyte abnormalities. We acknowledge the possibility of residual confounding despite our analytic approach and diagnostics and look forward to the results of the ongoing randomized clinical trial.

### A randomized, multicenter, open-label, blinded end point trial comparing the effects of spironolactone to chlorthalidone on left ventricular mass in patients with early-stage chronic kidney disease: Rationale and design of the SPIRO-CKD trial [^115A2RoD]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The trial is categorized by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency as type A, indicating no higher risk than standard medical care. Patients are closely monitored throughout the study, and a continuous risk evaluation is maintained during the recruitment period. Both spironolactone and chlorthalidone are considered investigational medicinal products (IMPs) within the SPIRO-CKD trial. Any adverse events or serious adverse events occurring during the trial are reported to the SPIRO-CKD Trials Office up to six weeks following the last administration of the IMP. Any suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions related to the IMP will be reported, regardless of their timing post-IMP administration. Responses to abnormalities in serum sodium, potassium, and eGFR are guided by predetermined management plans, as detailed in Appendix 2.

- **Blood pressure monitoring**: To confirm or refute the trial hypothesis, it is essential that the change in blood pressure during the treatment period is not significantly different across trial arms. Although a tight blood pressure target was impractical, a blood pressure monitoring committee (BPMC) reviews data after each block of 20 patients for the first 100 patients, and then after each block of 30 patients until the end of trial recruitment. The frequency of review may be adjusted based on the BPMC's independent data review. Patients enter the trial with controlled blood pressure.
