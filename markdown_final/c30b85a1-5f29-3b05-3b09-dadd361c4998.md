## Question

A 58-year-old man underwent liver transplantation 7 years ago for hepatitis C-related cirrhosis. He has been stable on tacrolimus monotherapy for the past 5 years, with consistently normal liver function tests. He has no history of acute or chronic rejection. A recent protocol liver biopsy shows minimal portal inflammation and stage 2 fibrosis. He has no significant comorbidities and is keen to reduce his medication burden. He asks you whether it is possible to reduce or stop his immunosuppression.

Based on current guideline recommendations, what is the most appropriate approach to immunosuppression management in this patient? Justify your answer with reference to the relevant criteria.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 58-year-old man who is 7 years post–liver transplant for hepatitis C, on tacrolimus monotherapy with normal LFTs, no prior rejection, and a recent protocol biopsy showing minimal portal inflammation and stage 2 fibrosis, can safely reduce or stop his immunosuppression. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's risk profile for rejection and disease recurrence. Then, I should verify what current guidelines say about immunosuppression minimization versus complete withdrawal. Next, I will review the evidence base for tacrolimus monotherapy and dose targets in long-term recipients. After that, I need to check the role and implications of the protocol biopsy findings. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with monitoring and safety caveats, including what to do if rejection emerges during any taper.

> Let me first confirm the risk profile. He is more than 5 years post-transplant, has no history of acute or chronic rejection, normal liver tests, and is on tacrolimus monotherapy, which places him in a low immunologic risk category for rejection, although his original disease was hepatitis C, which carries a risk of recurrence and fibrosis progression if immunosuppression is mismanaged [^a21bdcf4] [^a5fc5b2c].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance on minimization versus withdrawal. The AASLD/AST guideline supports minimizing immunosuppression to calcineurin inhibitor monotherapy in stable, long-term recipients without prior rejection and with favorable histology, but it does not endorse routine complete withdrawal of immunosuppression outside of trials or exceptional circumstances, and EASL explicitly advises against aiming for complete withdrawal as standard of care [^a21bdcf4] [^ca89c8e7] [^c9888ce1].

> I should confirm the evidence for tacrolimus monotherapy itself. Multiple studies and guidelines indicate that tacrolimus monotherapy is feasible and safe in appropriately selected long-term liver recipients, with similar rejection and graft survival compared with combination regimens, and contemporary guidance supports maintaining tacrolimus with lower long-term trough targets in stable patients [^a5fc5b2c] [^1a11dfd9] [^c210d788].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stopping therapy. Complete immunosuppression withdrawal has been explored in highly selected cohorts and can succeed in a minority, but rates of operational tolerance vary and rejection during weaning is common; importantly, most trials excluded viral hepatitis or autoimmune disease, and current guidance restricts withdrawal to carefully selected patients under close supervision, ideally within research protocols [^117fad0c] [^c9888ce1] [^7d2f5276].

> Next, I should review the protocol biopsy. Minimal portal inflammation with stage 2 fibrosis is reassuring but not entirely benign; stage 2 fibrosis on a 4-stage scale is mild to moderate and warrants caution with further immunosuppression reduction, and guidelines emphasize that histology is the gold standard to distinguish rejection from recurrent disease and to guide immunosuppression adjustments in long-term recipients [^272b4fdd] [^2974e798].

> Let me think about the practical, guideline-concordant approach. The most appropriate next step is cautious dose minimization of tacrolimus to the lowest effective trough that maintains normal liver tests, rather than complete withdrawal. AASLD/AST suggests tacrolimus troughs around or below 6 ng/mL in stable long-term recipients, and EASL recommends 4–8 ng/mL after the first month, which aligns with a strategy of gradual reduction with close monitoring [^c210d788] [^97011c2b] [^9fbdc01b].

> I should double-check the monitoring plan. Any downward adjustment should be accompanied by more frequent liver test monitoring initially, consideration of noninvasive fibrosis assessment such as transient elastography to track changes, and a low threshold to obtain liver biopsy if enzymes rise or if fibrosis appears to progress, because routine reliance on liver tests alone risks missing subclinical rejection or disease recurrence [^45e79e67] [^272b4fdd].

> But wait, what if the patient insists on stopping immunosuppression entirely. I need to ensure shared decision-making and document that complete withdrawal is not standard of care, that success is unpredictable, and that rejection risk is real; if pursued, it should occur in a structured, slow taper with protocolized surveillance and immediate access to biopsy and rescue therapy, recognizing that even in trials, many patients fail withdrawal and require resumption of immunosuppression [^c9888ce1] [^117fad0c] [^7d2f5276].

> Let me reconsider the HCV-specific angle. Although his original disease was HCV, contemporary management with direct-acting antivirals has transformed recurrence risk; if he is not already cured, treating HCV would further reduce fibrosis progression risk and could modestly expand the safety margin for immunosuppression minimization, though it does not by itself justify complete withdrawal [^e672d2ff] [^d73889f1].

> Final synthesis: I should confirm that the most appropriate, evidence-based approach is to minimize tacrolimus to a low but therapeutic trough, typically targeting around 4–6 ng/mL in this stable, rejection-free patient, with enhanced monitoring and readiness to reassess histologically if liver tests change. Complete cessation of immunosuppression is not recommended outside a trial or exceptional, closely supervised scenario given the limited predictors of tolerance and the risk of rejection and fibrosis progression [^c210d788] [^a21bdcf4] [^ca89c8e7] [^c9888ce1].

---

In a 58-year-old man, 7 years post–liver transplant for HCV, with normal LFTs, no rejection history, and stage 2 fibrosis on biopsy, **tacrolimus minimization is appropriate** [^a21bdcf4] but **complete withdrawal is not recommended** [^ca89c8e7]. The safest approach is to reduce tacrolimus to the lowest effective trough (about 3–5 ng/mL) [^c210d788] with close monitoring, as this balances rejection risk and medication burden. Complete immunosuppression withdrawal is **not advised** outside trials due to rejection risk and limited evidence [^c9888ce1] [^117fad0c]. If pursued, it should only be in a trial with protocolized biopsy surveillance [^c3dfd121].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Current guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the American Society of Transplantation (AST) [^a21bdcf4], as well as the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) [^ca89c8e7], provide clear guidance on immunosuppression management in stable liver transplant recipients:

- **Minimization of immunosuppression**: Guidelines recommend minimizing immunosuppression to a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) monotherapy (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) in stable patients without history of rejection, normal liver function tests, and minimal or no portal inflammation on biopsy [^a21bdcf4].

- **Complete withdrawal of immunosuppression**: Complete withdrawal of immunosuppression is not routinely recommended [^ca89c8e7] due to the risk of rejection and limited evidence supporting its safety and efficacy. It should only be considered in highly selected patients within clinical trials or under close supervision [^c9888ce1].

- **Monitoring and surveillance**: Regular monitoring of liver function tests, tacrolimus trough levels, and periodic liver biopsies are recommended to detect early signs of rejection or disease recurrence [^9e2bb8c2] [^45e79e67].

---

## Evidence supporting immunosuppression minimization

Several studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of **tacrolimus monotherapy** in stable liver transplant recipients:

- **Tacrolimus monotherapy**: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrated that tacrolimus monotherapy achieved excellent long-term results, with low rates of rejection and minimal side effects [^26b1c2ce].

- **Minimal immunosuppression**: Another prospective study showed that minimal immunosuppression with tacrolimus monotherapy was safe and effective, with no significant increase in rejection rates or graft loss [^2e483ff4].

- **Steroid-free regimens**: Steroid-free immunosuppression with tacrolimus monotherapy has been shown to be effective in preventing rejection and maintaining graft function [^d13379d5].

---

## Risks and benefits of immunosuppression withdrawal

While complete withdrawal of immunosuppression may seem appealing to reduce medication burden and long-term complications, it carries significant risks:

| **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|
| Reduced medication burden | Increased risk of acute and chronic rejection [^7a91503a] |
| Lower risk of CNI-related complications (e.g. nephrotoxicity, hypertension, diabetes) | Potential graft loss and need for retransplantation [^c9888ce1] |
| Improved quality of life | Limited evidence supporting safety and efficacy [^117fad0c] |

---

## Evidence supporting complete immunosuppression withdrawal

Limited evidence supports complete immunosuppression withdrawal in highly selected patients. Studies have shown that approximately 20% of carefully selected patients can achieve operational tolerance, defined as stable graft function without immunosuppression [^387d2590] [^7d2f5276]. However, these studies excluded patients with viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease, or significant fibrosis, limiting their applicability to the current patient [^117fad0c].

---

## Role of liver biopsy in decision-making

Liver biopsy remains the **gold standard** for assessing graft health and guiding immunosuppression management [^2974e798]. In this patient, the recent protocol biopsy showing minimal portal inflammation and stage 2 fibrosis is reassuring but does not provide definitive evidence of operational tolerance. Biopsy helps distinguish rejection from disease recurrence and guides appropriate adjustments in immunosuppression [^3b3a385e].

---

## Practical clinical approach

Given the patient's stable clinical course, normal liver function tests, and minimal fibrosis on biopsy, the most appropriate approach is to **minimize tacrolimus dosage** to the lowest effective trough level (approximately 3–5 ng/mL) [^c210d788] while maintaining close monitoring of liver function tests and tacrolimus trough levels. Complete withdrawal of immunosuppression is not recommended outside of a clinical trial setting due to the risk of rejection and limited evidence supporting its safety and efficacy [^c9888ce1].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up with **frequent monitoring** of liver function tests, tacrolimus trough levels, and periodic liver biopsies is essential to detect early signs of rejection or disease recurrence. The patient should be educated about the signs and symptoms of rejection and instructed to seek immediate medical attention if any abnormalities occur [^9e2bb8c2].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

In summary, **tacrolimus minimization is appropriate** [^a21bdcf4] for this patient, but complete withdrawal is not recommended outside a clinical trial. The safest approach is to reduce tacrolimus to the lowest effective trough level with close monitoring, balancing the benefits of reduced medication burden against the risks of rejection and graft loss [^c210d788].

### Impact of immunosuppressive therapy on recurrence of hepatitis C [^bbd6d911]. Liver Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

1. Approximately 10% to 25% of hepatitis C virus-infected recipients of liver allografts will develop cirrhosis within 5 years of transplantation; this acceleration of the natural history of hepatitis C is caused in part by immunosuppression. 2. Risk factors for aggressive recurrence, graft loss, and death are treated acute cellular rejection, methylprednisolone pulse therapy, and use of OKT3. There appears to be no consistent difference between cyclosporine and tacrolimus in their effects on hepatitis C. 3. The benefit of steroid withdrawal, although commonly practiced in transplant recipients with hepatitis C, has not been proven. 4. Mycophenolate mofetil may show synergistic antiviral properties when used with interferon; however, posttransplantation use has not been associated with consistent beneficial or deleterious effects. 5. Effects of other agents, such as sirolimus or interleukin-2-receptor antibodies, have not been adequately defined. Early reports suggest that disease activity may be more aggressive when these agents are constituents of the immunosuppressive regimen.

### AASLD AST practice guideline on adult liver transplantation: diagnosis and management of graft-related complications [^a5fc5b2c]. Liver Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Adult liver transplantation — maintenance immunosuppression with tacrolimus: In the absence of contraindications, tacrolimus monotherapy should be considered as maintenance immunosuppression in patients at low risk for rejection (e.g., non-immune mediated liver disease), as it has similar graft survival when compared to combination therapy (Strong, Level 3). Combination therapy with tacrolimus and an antimetabolite or a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor should be considered for adult liver transplant recipients who require reduced exposure to tacrolimus due to adverse effects (e.g., renal dysfunction) (Strong, Level 3). Once daily extended-release formulations of tacrolimus should be used similarly as twice daily immediate-release tacrolimus, as they are equally effective for the prevention of rejection and maintenance of allograft survival (Strong, Level 3). TAC monotherapy is feasible after three months post-LT in patients at low risk for rejection, and TAC is associated with long-term complications, including renal dysfunction, increased risk of malignancy and diabetes.

### Is minimal, [almost] steroid-free immunosuppression a safe approach in adult liver transplantation? Long-term outcome of a prospective, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, investigator-driven study [^26b1c2ce]. Annals of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the safety of minimal immunosuppression (IS) in liver transplantation (LT).

Background

The lack of long-term follow-up studies, including pathologic data, has led to a protean handling of IS in LT.

Methods

Between February 2000 and September 2004, 156 adults were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled minimization trial comparing tacrolimus placebo (TAC-PLAC) and TAC short-term steroid (TAC-STER) IS. All patients had a minimum clinical, biochemical, and histological follow-up of 5 years.

Results

Five-year actual patient and graft survival rates in TAC-PLAC and TAC-STER groups were 78.1% and 82.1% (P = 0.89) and 74.2% and 76.9% (P = 0.90), respectively. Five-year biopsies were available in 112 (89.6%) of 125 survivors. Twelve patients refused a biopsy because of their excellent evolution; tissue material was insufficient in 1 patient; 11 had normal liver tests; and 2 patients had developed alcoholic and secondary biliary cirrhosis. Histology was normal in 44 (39.3%) patients; 35 (31.3%) had disease recurrence. The remaining biopsies showed nonspecific chronic hepatitis (14.3%), mild inflammatory infiltrates (10.7%), and steatosis (3.5%). All findings were equally distributed between both groups. In each group, 3 patients (4.8%) presented with acute cellular rejection after the first year and only 1 (0.9%) TAC-PLAC patient developed chronic rejection after IS withdrawal because of pneumonitis. Arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, hypercholesterolemia, gout, and obesity were equally low in both groups.

Conclusions

Excellent long-term results can be obtained under minimal IS and absence of steroids. TAC-based monotherapy is feasible in most adult liver recipients until 5 years of follow-up.

### Immunosuppression minimization vs. complete drug withdrawal in liver transplantation [^387d2590]. Journal of Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite the increase in long-term survival, liver transplant recipients still exhibit higher morbidity and mortality than the general population. This is in part attributed to the lifelong administration of immunosuppression and its associated side effects. Several studies reported in the last decades have evaluated the impact of immunosuppression minimization in liver transplant recipients, but results have been inconsistent due to the heterogeneity of study designs and insufficient sample sizes. On the other hand, complete immunosuppression withdrawal has proven to be feasible in approximately 20% of carefully selected liver transplant recipients, especially in older patients and those with longer duration after transplantation. The long-term risks and clinical benefits of this strategy, however, also need to be clarified. As a consequence, and despite the general perception that a large proportion of liver recipients are over-immunosuppressed, it is currently not possible to derive evidence-based guidelines on how to manage long-term immunosuppression to improve clinical outcomes. Large clinical trials of drug minimization and/or withdrawal focused on clinically-relevant long-term outcomes are required. Development of personalized medicine tools and a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of idiopathic inflammatory graft lesions will be pre-requisites to achieve these goals.

### Natural history of recurrent hepatitis C [^c476a1bc]. Liver Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

1. After liver transplantation for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis, recurrence of infection is universal, with development of histological hepatitis in the majority of patients. 2. The natural history of recurrent hepatitis C is highly variable. Although 30% to 50% of patients develop posttransplantation viremia with minimal liver injury, 10% to 30% progress to cirrhosis after a median of 5 years. 3. Progression of hepatitis C is accelerated in immunocompromised liver transplant recipients compared with immunocompetent patients, both before and after the development of compensated cirrhosis. 4. HCV-related disease progression is faster in patients who underwent transplantation in recent years compared with those who underwent transplantation earlier. 5. HCV infection significantly impairs patient and allo-graft survival after liver transplantation. 6. Several variables, including donor age, degree of immunosuppression, viral load either pretransplantation or early posttransplantation, timing of recurrence, and early histological findings, are implicated in the outcome of hepatitis C posttransplantation.

### Outcomes of immunosuppression minimization and withdrawal early after liver transplantation [^fa625d00]. American Journal of Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

The Immune Tolerance Network ITN030ST A-WISH assessed immunosuppression withdrawal in liver transplant recipients with hepatitis C or nonimmune nonviral liver disease. Of 275 recipients enrolled before transplantation, 95 were randomly assigned 4:1 to withdrawal (n = 77) or maintenance (n = 18) 1- to 2-years posttransplant. Randomization eligibility criteria included stable immunosuppression monotherapy; adequate liver and kidney function; ≤ Stage 2 Ishak fibrosis; and absence of rejection on biopsy. Immunosuppression withdrawal followed an 8-step reduction algorithm with ≥ 8 weeks per level. Fifty-two of 77 subjects (67.5%) reduced to ≤ 50% of baseline dose, and 10 of 77 (13.0%) discontinued all immunosuppression for ≥ 1 year. Acute rejection and/or abnormal liver tests were treated with increased immunosuppression; 5 of 32 rejection episodes required a methylprednisolone bolus. The composite end point (death or graft loss; grade 4 secondary malignancy or opportunistic infection; Ishak stage ≥ 3; or > 25% decrease in glomerular filtration rate within 24 months of randomization) occurred in 12 of 66 (18%) and 4 of 13 (31%) subjects in the withdrawal and maintenance groups. Early immunosuppression minimization is feasible in selected liver recipients, while complete withdrawal is successful in only a small proportion. The composite end point comparison was inconclusive for noninferiority of the withdrawal to the maintenance group.

### Long-term management of the successful adult liver transplant: 2012 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^01678abf]. Liver Transplantation (2013). Medium credibility.

AASLD/AST 2012 practice guideline — post–liver transplant hepatitis C virus (HCV) outcomes — The risk of decompensation after onset of cirrhosis is 15% to 30% within the first year, and mortality is 40% to 55% within 6 to 12 months of the decompensating event; patient survival and graft survival are reduced in HCV-infected recipients with a 5-year patient survival rate of approximately 70%. HCV-infected recipients have higher rates of graft loss when the allograft is from an older donor, and there is a higher risk of cirrhosis when HCV-infected liver transplant (LT) recipients develop acute rejection requiring treatment or comorbid CMV hepatitis. The impact of immunosuppressives on HCV progression is poorly understood, with some data suggesting anti-lymphocyte agents promote HCV-associated liver injury, and post-LT diabetes, insulin resistance, and steatosis have been associated with a higher risk of rapid progression to advanced fibrosis.

### Recurrence of hepatitis C after liver transplantation [^1b2398b6]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Recurrence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection following liver transplantation is a major source of morbidity and mortality. The natural history of hepatitis C in the transplant setting is shortened. Overall, one third of HCV-infected recipients have developed allograft cirrhosis due to HCV recurrence by the 5 th -7 th year post-transplantation. The most significant variables which determine disease progression are the use of organs from old donors, the use of an inadequate immunosuppression (too low, inducing treatment rejection episodes, too potent or too rapidly changing), and the presence of comorbid conditions that also impact the quality of the graft (biliary complications, metabolic syndrome). The only factor consistently shown to modify the natural history of recurrent disease is antiviral therapy. A sustained viral response, achieved by one third of those treated with dual therapy, is associated with improved histology, reduced liver-related complications and increased survival. Variables associated with enhanced viral response with dual therapy include an adequate genetic background (IL28B C/C of both donor and recipient), good treatment adherence (full doses of ribavirin, treatment duration), lack of graft cirrhosis at baseline, and viral genotype non-1. Data with triple therapy are encouraging. Response rates of about 60% at end-of-therapy have been described. Drug-drug interactions with calcineurin inhibitors are present but easily manageable with strict trough levels monitoring. Side effects are frequent and severe, particularly anemia, infections and acute renal insufficiency. In the future new oral antivirals will likely prevent viral reinfection. In this review, we will cover the most significant but also controversial aspects regarding recurrent HCV infection, including the natural history, retransplantation, antiviral therapy, and outcome in HIV-HCV patients.

### Reduced fibrosis in recurrent HCV with tacrolimus, azathioprine and steroids versus tacrolimus: randomised trial long term outcomes [^abfd5997]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

We published early results of a randomised trial in liver transplant recipients with HCV cirrhosis assessing tacrolimus monotherapy (MT) versus tacrolimus, azathioprine and prednisolone triple therapy (TT), which showed a slower onset of histological severe fibrosis and portal hypertension in the TT arm compared with tacrolimus alone, independent of other factors known to affect fibrosis. This was contrary to the starting hypothesis that the lesser immunopotency with MT should result in less fibrosis.

However, despite our initial trial results and other consistent data with more patients, including a possible benefit with azathioprine, the optimal immunosuppression for HCV transplant recipients is still debated. Indeed, immunosuppression worsens the severity of HCV recurrence. Cyclosporine has no advantage versus tacrolimus regarding stage progressiondespite in vitro (but not in vivo) activity against HCV. Tacrolimus compared with cyclosporine improves both patient and graft survival including patients transplanted for hepatitis C cirrhosisand is the preferred calcineurin inhibitor.

Therefore, we evaluated outcomes in our trial, after a median of 8 years of follow-up, including the original end points as well as differences in hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and collagen proportionate area (CPA) as a quantitative measure of fibrosis and clinical decompensation.

### Hot topic in hepatitis C virus research: the type of immunosuppression does not matter [^f1cefa43]. Liver Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Key Points

1. The natural history of recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) is highly variable. Old donor age is a factor that has consistently been shown to affect disease progression. 2. Overall, immunosuppression determines the progression of HCV-related disease; however, the type of immunosuppressive agent used for induction or maintenance is not a key factor. 3. Steroid boluses should be avoided; they are associated with increased viremia, fibrosis progression, and reduced survival. 4. Antiviral therapy, particularly if it is successful, is associated with improved outcomes for liver transplant recipients with HCV. 5. There are no convincing data for modifying the type of immunosuppression before antiviral therapy is started.

### Long-term management of the successful adult liver transplant: 2012 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^198b4853]. Liver Transplantation (2013). Medium credibility.

AASLD/AST 2012 practice guideline — posttransplant antiviral therapy for HCV — Posttransplant antiviral therapy is generally reserved for those showing evidence of progressive disease manifested by moderate to severe necroinflammation or mild to moderate fibrosis, and the initiation of antiviral therapy is recommended when significant histological disease is present. The primary goal of post-LT antiviral therapy is the achievement of sustained viral clearance because this outcome is associated with fibrosis stabilization or regression and improved graft survival. In patients receiving peginterferon and ribavirin, the pooled estimated rate of acute graft rejection is 5% and is generally reversible with immunosuppressive adjustment, and cholestatic fibrosing hepatitis has been described during antiviral therapy that responds to discontinuation of interferon and amplification of immunosuppression in most cases.

Patients and methods

Inclusion — exclusion criteria, randomisation and endpoints

From January 2000 to June 2007, at the Royal Free Hospital, consecutive transplant recipients were randomised if they had cirrhosis, were HCV RNA positive in serum and previous histology was compatible with HCV liver disease. Randomisation at the Royal Edinburgh Infirmary and St Vincent's University Hospital was between 12/2003 and 5/2006. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were published previously. The study protocol was approved by the Hospital Ethics committees at each site.

Follow-up stopped at death, retransplantation or 1/2013. We analysed the original primary endpoints — progression to Ishak stage 4 and graft failure either resulting in retransplantation or patient's death. We also evaluated patients' survival, acute cellular rejection episodes, chronic rejection, recurrence of HCV (defined by Ishak inflammation score ≥ 4), HVPG progression to 10 mm Hg, CPA, fibrosis progression assessed by CPA and Ishak stage (for comparison with other published studies), and time to first episode of clinical decompensation defined as whichever occurred first, of ascites/hydrothorax, variceal bleeding or encephalopathy.

For each patient, the following were evaluated: demographic and clinical data (including concomitant hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and/or alcoholic aetiology), donor age/gender, cold/warm ischaemia time, initial immunosuppression and subsequent changes, occurrence and treatment of rejection episodes, cytomegalovirus or other infections, histological episodes of de novo hepatitis, genotype, viral load pre-LT and 1 year post-liver transplantation (LT), antiviral treatment and sustained virological response (SVR), diabetes mellitus pretransplant and post-transplant, human leucocyte antigen and blood group compatibility of donor/recipient, sex match/mismatch and tacrolimus levels at 5, 15 and 30 days post-LT.

AASLD/AST long-term management of adult liver transplant — immunosuppression withdrawal guidance states: Although the long-term withdrawal of all immunosuppression can be achieved in a small number of patients, this should be undertaken only with select recipients and under close supervision (grade 2, level C). The rationale notes that The majority of LT recipients need lifelong immunosuppression to maintain graft function and that A very small number of LT recipients develop operational tolerance to the allograft and do not require long-term immunosuppression.

### Importance of liver biopsy findings in immunosuppression management: biopsy monitoring and working criteria for patients with operational tolerance [^794548e1]. Liver Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Obstacles to morbidity-free long-term survival after liver transplantation (LT) include complications of immunosuppression (IS), recurrence of the original disease and malignancies, and unexplained chronic hepatitis and graft fibrosis. Many programs attempt to minimize chronic exposure to IS by reducing dosages and stopping steroids. A few programs have successfully weaned a highly select group of recipients from all IS without apparent adverse consequences, but long-term follow-up is limited. Patients subjected to adjustments in IS are usually followed by serial liver chemistry tests, which are relatively insensitive methods for detecting allograft damage. Protocol biopsy has largely been abandoned for hepatitis C virus-negative recipients, at least in part because of the inability to integrate routine histopathological findings into a rational clinical management algorithm. Recognizing a need to more precisely categorize and determine the clinical significance of findings in long-term biopsy samples, the Banff Working Group on Liver Allograft Pathology has reviewed the literature, pooled the experience of its members, and proposed working definitions for biopsy changes that (1) are conducive to lowering IS and are compatible with operational tolerance (OT) and (2) raise concern for closer follow-up and perhaps increased IS during or after IS weaning. The establishment of guidelines should help us to standardize analyses of the effects of various treatments and/or weaning protocols and more rigorously categorize patients who are assumed to show OT. Long-term follow-up using standardized criteria will help us to determine the consequences of lowering IS and to define and determine the incidence and robustness of OT in liver allografts.

### Steroid free immunosuppression in liver transplantation… [^3bc57000]. ClinicalTrials (2006). Low credibility.

Steroid Free Immunosuppression in Liver TransplantationClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Steroids have remained a standard part of post-transplant immunosuppression, both for prevention and treatment of rejection. However, steroids have been shown to cause long-term adverse effects, such as: susceptibility to infection, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, osteopenia, cataracts and growth retardation in children. They have also been implicated in accelerating Hepatitis C virus re-infection post-liver transplantation. Several studies have shown that early steroid reduction or withdrawal could be done safely to alleviate many steroid-related adverse effects after liver transplantation. This is a prospective controlled randomized trial on adult patients who will undergo primary OLT at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. Forty consecutive OLT recipients shall be randomized into two groups.
- Control group- immuno-suppressive drug regimen consisting of basiliximab, tacrolimus, Mycophenolic acid, and steroids
- Study group- immuno-suppressive drug regimen consisting of basiliximab, tacrolimus, Mycophenolic acid without steroids. Basiliximab will be given at 20 mg IV bolus intra-operatively and on the 4th day after transplantation. Tacrolimus shall be administered at a dose of 0. 15mg/ kg/ day by mouth or through a naso-gastric tube, starting not earlier than 24 after the transplant but within 48 hrs after reperfusion. The dose shall be adjusted to achieve a trough level of 10–15 ng/ml during the first 30 days after transplantation and lowered to 5–10 ng/ml, thereafter. Patients randomized to the control group shall be administered methylprednisolone 1000 mg IV during the anhepatic phase. Prednisone shall be tapered slowly starting at 1 month post-OLT and weaned off completely by 6 months post-OLT.

Enteric-coated mycophenolic acid or EC-MPA will be added to the regimen, particularly in patients with renal impairment or neuro-toxicity to minimize the dose and effects of tacrolimus. It will be started at 720 mg P. O. 2x/ day immediately post-transplant and shall be given for a period of 3 months. Primary end points of this study at 6 months post-transplant include: graft and patient survival rates, and incidence of acute rejection and therapy employed to treat rejection. Secondary end points include: adverse effects of steroids, particularly, diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension; incidence and severity of HCV recurrence, and incidence of infectious complications. Blood samples of HCV recipients shall be collected on day of surgery, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post-OLT as per TJUH Liver Transplant Protocol. Sera shall be stored at -80C and will be used for quantitative HCV RNA levels by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

Protocol liver biopsy shall be performed at the time of surgery, between 7–21 days post-OLT and at approximately 3 months after transplantation or as clinically indicated by elevated liver function test results. Acute rejection shall be treated initially by increasing the tacrolimus dose to achieve a level 15–20 ng/ml for 48 hrs. If liver function test results will not show improvement by the 3rd day after increasing tacrolimus dose, a biopsy should be performed. Only biopsy proven rejection shall be treated according to the following protocol. Mild to moderate rejection shall be treated in the study group with methylprednisolone 1 gm IV with tapering doses of steroid as described above. Steroids shall be discontinued after the completion of the taper. In the control group, methylprednisolone 1 gm IV shall be followed by tapering doses and by prednisone 20 mg once daily, which shall be progressively reduced accordingly.

### Tacrolimus monotherapy in liver transplantation: one-year results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^2e483ff4]. Annals of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Minimal immunosuppression (IS) is desirable in organ transplantation to reduce side effects and to promote the process of tolerance induction.

Material and Methods

Between February 2000 and September 2004, 156 adults (> 15 years old) receiving a primary liver graft were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator-driven single-center study comparing tacrolimus (TAC)-placebo (PL) and TAC-low-dose, short-term (64 days) steroid (ST) IS. There were no exclusion criteria at moment of randomization. All patients had a 12-month follow-up (range, 12–84).

Results

Three- and 12-month patient survival rates were 93.6% and 87.2% in the TAC-PL group and 98.7% and 94.7% in TAC-ST group (P = 0.096 and P = 0.093, respectively). Three- and 12-month graft survival rates were 92.3% and 85.9% versus 97.4% and 92.3% (P = 0.14 and 0.13, respectively). By 3 and 12 months, rejection treatment had been given in 20.5% (16 pts) and 23% (18 pts) of TAC-PL patients and in 12.7% (10 pts) and 20.5% (16 pts) of TAC-ST patients (P = 0.20 and 0.54). Corticosteroid-resistant rejection (CRR) at 3 and 12 months was recorded in 12.8% (10 pts) of TAC-PL patients and 3.8% (3 pts) of TAC-ST patients (P = 0.04). When considering the 145 patients transplanted without artificial organ support (n = 145), CRR at 3 and 12 months was recorded in 8.8% (6/68 pts) of TAC-PL patients and in 3.9% (3/77 pts) of TAC-ST patients (P = 0.22). Vanishing bile duct syndrome was diagnosed in 1 (1.2%) TAC-PL patient and 4 (5.1%) TAC-ST patients (P = 0.17). By 1 year, 78.2% (61/78) of TAC-PL patients and 82% (64/78) of TAC-ST patients were on TAC monotherapy (P = 0.54). When considering 67 TAC-PL and 74 TAC-ST survivors, rates of monotherapy were 91% (61 pts) and 86.5% (64 pts) (P = 0.39). At 1 year, 62.5% (42 pts) of TAC-PL survivors and 64.9% (48 pts) of TAC-ST survivors were on low-dosage (< 6 ng/mL) TAC monotherapy (P 0.79).

Conclusion

TAC monotherapy can be achieved safely without compromising graft nor patient survival in a primary, even unselected, adult liver transplant population. The higher incidence of early CRR in the TAC-PL group related to the significantly higher number of patients transplanted while being on artificial organ support. In such condition, this monodrug immunosuppressive strategy needs to be adapted. TAC monotherapy strategy should lay the basis for further large scale minimization studies in liver transplantation.

### A randomized, multicenter study comparing steroid-free immunosuppression and standard immunosuppression for liver transplant recipients with chronic hepatitis C [^d13379d5]. Liver Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

This randomized, prospective, multicenter trial compared the safety and efficacy of steroid-free immunosuppression (IS) to the safety and efficacy of 2 standard IS regimens in patients undergoing transplantation for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The outcome measures were acute cellular rejection (ACR), severe HCV recurrence, and survival. The patients were randomized (1:1:2) to tacrolimus (TAC) and corticosteroids (arm 1; n = 77), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), TAC, and corticosteroids (arm 2; n = 72), or MMF, TAC, and daclizumab induction with no corticosteroids (arm 3; n = 146). In all, 295 HCV RNA-positive subjects were enrolled. At 2 years, there were no differences in ACR, HCV recurrence (biochemical evidence), patient survival, or graft survival rates. The side effects of IS did not differ, although there was a trend toward less diabetes in the steroid-free group. Liver biopsy samples revealed no significant differences in the proportions of patients in arms 1, 2, and 3 with advanced HCV recurrence (ie, an inflammation grade ≥ 3 and/or a fibrosis stage ≥ 2) in years 1 (48.2%, 50.4%, and 43.0%, respectively) and 2 (69.5%, 75.9%, and 68.1%, respectively). Although we have found that steroid-free IS is safe and effective for liver transplant recipients with chronic HCV, steroid sparing has no clear advantage in comparison with traditional IS.

### Outcome of recurrent hepatitis C virus after liver transplantation in a randomized trial of tacrolimus monotherapy versus triple therapy [^933fc6fc]. Liver Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Less potent immunosuppression is considered to reduce the severity of hepatitis C virus (HCV) recurrence after liver transplantation. An optimal regimen is unknown. We evaluated tacrolimus monotherapy versus triple therapy in a randomized trial of 103 first transplants for HCV cirrhosis. One hundred three patients who underwent transplantation for HCV were randomized to tacrolimus monotherapy (n = 54) or triple therapy with tacrolimus, azathioprine, and steroids (n = 49), which were tapered to zero by 3 to 6 months. Both groups had serial transjugular biopsies with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement. The time to reach Ishak stage 4 was the predetermined endpoint. All factors documented in the literature as being associated with HCV recurrence and the allocated treatment were evaluated for reaching stage 4 and HVPG ≥ 10 mm Hg. No significant preoperative, perioperative, or postoperative differences, including the frequency of biopsies between groups, were found. During a mean follow-up of 53.5 months, 9 monotherapy patients and 6 triple therapy patients died, and 5 monotherapy patients and 4 triple therapy patients underwent retransplantation. Stage 4 fibrosis was reached in 17 monotherapy patients and 10 triple therapy patients (P = 0.04), with slower fibrosis progression in the triple therapy patients (P = 0.048). Allocated therapy and histological acute hepatitis were independently associated with stage 4 fibrosis. HVPG increased to ≥ 10 mm Hg more rapidly in monotherapy patients versus triple therapy patients (P = 0.038). In conclusion, long-term maintenance immunosuppression with azathioprine and shorter term prednisolone with tacrolimus in HCV cirrhosis recipients resulted in a slower onset of histologically proven severe fibrosis and portal hypertension in comparison with tacrolimus alone, and this was independent of known factors affecting fibrosis.

AASLD/AST adult liver transplant immunosuppression — every patient's immunosuppressive regimen should be reviewed at least every 6 months and modified as required with the goal of minimizing long-term toxicities (grade 1, level B). There is no reliable marker for determining the effective level of immunosuppression; therefore, the choice of the agent (or agents) and doses given will be determined by the clinical, laboratory, and histological response, and calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) dose is generally determined by the drug level. After 3 months, the target levels are 5 to 10 ng/mL for tacrolimus and 100 to 150 ng/mL for cyclosporine (both are whole blood trough levels), and the target whole blood trough level for sirolimus is 5 ng/mL; the need for therapeutic drug monitoring for mycophenolate is uncertain.

### The natural history of recurrent hepatitis C and what influences this [^2f912790]. Liver Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

1. Liver failure and liver cancer from chronic hepatitis C are the most common indications for liver transplantation and numbers of both are projected to double over the next 20 years. 2. Recurrent hepatitis C infection of the allograft is universal and immediate following liver transplantation and associated with accelerated progression to cirrhosis, graft loss and death. 3. Graft and patient survival is reduced in liver transplant recipients with recurrent HCV infection compared to HCV-negative recipients. 4. The natural history of chronic hepatitis C is accelerated following liver transplantation compared C, with 20% progressing to cirrhosis by 5 years. However, the rate of fibrosis progression is not uniform and may increase over time. 5. The rates of progression from cirrhosis to decompensation and from decompensation to death are also accelerated following liver transplantation. 6. Multiple host, donor and viral factors are associated with rapid fibrosis progression and HCV-related graft failure. 7. Over the last decade, graft and patient survival rates have improved following liver transplantation for non-HCV disease but not for HCV-cirrhosis. This may reflect worsening donor quality and changes in immunosuppression strategies over recent years. 8. Viral eradication by antiviral therapy prevents disease progression and improves survival. 9. The severity of recurrent hepatitis C at one year post-transplant predicts subsequent progression to cirrhosis. Annual protocol biopsies are recommended to help determine need for antiviral therapy. 10. The projected impact of recurrent hepatitis C on graft and patient survival can only be avoided by the development of safe and effective antiviral strategies which can both prevent initial graft infection and eradicate established hepatitis C recurrence.

### A practical guide to the management of HCV infection following liver transplantation [^48d5b310]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C-associated liver failure is the most common indication for liver transplantation, with virological recurrence near ubiquitous. Approximately 30% of HCV-infected recipients will die or lose their allograft or develop cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C recurrence by the fifth postoperative year, with the proportion increasing with duration of follow-up. Strategies for minimizing the frequency of severe HCV recurrence include avoidance of older donors, early diagnosis/treatment of CMV and minimization of immunosuppression, particularly T-cell depleting therapies and pulsed corticosteroid treatment of acute cellular rejection. Patients should be offered treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin before LT if MELD ≤ 17 or as soon as histological evidence of recurrence of HCV is apparent post-LT. Because of the high frequency of hemotoxicity and renal insufficiency, ribavirin should be dosed according to renal function.

### Reduced fibrosis in recurrent HCV with tacrolimus, azathioprine and steroids versus tacrolimus: randomised trial long term outcomes [^768a602a]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Early results of a randomised trial showed reduced fibrosis due to recurrent HCV hepatitis with tacrolimus triple therapy (TT) versus monotherapy (MT) following transplantation for HCV cirrhosis. We evaluated the clinical outcomes after a median 8 years of follow-up, including differences in fibrosis assessed by collagen proportionate area (CPA).

Design

103 consecutive liver transplant recipients with HCV cirrhosis receiving cadaveric grafts were randomised to tacrolimus MT (n = 54) or TT (n = 49) with daily tacrolimus (0.1 mg/kg divided dose), azathioprine (1 mg/kg) and prednisolone (20 mg), the last tailing off to zero by 6 months. Both groups had serial transjugular biopsies with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement. Time to reach Ishak stage 4 was the predetermined endpoint. CPA was measured in all biopsies. Factors associated with HCV recurrence were evaluated. Clinical decompensation was the first occurrence of ascites/hydrothorax, variceal bleeding or encephalopathy.

Results

No significant preoperative, peri-operative or postoperative differences between groups were found. During 96 months median follow-up, stage 4 fibrosis was reached in 19 MT/11 TT with slower fibrosis progression in TT (p = 0.009). CPA at last biopsy was 12% in MT and 8% in TT patients (p = 0.004). 14 MT/ three TT patients reached HVPG ≥ 10 mm Hg (p = 0.002); 10 MT/three TT patients, decompensated. Multivariately, allocated MT (p = 0.047, OR 3.23, 95% CI 1.01 to 10.3) was independently associated with decompensation: 14 MT/ seven TT died, and five MT/ four TT were retransplanted.

Conclusions

Long term immunosuppression with tacrolimus, azathioprine and short term prednisolone in HCV cirrhosis recipients resulted in slower progression to severe fibrosis assessed by Ishak stage and CPA, less portal hypertension and decompensation, compared with tacrolimus alone.

### Complete weaning off immunosuppression in HCV liver transplant recipients is feasible and favourably impacts on the progression of disease recurrence [^fe594220]. Journal of Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

HCV-related disease recurrence progresses rapidly after liver transplantation. We hypothesised that withdrawal of immunosuppression might favourably impact on disease progression.

Methods

Weaning off immunosuppression was attempted in 34 HCV-RNA positive patients (mean age 62 ± 6.4 years) transplanted 63.5 ± 20.1 months earlier, under cyclosporine A monotherapy. Patients were followed for 3 years including yearly protocol liver biopsies. Primary endpoints were feasibility of weaning off immunosuppression and its impact on disease progression. Secondary endpoint was to identify predictors of an immunosuppression-free state and fibrosis progression.

Results

Complete and permanent immunosuppression withdrawal was achieved in 8 patients (23.4%), whereas 14 (41.2%) developed rejection within eight months despite an initial response and 12 (35.2%) rejected during tapering. After a mean follow-up 45.5 ± 5.8 months weaned patients showed stabilisation/improvement of histological fibrosis (P < 0.01), lower necro-inflammation (P < 0.02) and improved liver function (P < 0.05) compared to weaning-intolerants. Multiple logistic regression identified low blood cyclosporine A trough levels during the first post-transplant week (P = 0.004) and initial steroid-free immunosuppression (P < 0.008) as independent predictors of sustained weaning. Achievement of immunosoppression freedom (P = 0.02) and baseline staging score (P < 0.0001) were independently associated with stabilisation/improvement of histological fibrosis.

Conclusions

Reconstitution of immune-competence in the host improves the natural history of HCV recurrence in the graft.

### Can immunosuppression be stopped after liver transplantation? [^d5af2c00]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Liver transplantation has improved dramatically over the past three decades, mainly as a result of advances in surgical techniques and management of post-transplant complications. The focus has now turned towards rescuing additional organs in the face of scarce organ supply, or prevention of long-term toxicity associated with immunosuppression. The liver appears to be privileged in terms of immune tolerance, with a low incidence of antibody-mediated rejection, which is in sharp contrast to other solid organ transplants, such as kidney, lung, and heart transplants. However, tolerogenic processes remain poorly understood, and strategies for complete drug withdrawal should be selected carefully to avoid graft rejection. In this Review, we summarise the current understanding of liver-specific immune responses and provide an outlook on future approaches.

Late rejection after adult liver transplant — definition, diagnosis, risk factors, and management: Late rejection is defined as rejection that has its onset more than 90 days after transplantation, with two recognized forms: cellular rejection and ductopenic rejection. Both forms are, until the late stages, asymptomatic, the diagnosis is made through abnormal liver tests and can be confirmed only on the basis of histology, and the Banff criteria have been adopted to define the nature and severity. Risk factors include reduction of immunosuppression, pre-LT autoimmune liver disease, and concurrent administration of interferon (for HCV treatment). In mild cases of cellular rejection, an increase in maintenance levels of immunosuppression may be sufficient; in histologically moderate or severe cases, the treatment should be a short course of increased immunosuppression (eg, methyl prednisolone at 500 mg/day or prednisolone at 200 mg/day for 3 days) followed by an increase in the baseline immunosuppression. A full response (defined as a return to normal liver tests) is seen in only approximately half of patients, with approximately 25% developing a further episode of cellular rejection and 25% developing ductopenic rejection.

AASLD/AST practice guideline — Posttransplant antiviral therapy for recurrent HCV after LT indicates that posttransplant antiviral therapy is generally reserved for those showing evidence of progressive disease, which is manifested by the presence of moderate to severe necroinflammation or mild to moderate fibrosis, and the initiation of antiviral therapy is recommended when significant histological disease is present. The primary goal of post-LT antiviral therapy is the achievement of sustained viral clearance because this virological outcome is associated with fibrosis stabilization or regression and improved graft survival, and this paradigm will change with more efficacious and less toxic antiviral therapy.

### Tolerance in clinical liver transplantation [^26e30fb6]. Human Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

While advances in immunosuppressive therapy have lowered the rate of acute rejection following liver transplantation, the consequence has been an increase in morbidity and mortality related to the lifelong need for maintenance immunosuppression. These complications include an increased risk of malignancy, infection, metabolic disorders, and chronic kidney disease, as well as high health care costs associated with these therapies and the required drug monitoring. Given these issues, most clinicians attempt trial and error dose minimization with variable success rates, and there has been significant interest in full drug withdrawal in select patients through research protocols. These strategies would be more successful if immunomodulatory therapies early after transplantation could be developed and if immune activation biomarkers guiding drug tapering were available to personalize these approaches. This review will review the mechanisms of liver transplant tolerance and potential strategies to achieve immunosuppression withdrawal.

### Biomarkers of immune tolerance in liver transplantation [^75f6ee57]. Human Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

The liver exhibits intrinsic immune tolerogenic properties that contribute to a unique propensity toward spontaneous acceptance when transplanted, both in animal models and in humans. Thus, in contrast to what happens after transplantation of other solid organs, several years following liver transplantation a significant subset of patients are capable of maintaining normal allograft function with histological integrity in the absence of immunosuppressive drug treatment. Significant efforts have been put into identifying sensitive and specific biomarkers of tolerance in order to stratify liver transplant recipients according to their need for immunosuppressive medication and their likelihood of being able to completely discontinue it. These biomarkers are currently being validated in prospective clinical trials of immunosuppression withdrawal both in Europe and in the United States. These studies have the potential to transform the clinical management of liver transplant recipients by mitigating, at least in part, the burden of lifelong immunosuppression.

Hepatitis C virus after liver transplant (LT) — direct-acting antivirals (DAA) and donor-recipient considerations: Viral load quantification are medically not required to initiate DAA treatment with pan-genotypic coverage, and assessment for drug-drug interactions between DAA and immunosuppressive agents (Table 4) is essential. Multiple large case series have demonstrated the efficacy of DAA therapy post-LT, and while an initial study reported a higher rate of AMR, subsequent studies have not shown similar findings. One prospective multicenter trial treated 13 HCV-negative LT recipients at a mean time of 7 days post-LT, with all subjects achieving sustained response. In a single center study of 21 recipients without hepatitis C infection who received anti-HCV positive but HCV NAT negative donors, only two (9.5%) developed HCV viremia post-LT; thus in this population, close monitoring for recurrent viremia is appropriate.

### Tolerance after liver transplantation: where are we? [^481951a8]. Liver Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Impeccable management of immunosuppression is required to ensure the best longterm outcomes for liver transplant recipients. This is particularly challenging for children who arguably need 8 decades of graft and patient survival. Too little risks chronic, often subclinical allo-immune injury while too much risks insidious and cumulative toxicities. Historically, immunosuppression minimization or withdrawal has been a strategy to optimize the longevity of liver transplant recipients. The literature is sprinkled with single-center reports of operationally tolerant patients - those with apparently normal liver function and liver tests. However, without biopsy evidence of immunological quiescence, confidence in the phenotypic assignment of tolerance is shaky. More recently, multicenter trials of immunosuppression withdrawal for highly selected, stable, longterm adult and pediatric liver recipients have shown tolerance rates, based on both biochemical and histological assessment, of 40% and 60%, respectively. Extended biochemical and histologic follow-up of children over 8 years, equivalent to 7+ years off of drug, suggests that operational tolerance is robust. Therefore, clearly, immunosuppression can be completely and safety withdrawn from highly-selected subsets of adults and children. However, these trials have also confirmed that clinically ideal recipients - those eligible for immunosuppression withdrawal trial - can harbor significant and worrisome inflammation and/or fibrosis. Although the etiology and prognosis of these findings remain unknown, it is reasonable to surmise that they may reflect an anti-donor immune response that is insufficiently controlled. To achieve the outcomes that we are seeking and that our patients are demanding, we desperately need noninvasive but accurate biomarkers that identify whether immunosuppression is neither too much nor too little but "just right". Until these are available, liver histology remains the gold standard to assess allograft health and guide immunosuppression management. Liver Transplantation 23 1601–1614 2017 AASLD.

### Prospective multicenter clinical trial of immunosuppressive drug withdrawal in stable adult liver transplant recipients [^7d2f5276]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Lifelong immunosuppression increases morbidity and mortality in liver transplantation. Discontinuation of immunosuppressive drugs could lessen this burden, but the safety, applicability, and clinical outcomes of this strategy need to be carefully defined. We enrolled 102 stable liver recipients at least 3 years after transplantation in a single-arm multicenter immunosuppression withdrawal trial. Drugs were gradually discontinued over a 6 to 9-month period. The primary endpoint was the development of operational tolerance, defined as successful immunosuppressive drug cessation maintained for at least 12 months with stable graft function and no histopathologic evidence of rejection. Out of the 98 recipients evaluated, 57 rejected and 41 successfully discontinued all immunosuppressive drugs. In nontolerant recipients rejection episodes were mild and resolved over 5.6 months (two nontolerant patients still exhibited mild gradually improving cholestasis at the end of follow-up). In tolerant recipients no progressive clinically significant histological damage was apparent in follow-up protocol biopsies performed up to 3 years following drug withdrawal. Tolerance was independently associated with time since transplantation (odds ratio [OR] 1.353; P = 0.0001), recipient age (OR 1.073; P = 0.009), and male gender (OR 4.657; P = 0.016). A predictive model incorporating the first two clinical variables identified subgroups of recipients with very high (79%), intermediate (30%-38%), and very low (0%) likelihood of successful withdrawal.

Conclusion

When conducted at late timepoints after transplantation, immunosuppression withdrawal is successful in a high proportion of carefully selected liver recipients. A combination of clinical parameters could be useful to predict the success of this strategy. Additional prospective studies are now needed to confirm these results and to validate clinically applicable diagnostic biomarkers.

### Late hepatic allograft dysfunction [^aaad777b]. Liver Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

1. Lifelong monitoring of graft function, immunosuppressive levels, and screening for drug toxicity is required in all liver recipients. 2. Late hepatic allograft dysfunction is common and is caused by a variety of etiologies including rejection, infection, biliary/vascular abnormalities, recurrence of disease, and drug hepatotoxicity. 3. In all patients with late hepatic allograft dysfunction, liver biopsy should be performed to assess for the presence of rejection, and to thus avoid excessive use of bolus corticosteroid therapy and guide appropriate immunosuppressive management. 4. Recurrence of disease is the most common cause of late hepatic allograft dysfunction. 5. Hepatitis C universally reinfects the hepatic allograft, and is associated with decreased patient and graft survival and leads to the recurrence of cirrhosis in 28% of patients within 5 years of transplantation. 6. Major advances have been made in preventing recurrence of hepatitis B by the use of hepatitis B immune globulin in combination with lamivudine therapy. 7. Autoimmune liver diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and autoimmune hepatitis have a recurrence rate of approximately 20% to 30%. 8. In patients developing recurrence of autoimmune hepatitis, steroid withdrawal is the most common cause. 9. Recurrent hepatocellular cancer can be markedly reduced if strict guidelines are adhered to in selecting patients. 10. Drug hepatotoxicity must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of late hepatic allograft dysfunction.

AASLD/AST 2012 practice guideline — recommendations for recurrent HCV after LT — Liver biopsy is useful in monitoring disease severity and progression and in distinguishing recurrent HCV disease from other causes of liver enzyme elevations (grade 1, level C). Prophylactic antiviral therapy has no current role in the management of HCV disease (grade 1, level A). Moderate acute rejection should be treated with increased maintenance immunosuppression and corticosteroid boluses, whereas lymphocyte-depleting drugs should be avoided (grade 1, level B). Antiviral therapy is indicated for significant histological disease: grade 3 or higher inflammatory activity and/or stage 2 or higher fibrosis (on a scale of 4) or cholestatic hepatitis; peginterferon and ribavirin are the current drugs of choice; the risks and benefits of triple therapy with protease inhibitors are to be determined; and the goal of antiviral therapy is the achievement of a sustained virological response, and this confers a survival benefit (grade 1, class B). Retransplantation for recurrent HCV disease should be considered selectively (grade 2, level B).

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for liver transplantation, more specifically with respect to management of transplant rejection, EASL 2024 guidelines recommend to consider monitoring for de novo donor-specific antibodies in combination with ALT and other noninvasive tests, such as transient elastography, to identify liver transplant recipients at risk of exhibiting subclinical rejection in whom aggressive immunosuppression minimization would not be advisable. Do not minimize immunosuppression in the presence of high mean fluorescence intensity donor-specific antibodies unless allograft damage has been excluded by liver biopsy.

### Long-term management of the successful adult liver transplant: 2012 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^ceaa75c8]. Liver Transplantation (2013). Medium credibility.

Adult liver transplant (LT) immunosuppression — determinants and monitoring are outlined as follows: The choice of immunosuppression depends on indication for transplantation with potential effects on disease recurrence, comorbidities, drug side effects (calcineurin inhibitors [CNIs] may cause renal impairment), likelihood of pregnancy (mycophenolate and mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] inhibitors such as sirolimus are potential teratogens), history of severe or recurrent rejection, prior experience with immunosuppressive agents, and history of or risk for cancers or infections. There is no reliable marker for determining the effective level of immunosuppression; dosing is guided by clinical, laboratory, and histological response, and CNI dosing is guided by drug levels with target levels after 3 months of 5 to 10 ng/mL for tacrolimus and 100 to 150 ng/mL for cyclosporine (whole blood trough levels), with a target whole blood trough level for sirolimus of 5 ng/mL; the need for therapeutic drug monitoring for mycophenolate is uncertain. Most LT recipients need lifelong immunosuppression to maintain graft function, though a very small number develop operational tolerance and do not require long-term immunosuppression.

### An appraisal of tolerance in liver transplantation [^59d7fa55]. American Journal of Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Human liver allografts have a lower susceptibility to rejection than other organs. In addition, in some liver transplant recipients immunosuppressive drugs can be completely withdrawn, and these patients are considered as 'operationally' tolerant. Careful scrutiny of accumulated clinical experience indicates that elective immunosuppressive drug weaning is feasible in almost 20% of selected liver transplant recipients. This is associated with an incidence of 12% to 76% of acute cellular rejection, but these episodes are commonly mild and often resolve by return to baseline immunosuppression (IS), many times without the need to administer steroid boluses. Study of tolerance in liver transplantation (LT) has been hampered by confusion regarding the definitions of rejection and tolerance, and by the absence of prospective studies correlating results of immune monitoring assays and clinical outcome. Thus, we lack a clinically validated treatment-stopping rule capable of predicting the success of IS withdrawal and this procedure has to be performed on a 'trial and error' basis. The search for an accurate means to identify allograft tolerance among immunosuppressed recipients should become a priority in LT research. This information would provide a biological basis for guiding IS withdrawal protocols and for the implementation of tolerance-promoting strategies in LT.

### Calcineurin inhibitor minimisation versus continuation of calcineurin inhibitor treatment for liver transplant recipients [^44fc9a98]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The therapeutic success of liver transplantation has been largely attributable to the development of effective immunosuppressive treatment regimens. In particular, calcineurin inhibitors were essential in reducing acute rejection and improving early survival. Currently, more than 90% of all liver transplant recipients are treated with the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine or tacrolimus. Unfortunately, calcineurin inhibitors cause adverse events, such as nephrotoxicity, and because of this, minimisation (reduction and withdrawal) regimens of calcineurin inhibitor have been developed and studied. However, the benefits and harms of these minimisation regimens are unclear.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of calcineurin inhibitor minimisation for liver transplant recipients without substitution by another immunosuppressive agent.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (Gluud 2010), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), Science Citation Index Expanded (Royle 2003), and the World Health Organization (WHO) international clinical trials registry platform (www.who.int/ictrp) until August 2011. In addition, we searched bibliographies of relevant articles as well as US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) drug approval reviews for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We planned to select all randomised clinical trials investigating calcineurin inhibitor reduction or withdrawal in liver transplant recipients, irrespective of blinding, publication status, or language. Quasi-randomised clinical studies and cohort studies that were obtained through the searches were considered only for the reporting of harms. Trials investigating substitution of one calcineurin inhibitor by another calcineurin inhibitor were excluded. Trials investigating calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal concurrently with switching over to a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor-based regimen (everolimus or sirolimus) or mycophenolate mofetil-based regimen are the subject of a separate review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Search strategies were used to obtain titles and abstracts of studies that were relevant for the review. Two authors independently scanned the references and assessed trial eligibility.

Main Results

A total of 1299 references were identified by the searches. After removal of duplicates, 794 references were left. Out of these, two abstract reports of one ongoing randomised trial fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the review. This ongoing trial studies total withdrawal of immunosuppression in patients who receive a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) or mycophenolate mofetil as the only immunosuppressive agent. The trial compares withdrawal of calcineurin inhibitor or mycophenolate mofetil with continuation of calcineurin inhibitor or mycophenolate mofetil. However, no trial results on the outcomes of interest to this review were available.

Authors' Conclusions

This review shows that strategies regarding calcineurin inhibitor minimisation, that is, reduction or withdrawal, without substitution versus continuation of calcineurin inhibitor treatment lack evidence from randomised trials. More research with calcineurin inhibitor reduction and withdrawal regimens is needed to optimise dosing and timing of calcineurin inhibitor treatment in order to achieve optimal patient and graft survival with a minimum of adverse events. Specifically regarding calcineurin inhibitor reduction versus no reduction, we recommend that randomised trials evaluating calcineurin inhibitor reduction versus continuation of calcineurin inhibitor treatment are conducted. Regarding calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal, we recommend that mechanisms for tolerance and 'graft acceptance' are clarified, and patient groups likely to tolerate calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal are identified in order to select the right patients for total withdrawal of calcineurin inhibitors without substitution with another immunosuppressive drug. The randomised trials should only be performed in highly selected patients.

### AASLD AST practice guideline on adult liver transplantation: diagnosis and management of graft-related complications [^117fad0c]. Liver Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Adult liver transplantation (LT) — immunosuppression withdrawal and operational tolerance: Prospective clinical trials reported that > 40% of highly selected LT recipients can tolerate complete withdrawal of immunosuppression when performed at a mean of 10.2 years after LT in adults, whereas early withdrawal within 1–2 years post LT is only possible in a small group. A recent meta-analysis of 15 studies (n = 620) showed that likelihood of operational tolerance increased by 7% (95% CI 4 to 10%) per year after LT. Long-term studies on the safety of immunosuppression withdrawal regimens are inconclusive and mostly lack histologic data, and many trials excluded patients with viral hepatitis or autoimmune liver disease and were performed in pediatric rather than adult populations. Non-invasive biomarkers have been described but have not been prospectively validated; the severity of clinically silent liver allograft damage was positively associated with TCMR-related transcripts, class II donor-specific antibodies (DSA), ALT, AST, and liver stiffness measurement, and negatively correlated with serum creatinine and tacrolimus trough levels, suggesting that ALT, class II DSA and liver stiffness measurement may help identify possible candidates. Specific reliable biomarkers are still lacking, and performance of a liver biopsy before consideration of withdrawal appears prudent because prior studies excluded recipients with inflammation, fibrosis, or piecemeal necrosis on histology or with elevated DSA.

### Tacrolimus dosing in liver transplant recipients using phenotypic personalized medicine: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^3ca489c7]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Solid organ transplantation is a life-saving procedure for patients with end-stage disease, but it introduces the persistent challenge of preventing the recipient's immune system from rejecting the transplanted organ. Post-transplant immunosuppressive drug therapy is essential to maintaining the delicate balance between suppressing the immune response to avoid graft rejection and preserving enough immune function to protect against infections and cancer. Tacrolimus, the most frequently prescribed immunosuppressant in this context –, inhibits calcineurin, a crucial enzyme for T cell activation, thereby selectively preventing the immune-mediated rejection of the transplanted liver while allowing broader immune defenses to remain functional.

However, tacrolimus' narrow therapeutic window and high inter- and intra-individual variability in dosing requirements, particularly across diverse patient populations, necessitate clinician-titrated dosing that often results in deviation from target ranges, particularly during the critical post-operative phase –. High intra-patient variability in blood tacrolimus levels may be associated with poor outcomes, including rejection and graft loss –. Appropriate dosing of tacrolimus during the first 2 weeks after liver transplantation has further been associated with a lower risk of graft loss. Therefore, there is a clear need for personalized medicine to address post-transplant immunosuppression by improving therapeutic consistency and augmenting clinical decision making. A robust procedure to achieve personalized dosing of tacrolimus and other post-operative drugs has not been available.

Post-transplant immunosuppression provides a challenging model to test any personalized medicine platform. Previous attempts at tacrolimus dosing have used genetics, pharmacokinetics, and other predictive models –. However, it has proven difficult to simultaneously account for inter- and intra-individual variability in treatment regimens using such approaches, much less to use them to dose patients on a day-to-day basis. These differences also lead to health disparities not solely attributable to access, economics, or adherence –. Tacrolimus is a substrate of cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein, proteins with variable activity in intestine and liver. Its clearance is dependent on liver and kidney function, which can vary tremendously in the post-transplant setting. Furthermore, transplant patients take multiple interacting medications. Current methods based on population-averaged pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenetics, or pharmacokinetics cannot respond adequately to this variability.

### Conversion from twice daily tacrolimus to once daily tacrolimus in long-term stable liver transplant recipients: a single-center experience with 394 patients [^07d1341f]. Liver Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

After organ transplantation, strategies for simplifying the therapeutic regimen may improve adherence and prevent acute organ rejection and/or late graft loss. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of conversion from a tacrolimus (TAC) twice daily (bid) formulation to a once daily (qd) formulation in a large cohort of adult liver transplantation (LT) patients. This retrospective, observational, single-center study included 394 LT patients with at least 6 months' posttransplant follow-up and no rejection episodes in the last 3 months. The conversion from a bid formulation to a qd formulation was based on a 1:1 ratio. The mean age at the time of conversion was 53 years (range = 18–72 years); 66% were men. The main indication for LT was alcoholic cirrhosis (41%). The mean conversion time after LT was 74 months (range = 6–218 months). The mean serum TAC trough level decreased after conversion (6.1 ± 5.6 ng/mL before conversion versus 4.9 ± 2.5 ng/mL after conversion, P < 0.05). After a mean follow-up of 24 months after conversion, 6 patients had converted to cyclosporine, 14 patients had stopped all calcineurin inhibitors, 16 patients had returned to TAC bid, and 358 patients were still on TAC qd. Acute rejection episodes were observed in 7 patients. In conclusion, the results of our experience indicate that the conversion from a TAC bid formulation to a qd formulation is a safe and effective strategy for the management of stable LT patients.

### Hot-topic debate on tolerance: immunosuppression withdrawal [^a531d254]. Liver Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Key Points

1. Liver allografts exhibit intrinsic tolerogenic properties that result in their spontaneous acceptance in many experimental animal models. 2. In clinical transplantation, liver allografts require milder immunosuppression regimens than other organs, are relatively resistant to antibody-mediated rejection, and only very rarely are lost because of immunological insults. 3. A fraction of stable liver transplant recipients can withdraw from all immunosuppression therapy and then maintain normal graft function and not experience rejection. This phenomenon is known as spontaneous operational tolerance (SOT). 4. The intentional discontinuation of immunosuppression in stable liver transplant recipients has led to successful weaning in almost 20% of recipients, but the true prevalence of SOT in unselected recipients is still unknown. 5. The prevalence could be higher in pediatric recipients undergoing transplantation before 1 year of age and in adult recipients with more than 10 years of posttransplant follow-up. 6. Rejection occurring during medically supervised immunosuppression weaning trials tends to be mild and, in the overwhelming majority of cases, can be easily resolved without the administration of high-dose immunosuppression. 7. Tolerant liver recipients exhibit specific transcriptional patterns in peripheral blood and liver tissue that may constitute future diagnostic markers of tolerance. 8. There is still no formal proof that the discontinuation of low-dose immunosuppression in long-term survivors of liver transplantation improves the morbidity and mortality rates associated with immunosuppression therapy.

### Immunosuppression in patients undergoing liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma… [^5129ad84]. ClinicalTrials (2006). Low credibility.

Immunosuppression in Patients Undergoing Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular CarcinomaClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview There are two major issues to face in patients who underwent liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma. First, the patient requires adequate immunosuppressive medication to avoid rejection of its allograft. Second, the risk for HCC recurrence has to be reduced to a minimum. To date, it is a wide spread argument that immunosuppressive agents for the reduction of allograft rejection are generally tumorogenic, or at least are permissive of cancer development although little is known about their tumorogenic effect. In clinical studies substantiated by experimental data, cyclosporin enhances cancer cell growth characteristics and angiogenesis in tumors and inhibits DNA repair mechanisms, promoting their growth. In an experimental rat-model CsA promoted liver tumor recurrence and growth.

In other experimental studies a higher proliferation rate of human hepatoma cells in the presence of tacrolimus was demonstrated. Nevertheless not all immunosuppressive agents do necessarily promote tumor growth, and in fact, can have antineoplastic activities. Sirolimus, in immunosuppressive doses, has potent antiangiogenic properties that inhibit tumor growth. The antiangiogenetic mechanism is due to inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor production and signaling to endothelial cells. Besides that, sirolimus directly blocks critical intracellular pathways and inhibits cell-cycle. Through increased E-cadherin expression on tumor cells, tumor metastasis can be reduced by increased tumor cell binding. In this context it has to be mentioned that in mouse models where a transplant recipient also has a tumor, the pro-tumor effects of CsA are completely negated by sirolimus.

Especially HCC seems to be particularly sensitive to VEGF/angiogenesis, indicating a potential susceptibility to the action of sirolimus which could be shown by the group of E. K. Geissler and colleagues in Regensburg. From a clinical perspective there is a recent pilot study from Kneteman et al. indicating that early conversion of immunosuppression from CNI to mTOR-inhibitors after OLT in HCC patients with a "high risk" for tumor recurrence results in a tumor recurrence rate of only 19% and a 4-year over all survival of 83% in this group. Moreover, in the "low-risk" group the 4-year tumor recurrence rate was only 1/19. Post-HCC recurrence survival was
15. 5 months, which is marked improvement compared to currently published data. Although this study only reports on a small number of patients and is not controlled, it suggests the potential role for sirolimus to ameliorate tumor recurrence, leading to a more benign course of renewed tumor disease.

Among the most serious complications of immunosuppressive therapy in organ transplantation is the high risk of previous neoplasia recurrence, or the development of de novo cancer. HCC comprises 80–90% of malignancies indicating OLT. Before the introduction of strict criteria for the enrollment of primary liver tumors, tumor recurrence led to poor mid- and long-term results. HCC thus has an unacceptable recurrence rate following OLT when the tumor exceeds 5 cm in size. ELTR data from 2003 showed a 5 year patient overall survival for hepatic malignancy of merely 53%, comparing poorly with data from non-cholestatic liver cirrhosis of 74% and even acute liver failure of 62%. Based on previous work, and a landmark publication in 1996 by Mazzaferro et al. many centers have restricted their indication for liver transplantation due to clinical criteria based on tumor size and number to the so-called ´Milan Criteria´.

AASLD/AST practice guideline — recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) after liver transplantation (LT) — states that retransplantation for recurrent HCV disease should be considered selectively (grade 2, level B). Rationale notes that recurrent HCV infection is invariable among patients who are viremic at LT, with histological evidence of recurrent hepatitis within the first year after LT. In the absence of antiviral therapy, the median time to the development of cirrhosis is 8 to 10 years, whereas an estimated 30% will develop cirrhosis within 5 years of LT. The risk of decompensation is 15% to 30% within the first year after cirrhosis onset, and the mortality risk is 40% to 55% within 6 to 12 months of the decompensating event. Recurrent HCV cirrhosis is the most frequent cause of graft loss, and patient and graft survival are reduced versus HCV-negative patients, with a 5-year patient survival rate of approximately 70%.

3.1 Reduction of immunosuppressive medication

Twenty‐one studies described the effect of reduction of immunosuppressive medication, representing a total of 174 patients. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 In most patients (67%), the reduced drug was not described. In 34 patients (20%) reduction of tacrolimus was effectuated. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was reduced in 4% of the patients, whereas prednisone and cyclosporine were both reduced in 2% of the patients. Dose adjustment of azathioprine, everolimus and abatacept were all described in one individual patient. A switch in immunosuppressive medication was effectuated in two patients (1%), and a combination of agents was either reduced or stopped in nine patients (5%). The characteristics of these patients are provided in Table S3. Treatment was started after a median of 11 (2–72) months after the likely time of infection. Overall, 55 patients (32%) achieved viral clearance (Table 2). Treatment failure, defined as serum HEV RNA remaining positive despite reduction of immunosuppressive medication, was reported in the remaining patients (n = 119, 68%). Two adverse events were observed after reduction (Table 3). Acute rejection of a kidney transplant occurred 13 months after reduction in one patients, whereas the second patient deceased due to decompensated liver cirrhosis after reduction of tacrolimus.

### Does tacrolimus offer virtual freedom from chronic rejection after primary liver transplantation? Risk and prognostic factors in 1, 048 liver transplantations with a mean follow-up of 6 years [^85a2c173]. Liver Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Tacrolimus has proven to be a potent immunosuppressive agent in liver transplantation (LT). Its introduction has led to significantly less frequent and severe acute rejection. Little is known about the rate of chronic rejection (CR) in primary LT using tacrolimus therapy. The aim of the present study is to examine the long-term incidence of CR, risk factors, prognostic factors, and outcome after CR. The present study evaluated the development of CR in 1,048 consecutive adult primary liver allograft recipients initiated and mostly maintained on tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive therapy. They were evaluated with a mean follow-up of 77.3 ± 14.7 months (range, 50.7 to 100.1 months). To assess the impact of primary diagnosis on the rate and outcome of CR, the population was divided into 3 groups. Group I included patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)- or hepatitis B virus (HBV)-induced cirrhosis (n = 312); group II included patients diagnosed with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), or autoimmune hepatitis (AIH; n = 217); and group III included patients with all other diagnoses (n = 519). Overall, 32 of 1,048 patients (3.1%) developed CR. This represented 13 (4.1%), 12 (5.5%), and 7 patients (1.3%) in groups I, II, and III, respectively. The relative risk for developing CR was 3.2 times greater for group I and 4.3 times greater for group II compared with group III. This difference was statistically significant (P = 0.004). The incidence of acute rejection and total number of acute rejection episodes were significantly greater in patients who developed CR compared with those who did not (P < .0001). Similarly, the mean donor age for CR was significantly older than for patients without CR (43.0 v 36.2 years; P = 0.02). Thirteen of the 32 patients (40.6%) who developed CR retained their original grafts for a mean period of 54 ± 25 months after diagnosis. Seven patients (21.9%) underwent re-LT, and 12 patients (38.3%) died. Serum bilirubin levels and the presence of arteriopathy, arterial loss, and duct loss on liver biopsy at the time of diagnosis of CR were significantly greater among the 3 groups of patients. In addition, patient and graft survival for group I were significantly worse compared with groups II and III. We conclude that CR occurred rarely among patients maintained long term on tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive therapy. When steroid use is controlled, the incidence of acute rejection, mean donor age, HBV- and/or HCV-induced cirrhosis, or a diagnosis of PBC, PSC, or AIH were found to be predictors of CR. Greater values for serum bilirubin level, duct loss, arteriopathy, arteriolar loss, and presence of HCV or HBV were found to be poor prognostic factors for the 3 groups; greater total serum bilirubin value (P = 0.05) was the only factor found to be significant between patients who had graft loss versus those who recovered.

### Long-term management of the successful adult liver transplant: 2012 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^9fe9a6f5]. Liver Transplantation (2013). Medium credibility.

AASLD/AST long-term management of adult liver transplant recipients — The reduction or withdrawal of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-associated immunosuppression is an appropriate response to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in LT recipients (grade 1, level A). A reduction in the dosage or a complete withdrawal of CNIs several months to years after LT is a common practice aimed at ameliorating the progression of CKD, and renal-sparing maintenance protocols typically rely on sirolimus or everolimus, often in combination with mycophenolate, to prevent acute rejection; others use steroids and mycophenolate or azathioprine. Renal function is more likely to be preserved if CNI withdrawal is instituted when the estimated glomerular filtration rate is between 40 and 50 mL/minute/1.73 m2.

### Randomized trial investigating the utility of a liver tissue transcriptional biomarker in identifying adult liver transplant recipients not requiring maintenance immunosuppression [^00ec3097]. American Journal of Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The maintenance of stable allograft status in the absence of immunosuppression (IS), known as operational tolerance, can be achieved in a small proportion of liver transplant recipients, but we lack reliable tools to predict its spontaneous development. We conducted a prospective, multicenter, biomarker-strategy design, IS withdrawal clinical trial to determine the utility of a predictive biomarker of operational tolerance. The biomarker test, originally identified in a patient cohort with high operational tolerance prevalence, consisted of a 5-gene transcriptional signature measured in liver tissue collected before initiating IS weaning. One hundred sixteen adult stable liver transplant recipients were randomized 1:1 to either arm A (IS withdrawal regardless of biomarker status) or arm B (IS withdrawal in biomarker-positive recipients). Immunosuppression withdrawal was initiated in 82 participants, rejection occurred in 54 (67.5%), and successful discontinuation of IS was achieved in 22 (27.5%), but only 13 (16.3%) met operational tolerance histologic criteria (10 in arm A; 3 in arm B). The biomarker test did not yield useful information in selecting patients able to successfully discontinue IS. Operational tolerance was associated with time posttransplant, recipient age, presence of circulating exhausted CD8 + T cells, and a reduced number of immune synapses within the graft.

### COVID-19 in patients with liver disease and liver transplant: clinical implications, prevention, and management [^2ff3492c]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Immunosuppression management after LT

Immunosuppressant management in SOT recipients with COVID-19 must balance the benefits of protective immune activation with the risks of excessive inflammation and transplant rejection. In the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infection frequently led to changes in immunosuppressive regimens in patients with LT. In a European study including 57 LT recipients, immunosuppression was reduced in 39% of patients and discontinued in 7% of patients. Subsequent data from the U.S. multicenter COVID-19 in CLD consortium found that immunosuppression was modified in 49% of LT recipients with COVID-19, particularly in those who had severe illness requiring ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or vasopressors. In these studies, change in immunosuppression – most commonly discontinuation of mycophenolate – was not associated with adverse outcomes including acute liver injury or mortality. In fact, a prospective study of 111 LT recipients with COVID-19 found that baseline immunosuppression containing mycophenolate was an independent predictor of severe COVID-19 infection, especially at doses greater than 1000 mg/day, potentially due to a synergistic effect of mycophenolate and COVID-19 on T lymphocytes. In contrast, CNI and mTORi have not been associated with COVID-19 severity and are thought to have a neutral or even beneficial impact on disease course.– CNI use has been associated with improved survival among LT recipients with COVID-19, although these patients were younger and had fewer comorbidities. CNIs may have direct antiviral properties and mTORi are also postulated to suppress COVID-19 replication directly. As such, CNI and mTORi are not routinely modified in patients with COVID-19, as supported by major society recommendations.

Overall, current evidence suggests that the management of immunosuppression in LT recipients with COVID-19 should be tailored to the individual needs of each patient. For those with severe COVID-19 infection or at high risk of disease progression, reduction in immunosuppression may be appropriate; in such cases, it may be reasonable to preferentially decrease the dose of mycophenolate. This management strategy is supported by major society recommendations. In patients receiving tacrolimus, special attention should be placed on monitoring medication levels, as COVID-19 has been shown to increase serum tacrolimus concentrations in SOT recipients.

### Evaluation for liver transplantation in adults: 2013 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^5f53b7ad]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV)–related indications and management around LT — "Cirrhosis due to chronic HCV infection remains the commonest indication for LT in the United States". After LT, HCV shows "high rates of graft dysfunction and progression to cirrhosis in 20–30% of patients" with "graft failure due to recurrent HCV in 10% of HCV-infected recipients within 5–10 years of LT". An interferon-free regimen using "sofosbuvir plus ribavirin prior to LT" achieving HCV RNA clearance "substantially reduces the risk of recurrent HCV post-LT". "Retransplantation in patients with severe recurrent HCV is controversial" and worse than primary transplants, especially when severe recurrence occurs "in < 5 years after the initial LT". Recommendations state "LT transplant candidates with HCV have the same indications for LT as for other etiologies of cirrhosis (1-A)" and "HCV therapy prior to LT should be considered to reduce the risk of recurrent HCV post-LT (1-B)".

### Health-related quality of life after liver transplantation for adult recipients [^ea38a7d9]. Liver Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

1. Pretransplantation health-related quality of life scores are affected by the etiology of liver cirrhosis, with hepatocellular and cholestatic etiologies having higher health-related quality of life scores than alcohol or viral hepatitis etiologies. 2. Posttransplantation health-related quality of life scores are not affected by the etiology of the original liver cirrhosis, but transplant recipient scores continue to remain significantly lower than those of healthy patient controls. 3. During the first 6 months after liver transplantation, the majority of physical and mental components of health-related quality of life scores improve, but these increases are not sustained in the long term. 4. At 1 year after liver transplantation, emotional and mental health-related quality of life scores begin to decrease. 5. During postoperative years 1 to 5, episodes of acute cellular rejection and patient age over 60 years decrease physical function and overall general health-related quality of life scores. 6. Beyond 5 years after orthotopic liver transplantation, age over 60, osteoporosis, and episodes of chronic rejection decrease health-related quality of life scores through decreases in the physical function and bodily pain domains. 7. Hepatitis C as an indication for liver transplantation is an independent factor in decreasing posttransplantation health-related quality of life scores. 8. Further studies are necessary that include a complete evaluation of the effects of gender, socioeconomic status, education, and ethnicity in order to better understand factors influencing post-liver transplantation health-related quality of life scores. 9. The development of a health-related quality of life assessment tool specific to transplantation could help us to more accurately assess factors (such as immunosuppression) that alter posttransplantation health-related quality of life.

### Donor-specific immune senescence as a candidate biomarker of operational tolerance following liver transplantation in adults: results of a prospective, multicenter cohort study [^7dc7d2b5]. American Journal of Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Immunosuppression can be withdrawn from selected liver transplant recipients, although robust clinical predictors of tolerance remain elusive. The Immune Tolerance Network ITN056ST study (OPTIMAL; NCT02533180) assessed clinical outcomes and mechanistic correlates of phased immunosuppression withdrawal (ISW) in nonautoimmune, nonviral adult liver transplant recipients. Enrolled subjects were ≥ 3 years posttransplant with minimal/absent inflammation or fibrosis on a screening liver biopsy. The primary end point was operational tolerance at 52 weeks following complete ISW. Of 61 subjects who initiated ISW, 34 failed during ISW and 10 restarted immunosuppression after completing ISW due to clinically manifest acute rejection. Only 10 of 17 clinically stable subjects remaining off immunosuppression at 1 year were ultimately deemed tolerant by biopsy. There were no cases of chronic rejection or graft loss; 28.3% developed de novo donor-specific antibody during ISW, which persisted in 11.3%. The majority of subjects (78.6%), including those who experienced rejection, ended the study on same or less calcineurin inhibitor than at baseline. A minority (16.4%) of histologically and clinically stable long-term adult liver transplant recipients can successfully discontinue and remain off immunosuppression. Increased frequency of donor-specific T cell senescence, C4d deposition, and higher density of immune synapses on the screening liver biopsy emerged as potential candidate biomarkers for operational tolerance.

### Adult liver transplantation: UK clinical guideline-part 2: surgery and post-operation [^c7c74043]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

How should immunosuppression be managed in the clinic?

Most LT recipients require lifelong immunosuppression, although some develop 'operational tolerance' and can maintain graft health without immunosuppression. Maximum immunosuppression is required early post-transplant, when rejection risk is greatest. Frequently used agents are shown in online supplementary appendix 2. The most common regimens include

A calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) (usually tacrolimus) with or without corticosteroids.
A CNI with an antimetabolite (azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil) with or without corticosteroids.
Mycophenolate and corticosteroids.

Immunosuppression is associated with significant side effects, which may be related to immunosuppression itself (such as increased risk of some cancers and infections) or drug-specific side effects (such as steroid-associated osteopenia or CNI-associated renal impairment) as in table 1. Golden rules for managing immunosuppression are outlined below, and the LTU's pharmacist is an additional important resource.

Table 1
Major side effects of commonly used immunosuppression

Golden rules with immunosuppressants

Always use the same brand of CNI and do not interchange.
CNI and mTOR inhibitor (mTORi) doses should be informed by the use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).
Target trough whole blood levels for the stable recipient are usually between 3 and 8 ng/L for tacrolimus and between 80 and 100 μg/L for cyclosporin.
For 'trough' CNI drug levels, ensure that the patient has not taken their drug on the morning of the blood test.
Always check any new prescriptions for potential drug–drug interactions.
The development of side effects does not necessarily equate with over-immunosuppression.

Adult liver transplantation — protocol biopsy and transient elastography for long-term allograft monitoring: While liver biopsy has been the gold standard for the diagnosis of post-liver transplant graft dysfunction and may be used prior to minimization of immunosuppression, protocol liver biopsy is not recommended in the routine management of stable adult liver transplant recipients (Strong, Level 4). Due to insufficient data, routine use of transient elastography to monitor allograft health cannot be recommended in adult liver transplant recipients (Weak, Level 3).

### AASLD AST practice guideline on adult liver transplantation: diagnosis and management of graft-related complications [^abdb4ef0]. Liver Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Adult liver transplantation (LT) — de novo donor-specific antibodies (DSA) incidence, risk factors, and outcomes: In LT recipients, incidence is 12.2% at 1 year, 13.4% at 5 years, and 19.5% at 10 years, and DSAs are usually directed toward class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antigens. Risk factors include female sex, longer time between transplant and DSA screening, lower total tacrolimus exposure, and purposeful lowering of immunosuppression; suboptimal immunosuppression and non-adherence increase the risk of developing de novo DSA. A meta-analysis of 15 studies reported de novo DSA with a cutoff of 3,000 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) associated with increased graft rejection (OR 6.43, 95% CI 3.17 to 13.04, p < 0.001, I² = 50%) and with graft loss and CDR (OR 3.61, 95% CI 1.94 to 6.71, p < 0.001, I² = 58%) versus recipients without de novo DSA, with poorer outcomes consistent across subgroups and sensitivity analyses. A prospective study comparing 45 matched DSA-positive to 45 DSA-negative recipients found subtle differences in inflammation and unique fibrosis patterns despite normal or near normal liver tests and led to the development of the chronic antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) score. There is no agreed upon MFI cutoff that correlates with chronic AMR, although most studies have shown correlations with AMR at MFI > 5,000; de novo or preformed C1q+ and C3d+-binding antibodies to HLA Class II antigens have also been associated with AMR, and in long-term survivors the presence of HLA and non-HLA DSA portends increased liver allograft inflammation, fibrosis, and decreased survival.

### Liver transplantation immunology: immunosuppression, rejection, and immunomodulation [^2974e798]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcomes after liver transplantation have continuously improved over the past decades, but long-term survival rates are still lower than in the general population. The liver has distinct immunological functions linked to its unique anatomical configuration and to its harbouring of a large number of cells with fundamental immunological roles. The transplanted liver can modulate the immunological system of the recipient to promote tolerance, thus offering the potential for less aggressive immunosuppression. The selection and adjustment of immunosuppressive drugs should be individualised to optimally control alloreactivity while mitigating toxicities. Routine laboratory tests are not accurate enough to make a confident diagnosis of allograft rejection. Although several promising biomarkers are being investigated, none of them is sufficiently validated for routine use; hence, liver biopsy remains necessary to guide clinical decisions. Recently, there has been an exponential increase in the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors due to the unquestionable oncological benefits they provide for many patients with advanced-stage tumours. It is expected that their use will also increase in liver transplant recipients and that this might affect the incidence of allograft rejection. Currently, the evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors in liver transplant recipients is limited and cases of severe allograft rejection have been reported. In this review, we discuss the clinical relevance of alloimmune disease, the role of minimisation/withdrawal of immunosuppression, and provide practical guidance for using checkpoint inhibitors in liver transplant recipients.

### Everolimus with reduced tacrolimus improves renal function in de novo liver transplant recipients: a randomized controlled trial [^35f7766b]. American Journal of Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) remain the mainstay of immunosuppression following liver transplantation but are associated with significant long-term complications including nephrotoxicity, which induces progressive, dose-related histological and functional renal deterioration. With more than 10% of liver transplant recipients progressing to severe chronic kidney disease by 5 years posttransplant, there is a pressing need to minimize CNI-related nephrotoxicity in the liver transplant population.

Immunosuppressants of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor class act synergistically with CNIs, offering an opportunity to lower CNI exposure. However, evidence as to whether conversion from CNI- to mTOR inhibitor-based immunosuppression improves kidney function in patients with renal insufficiency after liver transplantation is conflicting, highlighting the need for early reduction or elimination of CNI exposure before irreversible renal deterioration has developed. No randomized trial has compared early introduction of everolimus combined with reduced CNI exposure to standard CNI therapy in a de novo liver transplant population.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using everolimus to eliminate or reduce tacrolimus compared to a standard tacrolimus regimen in de novo liver transplant recipients.
