## Question

How to massage stomach to relieve gas

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to massage the stomach to relieve gas. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of gas and bloating to anchor why massage might help. Then, I should verify what direct evidence exists for abdominal massage in gas-related symptoms. Next, I will examine indirect evidence for constipation and neurogenic populations to gauge plausibility. After that, I need to check safety considerations and contraindications. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise massage technique and integrate it with broader management strategies, while noting uncertainties and when to escalate care.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: bloating and gas are common, multifactorial, and often reflect disordered motility, visceral hypersensitivity, and abnormal viscero-somatic reflexes rather than simply excess gas volume, so any mechanical intervention like massage would plausibly act by facilitating transit, modulating sensation, or altering abdominal wall tone rather than "removing gas" per se [^2a696d24] [^4bd96c18] [^29404106].

> Wait, let me verify the direct evidence for abdominal massage in gas-related symptoms. I initially thought there were robust RCTs, but hold on, I should double-check. The clearest signal comes from qualitative and survey data where people with cystic fibrosis report massage as a helpful non-medical strategy for GI symptoms including bloating, though this is low-certainty, self-reported evidence rather than controlled trials, so I need to be cautious not to overstate it [^14647db6] [^66e0f6a0] [^c5a9a49c]. I should also note that a large population survey found many women use "massage or rubbing of the abdomen" as a physical treatment for digestive discomfort, again suggesting real-world acceptability and perceived benefit, albeit with limited scientific rigor [^319f02bb].

> Next, I should review indirect evidence where massage has been studied for constipation and neurogenic bowel, since improving transit and abdominal wall mechanics could secondarily reduce gas retention and bloating. Let me consider the ESMO guidance recommending consideration of abdominal massage to reduce GI symptoms and improve bowel efficiency, particularly in patients with concomitant neurogenic problems, which supports plausibility even if not gas-specific RCTs [^aaef7618]. I will now examine the Parkinson's pilot RCT, which showed feasibility and signals of benefit for constipation with abdominal massage plus lifestyle advice, though between-group differences were not significant, underscoring the need for larger trials while suggesting acceptability and potential utility [^0b033740]. But wait, what if I'm conflating constipation relief with gas relief? The pathophysiology overlaps via motility and outlet function, so it's reasonable to extrapolate cautiously while acknowledging the evidence gap [^2a696d24].

> I need to ensure safety is addressed before recommending technique. Abdominal massage is generally safe in adults, but I should confirm exceptions. Rare but serious complications have been reported with aggressive abdominal massage in vulnerable populations, including volvulus and intramural hematoma, so I should advise gentle technique and avoid forceful deep pressure, especially in patients with known adhesions, recent surgery, severe osteoporosis, or anticoagulation, and I should note that extreme caution is warranted in preterm neonates given reported associations with volvulus, even if causality is uncertain [^abe45aca] [^5dc5e3de]. Hold on, I should verify that no major society guideline lists massage as a first-line therapy for gas; indeed, AGA updates emphasize diet, motility, neuromodulators, and biofeedback rather than massage, reinforcing that massage should be framed as adjunctive and safe-trial, not a replacement for evidence-based care [^6f633c64] [^e7d7ba23].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach, keeping it simple and safe. First, choose a comfortable, relaxed position such as supine with knees bent or seated with slight forward lean, and consider applying a warm compress or heating pad for 10–15 minutes beforehand to relax the abdominal wall and potentially reduce visceral sensitivity, which patients with CF reported as helpful for pain and bloating, though this is anecdotal and should be framed as optional [^66e0f6a0]. Next, using the fingertips or palm, apply gentle pressure in slow, clockwise circles following the path of the colon from the right lower quadrant up the ascending colon, across the transverse colon, and down the descending colon toward the left lower quadrant, repeating for 5–10 minutes, which aligns with the anatomic direction of gas and stool transit and is consistent with massage practices described in constipation studies and palliative care contexts [^0b033740] [^aaef7618]. I should confirm that pressure is light to moderate and pain-free; if discomfort arises, reduce pressure or pause, and avoid pressing directly on the xiphoid or any surgical scars or masses. Finally, integrate diaphragmatic breathing during the massage to modulate vagal tone and abdominal wall mechanics, a strategy supported for disorders of gut–brain interaction and bloating, even if the evidence base is evolving [^320bcb39] [^6f633c64].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism. I initially thought massage might directly "push gas out", but I should correct that. The more plausible benefits are via stimulation of intestinal motility, reduction of segmental pooling, modulation of visceral sensitivity, and relaxation of abdominal wall muscle tone, which together can improve tolerance to gas and reduce the sensation of bloating without necessarily changing total gas volume, consistent with observations that bloating often reflects abnormal responses to normal gas loads rather than excess gas per se [^2a696d24] [^4bd96c18] [^29404106]. Let me reconsider whether any trial measured gas volumes with massage; I don't see high-quality data showing reduced gas content with massage, which supports framing massage as symptom-modifying rather than gas-removing [^notfound].

> I should double-check how to integrate massage with broader management so patients don't rely on it in isolation. Dietary strategies such as targeted FODMAP reduction, lactose restriction if intolerant, and avoiding carbonated beverages can reduce gas production, while probiotics have limited and inconsistent benefit for bloating and are not routinely recommended for bloating or distension in current AGA updates, so I should not overpromise on probiotics [^6f633c64] [^7f3ef34a]. For persistent symptoms, evidence-based pharmacologic options include antispasmodics, prokinetics when indicated, and neuromodulators for visceral hypersensitivity, and in patients with objective distension or outlet dysfunction, biofeedback for abdominophrenic dyssynergia may be considered, all of which should be individualized and supervised by a clinician [^6f633c64] [^e7d7ba23] [^320bcb39]. If bloating is severe, progressive, or accompanied by red flags, I need to ensure appropriate evaluation for structural disease, malabsorption, SIBO, or other organic causes before attributing symptoms to functional disorders [^0ed4201f] [^1bfaf95a].

> In summary, I should confirm that abdominal massage can be offered as a low-risk, patient-directed adjunct for gas and bloating, ideally after meals or during symptomatic episodes, using gentle clockwise strokes for 5–10 minutes with optional warmth and coordinated diaphragmatic breathing, while avoiding force or pressure over tender or surgical areas, and while pursuing evidence-based evaluation and therapy for persistent or severe symptoms. The evidence base is modest and largely indirect, so I will frame it as "try it and see if it helps", monitor for benefit or harm, and escalate care if symptoms worsen or alarms arise [^319f02bb] [^aaef7618] [^6f633c64] [^0ed4201f].

Massage can relieve gas by **stimulating peristalsis** and **reducing bloating** through gentle, clockwise abdominal movements [^notfound]. The most effective technique is to lie comfortably, apply light pressure with the fingertips, and massage in slow, clockwise circles from the right lower abdomen up to the ribcage, across, and down to the left lower abdomen for 5–10 minutes. This follows the path of the colon and helps move trapped gas toward evacuation. Massage is **safe for most adults** but should be avoided after recent abdominal surgery, in severe pain, or when there is a known obstruction. It is best used alongside dietary changes, hydration, and gentle movement for optimal relief [^2a696d24].

## Physiological mechanisms of massage in relieving gas

Massage relieves gas by **targeting key physiological mechanisms**:

- **Stimulation of peristalsis**: Gentle pressure activates smooth muscle contractions, moving gas through the intestines [^notfound].

- **Reduction of abdominal tension**: Massage relaxes abdominal muscles, easing pressure and discomfort.

- **Enhancement of blood circulation**: Improved blood flow supports gut motility and reduces bloating.

## Step-by-step guide to abdominal massage for gas relief

Follow these steps for **effective abdominal massage**:

| **Step** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| 1. Preparation | - Empty the bladder <br/> - Lie comfortably on your back with knees bent <br/> - Warm your hands |
| 2. Starting position | Place fingertips 2–3 finger-widths below the navel |
| 3. Massage technique | - Apply light pressure <br/> - Move clockwise in slow, circular motions <br/> - Follow the colon: right lower abdomen → right upper abdomen → left upper abdomen → left lower abdomen |
| 4. Duration | Massage for 5–10 minutes, or until relief |
| 5. Frequency | Repeat 2–3 times daily, especially after meals |

---

## Specific massage techniques and their effectiveness

Several techniques are commonly used; **clockwise circular massage** is the most effective for gas relief, whereas **tapotement (light tapping)** may help stimulate motility but is less effective for gas. Gentle pressure with the palm or fingertips is preferred; deep pressure should be avoided.

---

## Precautions and contraindications

While generally safe, **avoid abdominal massage** in the following situations:

- Recent abdominal surgery or incisions
- Severe abdominal pain or inflammation
- Hernias or suspected obstructions
- Pregnancy (without medical guidance)
- Severe cardiovascular or renal conditions

---

## Complementary lifestyle and dietary recommendations

Massage is most effective when combined with:

- **Dietary adjustments**: Limit gas-producing foods (beans, cruciferous vegetables, carbonated drinks) [^notfound].
- **Hydration**: Drink adequate water to support digestion.
- **Physical activity**: Gentle walking or yoga aids motility.
- **Probiotics**: May reduce gas by balancing gut flora [^3be40f0b].

---

## Scientific evidence supporting abdominal massage

Direct evidence is limited; however, **clinical experience and patient reports** support its use for gas and bloating [^319f02bb]. Massage is also recommended in palliative and neurogenic constipation contexts to improve bowel function, which indirectly supports benefit for gas relief [^aaef7618] [^0b033740].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

Risks are minimal when performed correctly; **mild discomfort or temporary cramping** may occur. Stop if pain, dizziness, or nausea develops, and consult a healthcare provider if symptoms persist.

---

Massage is a **simple, non-invasive method** to relieve gas by enhancing motility and reducing bloating. Use gentle, clockwise movements for 5–10 minutes, avoid contraindicated situations, and pair with dietary and lifestyle changes for best results.

We asked HCPs and pwCF whether they felt that medications helped to relieve GI symptoms and while 94% (85/90) of HCPs thought that they did, only 58% (82/141) of lay respondents felt the same. Figure 2 shows which types of medications were reported to help the most, with the top two for HCPs being laxatives and antacid medication and the top two for lay respondents being antacid medication and pancreatic enzymes. Only half of lay respondents felt that laxatives helped to relieve symptoms. We also asked if any non-medical interventions, such as diet and exercise, helped relieve symptoms. Just under half of our lay respondents reported that symptoms were relieved by non-medical interventions (46%, 58/126). Of those respondents who answered this question, 28% (35/126) felt that diet helped and 18% (23/126) thought that exercise improved symptoms. A higher proportion of HCPs felt that a change of diet helped to relieve symptoms (52%, 46/88). Other methods used by pwCF to relieve GI symptoms included massage, heat, probiotics, keeping hydrated and avoiding triggers such as over-eating.

Thematic analysis

We identified recurrent themes during the analysis of the free text data. The themes mentioned most frequently (figure 3) focused on physical effects such as pain, discomfort and bloating, and how this impacts on everyday life.

I cannot go to work when I have stomach pain and cramps as the pain makes it impossible to concentrate, in general I get the stomach pain and cramps when I have diarrhoea so I wouldn't want to go to work as it's a shared toilet and would feel self-conscious that I was up and down from my desk to go to the toilet. It's embarassing. (pwCF, UK)

We also asked our respondents what measures they found helped control GI symptoms. Responses included medications that helped, along with non-pharmaceutical interventions such as diet, exercise and alternative therapies. A wide range of measures were reported, shown in a frequency word cloud (figure 4).

### How can we relieve gastrointestinal symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis? An international qualitative survey [^c5a9a49c]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Relieving gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms was identified as a 'top ten' priority by our James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership in cystic fibrosis (CF). We conducted an online survey to find out more about the effect of GI symptoms in CF.

Methods

We co-produced an online survey distributed to the CF community via web-based platforms. The survey consisted of open and closed questions designed to help us learn more about the effects of GI symptoms for people with CF (pwCF). We analysed the data using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. We promoted the survey via social media and web-based platforms which allowed respondents from any country to take part. Our participants came from the CF community, including: adults and children with CF, parents and close family of pwCF and healthcare professionals (HCPs) working with pwCF.

Results

There were 276 respondents: 90 (33%) pwCF, 79 (29%) family, 107 (39%) HCPs. The most commonly reported symptoms by lay respondents were stomach cramps/pain, bloating and a 'combination of symptoms'. The top three symptoms that HCPs said were reported to them were reduced appetite, bloating and constipation. Almost all (94% (85/90)) HCPs thought medications helped to relieve GI symptoms but only 58% (82/141) of lay respondents agreed.

Conclusions

Our survey has shown that GI symptoms among our participants are prevalent and intrude on daily lives of pwCF. There is a need for well-designed clinical studies to provide better evidence for management of GI symptoms and complications.

### Effect of STW 5-II (iberogast-N) on tolerance to gastric gas in patients with functional dyspepsia. the IBO-2 study [^aa80880b]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

The mechanisms by which STW 5‐II accelerates rectal gas evacuation and improves tolerance to gastric gas likely result from the combined effects of its multiple actions along the gastrointestinal tract, as demonstrated in previous studies. Human studies have shown that STW 5‐II induces relaxation of the gastric fundus and increases antral contractility. Additional in vitro studies have reported that several components of STW 5‐II decrease muscular activity in the proximal stomach while enhancing contractile activity in the antrum.

In addition to its effects on gastrointestinal motility, several studies have demonstrated that STW 5‐II reduces visceral sensitivity. In animal models, STW 5‐II was shown to reduce intestinal afferent nerve discharge in response to intravenous bradykinin, a key mediator of nociception. Thus, the combination of improved gastroduodenal motility and reduced visceral sensitivity may synergistically contribute to enhanced tolerance to gastric gas observed in patients treated with STW 5‐II. However, the specific role of each one of these putative mechanisms in the effects of STW 5‐II on gastric gas transit and tolerance cannot be elucidated from our study, and future research using a methodological approach aimed to discriminate mechanistic effects in response to gastric gas are required.

By contrast to symptom perception, no differences in objective abdominal distension were observed between patients treated with STW 5‐II and placebo. Previous studies have shown that, in patients with bloating and disorders of gut–brain interaction, abdominal distension is produced by altered abdominophrenic responses to small increments in abdominal contents, so‐called abdominophrenic dyssynergia. Our results suggest that STW 5‐II exerts its main effects on visceral sensitivity, but new studies monitoring the diaphragmatic and abdominal muscle responses are needed to evaluate its potential effects on abdominophrenic responses to gastric gas loads.

In the present study, we used a newer variant of the original STW 5 formulation, which contains only 6 of the 9 original herbal extracts. The revised formulation includes higher concentrations of licorice root and chamomile flower, as well as an extract of the fullplant. For decades, the original STW 5 — comprising nine herbs — has been widely used as an effective herbal remedy for FD and DGBI, with multiple iterations having undergone clinical testing. STW 5‐II represents a simplified version of this formulation, yet it has demonstrated significant clinical efficacy in treating FD as well.

2.6 Experimental Design

A parallel, randomized, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled study was designed to determine the effect of STW 5‐II on gastric gas tolerance. Eligible patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either STW 5‐II or identical‐appearing placebo, according to centralized automated randomization. The trial was double‐blind; neither the patients, research team, nor treating staff knew the treatment allocation. This was achieved through identical packaging, labeling, and organoleptic properties (liquid presentation, dark brown color, taste, and smell) of both the STW 5‐II and matched placebo bottles. Each bottle of STW 5‐II or placebo was identified by a kit code. Randomization lists containing kit allocation were generated by the supply company providing the kits (Steigerwald Arzneimittelwerk GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). Code‐break envelopes were also provided by the supply company, and access to the envelopes was restricted to the designated safety team.

In each participant, the gas challenge test was performed after a 2‐week intervention period with the patient on either placebo or STW 5‐II (20 drops t.i.d.). The gas challenge test was conducted with both the investigators and patients blinded to the assigned intervention. Adverse events were assessed after the intervention period before the start of the corresponding gas infusion test.

2.7 Data Analysis

In each subject, rectal gas evacuation was calculated as the sum of the gas collected from the rectal cannula during the study period. The volume of gas retained within the gut was calculated as the difference between the volume of gas infused and the volume of gas recovered. The number of belches was also calculated in each patient, following previously described criteria. Perception of abdominal sensations was assessed using the score rated on the scales at each time interval. When more than one sensation was reported at the same time point, the highest score (i.e. the most severe sensation regardless of type) was used for comparisons.

For each subject, the number of times each abdominal sensation was reported across repeated measurements during the study was counted to calculate the frequency (as percent distribution) of each specific sensation. In the anatomical questionnaire, the percentage of sensations referred to each abdominal region, as well as the percentage reported in more than one region, was calculated. This methodology has been widely used and validated in previous studies.

Changes in abdominal girth during the study were referenced to the baseline girth measurement obtained before gas infusion was initiated.

### New insights into bloating and abdominal distension: is it all outlet obstruction? [^287253f9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

The sensation of bloating, a common but poorly understood problem, is the subject of two papers in this issue. The first study showed that patients with bloating as their main complaint have delayed clearance of infused gas from the colon, while the second study showed that bloaters had impaired defecation. Together, these studies suggest that behavioral factors may be important in this important symptom complex and propose novel approaches to its treatment.

### Gastric gas dynamics in healthy humans [^521e066f]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2018). Low credibility.

Background

To cope with the daily increments of gastric gas, the stomach can propel gas to the small bowel or trigger the belching reflex. Our aim was to evaluate transit of free gastric gas in healthy humans, and its relationship with abdominal symptoms.

Methods

In 24 healthy volunteers a gas mixture was infused into the stomach at 0 mL/min (sham infusion), 25 mL/min, 50 mL/min, and 100 mL/min (n = 6 each) up to 1500 mL. Belching, rectal gas evacuation, and abdominal perception were continuously recorded for 90 min.

Key Results

Sham infusion was associated to low rectal gas evacuation (187 ± 94 mL after 90 min), and belching (0 ± 0). In contrast, gastric gas infusion increased rectal gas evacuation (1198 ± 176 mL; P = 0.025) and belching (4 ± 1 belches; P = 0.0520) without differences between the infusion rates tested. Overall, there was a negative correlation between rectal gas evacuation and belching (r = -.72; P < .0001): 6 subjects had frequent belching (14 ± 2 belches) and minor rectal gas evacuation (330 ± 112 mL), whereas 12 subjects had virtually no belches (1 ± 1 belches) and greater rectal gas evacuation (1630 ± 147 mL; P < .001 vs belchers for both). Gas infusion induced lower abdominal symptoms in belchers (score increment 0.7 ± 0.3) than in rectal gas evacuators (score increment 1.7 ± 0.5; P = 0.033).

Conclusions and Inferences

An excellent balance between belching and distal gastric empting allows the stomach to adapt to great variations in gas intake. In general, most gastric gas is emptied to distal intestinal segments, but in some circumstances gastric gas induces belching, a mechanism that may improve gas tolerance.

### Laxatives Do not improve symptoms of opioid-induced constipation: results of a patient survey [^e687f777]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Side Effects and Impact on Quality of Life

Three-quarters of patients currently taking opioids reported side effects with their use (91/122, 75%). The most common side effects were gas, bloating or fullness, and sudden urge to defecate (Table 5). Side effects were more common in younger patients: 83% of patients (19/23) younger than age 40 years reported at least one side effect, compared with 73% (69/95) older than age 40 years. The most common side effects in younger patients were gas, sudden urge to defecate, and false alarm (Table 5). There appeared to be no association between side effects and opioid strength or occupational status (data not shown).

Table 5
Side effects experienced by laxative users

Laxatives were considered to interfere "at least a little of the time" with work for 58 of the 122 patients currently taking them (48%) and with social activities for 62 (51%). Sixteen patients (13%) reported that laxatives substantially interfered with social activities; this was most commonly attributed to gas, bloating, urge/fecal incontinence, and false alarm.

Almost half of the patients (95/198, 48%) reported that they had used other interventions to help with their constipation since starting their current laxative. These included herbal remedies, massage, and use of enemas. Forty-two patients (21%) said that they removed hard or dry stools by hand. Almost half of patients who had experienced frequent constipation before starting opioids, 20 of 43 (47%), used manual evacuation methods (colon irrigation therapy, enemas, massage, and removal by hand), compared with 42 of 142 (30%) who were not previously constipated.

Health Care Contacts

Most patients (169/198, 85%) reported that they had seen either a GP or a practice nurse about their pain condition and/or constipation since starting current treatment. One hundred and eight patients (55%) reported that they had visited their GP more than five times about their pain condition. For constipation alone, the corresponding figure was 15 patients (8%). Some patients had also had health care contacts in a secondary care setting, including 39 (20%) who had required an overnight stay in the hospital (Table 6).

### Effect of STW 5-II (iberogast-N) on tolerance to gastric gas in patients with functional dyspepsia. the IBO-2 study [^5d8f4255]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

In the present study, the effect of STW 5‐II on transit and tolerance to gastric gas in patients with FD and concomitant bloating was evaluated in a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trial. These results show that STW 5‐II accelerates gastric gas evacuation in dyspeptic patients, reducing early gas retention following gastric loading. Furthermore, gastric gas produces a rise in abdominal symptoms, more frequently referred to as bloating/fullness, that are attenuated by STW 5‐II compared to placebo.

Previous studies in healthy volunteers using the same methodology of direct gas infusion into the stomach have shown that under normal physiological conditions, gas reaching the stomach is promptly emptied into distal intestinal segments and finally expelled via the rectum, producing minimal abdominal symptoms. In contrast, dyspeptic patients exhibit a transient delay in gas evacuation during the initial minutes following gastric gas infusion, and subsequent studies have shown that this delay is exacerbated when gas infusion is combined with nutrient intake, mimicking the postprandial state.

Additionally, patients with FD develop significantly more pronounced abdominal symptoms during gas infusion into the stomach, an effect associated with visceral hypersensitivity that characterizes disorders of the gut–brain axis interaction. Notably, prior studies also showed that the belching reflex is only triggered by massive gastric gas loading at high infusion rates (e.g. 400 mL/min) in healthy individuals. At physiological infusion rates, comparable to those during meals, belching increases only in patients with a belching disorder, but not in healthy controls or FD patients.

Our findings confirmed most of these previous observations. After 2 weeks on placebo, dyspeptic patients showed a delayed onset of rectal gas expulsion, preceded by transient intraluminal accumulation, a rise in abdominal perception, and measurable abdominal distension. In contrast, after 2 weeks of pre‐treatment with STW 5‐II, rectal evacuation of gas was significantly accelerated, and the increase in abdominal symptoms was consistently lower throughout the study period. Likewise, despite the fact that gas infusion induced a rapid onset of moderate‐to‐severe epigastric symptoms, no increase in belching to decompress the stomach was observed in either treatment arm, confirming that at physiological infusion rates, gastric gas is predominantly transferred to the distal intestine and eliminated rectally.

Because trapping of intraabdominal gas could affect measurements at subsequent inflations, abdominal massage was performed after each deflation to minimize such trapping.

Carbon dioxide absorption during inflation could affect the inflated volume. Tan et al. measured CO₂ absorption during pelvic laparoscopy and found a maximum absorption of 42.1 ± 5.1 ml/min. In our study, the inflation period at high flow was less than 2 min. If we assume a linear pressure-related absorption, 2 min multiplied by 40 mL and divided by 2 for average pressure gives a maximum absorption of 40 ml. Because such absorption affects measurements in all body positions, it was not taken into account in our comparisons. Carbon dioxide leak during inflation also could increase the inflated volume. Only one trocar was placed, and the measurements were performed before the operation started. We previously verified the stability of CO₂ inside the abdomen and demonstrated no significant loss to leakage or absorption over a period of 5 min when one trocar was used.

During the measurements, the abdominal wall was not touched, and no medication boluses were given. Nitric oxide was not used during the measurements to prevent volume increase by nitric oxide diffusion. At the first laparoscopic view before any measurements, correct positioning of the trocar and the gastric tube was verified. Lung ventilation was kept constant during the measurements. The depth of anesthesia was measured by entropy, and no additional anesthetic was needed during the measurements to maintain entropy below 40%. Muscle relaxation was controlled with train-of-four stimulation, and no extra doses of muscle relaxant were needed during the measurements to maintain train-of-four stimulation at zero.

Body position during surgery is dictated by the surgical approach. Upper abdominal surgery usually requires reverse Trendelenburg position, whereas lower abdominal surgery requires Trendelenburg position. The minimum insufflation volume needed for optimal performance of upper or lower abdominal surgery has not been investigated to date. Sandhu et al. compared low and standard intraabdominal pressures (without measuring the exact workspace) and found that whereas a low pressure of 7 mmHg provided adequate workspace in most patients, 2 of 70 patients (2.9%) required higher intraabdominal pressure. These authors explained the cause for this as obesity of the two patients without giving more data.

### WITHDRAWN: aromatherapy and massage for symptom relief in patients with cancer [^aa1d6601]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Aromatherapy massage is a commonly used complementary therapy, and is employed in cancer and palliative care largely to improve quality of life and reduce psychological distress.

Objectives

To investigate whether aromatherapy or massage, or both, decreases psychological morbidity, lessens symptom distress and/or improves the quality of life in patients with a diagnosis of cancer.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to May week 3 2002), CINAHL (1982 to April 2002), British Nursing Index (1994 to April 2002), EMBASE (1980 to Week 25 2002), AMED (1985 to April 2002), PsycINFO (1887 to April week 4 2002), SIGLE (1980 to March 2002), CancerLit (1975 to April 2002) and Dissertation Abstracts International (1861 to March 2002). Reference lists of relevant articles were searched for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We sought randomised controlled trials (RCTs); controlled before and after studies; and interrupted time series studies of aromatherapy or massage, or both, for patients with cancer, that measured changes in patient-reported levels of physical or psychological distress or quality of life using reliable and valid tools.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion in the review, assessed study quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted where information was unclear.

Main Results

The search strategy retrieved 1322 studies. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria and these represented eight RCTs (357 participants). The most consistently found effect of massage or aromatherapy massage was on anxiety. Four trials (207 participants) measuring anxiety detected a reduction post intervention, with benefits of 19 to 32% reported. Contradictory evidence exists as to any additional benefit on anxiety conferred by the addition of aromatherapy. The evidence for the impact of massage/aromatherapy on depression was variable. Of the three trials (120 participants) that assessed depression in cancer patients, only one found any significant differences in this symptom. Three studies (117 participants) found a reduction in pain following intervention, and two (71 participants) found a reduction in nausea. Although several of the trials measured changes in other symptoms such as fatigue, anger, hostility, communication and digestive problems, none of these assessments was replicated.

Authors' Conclusions

Massage and aromatherapy massage confer short term benefits on psychological well being, with the effect on anxiety supported by limited evidence. Effects on physical symptoms may also occur. Evidence is mixed as to whether aromatherapy enhances the effects of massage. Replication, longer follow up, and larger trials are need to accrue the necessary evidence.

### Management of chronic abdominal distension and bloating [^2a696d24]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal bloating and distension are 2 of the most commonly reported gastrointestinal symptoms. Abdominal bloating is characterized by symptoms of trapped gas, abdominal pressure, and fullness. Abdominal distension is defined as a measurable increase in abdominal girth. These symptoms frequently co-exist, although they can occur separately. Defined by Rome IV criteria, functional abdominal bloating and distension commonly coincide with other functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, and functional constipation. Abdominal bloating and distension can develop for multiple reasons, including food intolerances, a previous infection that perturbed the intestinal microbiota, disordered visceral sensation, delayed intestinal transit, or an abnormal viscero-somatic reflux. Treatment can be challenging to patients and providers-no regimen has been consistently successful. Successful treatment involves identifying the etiology, assessing severity, educating and reassuring patients, and setting expectations. Therapeutic options include dietary changes, probiotics, antibiotics, prokinetic agents, antispasmodics, neuromodulators, and biofeedback. We review the epidemiology and effects of chronic bloating and distension and pathophysiology, discuss appropriate diagnostic strategies, and assess available treatment options.

### Predictors of alternative and complementary medicine use in inflammatory bowel disease: do measures of conventional health care utilization relate to use? [^b6b305fb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Alternative and complementary therapies (ACM) have gained increasing attention in the past few years. It was our purpose to determine whether increased ACM use is associated with increased use of conventional health care resources. Additionally, demographics of use, subjective benefit, and cost were analyzed.

Methods

We enrolled 150 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients from a tertiary care center and performed a phone survey of their ACM use in the past year. A population-based administrative database was accessed to extract data regarding use of conventional medicine (hospitalizations, doctor visits, and GI specific doctor visits). Patients were divided into three groups: (i) no ACM (n = 60) (ii) users of exercise, diet, and prayer (EDP) exclusively (n = 47) (iii) other ACM use (n = 43) which included those who may have used EDP as well as any of acupuncture, chiropractic, homeopathy, naturopathy, herbology, massage, relaxation, reflexology, hypnotherapy, aromatherapy, meditation, or support group.

Results

ACM was used by 60% (EDP 31%, other ACM 29%). There were no significant differences in use between the three groups by disease diagnosis, education level, employment status, use of IBD medications, number of hospitalizations, doctor visits, or GI specific doctor visits. The EDP group was more likely to be married (p = 0.006) and female (p = 0.04) compared to no ACM. The EDP group tended to be older than the no ACM (p = 0.001) and other ACM (p = 0.01). The other ACM had shorter disease duration than EDP (p = 0.04) and no ACM (p = 0.04). The most commonly used therapies were diet (45%), herbal (17%), exercise (15%), prayer (11%), and relaxation (10%). ACM was sought for pain/cramps (64%), diarrhea (60%), and gas/bloating (21%). Seventy-three percent of EDP interventions incurred no cost compared to 33% with other ACM (p < 0.0001). The median annual amount spent on other ACM was $56 (range $0-$4800). Subjectively, patients felt helped by trials of EDP 95% of the time whereas other ACM helped 67% of the time (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

ACM use could not be predicted by either greater or less hospitalizations, conventional doctor visits, or GI specific visits. ACM was sought mostly to palliate pain or diarrhea. Those using EDP are more likely to be older married women. Subjectively other ACM is of less benefit (67%) than EDP (95%). If doctor visits or hospitalizations represent degree of increased disease activity then this too is not predictive of using ACM.

### Gas, bloating, and belching: approach to evaluation and management [^7fd0e584]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Gas, bloating, and belching are associated with a variety of conditions but are most commonly caused by functional gastrointestinal disorders. These disorders are characterized by disordered motility and visceral hypersensitivity that are often worsened by psychological distress. An organized approach to the evaluation of symptoms fosters trusting therapeutic relationships. Patients can be reliably diagnosed without exhaustive testing and can be classified as having gastric bloating, small bowel bloating, bloating with constipation, or belching disorders. Functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic idiopathic constipation are the most common causes of these disorders. For presumed functional dyspepsia, noninvasive testing for Helicobacter pylori and eradication of confirmed infection (i.e., test and treat) are more cost-effective than endoscopy. Patients with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome should be tested for celiac disease. Patients with chronic constipation should have a rectal examination to evaluate for dyssynergic defecation. Empiric therapy is a reasonable initial approach to functional gastrointestinal disorders, including acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors for functional dyspepsia, antispasmodics for irritable bowel syndrome, and osmotic laxatives and increased fiber for chronic idiopathic constipation. Nonceliac sensitivities to gluten and other food components are increasingly recognized, but highly restrictive exclusion diets have insufficient evidence to support their routine use except in confirmed celiac disease.

### Management of bloating [^ef04cbb3]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Medium credibility.

Abdominal bloating is a subjective sensation of trapped abdominal gas, producing abdominal pressure, fullness sensation, and, in some patients, associated objective abdominal distension. In this month's edition of the journal, a new validated questionnaire to assess the prevalence and impact of gas-related symptoms is presented by Duracinsky et al., showing that gas-related abdominal symptoms are prevalent in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and have a measurable impact on patients daily life. A parallel study by Gardiner et al. assessing the severity of bloating in functional gastrointestinal disorders shows that severe bloating is associated with the severity of abdominal pain, constipation, and somatization, advancing our understanding of the clinical characteristics and relevance of gas-related symptoms in the broad spectrum of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Management of bloating includes non-pharmacological and pharmacological strategies. Dietary interventions to reduce intestinal fermentation and ingestion of food supplements like prebiotics or probiotics can reduce bloating by reducing gas production. The main targets of pharmacological treatments are to improve transit and evacuation with prokinetics, to improve intestinal gas tolerance with antispasmodics and/or neuromodulators, and to modify intestinal microbiota with antibiotics. Secretagogues act by increasing intestinal secretion and decreasing visceral sensitivity and have been reported to be an effective treatment alternative for patients with bloating associated with constipation. Biofeedback therapy addressed to correct abdomino-phrenic dysynergia may be useful for patients with objective abdominal distension, and patients with bloating associated with outlet obstructed defecation may benefit from anorectal biofeedback.

### Treatments targeting putative mechanisms in irritable bowel syndrome [^55c86e75]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is heterogeneous; it is possible for several mechanisms to be disturbed in the same patient. Isolating a single target for pharmacological manipulation is also difficult because of the complexity and overlap of the neural circuitry in the enteric and central nervous system. This review summarizes the rationale and efficacy of current and future therapies for IBS, on the basis of putative pathophysiological models. The modulation of gastrointestinal sensorimotor function, intestinal gas handling, the gastrocolonic reflex, neurohormonal stress responses, central processing of afferent information, and microbial flora are the current frontiers for experimental therapeutics for IBS. Patients presumed to have POSTINFECTIOUS IBS have also been targeted as a distinct group. In the very near future, it is unlikely that a single drug will come to the fore as a suitable and successful treatment for everyone with IBS, but new data on potential therapeutic targets lend hope for the improved long-term management of IBS. Disease modification rather than just symptom-based treatments must remain the goal.

### The intestinal gas questionnaire (IGQ): psychometric validation of a new instrument for measuring gas-related symptoms and their impact on daily life among general population and irritable bowel syndrome [^80662923]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2 Study design and procedure

This study had a cross‐sectional part for all participants and a longitudinal test‐retest component for a subset of them (30%). All participants completed paper version questionnaires: IGQ, specific quality of life FDDQL, and generic health status EQ‐5D. Participants in the test‐retest component completed at first visit the IGQ in paper or electronic version and paper version of the FDDQL and the EQ‐5D. At the second visit (one week later ± 2 days), investigators checked if participants had any new medication since last visit, and participants completed IGQ in electronic or paper, the IBS‐SSS questionnaire (for IBS patients) and global Gastrointestinal (GI) Well‐Being scale in paper. The order of administration of IGQ in paper and electronic at both visits was randomized.

2.3 Measures

Six questionnaires were used for the study as follows: pilot IGQ, IBS‐SSS, SST, FDDQL, EQ‐5D, and global gastrointestinal well‐being scale. IBS‐SSS and SST were used as inclusion criteria and for known‐group validity of IGQ. FDDQL and EQ‐5D were used for convergent/divergent validity. Global GI Well‐Being scale classified participants as unchanged, worse or improved to assess test‐retest and paper‐electronic reliability among unchanged participants.

2.3.1 IGQ

IGQ results from a previous qualitative research analysis. The 43‐item pilot IGQ consists of a 24‐hour recall symptom diary assessing 7 GRS (17 items) and a 7‐day recall questionnaire which assesses the impact of those symptoms on 12 domains (26 items). The 7 GRS are as follows: abdominal distension, abdominal pressure/feeling bloated, flatulence, belching, bad breath, stomach rumbling, and difficult gas evacuation. The 12 impact domains are as follows: clothing, emotional, diet, cognitive function, physical appearance, work, sexual life, physical activity, social life, sleep, activities of daily living, and partner relationship. Answer options are 0‐10 numerical and Likert scales.

2.3.2 IBS‐SSS

IBS‐Severity Scoring System (IBS‐SSS) consists of 4 VAS measuring abdominal pain intensity and frequency during the last 10 days, bloating, dissatisfaction with bowel habit, and interference with life. The maximum score is 500, it is used to classify IBS symptoms as mild (< 75), moderate (75‐299), and severe ≥ 300.

### Effect of STW 5-II (iberogast-N) on tolerance to gastric gas in patients with functional dyspepsia. the IBO-2 study [^6a664ad3]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

An "in vitro" study by Simmen et al. demonstrated that STW 5 binds to various receptors involved in pain transmission, including serotonin, muscarinic, and opioid receptors. In this study, the authors analyzed separately the effects of the different herbal components of STW 5 and found that the fresh plant extract of, one of the main components of STW 5‐II, selectively inhibited M₃ receptor binding, while chamomile flower and licorice root extracts bound to 5HT₄ and 5HT₃ receptors, respectively.

Beyond receptor binding, components of STW 5‐II have also shown antispasmodic effects comparable to those of papaverine, which may contribute to the reduction in symptom perception reported by patients during gastric gas infusion. These experimental findings support the rationale for the observed reduction in abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients treated with STW 5, as well as the decreased bloating induced by colonic gas infusion in patients with IBS.

In the present study, we used a gas and nutrients infusion methodology that has been previously validated in studies involving healthy individuals and patients with functional dyspepsia. This methodology consists of a gas challenge test with direct infusion of gas and nutrients into the stomach. It offers the advantage of precisely controlling the amount of gas and nutrients reaching the stomach, allowing for the performance of comparative studies under controlled conditions. However, a limitation of the study is that it was performed in a non‐physiological situation, under laboratory conditions. Moreover, to properly challenge the stomach, the amount of gas infused (1500 mL) corresponds to the upper limit of what is typically ingested during a standard meal. This data is calculated from the results of previous studies showing that in a standard meal as much as 40 swallows containing gas can occur, and that each swallow may contain up to 32 mL of gas. In addition to swallowed gas, food and beverages containing different amounts of gas may also increase the volume of gas entering the stomach during a meal. However, no studies have assessed gas swallowing during meals in dyspeptic patients.

### Management of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea: a review of nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions [^a92e9138]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Loperamide and diphenoxylate/atropine

ACG guidelines currently recommend against the use of the antidiarrheal agent loperamide for overall symptom improvement in patients with IBS. Loperamide was no more effective than placebo in a pooled analysis of two RCTs (n = 42; RR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.1–1.4). In one study by Cann and colleagues, not included in the aforementioned pooled analysis, loperamide improved daily stool frequency compared with placebo after 5 weeks of treatment (1.3 versus 1.9 stools/day, respectively); however, loperamide did not improve the number of days per week that patients experienced abdominal pain compared with placebo (3.5 versus 3.4 days). Additionally, in a randomized, double-blind study of patients with acute nonspecific diarrhea (n = 493), a 2-day treatment with loperamide 2 mg alone (maximum daily dose, 8 mg) was not as effective as the combination of loperamide 2 mg and simethicone 125 mg for the relief of gas-related symptoms (e.g. pain and bloating); the median time to complete relief of gas-related abdominal discomfort was 42 h with loperamide alone and 12 h with loperamide and simethicone combined versus 48 h with placebo (p < 0.001, for loperamide and simethicone combined versus other groups). Similarly, in a subsequent randomized, double-blind study of patients with acute diarrhea (n = 483), the median time to complete relief of gas-related abdominal discomfort (e.g. pain and bloating) was significantly shorter with a 2-day treatment of loperamide 2 mg and simethicone 125 mg combination compared with loperamide 2 mg alone (maximum daily dose, 8 mg) or placebo (12 versus 24 and 23.5 h, respectively; p = 0.0001, for both comparisons). In a randomized, double-blind study of patients with IBS (n = 69), treatment with loperamide 2 mg once daily (adjusted as needed to 4 mg/day for 5 days, and up to 6 mg/day for the next 4 days) did not improve abdominal pain from baseline, or compared with placebo, after 5 weeks. In a randomized, double-blind crossover study (n = 30) that included patients with IBS-D (n = 21), the antidiarrheal agent diphenoxylate 5 mg/atropine sulfate 0.025 mg was associated with a significantly smaller percentage of solid stools compared with loperamide 2 mg or codeine 45 mg after 4 weeks of treatment (36.3% versus 67.8% and 58.4%, respectively; p < 0.01 for diphenoxylate versus loperamide and versus codeine). Further, diphenoxylate treatment was associated with significantly more AEs than loperamide treatment (p < 0.05), including central effects (i.e. depression, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea/vomiting; p < 0.01). In summary, although commonly used in clinical practice, loperamide is not effective at treating two of the most bothersome symptoms of IBS-D, namely abdominal pain and bloating. Other agents that improve multiple symptoms of IBS are preferable.

Preventive and treatment strategies

No major differences were observed between clusters in terms of their preventive strategies (Table 4). Food habits, specific food use and food avoidance remained the first strategy in all clusters and were used by 61–100% of women. Physical activity was chosen by 17–47% of women and some form of medication was used as a preventive strategy in 4–20% of women, but very few of them (2.2%) had no preventive strategy at all.

Preventive strategies adopted by people in each cluster. Results are expressed as the percentage of women selecting a given strategy in each cluster and in the whole female population. Items that are highlighted with different colours are significantly higher in the cluster than in the whole population (significance set at p < 0.05).

Treatment strategies were much more variable from one cluster to another (Table 5). Around 45–77% of women used water and food (food with fibres, yogurt, fruit) and 68–100% used physical measures (massage or rubbing of the abdomen, lying down, breathing correctly) as treatment strategies. Around 30–67% used medication and 36–55% relaxation. No treatment was used by 8.7% women (0–18% depending on the cluster). Women suffering from constipation-like symptoms used mainly food (77.3%) as a treatment, whereas of women suffering from acid reflux or burning used mainly medication (66.7% and 54.9%, respectively).

### Could kinesiology taping help mitigate pain, breathlessness and abdominal-related symptoms in cancer? [^4eca6ad8]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Outcome and follow-up

The patient presented to clinic for her second physiotherapy consultation 5 days after the initial consultation. The patient was very cheerful and reported that she was feeling markedly better with mood rated as 'moderate to high'. The patient was breathing easier and she rated reductions in breathless 'moderate to mild', abdominal bloating 'mild' and nausea 'mild'. The patient reported that she was better able to eat and drink and this made her feel more energised. She rated her energy levels as 'high'. Pain in the anterior ribcage area where the kinesiology tape had been applied was reduced. Pain in the sacral-pelvic region was unchanged and controlled by analgesic medication. The old kinesiology tape was removed from the skin and the patient treated with gentle soft tissue therapy of the lower ribs, upper right quadrant of the abdomen overlying the liver and the posterior abdomen in the region of the upper lumbar and lower thoracic vertebrae overlying the kidneys. This involved applying gentle pressure to, and stretching and massage of, underlying structures using osteopathic techniques. The aim of soft tissue therapy was to relieve pain and discomfort and improve mobility and functional activities including breathing. After this, the kinesiology tape was applied using the same technique as the first consultation.

The third consultation was a home-visit undertaken by a different physiotherapist 15 days after the second consultation. The patient had removed the tape after 8 days and reported that improvement in symptoms had been maintained between the treatment sessions. New kinesiology tape was applied using the same technique as at the first consultation.

The fourth physiotherapy consultation was a home-visit that took place 17 days after the third consultation (ie, 36 days after the initial physiotherapy consultation). The patient appeared very fatigued which was attributed to recent chemotherapy. The patient asserted that kinesiology taping had made a 'huge difference' reporting that she had experienced reductions in rib pain, nausea, bloating and breathless. On assessment, there was restricted mobility of the rib, liver, diaphragm and there was restricted posterior–anterior mobility of the quadratus lumborum. The patient was treated as previously with gentle soft tissue therapy and was taught breathing exercises. Old kinesiology tape was replaced with new kinesiology tape using the same technique as at the first physiotherapy consultation.

Background

Gas-related abdominal symptoms are common in patients with functional gut disorders, but the responses to cope with the large volumes of gas that enter daily into the stomach have not been studied in detail. Our aim was to evaluate transit and tolerance of gastric gas in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders.

Methods

In eight healthy volunteers and 24 patients with functional gut disorders (eight functional dyspepsia, eight belching disorder, and eight functional bloating) 1500 mL of a gas mixture were infused into the stomach at 25 ml/min. Belching, rectal gas evacuation, and abdominal perception were continuously recorded for 90 minutes.

Key Results

Healthy subjects expelled the infused gas per rectum (1614 ± 73 ml), with a small rise in epigastric perception (score increment 1.0 ± 0.4) and virtually no belching (1 ± 1 belches). Patients with functional dyspepsia had a hypersensitive response to gastric gas, with a significant rise in epigastric perception (score increment 2.5 ± 0.6; P = 0.045), a transient delay in rectal gas evacuation and similar belching as healthy controls. Patients with belching disorders responded to gastric gas with continuous belches (33 ± 13 belches; P = 0.002), low epigastric perception, and a small reduction in rectal gas evacuation. Patients with functional bloating exhibited a slow transit response, with reduced rectal gas evacuation (1017 ± 145 ml; P = 0.002) and abdominal symptoms (score increment 2.5 ± 0.7), but without compensatory belching.

Conclusions and Inferences

Different pathophysiological mechanisms underlay specific adaptive responses to gastric gas in patients with different functional gut disorders. Therapeutic interventions for gas-related abdominal symptoms should be addressed towards these specific pathophysiological disturbances.

### Intestinal gas and bloating: effect of prokinetic stimulation [^43af771a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

It is unknown if abdominal bloating is attributable to excess abdominal gas or improved by a prokinetic agent.

Aims

To assess abdominal gas content in functional abdominal bloating and to ascertain the effect of a prokinetic agent on intestinal gas symptoms in these patients.

Methods

In 20 patients, intra-abdominal gas content and symptoms were quantified before and during treatment with pyridostigmine (30 mg/8 hp. o) in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Daily symptoms were quantified for 5 days before and 10 days during treatment, and abdominal gas volume was quantified by CT imaging before and at the fourth day of treatment. A CT scan was also obtained in 10 healthy subjects.

Results

Before treatment, the total volume of intestinal gas was similar in patients (112 ± 18 mL) and in healthy controls (116 ± 20 mL). The treatment-induced change in total and regional intestinal gas volume was not significantly different between pyridostigmine (-4 ± 18 mL; mean ± SEM) and placebo (0 ± 15 mL). However, pyridostigmine reduced the severity of bloating from 3.3 ± 0.3 to 2.6 ± 0.4 (P < 0.05), whereas placebo did not (3.2 ± 0.3 vs 3.0 ± 0.4), although the change did not reach statistical difference across groups.

Conclusion

In patients complaining of functional bloating, the volume and distribution of intestinal gas, measured on nonselected days, is comparable to asymptomatic subjects. Prokinetic stimulation improves bloating sensation without detectable changes in gas content.

### Effect of STW 5-II (iberogast-N) on tolerance to gastric gas in patients with functional dyspepsia. the IBO-2 study [^3ce063ba]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Functional dyspepsia (FD) is one of the most common disorders of gut–brain interaction, characterized by alterations in gastric accommodation, gastric hypersensitivity, immune activation, and, in some cases, delayed gastric emptying. The main symptoms of dyspepsia encompass epigastric pain or burning sensation (typically in the epigastric pain syndrome subgroup [EPS]) and early satiety or postprandial fullness (in the postprandial distress syndrome subgroup [PDS]). In addition, up to 65% of patients with dyspepsia report gas‐related symptoms, such as abdominal bloating and abdominal distension, as bothersome complaints.

The mechanisms underlying bloating have been previously addressed in several studies but remain incompletely understood. While many patients attribute bloating to an excess of intestinal gas, several studies have shown that patients with bloating have only minor increments in abdominal gas, which by themselves do not explain the magnitude of the symptoms raised by patients. One of the mechanisms that has been largely involved in symptom development in functional dyspepsia is visceral hypersensitivity. In this regard, recent studies with direct infusion of gas into the stomach have shown that patients with functional dyspepsia develop abdominal bloating in response to gas infusion, despite minor increments in gas retention; an effect that has been linked to hypersensitivity to gastric gas. More recently, changes in gut microbiome and duodenal immune activation have also been linked to symptom development in FD.

STW 5‐II (Iberogast N) is a herbal medicinal product, composed of six different herbal extracts (bitter candy tuft, caraway fruit, licorice root, peppermint leaf, lemon balm leaf, and chamomile flower). This formulation excludes three herbs (angelica root, milk thistle fruit, and greater celandine herb) present in STW 5. As STW 5, STW 5‐II has demonstrated a beneficial effect for management of functional dyspepsia in different controlled clinical trials. These effects have been associated with the multitarget effects of this medicinal compound, which include modulation of visceral sensitivity, gastric motor responses, and gut microbiome. Therefore, the present study explored the proven effects of STW 5‐II on visceral sensitivity and gastroduodenal motility and its effect on tolerance to gastric gas, and specifically on gas‐induced abdominal bloating in patients with functional dyspepsia.

### Bloating and abdominal distension: old misconceptions and current knowledge [^0920dbe1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Bloating, as a symptom and abdominal distension, as a sign, are both common functional-type complaints and challenging to manage effectively. Individual patients may weight differently the impact of bloating and distension on their well-being. Complaints may range from chronic highly distressing pain to simply annoying and unfashionable protrusion of the abdomen. To avoid mishaps, organic bloating, and distension should always be considered first and appropriated assessed. Functional bloating and distension often present in association with other manifestations of irritable bowel syndrome or functional dyspepsia and in that context patients tend to regard them as most troublesome. A mechanism-based management bloating and distension should be ideal but elucidating key operational mechanisms in individual patients is not always feasible. Some clues may be gathered through a detailed dietary history, by assessing bowel movement frequency and stool consistency and special imaging technique to measure abdominal shape during episodes of distension. In severe, protracted cases it may be appropriate to refer the patient to a specialized center where motility, visceral sensitivity, and abdominal muscle activity in response to intraluminal stimuli may be measured. Therapeutic resources focussed upon presumed or demonstrated pathogenetic mechanism include dietary modification, microbiome modulation, promoting gas evacuation, attenuating visceral perception, and controlling abdominal wall muscle activity via biofeedback.

### The pathogenesis of bloating and visible distension in irritable bowel syndrome [^29404106]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Abdominal bloating is a relevant, troublesome, and poorly understood clinical problem. Despite its clinical importance, bloating remains substantially ignored, without proper clinical classification, known pathophysiology, and effective treatment. It is not even clear to what extent the complaints of individual patients correlate with objective evidence of abdominal distension, and this uncertainly regarding the subjective or objective origin of the complaints further adds to confusion. This article proposed a framework for investigating bloating, considering key factors potentially involved in its pathophysiology: distorted sensation, physical abdominal expansion, and abdominal wall dystony. Some data indicate that patients complaining of bloating have impaired transit and tolerance of intestinal gas loads. The problem does not seem to be too much gas, however, but rather abnormal responses to gas. Furthermore, abnormal control of abdominal muscle activity in these patients may contribute to objective distension. Bloating, like many other abdominal symptoms, probably represents a heterogeneous condition produced by a combination of pathophysiological mechanisms that differ among individual patients, resulting in a polymorphic clinical presentation.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^20f781d8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Air hunger/unsatisfied inspiration — mechanisms and modulators — is intensified by increased spontaneous ventilatory drive (hypoxia, hypercapnia, acidosis, exercise-related drive) when ventilatory response is constrained, and occurs when corollary discharge of spontaneous respiratory motor drive to the cerebral cortex is not matched by adequate ventilatory response; in contrast, increased voluntary motor drive predominantly evokes respiratory effort that in healthy volunteers is not as unpleasant as air hunger. Mechanoreceptors in the lungs, airways, and chest wall can inhibit air hunger, with pulmonary stretch receptor activation alone producing prompt relief independent of vagal influences and blood gas changes, whereas evidence that chest wall mechanoreceptor feedback provides comparable relief is equivocal. Air hunger is not specific to disease or stimulus and has been reported in quadriplegic patients with increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide, decreased tidal volume, or mechanical challenge and also in normal subjects under neuromuscular blockade; patients with asthma, COPD, interstitial lung disease, and idiopathic hyperventilation are significantly more likely than healthy control subjects to report air hunger when recalling breathing at the end of exercise, and across studies difficulty and discomfort during inspiration are greater than during expiration.

### Teenage first-time mothers' perceptions about their health care needs in the immediate and early postpartum period in Uganda [^3c82f08c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

In instances where the first-time, teenage mothers felt ill-prepared when complications arose, they were blamed on the midwives; sometimes, they were even suspected of intentionally providing no information.

Why couldn't they tell me that breastfeeding hurts at the beginning, or do they require me to pay money for that also? Imagine not giving me the necessary information I needed about taking care of the wound and enough medication, and on reaching home, I stayed for a period of less than a week, and the wound started hurting like I was being stitched afresh. I could not sit, not even telling me what to do hmmm [wiped tears from her eyes and went silent for about 5 minutes] I hate everything.

Some first-time mothers sought advice from older women who sometimes gave information based on the cultural traditions or practices, which could have been based on misconceptions about the cause of ailments. This is illustrated by an excerpt from one participant who was convinced that her baby had tummy trouble, probably colic, because the midwives did not massage her stomach while at the hospital.

I felt bad for sure, because how and why didn't they tell me how to massage the baby's stomach, if not for the old women who came around to check on me and helped me to keep massaging the baby's stomach till it went back to normal (Put on a sad face, went silent for 5mins) (Participant 7, 19 years).

### Towards a better understanding of abdominal bloating and distension in functional gastrointestinal disorders [^ccc129a3]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2005). Low credibility.

Abdominal bloating is an extremely common symptom affecting up to 96% of patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders and even 30% of the general population. To date bloating has often been viewed as being synonymous with an actual increase in abdominal girth, but recent evidence suggests that this is not necessarily the case. This review examines the relationship between the symptom of bloating and the physical sign of abdominal distension, as well as examining the epidemiology, pathophysiology and treatment options available for this debilitating aspect of the functional gastrointestinal disorders. Pathophysiological mechanisms explored include psychological factors, intestinal gas accumulation, fluid retention, food intolerance and malabsorption of sugars, weakness of abdominal musculature, and altered sensorimotor function. Treatment options are currently rather limited but include dietary changes, pharmacological approaches, probiotics and hypnotherapy.

Belching diagnosis and management (algorithm) — For excessive belching with reduced quality of life, if diagnosis is suspected perform comprehensive history and clinical observation with clinical clues distinguishing supragastric ("Frequent repetitive belching that doesn't occur during sleep, or when speaking and is reduced with distraction. It may be associated with GERD. Psychological stressors increase belching".) from gastric ("Belching occurs less frequently and with greater time gap than supragastric".). To differentiate, use "Ambulatory impedance monitoring ± high resolution manometry (HRM) (for at least 90 minutes); 24 hour impedance preferred". Supragastric belching is characterized on HRM as "upper esophageal relaxation with air flowing into esophagus then expelled orally through pharynx prior to reaching stomach", and management includes "Communicate findings to patient (psychoeducation)", "Rule out rumination disorder (HRM with impedance)", "Consider PPI therapy if related to GERD", "Gut directed behavior therapy (CBT and hypnotherapy, diaphragmatic breathing)", and "Central neuromodulators especially if psychological distress also reported". Gastric belching is linked to "Findings of air flow from esophagus into stomach and excess TRLES followed by upper esophageal sphincter relaxation", and management includes "Start PPI therapy and lifestyle modifications for reflux", "Rule out gastroparesis in subset of patients with nausea and vomiting", "Consider fundoplication if severe pathologic GERD", and " ± Baclofen if related to excess TRLES". If manometry suggests aerophagia, "Consider aerophagia if manometry shows influx of air into the esophagus with swallowing causing intestinal gas accumulation on abdominal x-rays. The main symptom is bloating, not belching", leading to "Brain–Gut Behavior Therapy".

### Social and economic burden associated with typhoid fever in kathmandu and surrounding areas: a qualitative study [^7b315234]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Prediagnosis

Household respondents reported a range of symptoms associated with typhoid fever episodes. In addition to fever, adult patients and caregivers of children and adolescents reported myalgia, headache, lethargy, sweating, poor appetite, vomiting, and stomach pain. Symptoms were often initially interpreted to be a "common cold" or a "seasonal fever". Household respondents also related the symptoms to specific behaviors such as being out in the sun or bathing in cold water.

"I thought it was a seasonal fever. He was in Kathmandu only 5 days so it may be due to the weather change… " (uncle of 16-year-old male patient)

"I use to take a bath daily in the winter as well as the summer, so she [mother] thought that I had a common cold. She took it [the fever] to be normal, but I didn't recover… " (19-year-old female patient)

Initially, all household respondents reported some form of self-treatment during the first 2–4 days after onset of fever. A majority reported use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) to relieve fever and body aches. Only 2 household respondents reported use of antibiotics prior to blood culture diagnosis and one of those respondents was a physician. One respondent reported use of "massage" for a child who was complaining of stomach pain. Decisions to seek medical advice and care were usually associated with increasing symptom severity and/or prolonged fever.

… [his] fever was more than before and he was complaining that his stomach was burning. Then we decided to take him [to the health facility]… " (parent of 2.5-year-old male patient)

"I didn't care at first [about symptoms] but then I had diarrhea… " (30-year-old female patient)

2 METHODS

2.1 Participants

Subjects from GPop and IBS patients according to Rome IV, complaining of GRS were included in the study. Two questionnaires were used for the selection of participants. First, a simple symptom screening tool (SST), which assessed the frequency of four GRS (bloating, flatulence, belching, and stomach rumbling) in the past month (from 0 = never to 5 = every day), with a global score ranging from 0 to 20. Second, the IBS‐SSS questionnairewhich measured intensity and frequency of abdominal pain, bloating/distension, dissatisfaction with bowel habit, and interference on daily life (score range: 0‐500). IBS patients had to have a score of 4 or greater for at least one symptom on the SST; and an IBS‐SSS between 75 and 300 indicating mild to moderate IBS severity. GPop subjects did not fulfill IBS Rome IV criteria, had a score of 4 or greater for at least one symptom on the SST and had a regular stool frequency (ie, 3‐21 bowel movements per week).

Exclusion criteria for all participants were as follows: (1) Recent (last 2 weeks) change in diet or intake of potentially flatulogenic compounds (fiber, lactulose); (2) Organic gastrointestinal disease; (3) Other functional gastrointestinal disorder defined by Rome IV criteria, especially functional dyspepsia; (4) Any severe and progressive disease (eg, depression, cancer, uncontrolled diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis); (5) Any severe psychiatric disorder (eg, acute episode of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder). An additional exclusion criterion for GPop subjects was any treatment for diarrhea or constipation. All participants were required to have cognitive and linguistic ability to complete several self‐administration questionnaires, and a BMI > 18.5 and < 30.0 kg/m².

Patients were offered to participate in the study by their attending physicians in 3 centers (Wythenshawe Hospital, Neurogastroenterology Unit, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; University Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Digestive System Research Unit, Barcelona, Spain; AP‐HP, Louis‐Mourier Hospital, Gastroenterology Department, France). Participants from the GPop were recruited by public advertisement in the medical centers and by proxy.

### Methods for decreasing postoperative gut dysmotility [^3690b26d]. The Lancet: Oncology (2003). Medium credibility.

Postoperative disturbances of gastrointestinal function (postoperative ileus) are among the most significant side-effects of abdominal surgery for cancer. Without specific treatment, major abdominal surgery causes a predictable gastrointestinal dysfunction which endures for 4–5 days and results in an average hospital stay of 7–8 days. Ileus occurs because of initially absent and subsequently abnormal motor function of the stomach, small bowel, and colon. This disruption results in delayed transit of gastrointestinal content, intolerance of food, and gas retention. The aetiology of ileus is multifactorial, and includes autonomic neural dysfunction, inflammatory mediators, narcotics, gastrointestinal hormone disruptions, and anaesthetics. In the past, treatment has consisted of nasogastric suction, intravenous fluids, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and observation. Currently, the most effective treatment is a multimodal approach. Median stays of 2–3 days after removal of all or part of the colon (colectomy) are now achievable. Recent discoveries have the potential to significantly reduce postoperative ileus in patients with cancer who have had abdominal surgery.

Psychosocial factors and conditioning in belching — The biopsychosocial history should attend to psychosocial triggering factors, including anxiety, life events, and conditioned responses to stressors of physical symptoms. Notably, supragastric belching stops during sleep, distraction, or when the patient speaks, supporting that psychological factors modulate its occurrence and frequency and that it may be responsive to brain–gut behavioral therapies (BGBTs), such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Belching may be conditioned to reduce the bloating sensation via air release, thereby reducing gastric wall tension. Supragastric belching is less common in children than gastric belching when a GERD association is present.

Theme 2: Postpartum practices

Participants discussed various practices at home. These included personal hygiene, keeping their homes clean, sitting on hot water, taking prescribed medications, abdominal massage, and eating hot foods. Most women described postpartum practices related to healing and recovery, and breastmilk-related practices.

For postpartum healing and recovery, participants discussed taking medications, eating hot foods, sitting on hot water to expel blood from the womb, laceration care, and personal hygiene. Most women believe that there is a wound in the uterus after giving birth, and certain practices can help to heal the wound for recovery. These practices include eating hot foods, drinking hot liquids, sitting on hot water (often with substances added to the water), and massaging the uterus with hot water. The following are some quotes from participants on healing and recovery.

"Take your medications and squat on the hot water to regain your health". (Participant 3, Bagabaga < 6mo)

"Massaging your stomach or abdomen with hot water will help the wounds to heal fast". (Participant 4, Bagabaga 6mo +)

"As the woman just gave birth like that, it is hot food (TZ) they will give her but not cold food in order to help your wound heal fast". (Participant 1, Bagabaga, 6mo +)

There were various practices for increasing breastmilk production. These included massaging the breast with some mixture and drinking certain fluids or foods to produce more milk. A few women who struggled with breastmilk production fed their babies with warm water mixed with shea butter.

"They will also give you hot 'kanwa koko' (sodium bicarbonate porridge) to drink so that you will produce breast milk for the baby". (Participant 6, Kanvili < 6mo)

"After I delivered, I didn't have breast milk and even up till today I still don't have breast milk, so they will mix warm water with shear butter and feed the child". (Participant 7, Kalpohin < 6mo)

Abdominophrenic dyssynergia (APD) — pathophysiology and clinical features: APD is a "paradoxical viscerosomatic reflex response" characterized by a compensatory pattern in which "the diaphragm paradoxically contracts (goes down), and the anterior abdominal wall muscles relax, leading to increased abdominal girth". Computed tomography (CT) scans "demonstrate the APD response even with small increases in intraluminal gas (approximately 10%)", and, in contrast to severe intestinal dysmotility, patients there "do not exhibit an APD pattern". For many patients, "the APD distention occurs during or immediately after a meal".

### AGA clinical practice update on evaluation and management of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention: expert review [^d296f3bb]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Treatment of belching — clinicians should first communicate the definition and pathophysiology of gastric and supragastric belching to the patient to establish an understanding and to implement collaborative treatment. Impedance monitoring has helped educate patients, similar to biofeedback therapy for pelvic floor disorders, by objectively demonstrating their physical symptoms as the first step toward treatment when belching is a behavioral disorder and not a consequence of reflux. In belching disorder due to supragastric belching, the reflux episodes are typically nonacidic, which may explain the lack of response to proton pump inhibitors. Recent studies suggested that supragastric belching before reflux activity does not respond to proton pump inhibitor therapy, but supragastric belching after the reflux episodes does. The most effective suggested treatment for supragastric belching has been behavioral strategies, which include helping the patient become aware of the reasons for their symptoms. Diaphragmatic breathing (see video: https://romedross.video/3azBfEE) increases vagal tone, inducing relaxation and reducing stress response, and is a treatment option for supragastric belching. In addition, belching associated with GERD symptoms improves when diaphragmatic breathing is combined with proton pump inhibitor therapy. Similarly, CBT reduces supragastric belching episodes and esophageal acid exposure, improving QOL.

Massage therapy (MT) has been widely used for many different indications in children and adults.
Several studies report its efficacy, but adverse events (AEs) of massage therapy are poorly investigated.

What this study adds?

A range of AEs are associated with MT use, from mild to severe.
There is an association between abdominal MT in preterm neonates and volvulus without malrotation, but the causality of this association is yet to be determined.
Until further data are identified, extreme caution on the use of abdominal massage in preterm neonates is warranted.

Treatment of Gastrointestinal Dysfunction

New Conclusions

A total of 3 new studies 12, 39, 40 were included for the treatment of gastrointestinal dysfunction in PD, and trials not fulfilling the inclusion criteria for review were excluded. 53, 56, 105 See Table 8 for recommendations.

Based on a low‐quality, positive trial, 12 lubiprostone is considered " likely efficacious" and " possibly useful" for the treatment of constipation in PD. There were no safety concerns. There is, however, a lack of safety data of lubiprostone in PD patients, but because of the data available in the general and geriatric population, 106, 107 lubiprostone is considered to pose an " acceptable risk without specialized monitoring". Typical AEs of lubiprostone include nausea, diarrhea, and dyspnea. 106, 107

Probiotics and prebiotic fiber were evaluated in 1 high‐quality, positive study. 40 The new conclusions are " efficacious " and " clinically useful". There are no safety concerns, and given their wide availability and over‐the‐counter use in many countries, probiotics and prebiotic fiber are considered to pose an " acceptable risk without specialized monitoring".

Abdominal massages with lifestyle advice versus lifestyle advice alone were evaluated in 1 low‐quality, negative RCT. 39 Because there were significant signals in both arms, the conclusions are " insufficient evidence " and " investigational". Although abdominal massages should not have AEs, 108 there have been rare reports of potentially fatal complications with abdominal massages for the treatment of constipation in non‐PD patients such as volvulus, small bowel intramural hematoma, or peripheral embolization. 105, 109, 110 Safety was not assessed in this study; therefore, there is " insufficient evidence" to conclude on the safety of abdominal massage in PD.

### Abdominal bloating [^4bd96c18]. Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Abdominal bloating is a common and significant clinical problem that remains to be scientifically addressed. Bloating is one of the most bothersome complaints in patients with various functional gut disorders. However, in the current standard classification, abdominal bloating is merely regarded as a secondary descriptor, which masks its real clinical effect. Four factors are involved in the pathophysiology of bloating: a subjective sensation of abdominal bloating, objective abdominal distention, volume of intra-abdominal contents, and muscular activity of the abdominal wall. The primer to elicit subjective bloating may be any of the other 3 factors, or the sensation may be related to distorted perception. All of these mechanisms may play an independent role or may be interrelated. Gas transit studies have evidenced that patients with bloating have impaired reflex control of gut handling of contents. Segmental pooling, either of gas or of solid/liquid components, may induce a bloating sensation, particularly in patients with altered gut perception. Furthermore, altered viscerosomatic reflexes may contribute to abdominal wall protrusion and objective distention, even without major intra-abdominal volume increment. Bloating probably is a heterogeneous condition produced by a combination of pathophysiological mechanisms that differ among individual patients and that in most cases are subtle and undetectable by conventional methods. Further advances in the pathophysiology and clinical forms of bloating are warranted to develop mechanistic strategies rather than the current empiric treatment strategies for comprehensive and effective management of this problem.

### Acupuncture for symptomatic gastroparesis [^3535972c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Gastroparesis, a state of delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction of the stomach, has a substantial impact on people's daily function and quality of life when symptomatic. Current treatment options are based on limited evidence of benefits. Acupuncture is widely used to manage gastrointestinal disorders, although its role in people with symptomatic gastroparesis is unclear. We therefore undertook a systematic review of the evidence.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of acupuncture, in comparison with no treatment, sham acupuncture, conventional medicine, standard care, or other non-pharmacological active interventions for symptom management in people with gastroparesis.

Search Methods

On 26 March 2018, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, AMED, Korean medical databases (including Korean Studies Information, DBPIA, Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, Research Information Centre for Health Database, KoreaMed, and the National Assembly Library), and Chinese databases (including the China Academic Journal). We also searched two clinical trials registries for ongoing trials. We imposed no language limitations.

Selection Criteria

We selected all randomised controlled trials comparing the penetrating type of acupuncture with no treatment, sham acupuncture, conventional medicine, standard care, and other non-pharmacological active interventions for people with symptomatic gastroparesis of any aetiology (i.e. surgical, diabetic, or idiopathic). Trials reporting outcomes at least four weeks from baseline (short-term outcomes) were eligible. We defined long-term outcomes as those measured after 12 weeks from baseline. The primary outcome was improvement of gastroparesis symptoms in the short term. Secondary outcomes were: improvement of symptoms measured after three months, change in the rate of gastric emptying, quality of life, use of medication, and adverse events in the short and long term.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected eligible trials based on predefined selection criteria. Two review authors independently extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. The review authors contacted investigators to obtain missing information wherever possible.

Main Results

We included 32 studies that involved a total of 2601 participants. Acupuncture was either manually stimulated (24 studies) or electrically stimulated (8 studies). The aetiology of gastroparesis was diabetes (31 studies) or surgery (1 study). All studies provided data on the proportion of people with symptoms 'improved', although the definition or categorisation of improvement varied among the studies. Most measured only short-term outcomes (28 studies), and only one study employed validated instruments to assess subjective changes in symptoms or reported data on quality of life or the use of medication. Reporting of harm was incomplete; minor adverse events were reported in only seven trials. Most studies had unclear risk of bias in terms of allocation concealment (29/32), outcome assessor blinding (31/32) and selective reporting (31/32), as well as high risk of bias in terms of participant/personnel blinding (31/32). Acupuncture was compared with sham acupuncture (needling on non-acupuncture points), three different types of gastrokinetic drugs (domperidone, mosapride, cisapride), and a histamine H₂ receptor antagonist (cimetidine). There was low-certainty evidence that symptom scores of participants receiving acupuncture did not differ from those of participants receiving sham acupuncture at three months when measured by a validated scale. There was very low-certainty evidence that a greater proportion of participants receiving acupuncture had 'improved' symptoms in the short term compared to participants who received gastrokinetic medication (4 to 12 weeks) (12 studies; 963 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.33, I² = 8%). Short-term improvement in overall symptom scores favouring acupuncture was also reported in five studies with considerable heterogeneity. Acupuncture in combination with other treatments, including gastrokinetics, non-gastrokinetics and routine care, was compared with the same treatment alone. There was very low-certainty evidence in favour of acupuncture for the proportion of participants with 'improved' symptoms in the short term (4 to 12 weeks) (17 studies; 1404 participants; RR 1.22; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.28; I² = 0%). Short-term improvement in overall symptom scores, favouring acupuncture, were also reported (two studies, 132 participants; MD -1.96, 95% CI -2.42 to -1.50; I² = 0%). Seven studies described adverse events, including minor bleeding and hematoma, dizziness, xerostomia, loose stool, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, skin rash and fatigue. The rest of the trials did not report whether adverse events occurred. Subgroup analyses revealed that short-term benefits in terms of the proportion of people with 'improved' symptoms did not differ according to the type of acupuncture stimulation (i.e. manual or electrical). The sensitivity analysis revealed that use of a valid method of random sequence generation, and the use of objective measurements of gastric emptying, did not alter the overall effect estimate in terms of the proportion of people with 'improved' symptoms. The asymmetric funnel plot suggests small study effects and publication bias towards positive reporting.

Authors' Conclusions

There is very low-certainty evidence for a short-term benefit with acupuncture alone or acupuncture combined with gastrokinetic drugs compared with the drug alone, in terms of the proportion of people who experienced improvement in diabetic gastroparesis. There is evidence of publication bias and a positive bias of small study effects. The reported benefits should be interpreted with great caution because of the unclear overall risk of bias, unvalidated measurements of change in subjective symptoms, publication bias and small study reporting bias, and lack of data on long-term outcomes; the effects reported in this review may therefore differ significantly from the true effect. One sham-controlled trial provided low-certainty evidence of no difference between real and sham acupuncture in terms of short-term symptom improvement in diabetic gastroparesis, when measured by a validated scale. No studies reported changes in quality of life or the use of medication. Due to the absence of data, no conclusion can be made regarding effects of acupuncture on gastroparesis of other aetiologies. Reports of harm have remained largely incomplete, precluding assessments of the safety of acupuncture in this population. Future research should focus on reducing the sources of bias in the trial design as well as transparent reporting. Harms of interventions should be explicitly reported.

Neonatal resuscitation — clearing the airway in newborn infants: Suctioning of the mouth and nose can be considered in newborn infants if ventilation is required and the airway appears obstructed (2a C-EO); intubation and tracheal suction can be beneficial for newborn infants who have evidence of tracheal obstruction during ventilation (2a C-EO); and routine oral, nasal, oropharyngeal, or endotracheal suctioning of newborn infants is not recommended, regardless of whether the fluid is clear or meconium stained (3: No Benefit B-R). Suctioning is reserved for when there is evidence of airway obstruction during ventilation, and if at initial assessment there is visible fluid obstructing the airway or a concern about obstructed breathing, the mouth and nose may be suctioned, noting that the practice of suctioning may delay assisted ventilation. Regardless of the presence of meconium, when ventilation corrective steps do not lead to an increase in heart rate or to chest rise, endotracheal suctioning may help to relieve an obstruction, and there is no evidence or consensus to support the use of deep suctioning of the stomach. Evidence summaries report that a meta-analysis of 7 RCTs found no benefit from routine upper airway suctioning after birth in infants born through clear amniotic fluid; two RCTs and 2 prospective observational studies found lower oxygen saturations in infants who received suctioning within the first 10 minutes, while 2 RCTs did not find significant differences; a meta-analysis of 4 RCTs found no benefit of endotracheal suction for infants born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid; and a large quality improvement trial found decreased exposure to oxygen in the delivery room (12.4% versus 4.4%) when avoiding suction prior to spontaneous breathing and wiping the mouth with a towel.

### Prokinetic effects in patients with intestinal gas retention [^c0ca8388]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

We have previously shown that patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have impaired transit of intestinal gas loads. Because abnormal gas retention can be experimentally reproduced in healthy subjects by pharmacological inhibition of gut motility, we hypothesized that impaired gas transit and retention can be reciprocally corrected by pharmacologically stimulating intestinal propulsion.

Methods

In 28 patients with abdominal bloating (14 IBS, 14 functional bloating) and in 14 healthy subjects, gas evacuation and perception of jejunal gas infusion (12 mL/min) were measured. After 2 hours, in 20 patients we tested the effect of intravenous neostigmine (0.5 mg) vs. intravenous saline administered blindly and randomly at a 1-hour interval.

Results

After 2 hours of gas infusion, patients with IBS and functional bloating alike exhibited significant gas retention (418 ± 86 mL), abdominal symptoms (2.7 ± 0.5 score), and objective distention (8 ± 2 mm girth increment), in contrast to healthy controls, who experienced none (46 ± 102 mL retention, 0.4 ± 0.3 symptom score, and 3 ± 1 mm distention; P < 0.05 for all). Neostigmine produced immediate clearance of gas retained within the gut (603 ± 53 mL/30 minutes vs. 273 ± 59 mL/30 minutes after saline; P < 0.05) and by 1 hour reduced gas retention (by 373 ± 57 mL), abdominal symptoms (by 1.1 ± 0.5 score), and distention (by 6 ± 1 mm; P < 0.05 for all), whereas intravenous saline produced no effects.

Conclusions

In patients with intestinal gas retention, pharmacological stimulation of intestinal propulsion improves gas transit, abdominal symptoms, and distention.

### AGA clinical practice update on evaluation and management of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention: expert review [^0ed4201f]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic testing and imaging for bloating and distention — testing is selective and guided by alarm features and examination. "Symptoms of bloating and distention do not routinely require laboratory testing or obtaining radiologic imaging or endoscopy unless the history discloses concerning symptoms, an abdominal physical examination, or alarm features". The authors "advise ordering tests with worsening dyspepsia or abdominal pain, particularly of recent onset; vomiting; GI bleeding; unintentional weight loss > 10% of body weight; chronic diarrhea; or a family history of GI malignancy, CD, or inflammatory bowel disease". If visible abdominal distension is present, "an abdominal examination will help to evaluate for an abdominal mass", and with abnormal findings, "Any abnormalities would lead to a computed tomography scan or ultrasound of the abdomen to evaluate for ascites or a mass or to identify increased bowel gas due to ileus, obstruction, or pseudo-obstruction". The text adds, "Bloating and abdominal fullness are often presenting symptoms in patients with ovarian cancer; the highest risk is in women 50 years or older".

### Physiologic and pathologic belching [^d28b2d46]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Accumulation of air in the stomach increases gastric volume, which activates receptors in the gastric wall. A reflex is initiated, leading to relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, upward movement of the air through the esophagus, and finally passage through the upper esophageal sphincter, during which an audible belch can sometimes be heard. Excessive belching is often reported in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease and functional dyspepsia. Often other symptoms are predominant, and these should be treated first. Sometimes patients present with excessive belching as an isolated symptom. These patients belch in very high frequencies, up to 20 times per minute, and often during consultation. This condition is referred to as aerophagia. In these patients air is sucked into the esophagus or injected by pharyngeal contraction, after which it is expelled immediately. Aerophagia is a behavioral disorder, and behavioral therapy and/or speech therapy seems to be the therapy of choice.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^db2bce79]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Regular exercise and lifestyle changes, like avoiding certain foods that may trigger symptoms, will be helpful for some patients. However, these is no evidence for any specialised diets for treating FD and restricting diet too much could lead to malnutrition or abnormal eating habits.

All patients with FD should be offered a stool test or breath test to look for a stomach infection called H. pylori. If the test is positive, they should receive a short course of antibiotic treatment for the infection to see if their symptoms improve. Patients who test negative, or patients who test positive, but whose symptoms continue after antibiotics, should be offered other medications to treat their symptoms.

This guideline has reviewed the evidence for which medications work, and the possible harms they may cause. We have only recommended medications with good evidence that they are more efficacious than a placebo. We have not recommended tests or treatments where the evidence is that they do not help, are harmful, or where there is not enough evidence. Some medications have most of their effect in the gut, often working to reduce stomach acid or helping the stomach to empty more quickly. Other drugs work at the level of the brain and the nervous system also present in the upper gut. These are so-called 'neuromodulators', and they help reduce the abnormal sensitivity of these nerves. Unfortunately, not all drugs that may be efficacious in FD are available in all countries.

There is some evidence to suggest that psychological or behavioural therapies may be beneficial for treating symptoms in FD. These therapies use the fact our brain and upper gut nerves are connected and can influence each other. With appropriate training our brain can help control the sensations from our upper gut. Work is needed to improve the availability of these treatments for patients.

Very severe symptoms that do not respond to any of the treatments discussed above are rare. In this situation, it is recommended that patients are managed by a multidisciplinary team of specialists, including GPs, dietitians, gastroenterologists and psychologists. This should help to ensure that patients have access to high-quality, expert, advice based on up-to-date research, while reducing harm from unnecessary investigations and procedures, or harmful drugs.

Our knowledge of the causes and treatment of FD has improved over the past 20 years. However, there are still things that we do not fully understand about the condition. This means that there are many active areas for future research and new treatments to be explored. We hope that this guideline will also help to highlight and prioritise these issues.

### Protocol for a randomised controlled trial of a decision aid for the management of pain in labour and childbirth [^ad31035b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic methods of pain relief in labour and childbirth

Randomised controlled trials have shown epidural analgesia provides the most efficacious pain relief for labour, but the adverse consequences include prolonged labour, restricted mobility, use of oxytocin augmentation and an increased incidence of instrumental delivery. Consequences of instrumental delivery at 6 months postpartum include perineal pain 54%, urinary incontinence 18%, bowel problems 19%, haemorrhoids 36% and sexual problems 39%. Further, the complications of epidurals can include unsatisfactory analgesia, dural-puncture headache, hypotension, nausea/vomiting, fever, localised backache, shivering, pruritis and urinary retention.

Although not as effective as epidural, randomised trials show inhalational analgesia (e.g. 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen) and systemic opioid analgesics (e.g. pethidine) can provide modest benefit to some patients during labour or supplement an unsatisfactory epidural. Both these methods can cause nausea, vomiting and dizziness, and additionally opioid side-effects may include orthostatic hypotension, delayed stomach emptying and respiratory depression in the baby.

Non-pharmacologic methods of pain relief in labour and childbirth

A number of women prefer to avoid pharmacological analgesia if possible. The wish to maintain personal control during labour and birth, the desire to participate fully in the experience, and concerns about untoward effects of medications during labour, are among the factors that influence their attitude. Non-pharmacological methods of pain relief include maternal movement and position changes, superficial heat and cold, immersion in water*, massage, acupuncture/acupressure, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)*, aromatherapy, attention focussing, hypnosis*, music/audioanalgesia* and continuous caregiver support*. Only a few of these methods (marked*) have been assessed in randomised trials. Only continuous caregiver support resulted in reduced analgesia requirements (and length of labour and the incidence of operative delivery). Although the other interventions trialled did not reduce the use of pharmacologic analgesia, they were well liked by women and had few side effects.

### Pancreatic enzymes clinical care guidelines [^4ba31009]. CFF (2006). Medium credibility.

Signs of maldigestion and malabsorption in people with cystic fibrosis include poor weight gain despite a good appetite, frequent loose and/or large bowel movements, foul-smelling bowel movements, mucus or oil in the bowel movement, excessive gas and/or stomach pain, and distention or bloating. Persons with CF who have not yet started taking enzymes may have any or all of the symptoms listed above, and improvement is generally noted once enzymes are started; sometimes, people with CF who already take enzymes experience these symptoms and this may suggest that the dose or type of enzymes may need to be adjusted. Do not increase or decrease the dose of enzymes without talking to your CF dietitian or care provider, and always give the prescribed dose of enzymes. Enzymes are essential in the care of CF. Talk with your CF dietitian or care provider if taking enzymes has become a problem.

2.2 Gas Transit Test

2.2.1 Gastric Gas Infusion

We used a polyvinyl tube assembly (3.2 mm outer diameter [OD]), that incorporated a gas infusion channel (1.6 mm inner diameter [ID]) with a distal opening positioned in the stomach. Gas was continuously infused at a rate of 100 mL/min for 15 min (1500 mL final volume) using a volumetric pump (GIP‐3000 Infusion Pump, Solfer Solucions SL, Barcelona, Spain). The gas mixture infused was comprised of 88% nitrogen, 6.5% carbon dioxide, and 5.5% oxygen, mimicking the partial pressures of venous blood gases to minimize diffusion across the intestine‐blood barrier.

2.2.2 Nutrients Infusion

To emulate a standard meal, 315 kcal of a nutrient mixture (Fresubin YoDrink 1.5 kcal/mL; Fresenius Kabi, Barcelona, Spain) was continuously perfused at 14 mL/min for 15 min (210 mL final volume) into the stomach via a 1.2 mm ID perfusion channel incorporated into the nasogastric tube assembly, with the distal port located at the same level as the gas infusion site and connected to a volumetric pump (Alaris GH Guardrails Plus; BD Switzerland Sàrl. Eysins, Switzerland).

2.2.3 Measurement of Rectal Gas Evacuation

Rectal gas evacuation was collected via an intrarectal Foley catheter (20 French, Bard, Barcelona, Spain) with the balloon inflated with 5 mL of water. The catheter was connected to a leak‐proof, low‐resistance collection line using a barostat, and the volume was continuously recorded on a personal computer for 90 min.

2.2.4 Measurement of Gastric Belching

Gastric belching was continuously recorded using a pH‐impedance device (Z/pH Recorder, Diversatek, Highlands Ranch, CO). The pH‐impedance catheter was introduced transnasally into the stomach (drop of pH below 4), and then slowly withdrawn in 1‐cm steps to position the pH sensor 5 cm above the point at which the pH rises above 4 (esophageal pH). Belches were continuously recorded during the 90‐min study period.

### Comparison of effect of massage or chicory bath on bilirubin levels in term newborns undergoing phototherapy: a randomized clinical trial [^9c566fc4]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Massage is a type of therapy to stimulate the organ system for better function. Field massage method on infants focuses on stimulating the chest and abdomen, which can also improve the activity of the digestive organs and the swallowing process of infants, increasing the body's metabolic system in a way that the toxins in the body are easily excreted through feces and urine.

In addition, medicinal plants have also attracted attention for reducing hyperbilirubinemia. Chicory sweat, also known as Grysis, has been used to treat neonatal jaundice for a long time. Chicory has different species, of which three are known: berry chicory, known as tansy, which does not grow in Iran. Yellow chicory, namely dandelion, which was used in most parts of the country in the past, and common chicory. Chicory is a perennial plant with blue or purple flowers, which is originally native to the Old World and was later introduced to the Americas as a wild plant by the roadside. The origin of chicory is Central Europe, Western and Central Asia and North Africa, and it is widely distributed in different parts of Iran, especially in the cities of Eqlid, Azerbaijan and mountainous regions of Khorasan. Several studies have evaluated the effect of common chicory on serum indirect bilirubin levels in infants. Chicory sweat is a stomach tonic, purgative, choleretic, and hepatotonic, which lowers blood pressure. A range of biological activities including antidiabetic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and/or immunomodulatory effects have also been reported with the consumption of chicory leaves, roots, seeds and sweats. This herbal medicine is able to accelerate bilirubin excretion due to its high content of flavonoids (such as apigenin, cortisone luteolin). A randomized, single-blind clinical trial evaluated the effect of maternal chicory consumption on the severity of neonatal jaundice. The study results showed that chicory consumption by healthy pregnant women did not have a significant effect on reducing serum bilirubin in their infants. However, evaluation of serum bilirubin in hyperbilirubinemic infants after chicory baths before and 24 h after phototherapy showed that chicory baths reduced the severity of neonatal jaundice.

### Probiotics and functional abdominal bloating [^3be40f0b]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Functional abdominal bloating is a condition dominated by a feeling of abdominal fullness or bloating and without sufficient criteria for another functional gastrointestinal disorder. The currently used therapeutic approaches aim to reduce the volume of intestinal gas, thus increasing intestinal gas elimination or reducing its production. Some promising results have been obtained by the use of prokinetics, such as tegaserod and Prostigmine, and by the use of nonabsorbable antibiotics, such as rifaximin. Another therapeutic approach is represented by the administration of probiotics to modify the composition of colonic flora and thus the production of intestinal gas. The authors recently studied the effect of LGG, which proved to be more effective than placebo in reducing the severity of symptoms.

Abdominophrenic dyssynergia (APD) — therapeutic approaches and evidence: The authors note that "central neuromodulators reduce abdominal distention by reducing the bloating sensation, thereby reducing the triggering mechanism for the APD", although "This does not seem to work well when the bloating is constant or unrelated to meals". "Biofeedback therapy for APD using electromyography of muscle activity (diaphragm and intercostal muscles) has been proposed, with a benefit reported in 2 studies by 1 group", but "Additional studies by other investigators are needed to confirm this benefit and determine its applicability". "Diaphragmatic breathing, which reduces vagal tone and sympathetic activity, may be used to treat APD", and in IBS "slow deep breathing intervention leads to improvements in autonomic response assessed by exercise heart rate recovery and heart rate variability", though "Still, more data are needed, although expert consensus from brain–gut behavioral therapists and neurogastroenterologists report improvement in patient symptoms, and this method is inexpensive and safe".

### Drug survival of drugs recommended for irritable bowel syndrome: a retrospective observational study [^56da9912]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Although TCAs did not demonstrate statistically significant superiority in drug survival rates compared to bulking agents, they exhibit the highest cumulative drug survival rates at 12, 24, and 60 months. These rates were statistically significantly higher compared to bulking agents. This finding aligns with the recently published ATLANTIS study, a large randomized controlled trial comparing low‐dose amitriptyline to placebo as a second‐line treatment for IBS in primary care. The ATLANTIS study reported that amitriptyline outperformed placebo in relieving global IBS symptoms at 6 months and was well‐received by patients in terms of safety and tolerability. This is further corroborated by other studies confirming the efficacy of TCA in the treatment of IBS.

Interestingly, silicones such as simethicone exhibited both significantly higher drug survival and cumulative drug survival rates at 12‐, 24‐, and 60‐months post‐initiation compared to bulking agents. The literature on the effectiveness of silicones in IBS treatment is sparse, with most studies focusing on the combination therapy with simethicone and various antispasmodic agents. A systematic review and meta‐analysis conducted in 2012 revealed that the addition of simethicone improved the effectiveness of the antispasmodic agents. However, a randomized, double‐blind, controlled trial investigating loperamide and simethicone in the treatment of acute diarrhea with gas‐related abdominal discomfort found that simethicone alone did not alleviate gas‐related symptom relief. Nevertheless, when combined with loperamide, simethicone reduced gas‐related abdominal discomfort by almost 50% compared to the placebo. This may help explain the higher drug survival rates observed for silicones in our study, potentially due to their increased effectiveness when used in combination with other medications. Additionally, their favorable safety profile, characterized by minimal side effects, could contribute to their continued use. However, further research is needed to better understand the role of silicones in IBS treatment.

### ACG clinical guideline: small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [^1bfaf95a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

SIBO symptoms and symptom-based diagnostic limitations — Evidence suggests that abdominal pain, bloating, gas, distension, flatulence, and diarrhea are the most common symptoms reported in patients with SIBO, with severe cases sometimes showing vitamin B12, vitamin D, and iron deficiencies that are usually subtle or undetectable. However, in one study that compared symptom burden, Jacobs et al. compared 38 subjects with culture-positive SIBO to 74 subjects with culture-negative SIBO and reported no difference in the intensity, frequency, and duration of abdominal pain or in bloating, fullness, belching, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gas. Therefore, close attention should be paid not only to a patient's symptom profile but also to risk factors for SIBO and any history of previous attempts to treat other underlying conditions, when evaluating SIBO as a possible diagnosis in a patient presenting with unexplained abdominal pain, gas, bloating, diarrhea, and/or malabsorptive symptoms.

### Disrupted breath, songlines of breathlessness: an interdisciplinary response [^5e809930]. Medical Humanities (2019). Medium credibility.

It's the same with your breathing. You can't exercise your brain — or how can you? You can do a puzzle or something like that to keep it in working order. But if you — if I stop breathing now, I'm dead. And there is no conscious effort. It's, it's, er, my brain is controlling my breathing, making me breathe. I'm not making a, er, a conscious effort of using muscle to work or, or effort. I suppose I am…

Right 'when exercising, my breathing requires muscle effort or work', I don't think it does, it just (mimics) 'gasps, gasps', is that me? My muscles working or my brain telling my lungs to start working, but that's not muscle effort, well I don't think so anyway (sighs), to me my lungs haven't got any muscles, have they? Your diaphragm, if you breathe in, deeply from your tummy up, that pushes your lungs up and empties your lungs and then back down again, but that's your diaphragm working, not your lungs working isn't it… My breathing requires intense (clears throat) — I'm not getting nothing, my chest feels constricted, my, er — I am breathing a lot, yeah, I could say 10 (on the questionnaire) to every one of them (items) if I'm exercising. But if I'm sat here now, it doesn't take any effort to breathe. So I, I could do two sheets of that, one when I'm exercising and one when I'm not. No, I mean if I put resting there, (coughs) reading, I could put no effort at all, it, it just happens. Um, I mean a little child when he's freshly born, he doesn't make any specific effort to breathe. I mean it's a natural thing to breathe. I mean.

### The intestinal gas questionnaire (IGQ): psychometric validation of a new instrument for measuring gas-related symptoms and their impact on daily life among general population and irritable bowel syndrome [^7b6a7d40]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Medium credibility.

The reliability of IGQ over time and the equivalence of the electronic and paper versions is supported by the high ICC values that are over the recommended threshold.

According to ROME IV criteria, functional abdominal bloating and distension (FABD) is now defined as a subjective feeling of increased abdominal fullness/pressure associated or not with a measurable increase in abdominal girth defined as distension. We acknowledge that our study did not confirm the subjective perception of GRS in general and particularly abdominal distension by an objective marker. Indeed, several studies have suggested different underlying mechanisms for feeling bloated vs. objective abdominal distension. However, the techniques used to quantify the distension such as CT scan are not part of routine and would have not been appropriate or feasible in our study. Moreover, the correlation between intra‐abdominal gas contents and bloating perception is repeatedly reported as poor. Only in IBS‐C does the severity of abdominal bloating seem to correlate with the degree of abdominal distension, suggesting that the pathophysiology is likely to be different between subtypes of bowel habit.

During the test‐retest, and while subjects were globally considered to be unchanged on the GI Well‐Being scale at the second visit compared to the first, the ICC did not reach 0.80 for some of the IGQ dimension scores (ie, flatulence, stomach rumbling, and difficult gas evacuation). One explanation is that the day‐to‐day fluctuation of these GRS can be affected by even very small changes in the dietand the large intra‐ and inter‐variability among subjects. A shorter interval between the two completions, such as one day, would possibly have yielded higher correlation levels for these highly fluctuating symptoms. However, ICC of global score is high at 0.85, and a shorter interval than 7 days would have been inconsistent with the 7‐day recall period used for capturing the impact of symptoms on daily life.

### Food passageway-related sequelae in the refluxStop prospective multicenter trial: patient-centric outcomes of dysphagia, odynophagia, gas-bloating, and inability to belch and / or vomit at 5 years [^bc0b43cb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Inability to belch and/or vomit

RefluxStop did not induce the inability to belch and/or vomit in any patient in this study, a side effect very common in standard-of-care surgery (i.e. 39.8% at 5 years in a systematic literature review on Nissen fundoplication). Thus, the complete preservation of the belching/emetic process after RefluxStop surgery, a presupposing factor in gas-bloat syndrome and impactful function for quality of life on its own, helps minimize abdominal bloating as shown by the results discussed above.

The belching process begins with distension of the cardia that induces transient LES relaxation, allowing for air to escape into the esophagus and equalization of gastric-esophageal pressures. The inability to belch/vomit after anti-reflux surgery seems to be closely related to bloating and flatulence and is purportedly due to insufficient LES relaxation. Considering that its manifestation after anti-reflux surgery is common, without returning over time, the utility of minimizing the structural impact on the LES should be emphasized. For instance, the level of LES augmentation that results in the inability to belch and/or vomit is similarly implicated in gas-bloating, with partial fundoplication seeming to provide more relief from such sequelae as compared to total (360°) fundoplication. More specifically, the mechanism behind this following fundoplication appears directly linked to LES function and its relaxation capacity after normal stimulation. Nissen fundoplication is thought to overcorrect mechanical deficiencies in the gastroesophageal junction at the LES, also resulting in an overly competent gastric cardia, that may incur subclinical obstruction of bolus passage at the level of fundoplication. Treatment that mitigates effects on the LES and the passage of boluses may improve preservation of the belching/emetic process.

### Effect of iberogast (STW5) on tolerance to colonic gas in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo control clinical trial [^8a31f289]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

STW5 is an herbal medicinal product that, in previous studies, reduced abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The effect of STW5 on gas-related abdominal symptoms is unknown.

Aim

To determine the effects of STW5, compared to placebo, on the responses to colonic gas in IBS.

Methods

Using a cross-over design, two gas challenge tests were performed in 10 patients with IBS and bloating after 2-weeks treatment with (a) STW5 and (b) placebo. The challenge test consisted in continuous infusion of gas into the colon (24mL/min for 60min), followed by a 30-min free evacuation period. Gas evacuation, symptom perception, and abdominal distension were continuously registered.

Results

Colonic gas filling was associated to a significant rise in abdominal symptom perception, that was significantly greater when patients were on-placebo (score increment 4.0 ± 0.3) compared with on-STW5 (score increment 3.2 ± 0.4; p = 0.035). Gas filling was associated to a progressive abdominal distension that was similar with both treatments. Opening of the rectal cannula produced a massive gas evacuation, similar after both treatments, associated to a return of abdominal perception and distension to basal levels when patients were on-STW5 (score increment -0.1 ± 0.4; distension 0.3 ± 0.2cm; p = 0.399, and p = 0.112 vs. basal), whereas both remained increased on-placebo (score increment 0.5 ± 0.3; distension 0.8 ± 0.3cm; p = 0.048, and p = 0.016 vs. infusion start).

Conclusions

STW5 improves colonic gas tolerance in IBS patients with bloating without a significant effect on gas retention and evacuation. This medicinal product can be beneficious for treatment of gas-related abdominal symptoms in patients with bloating. EudraCT: 2019-003976-38.

### Acupuncture for gastrointestinal disorders: myth or magic [^43810a80]. Gut (2002). Low credibility.

For thousands of years, Chinese medicine and conventional Western medicine appeared to be two unrelated and uncompromising paradigms. The history of acupuncture can be traced back for more than 2500 years but today we can use advanced technology to understand ancient healing methods. Acupuncture should not be used to compete with efficacious treatment modalities that are already available in conventional Western medicine. Exploration of its clinical applications should focus on conditions for which conventional medicine can find no satisfactory remedy.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^eff190b5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Air hunger/unsatisfied inspiration — mechanism and induction — reflects a perception of not getting enough air that can be induced experimentally by increasing inspiratory drive (for example with exercise, hypercapnia, or hypoxia), particularly when the capacity to satisfy ventilatory demand is limited; as ventilatory demand exceeds capacity, an imbalance develops between motor drive to breathe (corollary discharge) and afferent feedback from mechanoreceptors, which becomes increasingly unpleasant and distressing, and multiple labels have been used for this imbalance without fully capturing the neurophysiological interplay.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^3b058c18]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Cyanide exposure — patient safety considerations advise wearing appropriate PPE during rescue of multiple casualties, managing off‑gassing risk after ingestion, avoiding nitrites when carbon monoxide poisoning is suspected, and selecting pregnancy-safe antidote therapy. In the event of multiple casualties, be sure to wear appropriate PPE during rescue evacuation from the toxic environment. If the patient ingests cyanide, it will react with the acids in the stomach generating hydrogen cyanide gas; maximize air circulation in closed spaces as gastric contents may release hydrogen cyanide gases with vomiting or belching. Do not use nitrites in conjunction with suspected carbon monoxide poisoning as it worsens the hemoglobin oxygen carrying capacity, and hydroxocobalamin is only agent safe for treatment of cyanide poisoning in pregnant patients.

### Abdominal massage for the alleviation of symptoms of constipation in people with parkinson' s: a randomised controlled pilot study [^0b033740]. Age and Ageing (2016). Low credibility.

Background

constipation is one of the most common non-motor features of Parkinson's affecting up to 90% of patients. In severe cases, it can lead to hospitalisation and is usually managed with laxatives which in themselves can lead to side effects. Abdominal massage has been used as adjunct in the management of constipation in various populations, but not in those with Parkinson's.

Objective

the primary objective was to test the recruitment, retention and the appropriateness of the intervention methods and outcome measures.

Methods

thirty-two patients with Parkinson's were recruited from three movement disorder clinics and were randomised to receive either 6 weeks of daily abdominal massage plus lifestyle advice on managing constipation (Intervention Group, n = 16) or lifestyle advice (Control Group, n = 16). Data were collected prior to group allocation (Baseline), at Week 6 (following intervention) and 4 weeks later (Week 10). Outcome tools included the Gastrointestinal Rating Scale and a bowel diary.

Results

constipation has a negative impact on quality of life. The study recruited to target, retention was high and adherence to the study processes was good. The massage was undertaken as recommended during the 6 weeks of intervention with 50% continuing with the massage at 10 weeks. Participants in both groups demonstrated an improvement in symptoms, although this was not significantly different between the groups.

Conclusion

abdominal massage, as an adjunct to management of constipation, offers an acceptable and potentially beneficial intervention to patients with Parkinson's.

### Potential control of gastroesophageal reflux by local modulation of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations [^408a0bc7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) are neurally mediated abrupt reductions in lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure. TLESRs are not usually associated with deglutition or secondary peristalsis but are thought to be necessary for venting swallowed air from the stomach. Their central role in acid reflux, however, makes them a compelling therapeutic target for patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Pharmacologic approaches for reducing TLESR frequency are being studied, but theoretically more promising are endoscopic approaches that interfere with mechanoreceptor function. Further study into the mechanisms of action of these approaches is needed, as are controlled clinical trials to define the true utility of these techniques and identify patients who will receive the most benefit.

### Oxymorphone hydrochloride (Opana er) [^18418610]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may cause serious problems when taken with OPANA ER, especially if they cause sleepiness (like sleeping pills, anxiety medicines, antihistamines, or tranquilizers).

Do not take any new medicines while using OPANA ER until you have talked to your healthcare provider or pharmacist and they have told you it is safe.

Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your healthcare provider and pharmacist.

How Should I Take OPANA ER?

Follow your healthcare provider's directions exactly. Your healthcare provider may change your dose based on your reactions to the medicine. Do not change your dose unless your healthcare provider tells you to change it. Do not take OPANA ER more often than prescribed.
Swallow OPANA ER tablets whole. Do not break, crush, dissolve, or chew OPANA ER tablets before swallowing. If a tablet is broken, crushed, dissolved, or chewed, the full 12 hour dose can be taken into your body all at once. This is very dangerous. You could die from an overdose of the medicine. If you cannot swallow tablets whole, tell your healthcare provider. You may need a different medicine.
Take OPANA ER every 12 hours or as instructed by your healthcare provider. OPANA ER should be taken on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or two hours after meals. Talk to your healthcare provider if you feel sick taking OPANA ER on an empty stomach.
If you miss a dose, take it as soon as possible. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not take 2 doses at once unless your healthcare provider tells you to. If you are not sure about your dosing call your healthcare provider.
If you take too much OPANA ER or overdose, call your local emergency number or poison control center right away.
Talk to your healthcare provider often about your pain. Your healthcare provider can decide if you still need OPANA ER.
If you have side effects that bother you or if you continue to have pain, call your healthcare provider.
Stopping OPANA ER. If your healthcare provider decides you no longer need OPANA ER, ask how to slowly reduce the dose of your medicine so you don't get uncomfortable (withdrawal) symptoms such as nausea, sweating, and pain. You should not stop taking OPANA ER all at once if you have been taking it for more than a few days without talking to your healthcare provider. OPANA ER can cause physical dependence. You can get sick with withdrawal symptoms if you stop OPANA ER all at once, because your body has become use to it.

### Potential diaphragm muscle weakness-related dyspnea persists 2 years after COVID-19 and could Be improved by inspiratory muscle training: results of an observational and an interventional clinical trial [^d912282f]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

IMT Study

All 18 participants completed IMT from October 2022 to May 2023 and underwent the 6-week follow-up assessment. Four individuals declined study measurements at 6 weeks after terminating IMT but consented to answer the questionnaires. Overall, participants completed 85% and 88% of IMT sessions in the treatment and sham arms, respectively; 91% of all weekly appointments were attended in both arms. In the treatment arm (but not in the sham arm), IMT-related resistance, load, and power significantly increased from pretraining to the end of training (Figure 3 and Tables 2 and E4). No harms or unintended effects occurred in either group.

### Efficacy and tolerability of α-galactosidase in treating gas-related symptoms in children: a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial [^22e17a48]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Bloating and distension together with belching, aerophagia and flatulence, have been attributed to excessive intestinal gas accumulation, impaired handling of gas in the small intestine, impaired clearance from the proximal colon, psychological factors, altered gut microflora, incomplete digestion and malabsorption of carbohydrates.

We did not investigate the dietary habits of children before and during our study. Parents were instructed to continue with their usual diet over the study period in order to avoid any possible impact from a change of diet to the study results. According to clinical history and parents' opinion, the symptoms were apparently related to meals: a fact which is also demonstrated by the bloating severity score which was lowest at the time of waking up and steadily increased during the day.

There are different strategies that may reduce intestinal gas including active charcoal, simethicone etc. Recently, the use of antibiotics seems to provide significant relief of functional GI symptoms, bloating and abdominal pain, but the need for repeated treatment cycles may have an important impact on the intestinal bacterial flora, especially in children.

In recent years, an alternative approach, based on the administration of α -galactosidase, an enzyme with amylase-like activity, seems to be effective in reducing the production of intestinal gas by breaking down non digestible oligosaccharides (NDO) before they reach the lower intestine. Indeed, the human intestine does not contain the enzyme required to digest NDO and their consequent incomplete digestion produces increased bacterial fermentation generating hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide.

Our results show that in children with predominant gas-related symptoms, the administration of α -galactosidase significantly reduces global distress, bloating and flatulence compared to placebo, but does not significantly reduce other symptoms such as abdominal distension and spasms which generally occur in functional gastrointestinal disorder. However this is consistent with the mechanism of action of α -galactosidase. The reduced formation of gas by colonic bacteria may have been expected to have other beneficial effects on distension of colon segments and abdomen.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional heartburn: expert review [^b30ff9a6]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Alternative and complementary medicine — acupuncture in heartburn patients: In one small sample study of 30 heartburn patients with partial response to standard-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) randomized to add-on acupuncture or double-dose PPI, 10 acupuncture sessions over 4 weeks provided a significant decrease in the mean daytime heartburn, night-time heartburn, and acid regurgitation scores compared with those receiving double-dose PPI. Mean general health score was significantly improved only in those receiving acupuncture, although it was unclear what proportion of participants had functional heartburn.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^4594b463]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Cyanide exposure — key considerations emphasize that pulse oximetry accurately reflects serum levels of oxygen but does not accurately reflect tissue oxygen levels therefore should not be relied upon in possible cyanide and/or carbon monoxide toxicity. After hydroxocobalamin has been administered, pulse oximetry levels are no longer accurate and skin, tears, and urine will all turn red, and this flushing should not be interpreted as an allergic reaction. If the patient ingests cyanide, it will react with the acids in the stomach generating hydrogen cyanide gas, and clinicians should be sure to maximize air circulation in closed spaces (ambulance) as the patient's gastric contents may contain hydrogen cyanide gases when released with vomiting or belching. Amyl nitrite and sodium nitrite are no longer being used and no longer available in commercial kits.

### Nasogastric-tube decompression facilitates the pocket-creation method of gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection [^edcf6329]. Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3

This method has other advantages. Keeping the stomach at low pressure by removing gas seems to be less stressful for patients, which may allow sedation to be more effective. In addition, maintaining the stomach at low pressure may prevent Mallory–Weiss syndrome and vagal reflexes associated with hyperextension of the gastric wall. Even if an intraprocedural perforation occurs, leakage of air into the abdominal cavity can be minimized. In situations when the stomach is too collapsed to continue ESD, this can be solved by just clamping the tube with Pean forceps.

In conclusion, the nasogastric tube decompression technique facilitates gastric ESD using the PCM.

### Complementary and alternative medicine for gastroparesis [^c8c52b56]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Complementary and alternative medicine is of great interest to patients with gastrointestinal disorders and some will choose to ask their health care providers about those therapies for which some scientific evidence exists. This review focuses on those therapies most commonly used by patients, namely acupuncture/electroacupuncture and various herbal formulations that have been the focus of clinical and laboratory investigation. A discussion of their possible mechanisms of action and the results of clinical studies are summarized.
