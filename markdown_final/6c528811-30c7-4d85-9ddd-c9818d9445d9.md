## Question

Diagnosis of dress syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to diagnose DRESS syndrome, preserving the thinking process and self-verification cues throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and timing relative to drug exposure. Then, I should verify the core clinical features and how they map to diagnostic criteria. Next, I will review laboratory and ancillary tests, including viral reactivation and skin testing. After that, I should apply validated diagnostic criteria and consider severity stratification. Finally, I will differentiate DRESS from mimics, identify the culprit drug, and outline immediate actions and follow-up, while double-checking areas of uncertainty and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and timing, because DRESS typically begins 2 to 8 weeks after starting a new medication, though latency can be shorter with certain agents or in special populations, and I need to ensure I anchor the timeline to the most plausible culprit drug rather than assuming the most recent exposure is the trigger [^1141bUfg] [^115TrEdN]. Wait, let me verify the high-risk agents I should prioritize: aromatic anticonvulsants, allopurinol, sulfonamides, vancomycin, and targeted therapies like BRAF inhibitors and checkpoint inhibitors are repeatedly implicated, and I should keep these front-of-mind while I construct the timeline and differential [^115o48E4] [^115J5Mki] [^1114h719] [^112SZiE3].

> Next, I should review the core clinical features and make sure I do not miss the classic triad of fever, rash, and internal organ involvement, while remembering that eosinophilia and atypical lymphocytes support the diagnosis but are not universal at onset [^1141bUfg]. Hold on, I should verify the rash morphology and distribution: a morbilliform eruption with facial edema and cephalocaudal spread is typical, and facial edema is a useful clinical clue that raises suspicion for DRESS rather than a simple maculopapular drug eruption [^115TrEdN] [^115o48E4]. I need to check for lymphadenopathy, which is common and carries diagnostic weight in RegiSCAR, and I should confirm that fever is persistent and not fleeting, as transient fever weakens the case for DRESS [^116u13WK] [^1141bUfg].

> I will now examine the laboratory abnormalities, and I should double-check that eosinophilia is present or evolving, because while eosinophilia is a hallmark, it can be delayed or even absent early, which can mislead clinicians if they anchor on early normal counts [^115huwnU]. Let me consider liver involvement carefully, since hepatitis is the most frequent organ manifestation and ALT elevations beyond about twice the upper limit of normal strengthen the diagnosis; I should also remember that a hepatitic pattern is more typical than a cholestatic one in DRESS [^115o48E4] [^117CH72v]. I need to check renal function and urinalysis for interstitial nephritis, and I should review the CBC for leukocytosis or leukopenia and atypical lymphocytes, which, when present, add points in RegiSCAR and reflect immune activation [^1141bUfg] [^117CH72v].

> But wait, what if the patient has atypical organ involvement; I should confirm whether pulmonary, cardiac, or gastrointestinal disease is present, because although less common, these can dominate the presentation and worsen prognosis, and I must not dismiss respiratory failure or myocarditis as unrelated if the clinical picture fits DRESS [^112fvjJY] [^114pU9hU]. Hold on, I should verify that these atypical features still fit the broader DRESS framework by ensuring a compatible drug timeline, rash, and supportive labs before labeling the case as DRESS with severe organ involvement [^1141bUfg].

> Next, I should review viral reactivation testing, and I need to ensure I do not overinterpret early negative results; HHV-6, EBV, and CMV reactivation often occur 2 to 4 weeks after rash onset, so early testing can be falsely negative, and I should repeat or time PCR appropriately if suspicion remains high [^117CH72v]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought reactivation might help with early diagnosis, but I should correct that assumption: US data suggest reactivation is uncommon at presentation and should not be relied upon for early diagnostic confirmation, though it may support the diagnosis later and correlate with severity in some cohorts [^117CH72v].

> I will now apply validated diagnostic criteria, and I should double-check that I am using RegiSCAR consistently, since it is the most widely adopted tool and assigns points across clinical, hematologic, cutaneous, and visceral domains to classify cases as possible, probable, or definite DRESS [^1141bUfg]. Let me verify the thresholds: a score of 4 to 5 is probable and 6 or more is definite, and I should confirm that I am not missing negative points for fever absence or biopsy that could lower the total inadvertently [^116u13WK]. I should also consider Bocquet's original criteria, which require rash, eosinophilia or atypical lymphocytes, and internal organ involvement, and I should remember that Japanese criteria incorporate HHV-6 reactivation, which can be helpful in the right clinical window but is not necessary for RegiSCAR classification [^114VjPZx] [^117CH72v].

> Hold on, I should verify severity assessment because it guides therapy and monitoring; the Delphi consensus supports a pragmatic severity grading based on liver, kidney, and hematologic involvement, and I need to ensure I document the extent of organ damage and the need for systemic therapy rather than relying solely on RegiSCAR points, which do not directly measure severity [^116JxAVH]. Let me reconsider whether a high RegiSCAR score implies severity; it reflects diagnostic certainty, not necessarily severity, so I should explicitly grade severity by organ dysfunction metrics to avoid conflating the two [^116JxAVH].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis and actively exclude mimics, because infections, autoimmune diseases, and other SCARs can overlap with DRESS features and delay appropriate management if I do not rule them out systematically [^111L3Jgj]. I need to check for SJS/TEN when there is mucosal involvement or epidermal detachment, for AGEP when there are sterile pustules, and for vasculitis or hypereosinophilic syndromes when eosinophilia is extreme or persistent, adjusting my workup with ANCA, bone marrow evaluation, or infectious serologies as indicated [^111L3Jgj] [^114cSFbi]. Wait, let me verify that I am not anchoring on a single organ abnormality; DRESS is multiorgan by definition, so isolated hepatitis or isolated rash with eosinophilia should prompt me to reconsider the diagnosis or look for alternative explanations [^1141bUfg].

> I will now examine drug causality, and I should confirm that I am identifying the most plausible culprit using temporal association, drug notoriety, and improvement after withdrawal, while acknowledging that many patients are on multiple agents and that some culprits have atypical latency profiles, such as vancomycin in renal failure or early-onset reactions with BRAF inhibitors [^115J5Mki] [^1114h719]. Hold on, I should verify whether specialized testing can help; patch testing and intradermal testing can be considered 6 months after resolution and off corticosteroids, but sensitivity is variable and protocols are heterogeneous, so I should interpret results cautiously and in context [^116QvNun] [^1128R7MA]. Let me also consider the lymphocyte transformation test in the recovery phase, where sensitivity and specificity appear better than in the acute phase, especially for anticonvulsants and anti-TB drugs, though availability and standardization remain limited [^112WoKuR].

> I need to ensure I do not overlook pediatric nuances; children can have shorter latencies, especially with antibiotics, and they may present with features overlapping viral illnesses or Kawasaki disease, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion and use RegiSCAR rigorously while avoiding premature closure [^111gDBSg] [^112Y8HWt]. Let me double-check that facial edema and lymphadenopathy are still useful discriminators in pediatrics, as they are in adults, and that early drug withdrawal remains the cornerstone of therapy even when the presentation is atypical [^111gDBSg].

> I should confirm immediate actions once DRESS is suspected: stop all nonessential medications, with priority to the most likely culprit, and avoid rechallenge given the risk of rapid deterioration; if the culprit is an antiepileptic, I need to plan a safe taper or bridge strategy to prevent seizures while urgently initiating treatment and monitoring [^116JxAVH] [^116JBiAR]. Hold on, I should verify that supportive care, infection risk mitigation, and organ-specific management are in place, and I should involve dermatology, hepatology, nephrology, pulmonology, or cardiology early based on organ involvement to coordinate care and surveillance [^116JxAVH].

> Finally, I need to ensure long-term planning is addressed, because DRESS carries risks of relapse during steroid taper and late autoimmune sequelae; I should arrange close follow-up for several months, document the culprit and structurally related drugs clearly in the medical record and allergy systems, and consider specialist drug allergy evaluation to guide future therapy and avoid inadvertent re-exposure [^116JxAVH] [^114RGm6z]. Let me reconsider whether to pursue viral monitoring in convalescence; although not universally required, documenting resolution of abnormal viral loads can be informative in selected cases and may correlate with clinical improvement in some cohorts [^notfound].

DRESS diagnosis relies on a **clinical-laboratory approach** using the RegiSCAR scoring system, which requires a compatible drug exposure, a morbilliform rash, fever, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia or atypical lymphocytes, and internal organ involvement (commonly liver, kidney, or lung) [^114VjPZx] [^117CH72v]. Diagnosis is **supported by the RegiSCAR score** (≥ 4 = probable; ≥ 6 = definite) and by excluding infections, autoimmune diseases, and other SCARs such as SJS/TEN and AGEP [^116u13WK] [^111L3Jgj] [^11467nut]. Viral reactivation (HHV-6, EBV, CMV) may occur but is not required for diagnosis [^111Xsqc5] [^117CH72v]. Early recognition and prompt withdrawal of the culprit drug are critical, with a mortality of 5–10% if untreated [^116rDw2m] [^115o48E4].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and scoring systems

Several diagnostic criteria have been developed to standardize the diagnosis of DRESS:

| **Criterion** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| RegiSCAR criteria | - Acute rash <br/> - Fever ≥ 38°C <br/> - Lymphadenopathy <br/> - Internal organ involvement <br/> - Hematologic abnormalities (eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes) [^114VjPZx] |
| Bocquet criteria | - Cutaneous eruption <br/> - Hematologic abnormalities (eosinophilia or atypical lymphocytes) <br/> - Internal organ involvement [^112qbRFh] |
| Japanese DIHS criteria | Similar to RegiSCAR but includes HHV-6 reactivation as a key feature [^114VjPZx] |

---

The **RegiSCAR scoring system** is the most widely used and assigns points based on clinical and laboratory features, categorizing cases as definite, probable, possible, or excluded [^1141bUfg] [^114VjPZx].

---

## Clinical features and laboratory findings

DRESS typically presents with the following **clinical and laboratory features**:

- **Rash**: Morbilliform or exanthematous eruption, often progressing to erythroderma or exfoliative dermatitis [^1128o2YM].
- **Fever**: Persistent fever ≥ 38°C [^1141bUfg].
- **Lymphadenopathy**: Generalized lymphadenopathy is common [^116u13WK].
- **Hematologic abnormalities**: Eosinophilia (> 700/µL), atypical lymphocytes, leukocytosis or leukopenia [^117CH72v].
- **Internal organ involvement**: Hepatitis (most common), nephritis, interstitial pneumonitis, myocarditis, pancreatitis, or neurologic involvement [^117CH72v].

---

## Laboratory tests and imaging studies

Laboratory tests and imaging studies are essential to confirm the diagnosis and assess organ involvement:

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes, leukocytosis or leukopenia [^117CH72v].
- **Liver function tests (LFTs)**: Elevated ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, bilirubin [^1138u3UL].
- **Renal function tests**: Elevated creatinine, BUN, proteinuria, hematuria [^1138u3UL].
- **Viral serology**: HHV-6, EBV, CMV PCR or serology (optional, not required) [^117CH72v].
- **Imaging studies**: Chest X-ray or CT for pulmonary involvement, echocardiography for myocarditis, abdominal ultrasound for hepatosplenomegaly [^112fvjJY].

---

## Differential diagnosis

DRESS must be differentiated from other severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) and systemic conditions, including:

- **Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN)**: Mucosal involvement, epidermal necrosis, different clinical course [^116A8R6u].
- **Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP)**: Rapid onset of sterile pustules, different histopathology [^1145SQTN].
- **Systemic infections**: Sepsis, viral infections (e.g. mononucleosis, HIV) [^1141bUfg].
- **Autoimmune diseases**: Systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, hypereosinophilic syndrome [^111L3Jgj].

---

## Role of viral reactivation

Viral reactivation, particularly HHV-6, EBV, and CMV, is frequently observed in DRESS and may correlate with disease severity. However, **viral reactivation is not a prerequisite** for diagnosis and is not included in the RegiSCAR criteria [^117CH72v] [^113c7VGD].

---

## Diagnostic challenges and pitfalls

- **Delayed onset**: Symptoms typically appear 2–8 weeks after drug initiation, leading to diagnostic delays [^116u13WK].
- **Atypical presentations**: Pulmonary, cardiac, or neurologic involvement without classic skin findings [^1136UFKv].
- **Overlap with other SCARs**: Clinical and histopathological overlap with SJS/TEN and AGEP [^1133xXA9].
- **Lack of standardized diagnostic tests**: No definitive laboratory test or biomarker exists, necessitating clinical judgment and exclusion of other causes [^115mRAJg].

---

## Importance of early recognition and drug withdrawal

Early recognition and immediate withdrawal of the culprit drug are critical to prevent severe organ damage and reduce mortality. Delayed diagnosis and continued exposure to the offending drug significantly increase the risk of complications and death [^1141bUfg].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies depending on the severity of organ involvement and timeliness of intervention. Complications include chronic hepatitis, renal failure, autoimmune diseases, and relapses upon re-exposure to the culprit drug [^111Xsqc5]. Mortality is **approximately 5–10%**, primarily due to liver failure, renal failure, or severe infections [^115o48E4].

---

DRESS diagnosis is a **clinical-laboratory synthesis** anchored by RegiSCAR, requiring drug exposure, rash, fever, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia or atypical lymphocytes, and organ involvement, while excluding infections, autoimmune diseases, and other SCARs. Viral reactivation can occur but is not required. Early recognition and prompt drug withdrawal are essential to reduce mortality and complications.

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, represents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge due to its varied, evolving clinical presentation, complex pathophysiology, and potential for severe systemic involvement. This article explores DRESS syndrome through 3 illustrative cases from diverse populations and with different background comorbidities. Cases highlight different challenges in DRESS care, including (1) the need for early diagnosis and severity scoring, (2) identification of offending drugs and risk stratification to consider a possible drug challenge, and (3) best practice management including long-term monitoring for emergent autoimmunity. Recent developments in our understanding of clinical spectrum of disease, genomic and nongenomic biomarkers, severity groupings, and pharmacological and longer-term management strategies are described. Critical gaps remain in several of these domains, particularly in vulnerable groups such as the immune-compromised. In the absence of robust evidence, we aim in this article to assist attending clinicians with current expert opinion in DRESS management. Finally, we highlight areas for further research needed to improve the clinical care and outcomes of DRESS.

DRESS syndrome is a cutaneous and systemic drug reaction with severe complications and a long course that can be fatal. Recognition may be difficult, and the condition is just rare enough that clinicians will eventually see it but may not be familiar with it. This review will focus on key elements to help clinicians with the challenges of recognition and differential diagnosis.

### DRESS syndrome: part II. management and therapeutics [^116rDw2m]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The appropriate management of the drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is paramount because it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This syndrome shares clinical features with other dermatologic conditions, including other severe cutaneous drug reactions, requiring the clinician to carefully examine the proposed criteria to make the appropriate diagnosis. Once the diagnosis of DRESS syndrome has been established, the next step in management is immediate cessation of the causative medication(s). In cases in which the culprit drug is not obvious, clinicians must use their clinical judgment to select which medication to discontinue. They may also utilize patch or lymphocyte transformation tests to aid in identification when appropriate. Topical corticosteroids can be used for symptomatic relief, but systemic steroid therapy is generally required. Other immunosuppressants have also been employed in treatment and show promise in future therapy. Patients with DRESS syndrome should be managed in an intensive care or burn unit for appropriate care and infection control. In addition, appropriate specialists should be consulted based on the affected organ systems. Most patients recover completely after drug withdrawal and appropriate therapy. However, some patients with DRESS syndrome suffer from chronic complications and approximately 10% die, primarily from visceral organ compromise. Controlled clinical trials investigating the most appropriate therapies and their risks, particularly intravenous corticosteroids, are lacking, and would be invaluable in determining the optimal future treatment regimen for DRESS syndrome.

### Pediatrician! Do you know the symptoms of DRESS syndrome? A case report of a 4-year-old girl [^1126YTbM]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome and may be observed after administration of many drugs. Clinical symptoms usually occur 2 to 8 weeks after drug introduction. Because DRESS syndrome is potentially life threatening, it is especially important to diagnose it early. Withdrawal of the drug which induced symptoms is the most important therapeutic option. DRESS syndrome appears mostly in adults. There are relatively few articles on the DRESS syndrome in children. The article presents a case of a 4-year-old girl with a life-threatening clinical course of DRESS syndrome with massive pulmonary involvement. The knowledge of DRESS syndrome clinical symptoms is essential for doctors of various specialties. It is especially important that general practitioners, pediatricians, and pediatric neurologists should be able to take this life-threatening syndrome into consideration for differential diagnosis.

### Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DReSS): how far have we come? [^115mRAJg]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DReSS), also known as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DiHS), is an uncommon severe adverse reaction to medications. It is important to recognize it as it is potentially fatal and can cause significant morbidity. From the first reports of drug reactions related to certain anticonvulsants characterized by fever, liver enzyme elevation, and skin changes, our continuously growing understanding of this entity has allowed us to describe its physiopathology and clinical features even further. The relationship of genetic factors, viral activation, and specific drug exposure is now known to play a role in this disease. There is still not a widely accepted marker for DReSS/DiHS, but the spectrum of clinical and laboratory features has now been better outlined. The mainstay of treatment is the use of systemic corticosteroids, but other options such as intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, and cyclophosphamide have been described. We present a comprehensive review of the literature on DReSS/DiHS, focusing on its history, etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, therapeutic approach, and outcome.

### Distinguishing DRESS syndrome from drug rash and eosinophilia: beyond regiSCAR criteria [^112JCeNq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Two of the key features of DRESS are rash and eosinophilia; when present, they should prompt clinicians to investigate for DRESS. However, both of these manifestations are common; cutaneous manifestations are estimated to occur in approximately 45% of all drug reactions, and in a prospective evaluation of eosinophilic drug reactions, the incidence was found to be 16.7 per 10,000 hospital admissions. Furthermore, in a cohort of 824 patients receiving intravenous antibiotic therapy, 25% of all patients developed eosinophilia. Therefore, it is not surprising that there is a subset of patients who have a combination of rash and eosinophilia with or without systemic involvement but whose cases do not fulfill the RegiSCAR criteria for probable or definite DRESS.

### Nivolumab-associated DRESS syndrome: a case report [^1151y1cu]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Of the IRAEs encountered with the emergence of checkpoint inhibitor therapies for otherwise prognostically dismal cancer patients, DRESS is a potentially ominous systemic reaction that requires early detection and immediate action. Based highly on clinical suspicion, it is probably underdiagnosed, thus making it important to remain cognizant of this syndrome, even when patients are not taking drugs previously known to cause these reactions.

### Distinguishing DRESS syndrome from drug rash and eosinophilia: beyond regiSCAR criteria [^1141bUfg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Adverse cutaneous reactions to drugs are a frequent problem worldwide, affecting up to 2% to 3% of all hospitalized patients. Fortunately, most of these reactions are mild and self-limiting; however, a small proportion are severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (SCARs), one of which is drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS).DRESS is a rare but potentially life-threatening drug hypersensitivity reaction characterized by hematologic abnormalities including eosinophilia and lymphocytosis, skin rash, and internal organ involvement, most commonly hepatitis, typically occurring 1 to 8 weeks after drug exposure.DRESS has been reported to have a mortality rate of up to 10% in some cohorts, so early recognition, diagnosis, and withdrawal of offending drugs is critical.

The clinical presentation is often heterogeneous, with variable courses and severities of differing manifestations. Furthermore, many of the cardinal features — fever, rash, and organ involvement — are not specific to this syndrome and may be attributed to a wide range of other causes, such as infections or concomitant or preexisting diseases, often leading to a delay in diagnosis.

Three diagnostic criteria currently exist for DRESS, which further add to diagnostic complexities;, however, the Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction (RegiSCAR) criteria are the most widely accepted. In the original case series of 117 patients, in those with disease that met the criteria for probable or definite DRESS, there was minimal overlap between other SCARs.

Despite this, in practice, the diagnosis of DRESS is often challenging. In 216 patients hospitalized with a cutaneous adverse drug reaction, 21% of patients were found to have at least 2 possible diagnoses, and the disease of 3 patients was impossible to classify. In a study comparing the performance of the 3 different criteria for DRESS, 80% of the patients with disease that met the RegiSCAR probable criteria or more satisfied the Bocquet criteria, but only 27.6% of these patients had disease that met the atypical drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome criteria.

### Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS): a clinical update and review of current thinking [^11467nut]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Summary Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) describes a severe medication-induced adverse reaction, which has cutaneous, haematological and solid-organ features. It is one of the triad of life-threatening drug hypersensitivity dermatoses, along with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN). In this article, we discuss several controversies that surround DRESS, including problems with nomenclature and the lack of consensus in diagnostic criteria.

### The DRESS syndrome: a literature review [^1179JY8p]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptom (DRESS) is a severe adverse drug-induced reaction. Diagnosing DRESS is challenging due to the diversity of cutaneous eruption and organs involved. We used the RegiSCAR scoring system that grades DRESS cases as "no", "possible", "probable", or "definite" to classify cases reported in the literature. We also analyzed the clinical course and treatments of the cases. A total of 44 drugs were associated with the 172 cases reported between January 1997 and May 2009 in PubMed and MEDLINE. The most frequently reported drug was carbamazepine, and the vast majority of cases were classified as "probable/definite" DRESS cases. Hypereosinophilia, liver involvement, fever, and lymphadenopathy were significantly associated with "probable/definite" DRESS cases, whereas skin rash was described in almost all of the cases, including "possible cases". Culprit drug withdrawal and corticosteroids constituted the mainstay of DRESS treatment. The outcome was death in 9 cases. However, no predictive factors for serious cases were found. This better knowledge of DRESS may contribute to improve the diagnosis and management of this syndrome in clinical practice.

### Nivolumab-associated DRESS syndrome: a case report [^114VjPZx]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Despite there being no reliable standard for diagnosis, criteria for DRESS have been developed taking into account clinical and laboratory abnormalities. The original criteria, proposed by Bocquet et alin 1996 has expanded to 2 more commonly used diagnostic criteria: the RegiSCAR and the J-SCAR. The RegiSCAR group has suggested inclusion criteria for hospitalized patients suspected to have DRESS, consisting of at least 3 of the following systemic features developing weeks to months after drug initiation: acute skin rash, fever greater than 38°C, lymphadenopathy, internal organ involvement, and hematologic abnormalities, including atypical lymphocytosis, eosinophilia, and thrombocytopenia. If a case is included based on those criteria, a further scoring system is applied to classify the case as excluded, possible, probable, or definite case of DRESS. In contrast, the J-SCAR criteria emphasizes the role of human herpes virus 6 reactivation and is more easily applied due to the reliance on simpler laboratory tests.

The proposed diagnostic criteria highlight different factors hypothesized to be involved with DRESS. Yet, some inconsistencies between them and the nonspecific appearance of DRESS on histopathologylimit their utility in diagnosing the syndrome. Trends from retrospective data suggest that DRESS clinical characteristics vary depending on the causal drug, yet no clear unified outline can currently be defined for these multiorgan drug-induced reactions.,

Based on eosinophilia, suggestive cutaneous rash, and internal organ involvement, our patient scored as a probable case of DRESS per the RegiSCAR criteria. Despite none of her active medications being listed in a literature review by Cacoub et al, nivolumab was the only new medication added in the preceding months, making it the most probable culprit drug.

There is 1 previous case of checkpoint inhibitor–associated DRESS with ipilimumab, a CTLA-4 inhibitor, in an elderly man being treated for melanoma, and 1 case in a 46-year-old man on combination ipilimumab and nivolumab for melanoma. Our patient differed from these 2 cases in sex, type of cancer being treated, and organs affected, with nivolumab being the sole suspected culprit drug.

### Nivolumab-associated DRESS syndrome: a case report [^116Jc6Vw]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

The difficulty in using the proposed diagnostic criteria on novel drugs designed to target the immune system stems from the altered immune response that one would expect. Using leukocyte abnormalities in the criteria for diagnosis of DRESS may have been warranted with the initial culprit drugs. However, with the advent of immunomodulatory drugs, it is unclear whether the aforementioned criteria remain suitable for diagnosis.

DRESS is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction, whereby activated T cells play a central role. Checkpoint inhibitors enhancing the activation and activity of T cells could be interfering with cellular processing of drugs. This alteration in the immune system is comparable to that in individuals infected with HIV, in which the frequency of drug eruptions is higher when compared with the non-HIV population. Although large-scale studies on the prevalence and frequency of drug reactions with checkpoint inhibitors have yet to be conducted, it would be reasonable to assume that the adverse event profile of overactivation of the immune system has similarities with a suppressed immune system in a patient with HIV.

### Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms: a systematic review [^115o48E4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a potentially life-threatening drug reaction; recognizing the diversity of its clinical presentations, implicated drugs, and management modalities can aid in diagnosis and reduce morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To review the clinical features, drug causes, and treatments deployed in DRESS.

Methods

This review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to review publications relating to DRESS published between 1979 and 2021. Only publications with a RegiSCAR score of 4 or greater were included (indicating "probable" or "definite" DRESS). The PRISMA guidelines were used for data extraction and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for quality assessment (Pierson DJ. Respir Care 2009;54:1372–8). The main outcomes included implicated drugs, patient demographics, clinical manifestations, treatment, and sequelae for each included publication.

Results

A total of 1124 publications were reviewed, and 131 met the inclusion criteria, amounting to 151 cases of DRESS. The most implicated drug classes were antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and anti-inflammatories, although up to 55 drugs were implicated. Cutaneous manifestations were present in 99% of cases, with a median onset of 24 days and maculopapular rash the most common morphology. Common systemic features were fever, eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy, and liver involvement. Facial edema was present in 67 cases (44%). Systemic corticosteroids were the mainstay of DRESS-specific treatment. A total of 13 cases (9%) resulted in mortality.

Conclusion

DRESS diagnosis should be considered in the presence of a cutaneous eruption, fever, eosinophilia, liver involvement, and lymphadenopathy. The class of implicated drug may influence outcome, as allopurinol was associated with 23% of cases that resulted in death (3 cases). Given potential DRESS complications and mortality, it is important that DRESS is recognized early so that any suspect drugs are ceased promptly.

### Management of adult patients with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms: a Delphi-Based international consensus [^116JxAVH]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a rare but potentially fatal drug hypersensitivity reaction. To our knowledge, there is no international consensus on its severity assessment and treatment.

Objective

To reach an international, Delphi-based multinational expert consensus on the diagnostic workup, severity assessment, and treatment of patients with DRESS.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Delphi method was used to assess 100 statements related to baseline workup, evaluation of severity, acute phase, and postacute management of DRESS. Fifty-seven international experts in DRESS were invited, and 54 participated in the survey, which took place from July to September 2022.

Main Outcomes/Measures

The degree of agreement was calculated with the RAND-UCLA Appropriateness Method. Consensus was defined as a statement with a median appropriateness value of 7 or higher (appropriate) and a disagreement index of lower than 1.

Results

In the first Delphi round, consensus was reached on 82 statements. Thirteen statements were revised and assessed in a second round. A consensus was reached for 93 statements overall. The experts agreed on a set of basic diagnostic workup procedures as well as severity- and organ-specific further investigations. They reached a consensus on severity assessment (mild, moderate, and severe) based on the extent of liver, kidney, and blood involvement and the damage of other organs. The panel agreed on the main lines of DRESS management according to these severity grades. General recommendations were generated on the postacute phase follow-up of patients with DRESS and the allergological workup.

Conclusions and Relevance

This Delphi exercise represents, to our knowledge, the first international expert consensus on diagnostic workup, severity assessment, and management of DRESS. This should support clinicians in the diagnosis and management of DRESS and constitute the basis for development of future guidelines.

### DRESS syndrome presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and delayed eosinophilia [^115yhSb6]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Learning points

This is a case of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome with severe pulmonary manifestations in an otherwise healthy patient with delayed eosinophilia.
DRESS syndrome varies in presentation and severity. Therefore, high clinical suspicion can lead to prompt identification and initiation of treatment with systemic glucocorticoids and supportive care.
Given the lethality of DRESS syndrome, starting treatment as soon as possible is crucial to reduce the risk of mortality and improve prognosis.

### Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome [^111Xsqc5]. Clinics in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a severe cutaneous drug reaction characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, hematologic abnormalities, multisystem involvement, and viral reactivation. Although most patients with DRESS syndrome are able to fully recover, a subset of patients go on to have a prolonged course with recurrence, and/or autoimmune complications. Severe systemic involvement is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Viral reactivation, especially of human herpes virus 6, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus, is a common feature of DRESS, with a high viral load and antibody titers being associated with poor outcomes. Aside from prompt discontinuation of the offending drug, treatment for patients with significant disease consists of systemic therapy with corticosteroids.

### DRESS syndrome: a case report and literature review [^11461bf4]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

DRESS syndrome (drug rash, eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) is an idiosyncratic drug reaction characterised by rash, fever, lymphadenopathy and internal organ involvement. The authors report a case of this syndrome presenting with fever, generalised pruritus, macular rash and cholestatic hepatitis during allopurinol treatment. This case resolved with drug withdrawal, but the death rate in the setting of hepatic failure can reach 10%. Rapid diagnosis is crucial as prompt withdrawal of the offending drug is the key of the treatment, while the potential role of corticosteroids remains controversial.

### Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms vs toxic epidermal necrolysis: the dilemma of classification [^1133xXA9]. Clinics in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

According to contemporary vernacular, when the cutaneous manifestations of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic signs (DRESS) syndrome are those of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), the condition is defined as "DRESS syndrome with severe cutaneous reactions". In this article, we have presented arguments for and against including patients with skin lesions of the SJS/TEN syndromes who also have fever (practically all of the patients) and internal organ involvement (most of the patients) under the definition of DRESS syndrome. After weighing the arguments for and against this alteration of definition, we conclude that it makes more sense for patients with SJS/TEN to be classified as such and not be lumped together under the misleading label of DRESS syndrome.

### Distinguishing DRESS syndrome from drug rash and eosinophilia: beyond regiSCAR criteria [^1167QgQr]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnosing drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) can be challenging.

Objectives

We sought to identify clinical and laboratory features outside of the Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction (RegiSCAR) criteria that distinguish patients with probable DRESS (RegiSCAR ≥ 4) from those with drug rash and eosinophilia (DRE).

Methods

Using international coding classifications of drug-induced fever, generalized skin eruption due to medications, and eosinophilia, a retrospective audit from 2008 to 2023 of hospitalized patients was performed.

Results

Forty-four cases of DRESS were compared to 80 cases of DRE. In addition to the RegiSCAR distinguishing factors for DRESS were longer drug latency before symptom onset (median 21 vs 5 days, P < .001) and higher alanine transaminase levels (increase by a factor of 2.49 [95% confidence interval, 1.56, 4.00; p = 0.009]). Follow-up (mean 5.67 years) revealed a low rate of statewide drug alert reporting (29.6%) and drug allergy testing in DRESS (20.5%). Inadvertent reexposure to a culprit or structurally related drug resulted in recurrent DRESS in 3 patients (7.5%), and tolerance of structurally related drugs occurred in 8 patients (17.5%).

Conclusion

In this large study evaluating DRE patients whose disease does not meet the RegiSCAR criteria for DRESS, we found that additional factors outside the RegiSCAR criteria may help clinicians differentiate DRESS, which is critical for optimal and timely patient management. Our study also highlights the need for development of local protocols to ensure appropriate allergy labeling and testing are performed to prevent recurrent DRESS.

### DRESS syndrome: an important differential for eosinophilia with systemic organ dysfunction [^1148GHZe]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Drug rash occurring with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome is a potentially fatal adverse drug reaction that requires immediate action in order to minimise patient harm. Initially implicated with the use of anticonvulsants, it has also been shown to be caused by many other medications but less frequently with vancomycin. Patients typically present with fever, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia and systemic organ dysfunction. Diagnosis is aided using probability calculators such as RegiSCAR (Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction), as well as clinical response on removing the responsible medication. Here, we present a case without any systemic organ dysfunction that improved with withdrawal of the offending drug vancomycin.

### DRESS syndrome: part I. clinical perspectives [^1136UFKv]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, also referred to as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, is a distinct, potentially life-threatening adverse reaction. It is seen in children and adults most often as a morbilliform cutaneous eruption with fever, lymphadenopathy, hematologic abnormalities, and multiorgan manifestations. Historically, it was most frequently linked with phenytoin and known as phenytoin hypersensitivity syndrome. However, because many other medications were found to produce the same reaction, another name was in order. Anticonvulsants and sulfonamides are the most common offending agents. Its etiology has been linked with lymphocyte activation, drug metabolic enzyme defects, eosinophilia, and human herpesvirus-6 reactivation. DRESS has a later onset and longer duration than other drug reactions, with a latent period of 2 to 6 weeks. It may have significant multisystem involvement, including hematologic, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic, gastrointestinal, and endocrine abnormalities. This syndrome has a 10% mortality rate, most commonly from fulminant hepatitis with hepatic necrosis.

### Eosinophilic drug allergy [^111wB3bR]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

While peripheral or tissue eosinophilia may certainly characterize drug eruptions, this feature is hardly pathognomonic for a medication-induced etiology. While delayed drug hypersensitivity reactions with prominent eosinophilic recruitment have been typically classified as type IVb reactions, their pathophysiology is now known to be more complex. Eosinophilic drug reactions have a diversity of presentations and may be benign and self-limited to severe and life-threatening. The extent of clinical involvement is also heterogeneous, ranging from isolated peripheral eosinophilia or single organ involvement (most often the skin and lung) to systemic disease affecting multiple organs, classically exemplified by drug-reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). The spectrum of implicated medications in the causation of DRESS is ever expanding, and multiple factors including drug metabolites, specific HLA alleles, herpes viruses, and immune system activation have been implicated in pathogenesis. Due to this complex interplay of various factors, diagnostic workup in terms of skin and laboratory testing has not been validated. Similarly, the lack of controlled trials limits treatment options. This review also describes other localized as well as systemic manifestations of eosinophilic disease induced by various medication classes, including their individual pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management. Given the multitude of clinical patterns associated with eosinophilic drug allergy, the diagnosis can be challenging. Considerable deficits in our knowledge of these presentations remain, but the potential for severe reactions should be borne in mind in order to facilitate diagnosis and institute appropriate management.

### Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) caused by phenytoin [^113sXZao]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition with high mortality. Diagnosis is challenging due to variable clinical presentation and a protracted latency period following initiation of the offending drug. DRESS is a complex interplay that starts by introduction of the offending drug, reactivation of viruses and activation of the immune system. Herpes virus reactivation is considered a diagnostic marker and indicator of illness severity. Prompt recognition and the removal of offending agent remain the key to successful treatment. In cases of severe organ involvement, corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, antiviral and specialist consultation may be helpful. Here we present a case of a 36-year-old African-American male who presented with symptoms mimicking sepsis with an associated skin eruption that was diagnosed as DRESS.

### DRESS syndrome or hematologic malignancy? a case report of a 4-year-old boy [^112ZPbrt]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptom (DRESS) is a serious idiosyncratic drug reaction. It is characterized by skin eruption, fever, hematologic abnormalities, and multi-organ involvement. Diagnosis is challenging because of the wide clinical spectrum. Its association with aromatic antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine, has been well described in adults. There are few reports of DRESS syndrome in children, and knowledge about the relationship between new antiepileptic drugs such as oxcarbazepine and this syndrome is limited. The DRESS syndrome is a challenging entity and probably underdiagnosed because many of its clinical findings can mimic those of other serious systemic disorders such as infections and hematologic disorders. Virus reactivation and use of some drugs together with suspected drugs, such as amoxicillin, can trigger the symptoms of DRESS syndrome. This is a case report of a 4-year-old boy with oxcarbazepine-induced DRESS syndrome possibly triggered by amoxicillin; hematologic malignancy was included in the differential diagnosis.

### A review of DRESS-associated myocarditis [^114pU9hU]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

DRESS (drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms), also known as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, is a severe, systemic drug reaction most commonly associated with aromatic anticonvulsants and sulfonamides. Patients typically present with fever, facial edema, cervical lymphadenopathy and a morbilliform eruption, which may progress to erythroderma. Hematologic abnormalities are a hallmark of the condition, including eosinophilia and atypical lymphocytosis. Visceral organ involvement typically manifests as hepatic dysfunction but may include lymphadenopathy, nephritis, interstitial pneumonitis, and myocarditis. Five to ten percent of patients with DRESS die from systemic complications, making timely recognition and treatment essential to prevent life-threatening manifestations. Myocarditis is a fatal and under-recognized manifestation of DRESS, which may occur long after the initial diagnosis. We review the literature of previously reported cases of DRESS and myocardial involvement, highlighting the presenting symptoms associated with cardiac involvement, treatments used, and the outcome for each patient. In addition, we offer an algorithm for early diagnosis, treatment, and subsequent monitoring of these patients.

### Utility and safety of skin tests in drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS): a systematic review [^116QvNun]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Determination of culprit drug in drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is crucial. Skin tests have been used, although it remains unclear how sensitive these are.

Objective

To determine the value of skin tests in the assessment of drug causality in DRESS.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted for publications from 1996 onward of skin tests (skin prick test = SPT, patch test = PT, intradermal test = IDT) performed in clearly defined DRESS cases. Outcomes of testing, drug culpability assessments, and challenge test data were extracted.

Results

A total of 17 articles met inclusion criteria. In 290 patients with DRESS, patch testing was most frequent (PT = 97.2% [n = 282], IDT = 12.4% [n = 36], SPT = 3.1% [n = 9]). Positive results were noted in 58.4% (n = 160 of 282) of PTs, 66.5% of IDTs, and 25% of SPTs. When confidence of drug causality was high (n = 73 of 194), testing did not correlate well with clinical suspicion: PTs, 37.6%; IDTs, 36.5%. Direct comparison of skin testing with provocation testing (n = 12) showed 83.3% correlation. Positive IDT results were reported in 8 negative PT cases.

Conclusions

Skin tests, particularly PTs and IDTs, have been reported as tools for diagnosis of causal drugs in DRESS. Heterogeneity in methodology, results analysis, and reporting of cohorts make meta-analysis to determine sensitivity and specificity of published literature impossible and highlight weaknesses in the field. We propose that international collaboration is essential to harmonize the methodology and reporting measures from hypersensitivity testing studies in larger cohorts.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-induced drug eruption with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) [^113DyrtR]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a severe and potentially life threatening adverse drug reaction. To help identify DRESS, several criteria have been established; however, there is still a lack of consensus on diagnosis, and clinical judgment is paramount. Here we describe a 24-year-old female who presented with a cutaneous eruption, fever, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, facial edema, and elevated liver enzymes four and a half weeks after a 10-day course of Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). We used both the RegiSCAR and J-SCAR criteria to show the validity of classifying this case as DRESS, we also comment on the only other three cases, published to date, that had been reported as TMP/SMX induced DRESS. DRESS can be a difficult diagnosis due to its diverse symptomatology and delayed presentation - therefore, high suspicion and exclusion of other causes is key. Use of validated diagnostic criteria can aid the clinician in this regard. In the absence of a well-established therapy, early recognition, withdrawal of suspected drug(s), and supportive care play a crucial role in the management of DRESS.

### Human herpesvirus 6 in acute liver failure: leading role, supporting actor or innocent bystander? A case series, narrative review and management algorithm proposal [^1179qKkV]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

In recent years, an increasing number of acute liver failure (ALF) cases have been attributed to HHV-6, although its pathogenic role remains debated. In the absence of standardised diagnostic criteria, HHV-6 is likely underrecognized as a potential etiologic agent. We report three cases of liver injury with confirmed HHV-6 replication; each showing a markedly different degree of viral involvement. A narrative review of all previously reported cases of HHV-6-induced hepatitis in immunocompetent adults was conducted. Based on the available evidence, an algorithm was designed for the management of HHV-6-associated liver injury. Twenty cases were included, showing a predominance of young women (80%), fever as the most consistent symptom (75%), and a notable association (30%) with Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. Overall, 65% of patients met ALF criteria, and mortality reached 30%. Blood RT-PCR was the most frequently used diagnostic tool (70%), while liver biopsy was performed in 35% of cases. Antiviral therapy was administered in 45% of patients and corticosteroids in 40%, mainly due to coexisting DRESS syndrome or initial suspicion of autoimmune hepatitis. Notably, 25% of patients underwent liver transplantation. The proposed algorithm offers a structured approach to managing HHV-6 in patients with ALF and emphasises the importance of considering it in the differential diagnosis. HHV-6 should be considered in cases of ALF, particularly in young febrile women without an identified aetiology and in patients with concomitant DRESS syndrome. Further studies are needed to validate diagnostic criteria and guide treatment strategies.

### Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome caused by first-line antituberculosis drugs: two case reports and a review of the literature [^111XkJoF]. Contact Dermatitis (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients suffering from drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome caused by first-line antituberculosis drugs often need to be retreated rapidly. Patch tests prior to the reintroduction of antituberculosis drugs are rarely performed.

Objectives

To highlight those drugs most often involved in DRESS caused by antituberculosis drugs, illustrate the potential value of patch tests to identify these culprit(s), and provide insights into how to rapidly retreat these patients.

Methods

A detailed description of the work-up of two illustrative patients, together with a literature review of similar cases, is provided.

Results

All first-line antituberculosis drugs may cause DRESS syndrome, but rifampicin and isoniazid are most frequently involved. Patch tests can be performed sooner than usually advised in the context of DRESS syndrome, and potentially with lower test concentrations, but false-negative results are possible. Sequential reintroduction of patch test-negative drugs is feasible, although the dose and order of drugs to be readministered, as well as the use of concomitant systemic corticosteroids, remain a matter of debate.

Conclusion

Patch tests in the context of DRESS syndrome caused by antituberculosis drugs, despite their shortcomings, may potentially guide rapid retreatment of these patients.

### DRESS syndrome due to vemurafenib treatment: switching BRAF inhibitor to solve a big problem [^112a3cFA]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

We present a case report of an early-onset drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome) induced by vemurafenib (BRAF inhibitor) in a middle-age man affected by a metastatic, BRAF mutant melanoma who was started on first-line metastatic treatment with vemurafenib and cobimetinib. After initiating the treatment, the patient presented an extensive cutaneous rash with eosinophilia and renal impairment. Due the constellation of signs and symptoms, a diagnosis of DRESS syndrome was made which strongly contraindicated the reintroduction of vemurafenib due to its hypersensibility reaction. Thus, vemurafenib was stopped immediately, and we started corticoid treatment with clinical improvement. Due to the contraindication to start vemurafenib again, after multidisciplinary view of the case and having balanced the risks and benefits, we successfully performed a switch to another BRAF inhibitor in a progressively ascending pattern, without any skin toxicity and with a good response of the metastatic melanoma.

### Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome / drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. part I. epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinicopathological features, and prognosis [^115TrEdN]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DiHS), also known as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), is a severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) characterized by an exanthem, fever, and hematologic and visceral organ involvement. Anticonvulsants, antibiotics, and allopurinol are the most common triggers. The pathogenesis involves a complex interplay between drugs, viruses, and the immune system primarily mediated by T-cells. DiHS/DRESS typically presents with a morbilliform eruption 2–6 weeks after drug exposure, and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and risk of relapse. Long-term sequelae primarily relate to organ dysfunction and autoimmune diseases. Part I of this continuing medical education activity on DiHS/DRESS provides an update on epidemiology, novel insights into pathogenesis, and a description of clinicopathological features and prognosis.

### DRESS syndrome presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and delayed eosinophilia [^111zthrE]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Summary

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a rare, yet life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction. It typically presents with fever, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia and systemic organ dysfunction. Atypical presentations of DRESS syndrome, including elevated liver enzymes and acute respiratory distress syndrome, have previously been reported in rare cases. Here, we describe an otherwise healthy male patient in his mid-50s who presented with a rash, myalgia, shortness of breath and delayed eosinophilia that rapidly progressed to acute respiratory failure with hypoxia after starting trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Prompt identification and treatment of atypical manifestations of DRESS syndrome is critical to reduce morbidity and mortality.

### Clinical, biochemical, and serologic predictors of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome: a prospective case-control study [^115UqDBh]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Detailed scoring systems such as the European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (RegiSCAR) score for validating a diagnosis of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome are available, but there is no rapid, easy tool to identify DRESS at presentation.

Objective

To identify the clinical, biochemical, and serologic markers predicting the DRESS syndrome and its severity.

Methods

In this prospective observational study, 25 patients with the DRESS syndrome and 25 control patients with maculopapular drug rash were recruited. Baseline clinical, biochemical, and serologic markers, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) levels, were recorded and their utility in identifying the DRESS syndrome at presentation and predicting severity was analyzed.

Results

The effectiveness of TARC level (> 613.25 pg/mL), total body surface area (TBSA, > 35%), hsCRP (> 5 mg/L), eosinophils (> 6%), absolute eosinophil count (> 450 cells/mm³), and aspartate transaminase (> 92 U/L) were statistically similar to the effectiveness of the RegiSCAR DRESS validation score (≥ 2) in diagnosing the DRESS syndrome. A combination model (TBSA at baseline, eosinophil count, and hsCRP) at the cutoff of 6.8 had a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 100%. Baseline serum TARC levels did not predict the DRESS severity or outcome.

Limitations

Small sample size.

Conclusion

The combination of TBSA involvement, eosinophil count, and hsCRP levels can predict the DRESS syndrome at presentation.

### Distinguishing DRESS syndrome from drug rash and eosinophilia: beyond regiSCAR criteria [^111Pcj3a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study has a number of limitations. It is retrospective in nature, so there are missing data on variables, which meant that we were unable to analyze certain parameters, such as the influence of human herpesviruses. The use of ICD-10 codes for retrospective identification of cases may also mean that some cases were missed. The definitions used for liver and renal involvement did not allow consideration of other possible causes, such as toxicity from medications, chronic liver or renal disease, or the underlying infection itself, and therefore are likely to have overestimated the frequency of these organs' involvement. There were also limited data available on subsequent tolerance of other structurally related antibiotics. Furthermore, there is heterogeneity within the DRE group, which ranges from patients with rash and eosinophilia alone to patients with possible DRESS. Although subgroup analysis of these patients did not identify any additional signal, further studies with larger numbers separating this group out further may be of use.

Our study provides further evidence for a spectrum of eosinophilic drug reactions and suggests that the magnitude of increase in eosinophilia and ALT, as well as the duration of drug therapy before symptom onset, may be useful indexes to aid clinicians in differentiating patients who are more likely to have drug hypersensitivity with eosinophilia alone from DRESS. However, further larger prospective studies are required to further phenotype and define this group, which may allow for the development of useful prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers.

### Differential diagnosis of severe cutaneous drug eruptions [^111L3Jgj]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Adverse cutaneous reactions to drugs are frequent, mostly secondary to antibacterials, however, serious adverse cutaneous reactions are infrequent. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are a spectrum of the same disease. They are the more severe drug eruptions, with a mortality around 30% for TEN. The confusion between erythema multiforme major and SJS means that erythema multiforme major is the main differential diagnosis. Skin disorders involving desquamation, in particular after pustulosis, are also common differential diagnoses. Mechanical or autoimmune blistering are also potential misdiagnoses of TEN/SJS. Hypersensitivity Syndrome (HSS) or Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) is a severe cutaneous drug reaction with often a long duration of eruption and serious other organ involvement. Exfoliative dermatitis, whether caused by psoriasis, dermatitis or lymphoma, can be thought of as a differential diagnosis of DRESS/HSS. Angio-immunoblastic lymphadenopathy, viral eruption and vasculitis are other differential diagnoses of DRESS/HSS. Prompt recognition of a severe drug reaction and withdrawal of the culprit drug is often the most important therapeutic action. Alternatively, a delay in starting a specific treatment for a disease misdiagnosed as a drug eruption could be deleterious.

### Systemic drug reactions with skin involvement: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and DRESS [^116A8R6u]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Skin is often affected in adverse drug reactions. Although the majority of cutaneous adverse drug reactions are benign and self-limiting, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), affecting multiple organs and systems, are potentially fatal. Many organs can be affected, including the mucosal membranes, gastrointestinal tract, liver, lungs, kidneys, and eyes. We discuss the causes, pathophysiologic aspects, and main clinical features of SJS, TEN, and DRESS as systemic diseases with skin involvement.

### Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS): series of 49 French pediatric cases [^111gDBSg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a rare and potentially fatal adverse reaction. It can be difficult to diagnose, even more so among children, because symptoms may mimic other commonly encountered pediatric conditions.

Objective

To describe clinical and laboratory features of DRESS syndrome in the pediatric population (age ≤ 18 years) and establish causative agents and treatment modalities.

Methods

This was a multicenter retrospective study of probable and definite DRESS cases (Registry of Sever Cutaneous Adverse Reaction score ≥ 4) in children hospitalized in 15 French university hospitals between 2000 and 2020.

Results

We included 49 cases. All children had fever and rash, 69.4% had lymphadenopathy, and 65.3% had facial edema. The most common organ affected was the liver (83.7%). Treatment consisted of topical corticosteroid in only 30.6% and systemic corticosteroid in 55.1%; 12.2% received intravenous immunoglobulin. Among probable and likely culprit drugs, 65% were antibiotics and 27.5% were antiepileptics, median time to DRESS symptom onset after initiation of 15 days (13 days with antibiotics and 21 days with antiepileptics). Twenty-seven children had allergy assessment for causative agents, 65.4% of whom had positive tests.

Conclusions

Culprit drugs are frequently antibiotics and antiepileptic drugs, and onset is often less than 2 weeks after treatment starts, especially with antibiotics. Treatment with topical corticosteroids appears to be sufficient in the least severe cases. Treatment by systemic corticosteroid therapy remains the reference treatment in case of severe organ damage.

### Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome induced by levetiracetam in a pediatric patient [^113mEHeb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a rare, life-threatening hypersensitivity drug reaction. Patients present with cutaneous rash, fever, lymphadenopathy, hematologic abnormalities with eosinophilia and atypical lymphocytes, and visceral organ involvement. The prognosis of DRESS syndrome is related to the degree of end-organ damage, and the mortality rate is approximately 10%.

Case Report

We report a 9-year-old girl treated with only levetiracetam because of intracranial space occupying mass-related seizures. The patient developed pharyngitis accompanied by exudative membrane, bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, tender hepatomegaly, skin rash, and fever after 19 days of levetiracetam therapy. Laboratory findings revealed leukocytosis, lymphocytosis with an atypical lymphocytosis, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum transaminases. Serologic studies of viruses were negative. The patient was diagnosed with DRESS syndrome and antiepileptic therapy was ceased immediately. The systemic signs and symptoms of the patient were improved after systemic steroid and antihistamine therapy. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? It is important that emergency physicians be aware of the possibility of DRESS syndrome when attending children that present with clinical viral infections. We would like to emphasize that obtaining a careful and detailed medication history is an essential part of clinical assessment for the diagnosis of DRESS syndrome.

### Phenytoin-induced drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome: a case report from the emergency department [^116cVmnQ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is an uncommon but serious hypersensitivity drug reaction most frequently associated with antiepileptics. Clinical manifestations include rash, fever, and visceral organ involvement, most commonly hepatitis. The mortality rate associated with DRESS syndrome is approximately 10%, the majority due to fulminant liver failure.

Objectives

We report one case of phenytoin-induced DRESS syndrome in a patient who presented to the Emergency Department (ED). Our objectives for this case report include: 1) to learn the importance of DRESS syndrome; 2) to recognize the signs and symptoms of DRESS syndrome; 3) to know what diagnostic studies are indicated; and 4) to learn the appropriate treatment.

Case Report

We report one case of phenytoin-induced DRESS syndrome in a 34-year-old man, previously on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, who presented to the ED with 5 days of worsening symptoms including generalized rash, fever, tongue swelling, and dysphagia. Laboratory results revealed an eosinophilia and elevated liver enzymes. With initiation of steroids, the transaminitis improved despite increasing eosinophilia and development of an atypical lymphocytosis. Fever and angioedema resolved with improvement of the rash, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 3.

Conclusion

Given the significant mortality related to DRESS syndrome, ED staff should have a low threshold for suspecting the condition in patients who present with unusual complaints and skin findings after starting any antiepileptic drug. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment with corticosteroids is imperative.

### Differentiating between a prasugrel-induced hypersensitivity reaction and an atorvastatin-induced DRESS syndrome in the post-percutaneous coronary intervention setting [^114WL5sF]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a severe hypersensitivity reaction with high morbidity and mortality, characterized by skin eruption, fever, and hematologic and multiorgan involvement. Given the heterogenous clinical presentation of DRESS syndrome and paucity of diagnostic tests, scoring systems such as the European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (RegiSCAR) criteria have been validated to facilitate diagnosis. To date, few reports have implicated statins in DRESS syndrome, and none have involved the P2Y12 inhibitor prasugrel. However, P2Y12 inhibitors are well-documented triggers of hypersensitivity reactions. Here, we report a probable case of atorvastatin-induced DRESS syndrome manifesting with liver dysfunction, potentially complicated by pneumonitis or triggered by influenza A.

### Phenotype standardization for immune-mediated drug-induced skin injury [^1125aj5R]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Advances in genetic research and molecular biology techniques have made it possible to begin to characterize the underlying genetic factors that predispose patients to serious forms of drug-induced skin injury (DISI). To facilitate research in this area, we have set out standardized phenotypic definitions for (i) Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), (ii) acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and (iii) hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS; also known as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS)). A DISI Expert Working Group comprising participants with varied expertise reviewed and debated current terminology and diagnostic criteria for DISI and agreed on the minimum phenotypic criteria for selected forms of DISI (SJS/TEN, AGEP, and HSS). In addition, an algorithm has been developed to aid appropriate clinical categorization of patients with DISI. These standardized criteria will be important in facilitating adequate and accurate patient recruitment in order to advance research in pharmacogenomic, immunological, mechanistic, and epidemiological studies.

### A young child with eosinophilia, rash, and multisystem illness: drug rash, eosinophilia, and systemic symptoms syndrome after receipt of fluoxetine [^115KyZpB]. Pediatric Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Drug rash, eosinophilia, and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a severe systemic hypersensitivity reaction that usually occurs within 6 weeks of exposure to the offending drug. Diagnosis is usually straightforward in patients with pyrexia, skin rash, hepatitis, and eosinophilia with a preceding history of exposure to agents often associated with DRESS syndrome, such as aromatic anticonvulsants and sulfa drugs, but diagnosis of DRESS may still be a challenge. We report a 4-year-old child with probable DRESS syndrome complicated by multiple hematologic complications that developed 1 month after exposure to fluoxetine, a drug not known to be associated with such severe reactions.

However, despite changing class of therapy with continued antimicrobial coverage, end organ damage continued, the rash worsened and facial oedema developed. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms was ultimately diagnosed and was consistent with clinical and histopathological findings, as well as meeting all criteria for scoring systems. The patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone 125mg per 8hours with rapid improvement of rash, swelling and end organ damage. Initial challenge to decrease dose failed, but the patient was ultimately able to be discharged on an extended taper.

### Ivermectin-induced drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome [^117KsM1n]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

DRESS syndrome is a severe adverse drug reaction that typically occurs 2 to 6 weeks after initiation of the offending drug. DRESS syndrome is characterized by generalized exanthema with facial swelling, fever, lymphadenopathy, leukocytosis with eosinophilia, and internal organ involvement with liver or renal dysfunction. Diagnosis of DRESS syndrome is established by applying the RegiSCAR scoring system shown in Table I. The most common causative drugs include antiepileptics, allopurinol, antimicrobial sulfonamides, minocycline, and vancomycin. An association with reactivation of viruses of the herpes family (human herpesvirus-6, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus) has also been reported. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case adding ivermectin to the list of drugs causing DRESS syndrome.

Table I
Diagnostic criteria for DRESS syndrome according to RegiSCAR,

The therapeutic management of DRESS syndrome is challenging and should always be discussed and adjusted based on the severity of organ involvement. Recently, a consensus group of the French Society of Dermatology published recommendations for the management of DRESS syndrome. Withdrawal of the culprit drug and supportive care with emollients and H1-antihistamines are recommended for all cases and may be sufficient to obtain remission in some nonsevere DRESS cases with mild hepatitis, as shown in our patient. In the absence of signs of severity, patients can be treated with topical corticosteroids in addition to supportive therapy. In the presence of signs of severity (transaminase levels > 4 times normal, renal involvement), treatment with systemic corticosteroids (0.5–1 mg/kg/d) is warranted. In patients with life-threatening systemic disease such as fulminant hepatitis or hemophagocytosis, antiviral treatments including ganciclovir and intravenous immunoglobulins have been considered as alternative treatments, but their efficacy has yet to be demonstrated, and they may even be deleterious.

### DRESS syndrome presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and delayed eosinophilia [^116sSJv7]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a rare, yet life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction. It typically presents with fever, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia and systemic organ dysfunction. Atypical presentations of DRESS syndrome, including elevated liver enzymes and acute respiratory distress syndrome, have previously been reported in rare cases. Here, we describe an otherwise healthy male patient in his mid-50s who presented with a rash, myalgia, shortness of breath and delayed eosinophilia that rapidly progressed to acute respiratory failure with hypoxia after starting trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Prompt identification and treatment of atypical manifestations of DRESS syndrome is critical to reduce morbidity and mortality.

### Successful transition to encorafenib following vemurafenib-induced drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome [^1114h719]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

DRESS syndrome is a severe, potentially life-threatening drug-induced adverse reaction. The present case highlights the importance of vemurafenib-induced DRESS syndrome, which is often characterized by early onset compared with DRESS syndrome induced by other medications (7–12 days compared with typically 2–6 weeks). Previous PD-1 inhibitor use is associated with more severe cutaneous toxicity from vemurafenib, as our patient experienced (receiving pembrolizumab 4 days prior to vemurafenib).

BRAF mutations are present in 50%-60% of melanomas overall, and vemurafenib as a first-line option for these patients confers significantly improved morbidity and mortality compared with the prior standard of care. Clinicians can expect to encounter this regimen in practice and should be privy to this potentially life-threatening adverse event.

When DRESS due to vemurafenib occurs, these patients are often successfully switched to dabrafenib without recurrence. A recent systematic review showed, of 31 severe cutaneous adverse reactions to BRAF/MEK inhibitors, all were caused by vemurafenib except one (which was dabrafenib-caused). It remains to be identified why vemurafenib is so disproportionately causative of DRESS syndrome compared with other BRAF/MEK inhibitors.

The pathogenesis of DRESS syndrome is poorly understood. Proposed mechanisms include detoxification defects leading to reactive metabolite formation, immunologic reactions, slow acetylation, and reactivation of herpes viruses. The pattern of cutaneous eruptions and organs involved are various, and no link has been established between type of visceral involvement and type of causative drug. Adding to this challenge, half of the causative drugs are associated with only a single case of DRESS syndrome, and in most cases, the underlying mechanism is not investigated.

### DRESS syndrome presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and delayed eosinophilia [^116TrD1f]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

The incidence of DRESS syndrome is low; however, this may be attributed to under-reporting and unawareness. The mechanism and pathogenesis have not been clearly elucidated but likely involve genetic predisposition, accumulation of drug metabolites and drug-virus interactions. Diagnosing DRESS syndrome requires a high level of clinical suspicion, as identifying the qualifying features is challenging. The RegiSCAR scoring system, Japanese DIHS criteria and Bocquet's criteria are commonly used to delineate the likelihood that a patient has DRESS. Given the non-specific symptoms and multiorgan involvement seen in both typical and atypical presentations of DRESS, the differential diagnosis is quite broad, and clinicians should consider this syndrome until other aetiologies have been ruled out.

Antibiotic sulfonamides have been previously reported as common causative agents of DRESS syndrome, and there was a temporal relationship between taking TMP-SMX and our patient's presenting symptoms. His hospital course highlights the life-threatening nature of DRESS syndrome as pulmonary manifestations may be a presenting sign of DRESS and are frequently misdiagnosed for pneumonia. Because our patient lacked the characteristic features of DRESS syndrome, he was diagnosed with DRESS. Prior retrospective studies have shown that the liver is the most commonly affected organ in DRESS. In our review of the literature, we found one case report that describes atypical DRESS syndrome in a patient presenting with transaminitis. One systematic review highlighted the pulmonary manifestations of DRESS, which are rare but associated with a more severe clinical course and worse outcomes. The review mentions one case of pulmonary DRESS secondary to TMP-SMX in a male patient with other pulmonary co-comorbidities. To our knowledge, there are no case reports that describe DRESS syndrome induced by TMP-SMX that presents with acute respiratory failure with hypoxia in an otherwise healthy adult with delayed eosinophilia.

### Distinguishing DRESS syndrome from drug rash and eosinophilia: beyond regiSCAR criteria [^113W8BY5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Data of 124 patients were analyzed, 44 (35.5%) of whom had DRESS. The overall mean (SD) age was 61 (19.6) years, with no significant sex predisposition (50.8% male) (Table I). There was no apparent change in the frequency of DRESS diagnosis over the 15-year period studied (Fig 1).

Table I
Demographic data and outcomes of DRESS versus DRE patients

Fig 1
Frequency (cases per year) of DRESS and DRE during study follow-up.

The most common causative drug type was antibiotics (64.5%), which is in keeping with the most common underlying diagnosis of infection (64.5%) (Table I). Causative drug type and underlying diagnoses were similar between the DRESS and the DRE group. Approximately two thirds of patients were reviewed by immunology or dermatology specialist teams during the inpatient stay and specialist review.

Clinical features

Time to rash onset after causative drug commencement was significantly longer in the DRESS group compared to the DRE group (median 21 vs 5 days, P < .001) (Fig 2). In keeping with the RegiSCAR criteria, patients with DRESS were more likely to have fever, facial swelling, and liver function derangement compared to those with DRE (Table II). Systemic corticosteroid treatment was provided to 65.91% of the DRESS group and 33.06% of the DRE group. Maculopapular rash was the most common rash morphology in both groups (64.9%) but was seen at a higher frequency in the DRESS group compared to the DRE group (odds ratio, 7.29; 95% confidence interval, 2.31, 30.7; p = 0.005; Table II).

### Polycyclic rash with persistent eosinophilia [^114HXeW5]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

A 56-year-old man with no past medical history presented with dry cough and dyspnea. He was given antibiotics and bronchodilators which did not improve his symptoms. Three years after the initial symptoms began, he developed persistent hypereosinophilia with an absolute eosinophil count as high as 2250 cells/uL. Prednisone (40 mg daily) was initially helpful, but his symptoms returned once the drug was tapered. Subsequently, he developed new myalgias, arthralgias, joint swelling, hives, and polycyclic purpuric plaques with hemorrhagic zones and erythema on his trunk and extremities (Figs 1 and 2). A skin biopsy of the rash revealed necrotizing vasculitis with eosinophils (Fig 3). Bone marrow biopsy showed marked eosinophilia with immature eosinophils.

### Distinguishing DRESS syndrome from drug rash and eosinophilia: beyond regiSCAR criteria [^114RGm6z]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

Unplanned readmission rates for all patients 6 months after the diagnosis were high (n = 61, 49.2%), and there were no differences between groups (P = 0.1823) (Table I). Mortality during admission was higher in the DRESS group, at 3 (7.5%) of 40 versus 1 (1.25%) of 80, but there was no difference in survival throughout the follow-up period (Fig 3). This may have related to the significant comorbidities in the patients in the DRE group. One patient developed chronic relapsing DRESS, and 3 patients experienced recurrent DRESS on inadvertent reexposure to culprit or structurally related drugs.

Fig 3
Survival over time in DRESS versus DRE groups.

In the DRESS group, 79.6% of patients had their allergy listed on their discharge summary, but only 29.6% patients had a statewide clinical alert completed. Having specialist immunology or dermatology input during the admission did not alter this.

Of the 26 patients with DRESS resulting from antibiotic therapy; only 9 (34.6%) proceeded to have allergy testing performed. Of these 9 tested patients, 7 (77.8%) tested positive to either the culprit or a structurally related drug. In 17.5% of DRESS patients, longitudinal follow-up revealed tolerance of structurally related antibiotics despite testing only being performed in 2 patients (Table III).

Table III
Structurally related antibiotics tolerated in DRESS

Within the DRE group, 33 patients had rash and eosinophilia, but without any organ involvement. Subgroup analysis of these patients compared to the DRESS group did not reveal any additional findings.

### Differentiating between a prasugrel-induced hypersensitivity reaction and an atorvastatin-induced DRESS syndrome in the post-percutaneous coronary intervention setting [^113XCjzW]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Statins and P2Y12 inhibitors, such as prasugrel, are first-line therapies with significant mortality benefits after acute coronary syndrome, with dual-antiplatelet therapy recommended in the first month-to-year postdrug-eluting stent placement to prevent in-stent thrombosis. Although rare, hypersensitivity reactions to these agents warrant attention. Statins, particularly atorvastatin, have been associated with isolated case reports of DRESS syndrome. Conversely, although clopidogrel, another P2Y12 inhibitor, has been implicated in DRESS syndrome, prasugrel has not been previously reported as a causative agent. However, several reports of prasugrel-induced exanthematous hypersensitivity reactions have been documented, including one describing liver involvement and peripheral eosinophilia — features that may represent undiagnosed DRESS syndrome. Although DRESS syndrome typically presents 2 to 8 weeks after the initiation of the offending medication, shorter latency periods have been documented in the literature, particularly in older patients and those with multiple comorbidities. Additionally, although DRESS may take weeks to months to resolve after cessation of the offending drug, prasugrel-associated hypersensitivity reactions typically resolve within a few days.

Concurrent initiation of both medications complicates identification of the culprit drug. Considering that the majority of existing reports of prasugrel hypersensitivity reactions do not present with organ involvement, the patient's eosinophilia and liver involvement favor a diagnosis of DRESS syndrome. The higher frequency of atorvastatin-associated DRESS reported in the literature also increases suspicion of atorvastatin as the more likely offending agent. As concurrent drug reactions could not be ruled out, the decision was made to continue the alternative P2Y12 inhibitor, clopidogrel, and discontinue atorvastatin, as alternative lipid-lowering agents could considered after resolution of acute illness. Given that poststent patients are started on multiple drugs for mortality reduction, laboratory monitoring in the presence of morbilliform rash after coadministration of atorvastatin and prasugrel should be considered.

### Aggressive treatment in paediatric or young patients with drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DiHS) / drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is associated with future development of type III polyglandular autoimmune syndrome [^112Y8HWt]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis

There are a number of differential diagnostic considerations in children; they include Kawasaki disease and viral eruptions, which show unexplained illness that includes rash, fever and lymphadenopathy. In particular, there is an emerging recognition that some children with DiHS/DRESS have been misdiagnosed as Kawasaki disease and erroneously treated by high doses of IVIG within the first 10 days of fever onset.

---

### Modafinil-induced drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome [^112tMjZY]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Symptoms of DRESS syndrome typically begin 2 to 6 weeks after administration of a causative agent. In this case, rash and fever developed approximately 3 weeks after the initiation of modafinil. Although the patient received multiple medications — including antibiotics, vasopressors, insulin, furosemide, and amantadine — during his hospitalization, modafinil was the only new medication that was initiated in the 2- to 6-week window before symptom onset.

Cutaneous manifestations of DRESS syndrome usually consist of a morbilliform rash with macules and papules that begin in the face and spread cephalocaudally. However, pustules, vesicles, and bullae may also be seen. Patients may develop facial edema and internal organ involvement, most commonly seen in the hepatobiliary, renal, and hematologic systems. In this case, the patient developed abnormal liver function tests, an acute kidney injury, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after discontinuation of modafinil and treatment with systemic steroids.

DRESS syndrome is often diagnosed clinically, as histology can be nonspecific. Given that many symptoms of DRESS syndrome can be seen with systemic infections, a thorough infectious workup must be completed. The RegiSCAR has established diagnostic criteria to determine the likelihood of DRESS syndrome. In this case, our clinical diagnosis was supported by a RegiSCAR score of 6 suggesting definite DRESS syndrome: fever ≥ 38.5 °C (0), no lymphadenopathy (0), no atypical lymphocytes (0), eosinophilia (+1), rash affecting greater than 50% body surface area (+1), facial edema and scaling (+1), no biopsy (0), internal organ involvement (+2), disease duration ≥ 15 days (0), and 3 or more negative biologic investigations (+1).

### Distinguishing DRESS syndrome from drug rash and eosinophilia: beyond regiSCAR criteria [^111cVyZZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

A new scoring algorithm combining eosinophil count, high-sensitivity CRP, and total body surface area rash involvement, known as the CET score, has recently been evaluated as a diagnostic tool in DRESS syndrome. It has been found to have a positive predictive value of 80.5% for DRESS syndrome compared to maculopapular exanthems. In contrast, we did not find CRP to be significantly different between our cohorts; we were unable to analyze total body surface given the retrospective nature of our study.

We found that patients with DRESS were also more likely to require systemic corticosteroid therapy compared to those with DRE, but there was no difference in overall survival throughout the follow-up period. This finding is not surprising given the importance of corticosteroid treatment for the management of DRESS syndrome; however, a higher mortality rate may have been anticipated in the DRESS group. During follow-up, 7 patients with DRESS were found to have tolerated structurally related antibiotics. Cross-reactivity patterns in β-lactam DRESS are poorly understood, and as a result, recommendations are to avoid all β-lactam antibiotics until standardized testing in a specialized center is performed. Similarly, there may be a low but detectable risk of cross-reactivity among the glycopeptide class, but this requires further study. We provide some real-world data on future tolerance to structurally related antibiotics in DRESS suggesting that these may be tolerated in some patients, thus highlighting the importance of follow-up drug allergy testing in specialist centers. Of concern, however, is the fact that 3 patients developed recurrent DRESS after inadvertent reexposure to either the culprit drug or a related drug, and although most patients had their adverse drug reaction recorded on their discharge summary, few had a statewide clinical alert for their allergies completed or follow-up allergy testing arranged. In Australia, we have a statewide clinical alert system, which ensures that allergy recording extends beyond individual hospital systems. Development and implementation of standardized management protocols for DRESS may help improve drug allergy labeling, improve specialist testing, and prevent inadvertent reexposure and recurrent DRESS.

### Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome to hemodialysis polysulfone membrane [^113qyW4e]. Seminars in Dialysis (2024). Medium credibility.

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a severe and potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction. Although commonly associated with specific drugs, there have been no reports of DRESS syndrome caused by medical devices. We report a unique case of DRESS syndrome linked to a particular hemodialysis membrane during treatment. An 83-year-old man on hemodialysis exhibited fever, rash, and elevated eosinophils. Despite medication changes and consultations with specialists, his condition persisted. A drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test revealed a positive response to the dialysis membrane. His symptoms and lab results met DRESS syndrome diagnostic criteria. After substituting the membrane and administering glucocorticoids, the patient displayed early improvement. Diagnosing DRESS syndrome is complex due to its varied presentation and lack of specific benchmarks. This instance underscores the need to consider medical devices as potential DRESS syndrome triggers. Enhanced physician awareness can facilitate prompt detection and proper management, ultimately refining patient outcomes.

### Allopurinol-induced DRESS syndrome presented as a cholecystitis-like acute abdomen and aggravated by antibiotics [^1173AZw2]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction characterised by generalised skin rash, fever, lymph node enlargement and haematological abnormalities, in addition to multiorgan involvement. However, diagnosis can be challenging, with rare cases presenting as an acute abdomen. Its aetiopathogenesis is not fully understood but inefficient drug detoxification, deregulated immune responses, reactivation of host viruses and genetic predisposition appear to be important. Furthermore, it has been recently recognised that antibiotics may act as promoters of DRESS syndrome caused by another drug. We report the case of a 48-year-old man, receiving allopurinol, who developed DRESS syndrome, initially presenting with a cholecystitis-like acute abdomen that was triggered by antibiotics. This report also emphasises the utility of performing patch skin tests to establish drug imputability.

### Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome in a patient taking lamotrigine [^116KRxHe]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a rare adverse drug reaction characterised by skin eruption and multiple organ involvement. Diagnosing this entity is challenging due to the variability of clinical manifestations, late onset and relapse even after stopping the causative drug. It is potentially life-threatening; thus, it must be promptly recognised and the causative drug withdrawn. We describe a case of a 50-year-old man with an acute diffuse rash, fever and eosinophilia 4 weeks after having started lamotrigine. The suspected eliciting drug was suspended and systemic corticoid treatment was initiated (prednisolone 0.5mg/kg/day). Symptoms relapsed under corticoid tapering with greater severity. The patient developed an exuberant rash associated with peripheral lymphadenopathies, marked eosinophilia and hepatic cytolysis. The diagnosis of DRESS syndrome to lamotrigine was made. Prednisolone dosage was increased to 1mg/kg/day, and the subsequent taper was performed slowly over the course of 10 weeks. Full clinical remission was observed.

### DRESS syndrome presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and delayed eosinophilia [^112qbRFh]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Background

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a severe and life-threatening drug reaction that affects the skin and multiple internal organs. It is seen in 1 in 1000 to 10 000 drug exposureswith a mortality rate of up to 10%. The onset and duration of DRESS are longer than other drug reactions, with symptoms presenting between 2 and 8 weeks following drug exposure. Symptoms typically include fever, lymphadenopathy, acute rash, blood cell count abnormalities and involvement of at least one internal organ. Viral reactivation of human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus is also commonly seen in DRESS syndrome.

The RegiSCAR (European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions) scoring system is used to determine the probability of DRESS syndrome. Depending on the score, cases of DRESS are categorised as no case, possible case, probable case or definite case. The Japanese drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS) criteria include reactivation of HHV-6 as an additional criterion and classify cases as either typical or atypical. Finally, Bocquet's criteria are based on the presence of skin eruption, blood eosinophilia or the presence of atypical lymphocytes and internal organ involvement, including lymphadenopathies, hepatitis, interstitial nephritis, interstitial pneumonia or carditis. A diagnosis of DRESS syndrome using Bocquet's criteria requires the presence of all three features.

DRESS syndrome has been previously described in patients after taking a variety of medications, with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anticonvulsants and antibiotics being the most common culprits. The incidence of DRESS syndrome in the setting of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is an estimated 1 in every 1000 to 10 000 exposures, with antibiotics attributed to 74% of cases and sulfonamides compromising 3% of these cases. However, over 40 medications have been implicated in the development of DRESS syndrome. Atypical DRESS syndrome can present without meeting the diagnostic criteria and therefore requires a high level of clinical suspicion. Here, we present a severe case of atypical DRESS syndrome caused by TMP-SMX that manifested with a rash and unusually extensive lung involvement.

### Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms / drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome: clinical features of 27 patients [^1127Rq3M]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) [also called drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS)] includes severe reactions to drugs that need to be promptly recognized by physicians.

Aim

To explore heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of DRESS/DIHS at a large academic hospital in Latin America, using the criteria defined by the European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (RegiSCAR) scoring system.

Methods

A retrospective medical record review of 60 patients with diagnostic suspicion of DRESS/DIHS admitted to our hospital between July 2008 and April 2012 was performed, including demographic data, clinical features, laboratory findings and treatment.

Results

Of the 60 patients, 27 fulfilled the criteria for DRESS/DIHS. Maculopapular exanthema (85.1%), fever (96.2%) and hepatic involvement (85.1%) were the most common features. Anticonvulsants were the most common causal drugs (77.7%); Phenytoin was the most common individual drug (44.4%), followed by carbamazepine (29.6%). All patients were treated initially with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day. Mortality rate was 4%.

Conclusion

The major findings of this study (to our knowledge the largest collection of data on DRESS/DIHS in Latin America) include a positive statistical association between presence of atypical lymphocytes and higher levels of alanine aminotransferase (P < 0.001) and reinforce the importance of anticonvulsants in the pathogenesis of this severe reaction.

### Rufinamide [^116JBiAR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Multi-organ Hypersensitivity/Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including rufinamide. DRESS may be fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved.

All cases of DRESS identified in clinical trials with rufinamide occurred in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age, occurred within 4 weeks of treatment initiation, and resolved or improved with rufinamide discontinuation. DRESS has also been reported in adult and pediatric patients taking rufinamide in the postmarketing setting.

If DRESS is suspected, the patient should be evaluated immediately, rufinamide should be discontinued, and alternative treatment should be started.

5.5 Withdrawal of AEDs

As with all antiepileptic drugs, rufinamide should be withdrawn gradually to minimize the risk of precipitating seizures, seizure exacerbation, or status epilepticus. If abrupt discontinuation of the drug is medically necessary, the transition to another AED should be made under close medical supervision. In clinical trials, rufinamide discontinuation was achieved by reducing the dose by approximately 25% every 2 days.

5.6 Status Epilepticus

Estimates of the incidence of treatment emergent status epilepticus among patients treated with rufinamide are difficult because standard definitions were not employed. In a controlled Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome trial, 3 of 74 (4.1%) rufinamide-treated patients had episodes that could be described as status epilepticus in the rufinamide-treated patients compared with none of the 64 patients in the placebo-treated patients. In all controlled trials that included patients with different epilepsies, 11 of 1,240 (0.9%) rufinamide-treated patients had episodes that could be described as status epilepticus compared with none of 635 patients in the placebo-treated patients.

### Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome identified in the electronic health record allergy module [^1171bxZT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a rare but severe hypersensitivity reaction that remains poorly characterized in the United States.

Objective

To identify and describe DRESS syndrome cases in an integrated health care system using electronic health record (EHR) allergy module free-text searches.

Methods

We identified DRESS syndrome cases with rash, absolute eosinophil count of 500/L or more, organ involvement, and a European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions to Drugs and Collection of Biological Samples score of 2 or more by reviewing those patients from 1980 to 2016 whose EHR allergic reaction matched DRESS-related key words. Liver injury required alanine aminotransferase level of 100 U/L or more, and renal injury required creatinine increase by 0.5 mg/dL (or 50%) or more. Patient and DRESS characteristics were described, resource use was determined, and cost was estimated.

Results

Among 3,162,562 patients with 3,319,387 million allergy entries, 538 reactions matched key words, and 69 were DRESS syndrome cases (prevalence 2.18 per 100,000). Patients with DRESS had liver (42%) or renal (42%) injury; 11 (16%) had both liver and renal injury. Primary drug culprits were antibiotics (74%) (vancomycin [39%], β-lactams [23%], fluoroquinolones [4%], tetracyclines [4%], and sulfonamides [3%]) and anticonvulsants (20%). Of 65 (94%) hospitalized patients with DRESS, 43 (66%) were hospitalized for DRESS syndrome management with median length of stay of 9 days (interquartile range, 6–17 days) and cost approximately $17,101 per patient.

Conclusions

Using free-text search of the EHR allergy module identified a large US DRESS syndrome cohort. DRESS prevalence was 2.18 per 100,000 patients. Both liver and kidney injury were frequent, and vancomycin was the most common drug culprit. DRESS cases were morbid and resource-intensive.

According to the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale (score = 7), the cutaneous reaction was probably drug induced given that it occurred after administration of the drug, followed a recognized response to the suspected drug, improved with withdrawal of the drug, and could not be attributed to another clinical cause. Findings were consistent with a diagnosis of definite DRESS syndrome per the European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (RegiSCAR) criteria. Modafinil was stopped, and the patient was initiated on 60 mg of oral prednisone daily. Rash, liver dysfunction, pulmonary dysfunction, acute kidney injury, and hypereosinophilia resolved over the next 3 weeks, and prednisone was gradually tapered.

### Pediatric drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms: a systematic review of the literature, with a focus on relapsing cases [^116mkMNx]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a severe cutaneous adverse drug reaction with systemic symptoms. This study aims to investigate clinical features, causative drugs, and available treatments for pediatric DRESS, particularly for relapsing cases.

Methods

A systematic search of the English and French literature on pediatric DRESS was conducted using the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane collaboration databases. Confirmed cases of pediatric DRESS fulfilling the RegiSCAR diagnostic criteria with a probable or a definite diagnosis were included.

Results

After full-text article review, 144 articles were included, representing a total of 354 pediatric patients with a mean age of 8.8 years. The mean time from the drug intake until the onset of the first symptom was 18.9 days. Antiepileptic drugs were the main trigger, followed by anti-infectious agents. Relapsing DRESS was reported in 17 children. In comparison to non-relapsing cases, relapsing patients had more comorbidities. The initial clinical presentation was more commonly erythroderma. Facial edema, fever, and enlarged lymph nodes in more than two sites were more commonly found in relapsing cases. Systemic steroids were more frequently administered.

Conclusion

Pediatric DRESS is a potentially severe adverse drug reaction. Antiepileptic agents are the most common causative agents. Fever, facial edema, lymph node enlargement, and pharyngeal and visceral involvement predicted DRESS reactivation in children. Corticosteroids were the mainstay of treatment.

### An unusual case of DRESS syndrome due to leflunomide [^112irPYY]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

The DRESS (drug rash, eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) syndrome, is a type of drug hypersensitivity syndrome, is a severe idiosyncratic reaction to several drugs, mainly antiepileptics and antibiotics, which can occasionally produce acute hepatic failure. In this article, the authors report a case of DRESS syndrome with severe exfoliative dermatitis with acute hepatitis associated with intake of leflunomide. Rapid diagnosis with withdrawal of offending agent is crucial for survival of these cases.

### A typical presentation of moxifloxacin-induced DRESS syndrome with pulmonary involvement: a case report and review of the literature [^112fvjJY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a kind of hypersensitivity drug reaction involving the skin and multiple organs. Symptoms are usually skin rash and fever, accompanied by eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytosis, and multiple organ failure. DRESS syndrome is marked by prolonged latency, and symptoms usually appear 2 to 6 weeks after the first exposure to the offending drug. There will still be a long course of disease with frequent recurrence after discontinuation of the involved drugs. It is often accompanied by reactivation of a latent human herpesvirus (HHV) infection. Drugs related to DRESS syndrome include but are not limited to anticonvulsants, antidepressants and antimicrobials. A recently published case series proposed that 15–37% of DRESS syndrome cases may be caused by antimicrobials. Sharifzadeh et al. analyzed 254 cases of antimicrobial-induced DRESS syndrome and found that 42.13% were induced by antituberculosis, 18.1% were induced by glycopeptides, and only 1.97% were induced by fluoroquinolone.

Lungs (8.9%) are less frequently involved in DRESS syndrome compared with the liver (86.7%) and kidney (17.8%), but pulmonary involvement may herald a more severe clinical course and higher mortality. In a systematic review, 22 cases of DRESS syndrome with pulmonary manifestations were collected, and none were credited to fluoroquinolone. The pattern of computerized tomography of pulmonary involvement has been described in the review, but information about changes in pulmonary function and alveolar lavage fluid was not mentioned. The differential diagnosis of a combination of peripheral eosinophilia, rash, and respiratory symptoms is so complicated that 50% of patients with DRESS syndrome were initially misdiagnosed and treated for infection. Therefore, it is important to study the characteristics of patients with lung involved of DRESS syndrome and to recognize them to stop offending medication and improve the outcome.

### Case report: atypical presentation of vancomycin induced DRESS syndrome: a case report and review of the literature [^111HXfeY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Due to the variability of clinical presentation of DRESS, a scoring system, the European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction Criteria (RegiSCAR), was proposed to aid diagnosis. The patient scored seven points according to the RegiSCAR criteria, including fever (one point), eosinophilia greater than 1500/uL (two points), skin involvement and biopsy suggesting drug eruption (two points), renal and lung involvements (two points), and negative testing for ANA, blood culture and hepatitis. This score categorized the probability of vancomycin induced DRESS syndrome as "Definite".

We also considered other diagnoses involving hypereosinophilia and multiple organ failures. Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA), previously Churg-Strauss, is a necrotizing vasculitis associated with severe asthma and eosinophilia. Features of EGPA include elevated Antineutrophil Cytoplasm Antibody (ANCA) (30–70% cases), tissue eosinophilia in BAL fluid, and intraluminal microthrombi and fibrinoid necrosis in skin biopsy. The patient had negative ANCA, absence of eosinophils in the BAL fluid, and absence of intraluminal microthrombi in skin biopsy, making EGPA a less likely option. Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is another entity which overlaps with DRESS. Secondary HES has a broad range of causes including parasitic infection, allergy and drug reactions. DRESS is currently classified as a subtype of drug induced HES. Alternatively, primary HES is a myeloproliferative disorder and involves neoplastic eosinophils with cytogenetic abnormalities. The peripheral blood smear of the patient did not demonstrate any lymphoid or myeloid lineage dysplasia that may be suggestive of primary HES. Stevens Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SJS/TEN) is a spectrum of severe drug reaction and features epidermal necrosis with epidermis detachment of at least 10% of body surface. The rash in this case did not involve any bullae, desquamative or erosive lesions, and its appearance was not suggestive of SJS/TEN. Kawasaki disease is another condition characterized with fever, rash and systemic organ involvement. Kawasaki disease has well defined criteria including polymorphic rash, conjuctival changes and lymphadenopathy, which are not present in this case.

### Morbilliform eruptions: differentiating low-risk drug eruptions, severe cutaneous adverse reactions, viral eruptions, and acute graft-versus-host disease [^117CH72v]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Systemic involvement is frequently observed in patients with DRESS/DiHS, with hepatic involvement being the most common. While renal injury is described, care should be taken to prevent misattribution, as vancomycin and allopurinol are more likely associated with direct nephrotoxicity rather than DRESS/DiHS syndrome. Peripheral eosinophilia is a common laboratory abnormality seen in the majority of DRESS/DiHS patients, with incidence ranging from approximately 50% to greater than 90% of cases across international cohorts. Atypical lymphocytes are also a classic feature, though they are variably present. Furthermore, whether leukopenia or leukocytosis is present often depends on the timing of the blood examination. Leukopenia is often observed earlier and leukocytosis later in the disease course of DRESS/DiHS. In older patients with DRESS/DiHS, cytopenias are more common. Additionally, patients with cytopenias were found to have a higher likelihood of rehospitalization, longer hospitalization, and mortality. Therefore, close observation of hematologic labs may be indicated in older patients to monitor for adverse clinical outcomes. Less commonly, pulmonary or cardiac involvement can be seen.

Multiple diagnostic criteria, including those set forth by Bocquet et al. the Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (RegiSCAR) study group, the Japanese Consensus Group, and Sontheimer and Houpt, can be utilized to determine the likelihood of a diagnosis of DRESS/DiHS (Table 3). No criteria have proven superior, although there is widespread agreement that one of these systems ought to be used to confirm DRESS/DiHS diagnosis. Of note, some criteria utilize human herpes virus reactivation 2–4 weeks after rash onset to assist with the diagnosis of DRESS/DiHS syndrome. However, US data suggest that reactivation is uncommon at the time of diagnosis and should not be used for early diagnosis. Currently, no criteria exist to elucidate drug causality, although a systematic approach to drug notoriety in DRESS/DiHS has been published. As described above, LTT can also be considered to test for a suspected causative drug. The DRESS-DiHS severity score (DDS) is a validated tool that can be used to assess the severity of DRESS/DiHS, predict clinical prognosis, and stratify by risk for complications.

### Case report: atypical presentation of vancomycin induced DRESS syndrome: a case report and review of the literature [^11217kE9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a severe hypersensitivity drug reaction involving the skin and multiple internal organ systems. The symptoms typically present with fever and skin rash, and rapidly progress to multiple organ failures. Vancomycin is a rare drug to cause DRESS syndrome with 23 cases reported to date.

Case presentation

We described a case of a 39 year-old man who was treated with vancomycin for osteomyelitis of the foot. The patient subsequently developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) followed by rash and acute interstitial nephritis. These symptoms were improved by withdrawal of vancomycin and a pulsed corticosteroid regimen. According to the European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction Criteria (RegiSCAR) (Kardaun et al, British Journal of Dermatology, 169:1071–1080, 2013), the probability of vancomycin induced DRESS syndrome was scored as "Definite". A literature search of vancomycin induced DRESS syndrome was also performed and the overall pulmonary involvement was estimated as 5%. To our knowledge, this was the first case reported with pulmonary involvement as the initial symptom.

Conclusion

This is the first case to report pulmonary manifestation as the initial symptom in vancomycin induced DRESS syndrome. Prompt recognition of this entity can expedite proper treatment and hasten recovery.

### Updates on the immunopathology and genomics of severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions [^111brhzk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)/drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS) cause significant morbidity and mortality and impede new drug development. HLA class I associations with SJS/TEN and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms/drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome have aided preventive efforts and provided insights into immunopathogenesis. In SJS/TEN, HLA class I-restricted oligoclonal CD8 + T-cell responses occur at the tissue level. However, specific HLA risk allele(s) and antigens driving this response have not been identified for most drugs. HLA risk alleles also have incomplete positive and negative predictive values, making truly comprehensive screening currently challenging. Although, there have been key paradigm shifts in knowledge regarding drug hypersensitivity, there are still many open and unanswered questions about SCAR immunopathogenesis, as well as genetic and environmental risk. In addition to understanding the cellular and molecular basis of SCAR at the single-cell level, identification of the MHC-restricted drug-reactive self- or viral peptides driving the hypersensitivity reaction will also be critical to advancing premarketing strategies to predict risk at an individual and drug level. This will also enable identification of biologic markers for earlier diagnosis and accurate prognosis, as well as drug causality and targeted therapeutics.

### Reticular rash in drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome: a clue to parvovirus B19 reactivation? [^112ynjsL]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The term drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) refers to a complex syndrome characterized by cutaneous lesions, eosinophilia, and systemic symptoms that may be triggered by different medications. The reaction takes place 2 to 6 weeks after the initial exposure to the culprit drug. Even after appropriate diagnosis and treatment have been conducted, patients may experience isolated or sequential relapses and slow clinical resolution that may be associated with viral reactivations of herpesvirus.

Parvovirus B19 is a small, nonenveloped single-stranded DNA virus of the Parvoviridae family. It is well known for its ability to persist in blood and bone marrow in immunocompromised patients due to different conditions, such as chemotherapy, HIV, congenital immunodeficiencies, and transplants. It can also be found in many tissues of immunocompetent patients, like the skin.

We describe 5 adult patients with DRESS syndrome who developed a rash in a lace-like pattern during the disease. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies found parvovirus B19 DNA in skin biopsy specimens obtained from the rash sites in all patients. Therefore, we hypothesize that an association between DRESS syndrome and Parvovirus B19 reactivation may exist.

### Treatment of prolonged drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome with dupilumab using a molecularly-guided approach [^1119vXKe]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a severe cutaneous adverse reaction characterized by an exanthem, fever, and hematologic and visceral organ involvementthat often requires prolonged high-dose systemic corticosteroid therapy. Targeted steroid-sparing therapies may be beneficial, particularly for patients with steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory DRESS or those at increased risk of corticosteroid-related adverse effects. Here we describe a case of prolonged DRESS in which skin molecular profiling via RNA in situ hybridization (RISH) guided the selection of dupilumab as an effective targeted steroid-sparing therapy.

### A typical presentation of moxifloxacin-induced DRESS syndrome with pulmonary involvement: a case report and review of the literature [^116oV5nH]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a kind of hypersensitivity drug reaction involving the skin and multiple internal organ systems. Moxifloxacin has rarely been reported to be a drug that is associated with DRESS syndrome. Lungs are less frequently involved in DRESS syndrome, but their involvements may herald more serious clinical processes. We present a rare typical case of moxifloxacin-induced DRESS syndrome with lungs involved. Valuable clinical data such as changes in the pulmonary imaging and pulmonary function tests was recorded. This case is important for the differential diagnosis of DRESS syndrome with lungs involved by providing clinical manifestations, CT imaging, pulmonary function tests, and biopsy pathological characteristics. The changes in pulmonary imaging and pulmonary function tests may help us understand the mechanism of DRESS syndrome further.

Case Presentation

We report a case of a 47-year-old woman who was treated with oral moxifloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia. The patient subsequently developed a cough, fever, liver injury, skin rash, hematologic abnormalities, and shortness of breath (SOB) followed by pharyngeal herpes and peripheral neuritis. These symptoms, clinical lab index, and CT scan of the lungs improved after the withdrawal of moxifloxacin. The probability of moxifloxacin-induced DRESS syndrome was rated as "Definite", with 7 scores graded by RegiSCAR. A literature search was also performed with "fluoroquinolones", "moxifloxacin", "ciprofloxacin", "levofloxacin", "delafloxacin", and "DRESS" or "drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS)" as the keywords that were put into PubMed. The overall pulmonary involvement was approximately 9.1% (1/11). It is a rare reported case of DRESS syndrome with pulmonary involvement induced by moxifloxacin. We summarized detailed clinical data, including pulmonary imaging and pulmonary function changes.

Conclusion

This is a rare reported case of DRESS syndrome with pulmonary involvement induced by moxifloxacin. Prompt recognition and correct diagnosis can promote appropriate treatment and accelerate recovery. This case is important for us as a reference in the differential diagnosis of DRESS syndrome and helps us further understand the mechanism of DRESS syndrome.

### Distinguishing DRESS syndrome from drug rash and eosinophilia: beyond regiSCAR criteria [^115huwnU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Laboratory parameters

Patients in the DRESS group had significantly higher ALT levels at peak (increase by a factor of 2.49 [95% CI, 1.56, 4.00; p = 0.009]). The difference between peak ALT magnitude remained significant when corrected for baseline ALT levels (mean 272 vs 81.1 U/L, P = 0.0498) (Fig 2). There was no significant difference in GGT, ALP, or bilirubin levels at baseline, diagnosis, and peak between the 2 groups.

In keeping with the RegiSCAR criteria, patients with DRESS had significantly higher peak eosinophil counts (increased by a factor of 2.36 [95% CI, 1.72, 3.23; P < .001]), which remained significant when corrected for the baseline eosinophil level (increase by factor 2.42 [95% CI, 1.66, 3.51; P < .001], Fig 2). Almost all patients had peak eosinophilia, which occurred after the diagnosis was made (87.9%). The median time from diagnosis to peak eosinophilia was 4 days. Atypical lymphocytes were seen in 7 patients (15.9%) in the DRESS group and were not detected in any of the DRE patients (P = 0.019).

Renal involvement was seen in 11.3% of the DRESS group compared to 8.75% in the DRE group. There was no significant difference in creatinine levels between the 2 groups.

Other laboratory values including lymphocyte, ferritin, CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, sodium, hemoglobin, neutrophil, and platelet levels were not significantly different between the groups (P > .05). There were insufficient numbers to analyze results on virus serology, procalcitonin, or serum IgE levels.

### Sensitivity and specificity of the lymphocyte transformation test in drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms causality assessment [^112WoKuR]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a severe delayed hypersensitivity reaction. The determination of drug causality is complex. The lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) has been reported positive in more than 50% of DRESS cases. Nevertheless, the sensitivity and specificity of LTT specifically in DRESS have not yet been established. Rechallenge with the culprit drug is contraindicated and cannot be used as gold standard for sensitivity and specificity determination.

Objective

To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of LTT in a clinically defined series of patients with DRESS.

Methods

Some 41 patients diagnosed with DRESS were included in the study. The results of the algorithm of the Spanish Pharmacovigilance System were used as the standard for a correct diagnosis of drug causality. A standard LTT was performed with involved drugs in acute or recovery samples. A stimulation index (SI) ≥ 2 in at least one concentration except for beta-lactams (SI ≥ 3) and contrast media (SI ≥ 4) was considered positive. Contingency tables and ROC curves were used for analysis.

Results

Sensitivity and specificity of LTT in the recovery phase of DRESS were 73% and 82%, respectively, whereas in the acute phase, they were only 40% and 30%, respectively. Comparison of skin tests and LTT confirmed a higher sensitivity and specificity of LTT in DRESS. LTT showed high sensitivity (S) and specificity (Sp) for anticonvulsants (S 100%, Sp 100%; p = 0.008), anti-TB drugs (S 87.5%, Sp 100%; p = 0.004), and beta-lactams (S 73%, Sp 100%; p = 0.001). ROC curves revealed that the best criteria for LTT positivity for all drugs are SI ≥ 2 in at least one concentration, increasing overall sensitivity to 80%, and for beta-lactams from 73% to 92%.

Conclusions and Clinical Relevance

LTT is a good diagnostic tool for drug causality in DRESS, mainly when performed in the recovery phase.

### Unravelling cases of clozapine-related drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) in patients reported otherwise: a systematic review [^113Rofut]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction.

Aims

Aim was to review reports of clozapine-related reactions fulfilling the registry of severe cutaneous adverse reaction (RegiSCAR) criteria for DRESS syndrome reported as such or otherwise, to provide a descriptive overview of demographic patterns, clinical manifestations, and DRESS course and investigate associations between demographic, DRESS parameters, and clinical outcomes.

Methods

This review was conducted following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42020156385). We searched PubMed/Embase/PsychInfo/Cochrane for reports of clozapine-related reactions meeting RegiSCAR criteria. Associations between RegiSCAR scores and time-to-recovery with demographic/clinical variables were assessed. Demographic/clinical characteristics of patients with versus without reported DRESS were compared using non-parametrical tests.

Results

We identified 26 reports of 27 patients meeting RegiSCAR criteria. Males (n = 19, 70.4%) and patients with schizophrenia (n = 18, 66.7%) were mainly affected. Twelve patients (44.4%) received clozapine-monotherapy. DRESS symptoms manifested within a month after clozapine initiation (n = 24, 88.9%). Lungs and liver were the most common organs involved (n = 12, 44.4%; n = 11, 40.7%), with a mean time to recovery of 33.75days. Clozapine rechallenge led to DRESS recurrence in four patients. Death rate was 7.4%. No associations were detected between RegiSCAR criteria or days to recovery with any demographic/clinical variables. No differences between patients with versus without reported DRESS were detected.

Conclusions

Clozapine-related DRESS may be rare, but also underreported. Clinicians need to be aware of it even in patients under clozapine-monotherapy or without skin rash.

### Nivolumab-associated DRESS in a genetic susceptible individual [^112SZiE3]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

DRESS is a severe adverse drug reaction characterized by extensive rash accompanied with multiple visceral organ involvement, eosinophilia, and lymphadenopathy. Though rare, a mortality rate up to 10% of DRESS syndrome was reported. Due to the heterogenous nature and a general lack of physician knowledge of this condition, DRESS syndrome is undoubtedly globally underdiagnosed. Currently, two diagnostic criteria have been proposed by the International Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions group and the Japanese Consensus Group: the RegiSCAR criteria and the Japanese Consensus Group criteria. There is no fundamental difference between the two criteria, but the HHV-6 reactivation is not included in the RegiSCAR criteria. Except for the documented fever, our patient presented with typical DRESS clinical pictures: rash, eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy, pulmonary involvement, and stepwise development of renal failure as well as sequential herpesvirus activation. These prolonged clinical symptoms after the initiation of nivolumab substantiates nivolumab as an inciting agent of DRESS. In previous literature, the most frequently reported culprit drugs were aromatic anticonvulsants (carbamazepine and phenobarbital), antibiotic sulfonamides (dapsone and sulfamethoxazole) and allopurinol. Documented ICIs as offending drugs for DRESS syndrome were rare. To our knowledge, there is one case of nivolumab-associated DRESS, one case of ipilimumab-related DRESS, and one case of ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab-associated DRESSin published literature. Our case is different from the aforementioned cases because (1) this is the first case that showed HLA genotypes may lay the genetic susceptible foundation for ICI-induced DRESS; (2) this case displayed a typically prolonged course with stepwise development of organ damage and sequential herpesvirus activation in ICI-related DRESS; and (3) we had a comprehensive immune status assessment both in blood and renal tissue to better understand the mechanisms. Luckily, all the four ICI-related DRESS cases were responsive to high dosage of steroids therapy, indicating rapid recognition and timely steroid therapy are the cornerstones for DRESS syndrome.

### Distinguishing DRESS syndrome from drug rash and eosinophilia: beyond regiSCAR criteria [^1138u3UL]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

A retrospective search of Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital medical record coding classifications from 2008 to 2023 was performed to identify patients with DRESS and drug reaction with eosinophilia not fulfilling DRESS criteria (DRE) using international coding classifications (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, aka ICD-10): drug-induced fever (R502), generalized skin eruption due to drugs or medicaments (L270), and eosinophilia (D721). Patient details were collected from medical records of inpatient and outpatient visits, and laboratory results were accessed. All DRESS cases were confirmed by RegiSCAR criteria and were included only if they fit probable or definite DRESS classification (RegiSCAR ≥ 4). All other cases were characterized as DRE.

Liver involvement was defined as elevation in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT), or bilirubin > 1.5 times the upper limit of normal; renal involvement was defined as a serum creatinine > 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. Time of diagnosis was the date of rash development. Baseline laboratory parameters were defined as the lowest result available for ALT, ALP, GGT, bilirubin, creatinine, and eosinophils within 1 year before or after reaction onset; peak parameters were defined as the highest result for ALT, ALP, GGT, bilirubin, creatinine, eosinophils, and C-reactive protein (CRP) that occurred within 1 month before or 3 months after onset of reaction. Clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters of the 2 groups were compared. The study was approved by the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital Quality and Safety Committee (GEKO 28972).

Data were summarized using means and standard deviations (SDs) for normally distributed variables, medians and interquartile ranges for nonnormally distributed variables, or counts and proportions for categorical variables. Associations between DRESS versus DRE patients and clinical features were assessed by the Fisher exact test where appropriate. For continuous measures, differences between the DRESS and DRE groups were assessed with 2-sample t tests; quantities that exhibited considerable positive skew were log-transformed or symmetric log high-transformed for measures that had zeroes. A large number of hypothesis tests were conducted to compare the DRESS and DRE groups; to mitigate type I error, all reported P values have been adjusted with the Holm procedure. All analyses were performed by R v4.3.1 statistical software (R Project;), and statistical significance was set at P < .05.

### Psychotropic drug-related eosinophilia with systemic symptoms after acute caffeine ingestion [^116KDraM]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Drug-related eosinophilia with systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a potentially life-threatening, multiorgan condition that can result from drug treatment. Antiepileptic medications have provided the best-studied link of any class of medications. Here, we report the case of a 16-year-old boy with long-standing bipolar disorder who was chronically treated with aripiprazole and fluoxetine and developed DRESS syndrome after ingestion of high doses of caffeine. His classic presentation with fever, morbilliform rash, lymphadenopathy, and visceral involvement, including leukocytosis, eosinophilia, and hepatitis, was consistent with this diagnosis. Furthermore, the patient's symptoms dramatically improved after corticosteroid therapy and discontinuation of all psychotropic medications. We propose that the development of DRESS syndrome is a net result of inconsistent medication adherence coupled with the ingestion of near-toxic doses of caffeine, which can lead to rhabdomyolysis and, through renal impairment, lead to the accumulation of toxic oxidative metabolites of either or both psychotropic medications. We also present one of the few reported cases of caffeine-induced rhabdomyolysis and propose its role in the development of DRESS in this patient.

### DRESS syndrome caused by efalizumab [^116XdEkw]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

We report a case of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) to efalizumab. A 52-year-old man developed a widespread papulovesicular rash after 4 weeks of treatment with efalizumab (1.0 mg/kg/week) for treatment-resistant severe psoriasis. Histology revealed a subepidermal blister with eosinophil-rich inflammatory cell infiltrate. Subsequently, the patient developed high peripheral eosinophilia, abnormal liver function, malaise and fever, all requiring inpatient admission. Efalizumab was discontinued immediately, but the rash persisted for 4 months and was only controlled by oral prednisolone at a dose of 30 mg/day. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of DRESS caused by efalizumab.

### Distinguishing DRESS syndrome from drug rash and eosinophilia: beyond regiSCAR criteria [^111Vpx3B]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the largest study examining an intermediate group of drug hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash and eosinophilia that do not fulfill the criteria for probable or definite DRESS. Two other studies have previously reported on similar but much smaller cohorts of patients. Pinto Gouveia et alreported on 34 patients whose disease appeared to have overlapping features between maculopapular exanthema and DRESS but did not fulfill RegiSCAR criteria for probable DRESS, and Momen et alcompared 19 patients with RegiSCAR < 3 (minor DRESS) with 26 patients with RegiSCAR > 4 (major DRESS). Both these studies, in keeping with our findings, reported that compared to a cohort of DRESS patients, these patients had a significantly shorter latency period between drug exposure and symptom onset. This is also in keeping with a recent systematic review that evaluated 151 cases of definite DRESS and demonstrated a latency of 24 days. In comparison to the other studies in our study, all cases were confirmed by detailed file review.

Consistent with our findings, higher peak eosinophil counts, higher ALT levels, and fever were also found to be significantly different in the major compared to minor DRESS group. We found ALT levels, as opposed to ALP or bilirubin levels, to be associated with DRESS, which is in keeping with the literature, which describes a hepatitic pattern of liver derangement to be most common. In contrast, our study found lower rates of facial swelling (5.6%) compared to the cohorts of Pinto Gouveia et aland Momen et al(respectively, 73% and 31.5%).

Numerous studies have reported an association between both the magnitude and presence of eosinophilia with cutaneous drug eruption severity. In 206 patients who developed eosinophilia during intravenous antibiotic therapy, patients who went on to develop a drug hypersensitivity reaction had an earlier onset of eosinophilia (11 vs 17 days) and a higher peak eosinophilia (0.857 vs 0.699). A number of other studies, both of DRESS and cutaneous adverse drug reactions, have shown a relationship between higher eosinophil counts and greater impairment of liver function, prolonged hospitalization, longer recovery time, and higher cumulative doses of corticosteroids.

### Alectinib-associated drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome [^1128o2YM]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

According to alectinib clinical trial data (600 mg orally twice daily) in 152 patients, the most common any-grade adverse events were anemia (22.4%), increased serum bilirubin (19.1%), peripheral edema (18.4%), elevated alanine aminotransferase (17.1%), and myalgia (16.4%). Any-grade cutaneous adverse events included photosensitivity (5.9%) and alopecia (0.7%). Few cases of severe rashes (eg, erythema multiforme) have been reported with alectinib.

Symptom onset for DRESS syndrome generally occurs 2 to 6 weeks after administering the causative agent, often beginning with fever several days before rash eruption. Our patient exhibited signs and symptoms after 2.5 weeks. The most common cutaneous manifestation is morbilliform rash, often first affecting the face, upper trunk, and upper extremities and later spreading to the lower extremities. As observed in our patient, this rash often progresses to exfoliative dermatitis with facial edema. Bullae, vesicles, pustules, purpura, cheilitis, erythroderma, or target lesions may be present. Other common features include lymphadenopathy, hematologic abnormalities (eg, eosinophilia, leukocytosis), and abnormal liver function test results that can mimic viral hepatitis.

Diagnosis is primarily clinical as histology is often nonspecific. Latency, symptom diversity, and exclusion of other drug-induced complications must be considered. High index of suspicion should be given with fever, rash, liver involvement, eosinophilia, and lymphadenopathy. Each of these manifested in our patient. Bocquet et alproposed the original DRESS syndrome diagnostic criteria. Since then, criteria have also been suggested by the European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactionsand the Japanese Research Committtee. Diagnosis in our patient was further supported by a Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions score of 6: afebrile (-1); lymph node enlargement (+1); atypical lymphocytes (+1); eosinophilia (+2); rash affecting greater than 50% body surface area (+1); edema and scaling (+1); biopsy suggestive of DRESS, unknown (0); internal organ involvement (+1); resolution delay of greater than15 days (0); 3 or more negative biologic investigations, unknown (0). A score of 6 or more is definite DRESS syndrome.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^116CCw2F]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Penicillin hypersensitivity — classification, timing, and acute manifestations: "Hypersensitivity reactions to penicillin are classifiable as immediate or nonimmediate according to their clinical manifestation, time since the last drug administration, and the onset of symptoms". Immediate reactions are "predominantly IgE-mediated" and "can occur within 6 hours after the last drug administration but typically occur within 1 hour of the first dose of a new treatment course". Acute symptoms include "urticaria, angioedema, conjunctivitis, respiratory symptoms (rhinitis, bronchospasm, cough, dyspnea), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), and/or anaphylaxis". Nonimmediate reactions "occur more than 1 hour after the initial drug exposure, and they often develop days to weeks after medication initiation", with manifestations that include "maculopapular or morbilliform exanthems" and can also present as "delayed urticaria/angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and more severe bullous exanthems such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)". The multisystem presentation "is termed drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome or drug rash (or reaction) with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)".

### Ethosuximide [^113i4i48]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multi organ hypersensitivity, has occurred with ethosuximide. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g. fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Ethosuximide should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.

### High-risk drug rashes [^1145SQTN]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a brief overview of the clinical presentation, common offending agents, management, prognosis, and mortality of 6 selected high-risk drug rashes, namely, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, multiple drug hypersensitivity (MDH) syndrome, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and drug-induced bullous pemphigoid (DIBP).

Data Sources

A review of the published literature was performed with PubMed and supplemented with our clinical experience.

Study Selections

The most recent clinically relevant studies and older seminal works were selected.

Results

Most of the published data on these uncommon rashes were based on small observational series or case reports. SJS and TEN have specific genotypes association with certain drugs, have high morbidity and mortality, and require aggressive management by a team of multiple specialists. DRESS syndrome is a severe, prolonged multiorgan reaction, yet it has a better prognosis than TEN. MDH is a syndrome of repeated reactions to unrelated drugs that often imposes diagnostic and management difficulties. AGEP consists of generalized sterile small pustules, usually mistaken for infection with subsequent inappropriate treatment. Bullous pemphigoid presents with tense pruritic bullae and characteristic linear basement membrane deposition of IgG and C3. DIBP has much better prognosis than the autoimmune variety.

Conclusion

In such high-risk drug rashes, early recognition, immediate withdrawal of the suspected drug(s), prompt individualized management, and monitoring of vital organs function are mandatory for reducing morbidity and mortality. The lack of reliable tests for identification of the causative agent imposes difficulty, particularly in patients receiving multiple medications.

### A typical presentation of moxifloxacin-induced DRESS syndrome with pulmonary involvement: a case report and review of the literature [^116SqgCb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

The patient in this case report did not take any new medications to cause the symptoms. There was no rash or fever during the patients' long-term use of oral anti-hypotension drugs, anti-diabetic drugs and anti-anxiety drugs. Therefore, these drugs were less likely to be the etiology of DRESS in this patient. The offending drug that caused DRESS in this patient was likely used before the outbreak of the rash, which points to the only drug added — moxifloxacin. The rash appeared 27 days after starting moxifloxacin, with a latency consistent with that reported by Kardaun SH et al. The culprit drug in our case was identified by reviewing the medication history and clinical course (rash and systemic symptoms improved after stopping moxifloxacin). Peripheral blood counts, liver function tests, the determination of serum creatinine levels and urinalyses were performed to identify any internal organ abnormalities. The serological detection of autoantibodies and pathogenic detection were performed to exclude other autoimmune or infectious diseases. Other possible skin diseases were ruled out by consulting a dermatologist and obtaining a skin biopsy. The lymphocyte transformation test and patch testing were helpful in finding the culprit drug associated with the DRESS. Unfortunately, these studies were not conducted in our case because the patient did not consent.

The exact mechanism of this syndrome is still unclear. It is believed that the drug-specific immune response induces virus reactivation and then activates cytotoxic CD8 + T lymphocytes, resulting in tissue damage. Human herpesvirus (HHV), Epstein–Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus reactivation have been observed during the acute phase of DRESS syndrome, which has led to suggestions of a pathogenic connection. PCR and serological antibodies against EBV were performed to exclude its activation. CMV-IgM antibody was negative, but CMV-IgG antibody was positive. The active state of CMV is unknown due to the lack of dynamic changes in CMV-IgG. Herpesvirus reactivation is also unknown limited by the detection ability of the institution.

Much work was done in this case to definitively diagnose DRESS syndrome in this case. Because of the different manifestations of DRESS syndrome and the involvement of different organs, a set of diagnostic criteria that can be easily applied in the clinic is needed. The RegiSCAR group has suggested a series of criteria to grade the possibility of DRESS syndrome. Our case is a definite case of DRESS syndrome according to the RegiSCAR group diagnosis scoring system because this case had a high score of 7 (Table 3).

### Advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) does not affect ability to utilize lymphadenopathy in assessment of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome in HIV and tuberculosis: prospective comparative study [^116u13WK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is an uncommon, potentially life-threatening, idiosyncratic reaction to a drug that is characterized by a rash with systemic features. It can arise anywhere between 2 and 8 weeks after drug initiation.DRESS presents as a morbilliform eruption associated with fever, lymphadenopathy, and hematologic abnormalities, and it can affect multiple internal organs. Lymphadenopathy, defined as lymph nodes (LNs) that are abnormal in size and consistency, is common in DRESS syndrome and is present in approximately 75% of cases. A focal or generalized presentation of lymphadenopathy is associated with DRESS syndrome, with a predilection to cervical, axillary, and inguinal nodes; further, the affected nodes may be tender. Criteria for case definition have been proposed by the Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction (RegiSCAR) study group and the Japanese Research Committee on Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction. Lymphadenopathy in at least 2 sites is included in both diagnostic criteria.

The RegiSCAR group has developed a diagnostic validation score, combining clinical and biological criteria for validation of potential DRESS cases. The score assigns each of the 8 major features a score ranging from −1 to 2 points, for a maximum score of 9 points. The certainty of diagnosis is based on the total score, as follows: < 2 points, no case; 2–3 points, possible case; 4–5 points, probable case; and > 5 points, definite case (see Table E1 in the Online Repository available at www.jaci-global.org). In the score, lymphadenopathy carries 1 point, and if absent, 0 points. A single point has the potential to affect the certainty of the DRESS diagnosis. Lymphadenopathy together with eosinophilia, fever, and liver injury have been significantly associated with a "probable" or "definite" case of DRESS.

During the latent phase of HIV infection, there is continuous depletion of lymphocytes and progressive involution of the germinal centers of LNs. Over time, the nodes become smaller or impalpable. It has been suggested that the nonresolving adaptive responses in HIV result in collagen deposition and fibrosis of LNs. However, it is not clear if this affects the detection of lymphadenopathy in HIV-associated DRESS. To answer this question, we decided to perform a prospective case–control study evaluating lymphadenopathy in HIV-infected and -uninfected patients with DRESS.

### Management of adult patients with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms… [^1163sV68]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the optimal diagnostic and severity assessment as well as management of patients with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. Findings In this 2-round international Delphi exercise, a panel of 54 experts agreed on 93 statements regarding DRESS diagnosis and management. These statements included recommendations on diagnostic workup and multidisciplinary involvement, severity assessment, drug management, treatment, and follow-up care, as well as allergological workup. Meaning DRESS is a complex, severe cutaneous adverse drug reaction that poses diagnostic and management challenges for clinicians; this consensus is aimed at providing needed support in diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of patients with DRESS. Importance Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms is a rare but potentially fatal drug hypersensitivity reaction. To our knowledge, there is no international consensus on its severity assessment and treatment.

Objective To reach an international, Delphi-based multinational expert consensus on the diagnostic workup, severity assessment, and treatment of patients with DRESS. Design, Setting, and Participants The Delphi method was used to assess 100 statements related to baseline workup, evaluation of severity, acute phase, and postacute management of DRESS. Fifty-seven international experts in DRESS were invited, and 54 participated in the survey, which took place from July to September 2022. In the first Delphi round, consensus was reached on 82 statements. Thirteen statements were revised and assessed in a second round. A consensus was reached for 93 statements overall. The experts agreed on a set of basic diagnostic workup procedures as well as severity- and organ-specific further investigations. They reached a consensus on severity assessment based on the extent of liver, kidney, and blood involvement and the damage of other organs.

The panel agreed on the main lines of DRESS management according to these severity grades. General recommendations were generated on the postacute phase follow-up of patients with DRESS and the allergological workup. Conclusions and Relevance This Delphi exercise represents, to our knowledge, the first international expert consensus on diagnostic workup, severity assessment, and management of DRESS. This should support clinicians in the diagnosis and management of DRESS and constitute the basis for development of future guidelines. © 2024 JAMA+ AI Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Association of human herpesvirus 6 infection with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms… [^113c7VGD]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

All consecutive adult patients hospitalized with DRESS syndrome were enrolled in this study. Criteria for diagnosis included clinical manifestations and biological manifestations. 6 Anamnestic data were collected. Mononuclear cells infected with HHV-6 were used as a target. A polymerase chain reaction procedure was performed on the first serum sample of each patient. Detection of HHV-6 DNA in the DNA extracted from skin lesions and uninvolved skin was done in the last patient with DRESS syndrome. The nested PCR was performed as previously reported.
7.

The absence of an increase in antibodies directed to other viruses excluded a nonspecific increase of antibodies due to polyclonal reactivation. In these cases IgM antibodies were not detected, suggesting a reactivation. 2, 3 In our 4 cases the presence of IgM antibodies and the detection of HHV-6 DNA in a skin lesion bring further arguments for an association of HHV-6 active infection and the development of DRESS. Our results support the hypothesis that HHV-6 infection is associated with some DRESS, but it is clear that the evidence of viremia remains the criterion standard for confirmation of an active infection. Comparisons between patients infected with HHV-6 and patients without active HHV-6 infection do not show major differences in clinical, biological, and histological manifestations.

We can propose that some DRESS may be the result of a cascade of successive events on a predisposed genetic background: HHV-6 infection; generation of anticytochrome P450 antibodies directed to some specific components (possibly cross reactivity between HHV-6 and some cytochrome. Conclusions Our results suggest that HHV-6 active infection is associated with some DRESS. Some drugs with reactive metabolites could favor reactivation and propagation of HHV-6. We propose to systematically look for HHV-6 infection in the patients with severe DRESS. The pathogenic role of HHV-6 infection in the development of the skin and visceral manifestations still needs to be demonstrated.

### Clarification… [^113tT6jc]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Unclear information regarding the correct diagnosis. The Photo Quiz "Pruritic Skin Rash and Fever" contained unclear information in the answers, discussion, and summary table. Although drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome is also known as anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome, it would have been more clear for the answer to have been DRESS syndrome, because the patient was taking allopurinol, a medication associated with DRESS syndrome, and not an anticonvulsant. The discussion should have clarified the medications often associated with DRESS syndrome. The online version of this Photo Quiz has been modified to address these issues.
