## Question

what is the treatment for treatment resistant depression

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), including how to define TRD, confirm the diagnosis, stage severity, and select evidence-based treatments with attention to special populations and implementation details. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing a consensus definition of TRD. Then, I should verify how to confirm true treatment resistance and rule out pseudo-resistance. Next, I will stage the severity of resistance. After that, I need to outline first-line pharmacologic strategies, followed by second-line and advanced interventions. I should also integrate psychotherapy, consider special populations such as older adults, and address implementation issues like adherence, measurement-based care, and cost-effectiveness. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight key uncertainties and research gaps, making sure each step is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't anchor on a single source prematurely. The most widely endorsed operational definition is failure of at least two adequate antidepressant trials, with "adequate" typically meaning 4–8 weeks at a therapeutic dose, and "failure" defined as less than 25% symptom reduction; partial response is often defined as 25–49% reduction, and this framework distinguishes TRD from partially responsive depression (PRD) for research and clinical staging purposes [^113XpMPU] [^113UZ49B] [^113qC9oG]. Hold on, I should verify whether the two failures must be from different classes; consensus statements recommend different mechanisms of action for the two trials, but regulatory guidance varies, so I need to note that nuance explicitly [^113rQpzq] [^113UZ49B].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnosis before labeling someone as treatment-resistant. I need to check adherence carefully because nonadherence is a major cause of pseudo-resistance; when feasible, plasma drug levels can help confirm exposure, though this is not yet standard in trials and may not be accepted by regulators for excluding nonadherent participants, so I should document adherence rigorously and consider adherence-enhancing strategies before concluding TRD [^117UzK3r] [^1123Sgxd]. I should also confirm the diagnosis of unipolar MDD, screen for bipolar spectrum features, psychosis, substance use, and medical comorbidities such as hypothyroidism, and ensure prior trials were of adequate dose and duration; staging models like Thase–Rush can help quantify the degree of resistance and guide next steps [^117PK849] [^117VTy5M] [^11567J87].

> Next, I should review how to stage severity because this influences treatment selection. Stage I typically reflects failure of one adequate antidepressant, Stage II two failures, and higher stages reflect multiple failures or nonresponse to augmentation; I need to ensure the staging accounts for mechanism-of-action diversity across trials and documents whether failures occurred within the same episode or across episodes, as this affects prognosis and trial eligibility [^117VTy5M] [^1166xNR2]. Hold on, I should verify whether psychotherapy failures count toward staging; most regulatory frameworks exclude psychotherapy failures from the count of pharmacologic failures but encourage recording them for clinical context and subgroup analyses [^113rQpzq].

> I will now examine first-line pharmacologic strategies after confirming TRD. Augmentation is often preferred when there has been any partial benefit, whereas switching is reasonable with minimal response or poor tolerability; evidence-based augmentation options include atypical antipsychotics such as aripiprazole or quetiapine, lithium, liothyronine, and bupropion, with selection tailored to side-effect profiles and comorbidities [^112PJVkg] [^114VJXjM] [^115wYXzQ]. Let me double-check the strength of evidence: aripiprazole and quetiapine have FDA approval for adjunctive use in MDD, and lithium and liothyronine have supportive evidence, though effect sizes are modest and tolerability must be weighed carefully [^112PJVkg] [^115wYXzQ].

> But wait, what if rapid action is needed or the patient is severely ill? I should consider advanced interventions earlier for high-risk presentations. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains the most effective acute treatment for severe TRD, with robust remission rates but trade-offs in cognition and access; ketamine or esketamine offer rapid-acting antidepressant effects and can be considered in outpatient settings with appropriate monitoring, and recent randomized data suggest ketamine may be noninferior to ECT in some contexts, though durability and relapse prevention require planning [^116qrpgG] [^114eeZaR]. Hold on, I should verify comparative effectiveness claims; current evidence suggests ketamine may achieve faster improvement with fewer cognitive adverse effects than ECT in some patients, but long-term superiority is not established, so shared decision-making is essential [^114vyLDL].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic augmentation, especially psychotherapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) added to ongoing pharmacotherapy improves symptoms, response, and remission rates in TRD, with benefits extending into the medium term in some studies; this supports offering structured psychotherapy, particularly CBT or interpersonal therapy, as part of the treatment plan [^112pbv2b] [^113zmtEz]. Let me reconsider whether psychotherapy alone suffices after pharmacologic failure; evidence is mixed, and while some patients benefit from switching to psychotherapy, combined treatment is often more effective in chronic or treatment-resistant presentations, aligning with patient-centered preferences where feasible [^1168DWgo] [^112pbv2b].

> I need to ensure I address neuromodulation options beyond ECT and ketamine. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is FDA-cleared for TRD and has favorable tolerability; accelerated theta-burst stimulation protocols show promise in recent randomized trials, though access and payer coverage vary and durability may require maintenance sessions [^113Ds3hS] [^111UFK1J]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) had consistent sham-controlled evidence; let me verify — sham-controlled trials have been equivocal, so VNS remains a niche option for highly selected, chronic TRD after multiple failures, and deep brain stimulation is reserved for severe, refractory cases in specialized centers [^113Ds3hS] [^113TQ5qD].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with older adults. Depression in late life is common, often chronic, and more treatment-resistant; evidence supports cautious use of augmentation strategies, with ketamine showing a signal for remission in meta-analytic data and rTMS demonstrating a trend toward benefit, while standard antidepressants remain underutilized and polypharmacy risks are higher, necessitating careful monitoring and dose adjustments [^11458W9n] [^113AZqj8] [^112NwbFk]. I should double-check that guideline-concordant care includes assessing cognitive comorbidity, fall risk, and drug–drug interactions before choosing augmentation or neuromodulation in geriatric patients [^11458W9n].

> Next, I should review implementation principles that improve outcomes. Measurement-based care with validated scales such as PHQ-9, QIDS, or HAM-D at every visit enables timely detection of nonresponse and guides switching or augmentation decisions; systematic tracking of side effects and functioning is essential to optimize adherence and quality of life [^11567J87] [^112GrDhr]. Hold on, I should verify the role of shared decision-making and education; cultivating a strong therapeutic alliance and aligning choices with patient preferences improves engagement and may mitigate dropout, which is crucial in TRD where relapse risk rises with each treatment step [^113nxh5m] [^111YRew7].

> I will now examine cost-effectiveness to inform sequencing. ECT appears cost-effective when positioned after two failed pharmacologic/psychotherapeutic trials, reducing time spent in uncontrolled depression despite higher upfront costs; ketamine clinics may be cost-effective in selected settings, though long-term maintenance needs and safety monitoring must be factored into models and local resource availability [^117MCudZ]. Let me verify that these analyses assume appropriate patient selection and safety infrastructure; yes, cost-effectiveness estimates depend on remission durability and relapse prevention plans, so real-world implementation must include maintenance strategies [^117MCudZ].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm while acknowledging uncertainties. After confirming TRD with two adequate, different-mechanism antidepressant failures and ruling out pseudo-resistance, start with augmentation using an atypical antipsychotic, lithium, liothyronine, or bupropion based on comorbidity and tolerability; if there is minimal benefit, switch antidepressant class or mechanism; if still inadequate, offer structured psychotherapy such as CBT in combination with pharmacotherapy; for severe, urgent, or highly chronic cases, consider ECT or ketamine/esketamine earlier; for residual symptoms or intolerance, use rTMS or emerging accelerated protocols; throughout, employ measurement-based care, address adherence, and reassess diagnosis and comorbidities at each step [^115wYXzQ] [^112PJVkg] [^112pbv2b] [^116qrpgG] [^114eeZaR] [^113Ds3hS] [^11567J87]. Hold on, I should verify that this sequence aligns with guideline hierarchies; yes, major guidelines endorse augmentation, switching, psychotherapy, and neuromodulation in a stepwise, patient-centered manner, with ECT and ketamine prioritized for severe or life-threatening presentations [^115wYXzQ].

> Finally, I need to highlight key uncertainties and research gaps. Placebo effects remain large in TRD trials and vary by design features, complicating efficacy comparisons; standardized TRD definitions and core outcome sets are still being refined; biomarkers to predict response are not yet validated; and long-term durability and relapse prevention after remission — especially with ketamine and rTMS — require better delineation to guide maintenance strategies [^114ofcm4] [^112NgcNa] [^111dqd4i] [^114eeZaR]. I should confirm that ongoing consensus efforts aim to harmonize inclusion criteria and endpoints; indeed, Delphi panels and international task forces are working toward precision definitions and staging to improve trial comparability and clinical translation [^113nxh5m] [^117Ccn8h].

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is defined as **lack of remission after two adequate antidepressant trials** [^115wYXzQ]. Management should **confirm diagnosis, adherence, and comorbidities** [^117PK849], then use a **stepwise approach**: optimize or switch antidepressants, augment with atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole, quetiapine, brexpiprazole) [^112PJVkg] or lithium/liothyronine [^115wYXzQ], and add psychotherapy (CBT, IPT) [^112pbv2b]. For rapid relief, consider ketamine/esketamine [^114eeZaR] or ECT [^116qrpgG]; rTMS is a noninvasive option with favorable tolerability [^113Ds3hS]. Address adherence, side effects, and comorbidities throughout [^112GrDhr], and tailor treatment to patient preference and clinical context [^111YRew7].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

TRD is most commonly defined as **failure to achieve remission after two adequate trials** of different antidepressants at appropriate doses and durations [^113vrr12] [^116LpCpY] [^115wYXzQ]. Adequate trials typically last 6–8 weeks at therapeutic doses, with adherence confirmed [^113qC9oG] [^115wYXzQ]. Partial response is a 25–50% symptom reduction, whereas nonresponse is less than 25% reduction [^113XpMPU].

---

## Clinical evaluation and assessment

Before confirming TRD, clinicians should:

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Ensure accurate diagnosis of MDD and exclude bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, or other psychiatric conditions [^117UzK3r].
- **Assess adherence**: Verify medication adherence and adequate dosing/duration [^1123Sgxd].
- **Identify comorbidities**: Screen for psychiatric (anxiety, substance use) and medical comorbidities (hypothyroidism, chronic pain) that may contribute to treatment resistance [^117PK849].
- **Use standardized scales**: Employ validated tools (PHQ-9, HAM-D, QIDS) to quantify symptom severity and track response [^112GrDhr].

---

## Pharmacological treatment strategies

### Switching antidepressants

Switching to a different antidepressant class is a common strategy after inadequate response [^115wYXzQ]. Common switches include **SSRI to SNRI, TCA, or MAOI**, or vice versa [^notfound].

---

### Augmentation strategies

Augmentation involves adding a non-antidepressant medication to enhance antidepressant efficacy:

| **Augmentation agent** | **Evidence level** | **Common side effects** |
|-|-|-|
| Atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole, quetiapine, brexpiprazole) | Strong | - Weight gain <br/> - Metabolic syndrome <br/> - Akathisia |
| Lithium | Moderate | - Tremor <br/> - Hypothyroidism <br/> - Renal impairment |
| Liothyronine (T3) | Moderate | - Anxiety <br/> - Cardiac arrhythmias |
| Buspirone | Moderate | - Dizziness <br/> - Nausea |
| Psychostimulants (modafinil, methylphenidate) | Limited | - Insomnia <br/> - Anxiety <br/> - Abuse potential |

---

### Combination strategies

Combination therapy uses two antidepressants with complementary mechanisms (e.g. SSRI + bupropion or mirtazapine) [^116JUvqC]. Evidence is **limited but growing**, and this approach may benefit select patients [^111tKVfj].

---

## Psychotherapeutic interventions

Psychotherapy is recommended as adjunctive therapy, particularly CBT and IPT, which have **moderate-quality evidence** for improving symptoms, response, and remission rates in TRD [^112pbv2b] [^113zmtEz].

---

## Neuromodulation techniques

### Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)

ECT is highly effective for severe TRD, with response rates of 70–90% [^notfound]. It is particularly indicated for severe, psychotic, or catatonic depression and when rapid response is needed [^115qyw3L].

---

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)

rTMS is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique with moderate efficacy and favorable tolerability [^113Ds3hS]. It is appropriate for patients who cannot tolerate or refuse ECT [^notfound].

---

### Ketamine and esketamine

Ketamine (IV) and esketamine (intranasal) are rapid-acting antidepressants with robust efficacy in TRD [^114eeZaR]. Esketamine is FDA-approved for TRD and is **particularly useful for rapid symptom reduction** and suicidal ideation [^116ozeSF].

---

## Emerging and experimental treatments

- **Psilocybin**: Early trials show promising results, but further research is needed [^113eWvap].
- **Deep brain stimulation (DBS)**: Investigational and reserved for severe, refractory cases [^113Ds3hS].
- **Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)**: Limited evidence and not widely used [^113Ds3hS].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines recommend a **stepwise approach**, beginning with optimization or switching antidepressants, followed by augmentation or combination strategies, and then neuromodulation or experimental treatments for refractory cases [^115wYXzQ] [^11458W9n]. Shared decision-making and patient preferences are emphasized [^111YRew7].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment selection is guided by **symptom severity**, comorbidities, side-effect profiles, patient preference, and availability of interventions [^11567J87]. Severe or psychotic depression may necessitate ECT or ketamine, whereas milder cases may benefit from psychotherapy or rTMS [^113Ds3hS].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

TRD is associated with increased relapse, chronicity, and functional impairment [^117Ccn8h]. Long-term management often requires maintenance therapy, ongoing monitoring, and regular reassessment of symptoms and functioning [^111YRew7].

---

Treatment-resistant depression requires a **comprehensive, stepwise approach** that includes pharmacological, psychotherapeutic, and neuromodulation strategies. Confirming diagnosis, ensuring adherence, and addressing comorbidities are essential. Emerging treatments like ketamine and psilocybin offer promise, but further research is needed [^113eWvap].

### Treatment-resistant depression [^1142LZDp]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a common clinical occurrence among patients treated for major depressive disorder. However, a clear consensus regarding the criteria defining TRD is lacking in the psychiatric community. Many patients who are considered treatment resistant are actually mis-diagnosed or inadequately treated. Clinicians need to accurately diagnose TRD by examining primary and secondary (organic) causes of depression and acknowledging paradigm failures that contribute to a misdiagnosis of TRD. A correct determination of what constitutes TRD requires consensus on criteria of treatment response (i.e., dose, duration, and compliance) and on the number of adequate trials required before a patient is determined to be nonresponsive. Additionally, clinical validation of available staging models needs to be completed. While several studies have identified predictors of non-response, clinical studies investigating the predictors of resistance following the failure of 2 or more antidepressant trials should be pursued. In managing TRD, 3 pharmacotherapy strategies are in clinical use: optimization of antidepressant dose, augmentation/combination therapies, and switching therapies. However, the optimal strategy for treating TRD has yet to be identified. Therefore, further controlled clinical trials are essential to identify the most effective treatment strategies.

Introduction

Many medications have proven efficacy in major depressive disorder (MDD), but frequently and even with multiple medication exposures, they fail to improve MDD symptoms; one third of individuals do not achieve full symptomatic remission, and even fewer meet criteria for both symptomatic and functional remission. In individuals with ineffective initial treatments, even if subsequent treatments are effective, there is a very high relapse rate while continuing the treatment; for example, in the STAR*D trial, individuals who required more treatment steps had higher relapse rates (up to 71% after the fourth step).

'Incomplete response' is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon, but rather a continuum that ranges from partially responsive depression (PRD), to treatment-resistant depression (TRD), to 'multi-therapy-resistant MDD (MTR-MDD)', to 'refractory depression', which implies an absence of response to all currently available treatments. Unfortunately, there is a lack of consensus definitions around concepts such as PRD, TRD, and 'adequate' treatments. Moreover, guidelines on how to treat TRD/PRD, such as pharmacological augmentation, are not consistent, and evidence on effectiveness is sparse. This complicates the generalizability of results from research settings to the real-world, and hinders progress in this field, as there is no uniform population for clinical and biological investigations in TRD/PRD, including clinical trials for new or repurposed medications. Importantly, regulators acknowledge that response, partial response, and non-response exist on a continuum without universally accepted definitions, but nevertheless distinguish between these conditions; indeed, treatments for TRD and PRD already have accepted regulatory paths for drug approval.

TRD and PRD definitions

What is lack of response?

A treatment response in MDD is defined by a reduction of at least 50% in MDD severity on a standardised rating scale (see below); 'lack of response', encompassing both TRD and PRD, is the mirror image of this definition, that is, less than 50% reduction in depression severity. TRD is further associated, in most definitions, with the 'classic criteria' of lack of response to at least two medications at an adequate dose and duration (see below). There is, however, much variability around the definition of TRD. In a recent systematic review, Brown et al. reported that, out of 155 TRD definitions identified in the published literature, 48.4% specified at least two sequential treatment failures as a requirement. In an even more recent systematic review, Gaynes and colleagues found that only 37% of intervention studies in TRD had enrolled individuals with MDD meeting the criteria of at least two failed antidepressants, and only 19% had also described failure to adequate doses and durations of treatments. In fact, the most common definition for TRD in intervention trials involved a minimum of only one previous failed treatment (48%). Thus, the majority of studies on TRD do not seem to use the 'classic criteria', making it difficult to pool or compare data across these TRD studies. Not surprisingly, there was a strong consensus (98%) for our first recommendation that a definition of TRD for clinical trials conducted for regulatory purposes is necessary.

Operational criteria for TRD and PRD

Based on a number of guidelines and other expert documents, in this report we adopt the definition of TRD as indicating individuals who show a reduction of less than 25% in MDD severity to at least two antidepressants, and of PRD as indicating individuals who show a reduction of between 25% and < 50% in MDD severity to at least one antidepressant. This should ideally be established using prospective psychometric assessments, or at least using clinical interviews and health records to measure retrospectively the improvement in depression severity (see below).

The majority of experts, even though with moderate consensus (85%), recommended the importance of this distinction between TRD and PRD for randomized clinical trials for new treatments, especially because of the potential advantage of separating these individuals for different types of randomized controlled trials (for example, switching for TRD vs. augmentation for PRD).

### Using treatment algorithms for the effective management of treatment-resistant depression [^1129Kt9m]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Increasingly, clinicians are looking to evidence-based medicine for information about treatment options. Treatment algorithms have been used with a variety of psychiatric disorders to assist physicians in making treatment decisions. The direct, prescriptive nature of algorithms also makes them suitable for use in treatment-resistant depression. Two major projects, the Texas Medication Algorithm Project and Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression, have begun to address the questions of sequenced treatment options. Future directions for algorithm development and implementation are discussed.

---

### Management of patients with treatment-resistant depression [^115UtnfY]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression can be attributed to multiple causes, including nonadherence to medication and medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Selecting the appropriate strategy for a patient with treatment-resistant depression, whether it be a single antidepressant, a combination of medications, or a nonpharmacologic method, depends on a correct determination of the cause of the patient's resistance to treatment.

### Defining treatment-resistant depression [^113vrr12]. Depression and Anxiety (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Varying conceptualizations of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) have made translating research findings or systematic reviews into clinical practice guidelines challenging and inconsistent.

Methods

We conducted a review for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to clarify how experts and investigators have defined TRD and to review systematically how well this definition comports with TRD definitions in clinical trials through July 5, 2019.

Results

We found that no consensus definition existed for TRD. The most common TRD definition for major depressive disorder required a minimum of two prior treatment failures and confirmation of prior adequate dose and duration. The most common TRD definition for bipolar disorder required one prior treatment failure. No clear consensus emerged on defining adequacy of either dose or duration. Our systematic review found that only 17% of intervention studies enrolled samples meeting the most frequently specified criteria for TRD. Depressive outcomes and clinical global impressions were commonly measured; functional impairment and quality-of-life tools were rarely used.

Conclusions

Two key steps are critical to advancing TRD research: (a) Developing a consensus definition of TRD that addresses how best to specify the number of prior treatment failures and the adequacy of dose and duration; and (b) identifying a core package of outcome measures that can be applied in a standardized manner. Our recommendations about stronger approaches to designing and conducting TRD research will foster better evidence to translate into clearer guidelines for treating patients with this serious condition.

### Using mechanism of action to choose medications for treatment-resistant depression [^111TamRB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Remission rates for depression continue to be low, and for many patients, complex treatment regimens are needed for optimal response. Many physicians do not fully understand how and why depression medications work or which ones will complement each other. This CME Webcast covers the different mechanisms of action of current pharmacotherapeutic options for depression, both monotherapy and adjunctive medications, and shows clinicians how to use their understanding of mechanisms of action to choose the most effective treatment strategy for their patients, especially those with treatment-resistant or difficult-to-treat depression.

### A Delphi-method-based consensus guideline for definition of treatment-resistant depression for clinical trials [^116Wk65d]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Criteria for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and partially responsive depression (PRD) as subtypes of major depressive disorder (MDD) are not unequivocally defined. In the present document we used a Delphi-method-based consensus approach to define TRD and PRD and to serve as operational criteria for future clinical studies, especially if conducted for regulatory purposes. We reviewed the literature and brought together a group of international experts (including clinicians, academics, researchers, employees of pharmaceutical companies, regulatory bodies representatives, and one person with lived experience) to evaluate the state-of-the-art and main controversies regarding the current classification. We then provided recommendations on how to design clinical trials, and on how to guide research in unmet needs and knowledge gaps. This report will feed into one of the main objectives of the EUropean Patient-cEntric clinicAl tRial pLatforms, Innovative Medicines Initiative (EU-PEARL, IMI) MDD project, to design a protocol for platform trials of new medications for TRD/PRD.

### Approach to diagnosis and management of treatment-resistant depression [^11567J87]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Major depressive disorder is a chronic and recurrent illness that affects 20% of adults during their lifetime and is one of the leading causes of suicide in the United States. A systematic measurement-based care approach is the essential first step in the diagnosis and management of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) by promptly identifying individuals with depression and avoiding delays in treatment initiation. As comorbidities may be associated with poorer outcomes to commonly used antidepressants and increase risk of drug-drug interactions, their recognition and treatment is an essential component of management of TRD.

### Psychological therapies for treatment-resistant depression in adults [^112pbv2b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Antidepressants are a first-line treatment for adults with moderate to severe major depression. However, many people prescribed antidepressants for depression don't respond fully to such medication, and little evidence is available to inform the most appropriate 'next step' treatment for such patients, who may be referred to as having treatment-resistant depression (TRD). National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance suggests that the 'next step' for those who do not respond to antidepressants may include a change in the dose or type of antidepressant medication, the addition of another medication, or the start of psychotherapy. Different types of psychotherapies may be used for TRD; evidence on these treatments is available but has not been collated to date. Along with the sister review of pharmacological therapies for TRD, this review summarises available evidence for the effectiveness of psychotherapies for adults (18 to 74 years) with TRD with the goal of establishing the best 'next step' for this group.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of psychotherapies for adults with TRD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (until May 2016), along with CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO via OVID (until 16 May 2017). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished and ongoing studies. There were no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with participants aged 18 to 74 years diagnosed with unipolar depression that had not responded to minimum four weeks of antidepressant treatment at a recommended dose. We excluded studies of drug intolerance. Acceptable diagnoses of unipolar depression were based onthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) or earlier versions, International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10, Feighner criteria, or Research Diagnostic Criteria. We included the following comparisons.1. Any psychological therapy versus antidepressant treatment alone, or another psychological therapy.2. Any psychological therapy given in addition to antidepressant medication versus antidepressant treatment alone, or a psychological therapy alone. Primary outcomes required were change in depressive symptoms and number of dropouts from study or treatment (as a measure of acceptability).

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data, assessed risk of bias in duplicate, and resolved disagreements through discussion or consultation with a third person. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses when appropriate. We summarised continuous outcomes using mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs), and dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RRs).

Main Results

We included six trials (n = 698; most participants were women approximately 40 years of age). All studies evaluated psychotherapy plus usual care (with antidepressants) versus usual care (with antidepressants). Three studies addressed the addition of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) to usual care (n = 522), and one each evaluated intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy (ISTDP) (n = 60), interpersonal therapy (IPT) (n = 34), or group dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT) (n = 19) as the intervention. Most studies were small (except one trial of CBT was large), and all studies were at high risk of detection bias for the main outcome of self-reported depressive symptoms. A random-effects meta-analysis of five trials (n = 575) showed that psychotherapy given in addition to usual care (vs usual care alone) produced improvement in self-reported depressive symptoms (MD -4.07 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.07 to -1.07 on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scale) over the short term (up to six months). Effects were similar when data from all six studies were combined for self-reported depressive symptoms (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.14; n = 635). The quality of this evidence was moderate. Similar moderate-quality evidence of benefit was seen on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Scale (PHQ-9) from two studies (MD -4.66, 95% CI 8.72 to -0.59; n = 482) and on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) from four studies (MD -3.28, 95% CI -5.71 to -0.85; n = 193). High-quality evidence shows no differential dropout (a measure of acceptability) between intervention and comparator groups over the short term (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.24; six studies; n = 698). Moderate-quality evidence for remission from six studies (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.46 to 2.52; n = 635) and low-quality evidence for response from four studies (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.7; n = 556) indicate that psychotherapy was beneficial as an adjunct to usual care over the short term. With the addition of CBT, low-quality evidence suggests lower depression scores on the BDI scale over the medium term (12 months) (RR -3.40, 95% CI -7.21 to 0.40; two studies; n = 475) and over the long term (46 months) (RR -1.90, 95% CI -3.22 to -0.58; one study; n = 248). Moderate-quality evidence for adjunctive CBT suggests no difference in acceptability (dropout) over the medium term (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.47; two studies; n = 549) and lower dropout over long term (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.97; one study; n = 248). Two studies reported serious adverse events (one suicide, two hospitalisations, and two exacerbations of depression) in 4.2% of the total sample, which occurred only in the usual care group (no events in the intervention group). An economic analysis (conducted as part of an included study) from the UK healthcare perspective (National Health Service (NHS)) revealed that adjunctive CBT was cost-effective over nearly four years.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence shows that psychotherapy added to usual care (with antidepressants) is beneficial for depressive symptoms and for response and remission rates over the short term for patients with TRD. Medium- and long-term effects seem similarly beneficial, although most evidence was derived from a single large trial. Psychotherapy added to usual care seems as acceptable as usual care alone. Further evidence is needed on the effectiveness of different types of psychotherapies for patients with TRD. No evidence currently shows whether switching to a psychotherapy is more beneficial for this patient group than continuing an antidepressant medication regimen. Addressing this evidence gap is an important goal for researchers.

### Treatment-resistant depression: prevalence, risk factors, and treatment strategies [^1117eMwL]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Full symptomatic remission is the optimal outcome for patients with major depression. Unfortunately, initial antidepressant efficacy is limited to partial response for many patients. Incomplete remission of depressive symptoms is associated with increased risk of relapse, decreased functioning in work and social settings, and increased risk of suicide. Factors that increase the likelihood of treatment resistance include chronicity, severe symptomatology, and comorbid illnesses. Strategies to manage patients who do not respond to an initial course of antidepressant medication include optimizing the dose, switching antidepressants, or adding adjunctive treatment (ie, psychotherapy or a second medication). Augmentation may be the preferred strategy for improving response if tolerability to the original agent is acceptable and the initial medication has had some beneficial effects. Tracking patients' depressive symptoms with standardized measurement tools during the course of treatment is necessary for identifying incomplete remission and providing appropriate treatment modification.

### What alternatives to first-line therapy for depression are effective? [^115Bfngj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Depression is often a chronic illness that requires a methodical, long-term approach to manage it optimally. A single antidepressant trial is often insufficient for patients to achieve remission. Remission rates for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are about 30% to 35%. Using successive treatment steps with optimal medication dosing and making measurement-based treatment decisions can help patients achieve remission, but, at each step, remission is less likely than at the first step. Depression is considered treatment-resistant if 2 adequate trials of medication fail. Clinicians can use validated symptom checklists such as the 16-Item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire, Global Assessment of Functioning, and Sheehan Disability Scale to identify patients with treatment-resistant depression. Treatment resistance is likely in patients with a history of depressive chronicity and concurrent psychiatric and medical disorders and may be mistakenly suspected in patients who have had an inadequate trial of medication or who have been misdiagnosed. Strategies that can be effective to combat treatment resistance include optimizing treatment, switching to another antidepressant, combining antidepressants, and augmenting antidepressants with nonantidepressant treatments such as buspirone, lithium, liothyronine, atypical antipsychotics, or other agents. In addition, clinicians need to cultivate strong therapeutic alliances with patients, use objective measurements, practice evidence-based medicine, and educate patients about the disease and its treatments.

### Identifying difficult-to-treat depression: differential diagnosis, subtypes, and comorbidities [^117PK849]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a common clinical presentation responsible for much of the burden of major depressive disorder worldwide. For this reason, TRD requires aggressive identification and management. Although several models have been proposed to describe TRD, consensus is still needed on the criteria (ie, dose, duration, compliance, number of trials required) used to define treatment response and resistance. When diagnosing patients with depression, clinicians should identify risk factors associated with treatment resistance, including clinical subtypes of depression and medical or psychiatric comorbidities that could affect the course of treatment. When evaluating a patient who has not responded to a first course of antidepressant treatment, the clinician should verify the primary diagnosis and ensure that the patient has adhered to a treatment regimen that was of adequate dose and duration.

### Treatment-resistant depression in adolescents: recognition and management [^115FtgSS]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Approximately 20% of adolescents experience at least one depressive episode by the time they enter their adult years. For most adolescents, depression, although serious, either remits spontaneously or responds to treatment. For a smaller but significant proportion of adolescents, however, depression can be long-lasting and relatively unresponsive to initial treatment. In this article the authors provide an operational definition of treatment-resistant depression, identify factors associated with treatment nonresponse, describe an approach to the management of treatment-resistant depression, and advance suggestions for promising avenues of research.

### Clinical features of treatment-resistant depression [^114y49tA]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

As many as 30% to 40% of patients with major depressive disorder are unresponsive to a trial of antidepressant medication. Many patients labeled with treatment-resistant depression actually have pseudoresistance, in that they have been inadequately treated or are misdiagnosed. Others may have unrecognized comorbid psychiatric or general medical conditions that contribute to treatment resistance. Variables such as gender, family history, age at onset, severity, and chronicity have also been evaluated as possible risk factors for treatment-resistant depression. This article reviews the current literature regarding the clinical characteristics of treatment-resistant depression, with particular attention to the relevance of these factors for clinical decision making.

### Risk factors for treatment resistance in unipolar depression: a systematic review [^115zZHWB]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment resistant depression is a complex disorder and an important source of morbidity and mortality. Identification of risk factors of resistance may be useful to improve early recognition as well as treatment selection and prediction of outcome in patients with depression.

Methods

The aim of this paper was to review the current status of knowledge regarding risk factors of treatment resistance in unipolar depression, in patients who failed to respond to at least two successive and adequate antidepressant treatments.

Results

Systematic literature search yielded 8 publications exploring clinical and biological factors. Specific psychiatric comorbidities, psychosocial factors, clinical characteristics of the depressive episode and biological markers emerge as possible risk factor for treatment resistant depression.

Limitations

Due to the lack of objective definition and diagnostic criteria for treatment resistant depression, and the paucity of reports on risk factors, our review only summarized a small number of studies.

Conclusion

Future investigations of risk factors should help to improve the understanding of the mechanisms underlying resistance in mood disorders and contribute to improve their therapeutic management.

### A Delphi-method-based consensus guideline for definition of treatment-resistant depression for clinical trials [^114J3HyZ]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Notwithstanding these limitations (and the points of uncertainties further discussed in the Appendix), this report offers clear and consistent definitions of TRD/PRD for regulatory clinical trials and for clinical and biological studies more broadly, agreed among a large group of experts including clinicians, academics, industry, regulatory agencies, and PWLE. Our ultimate ambition is to advance tailored treatments and a truly 'precision medicine' approach for MDD, which in turn will finally help to deliver better care for people suffering from this severely challenging illness, which remains too often ineffectively treated.

### Issues in treatment-resistant depression [^11129XY9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder is a debilitating disease that imposes significant social and economic burdens not only on patients but also on society. Although various treatment options are available, treatment-resistant depression is common. Determining the exact prevalence of treatment-resistant depression is difficult because definitions vary, as do definitions of antidepressant response. Operational definitions of antidepressant response, nonresponse, partial response, and remission will be discussed in this article. Pharmacotherapy options for patients with treatment-resistant depression include augmentation, combination, and switching therapies; however, data from controlled clinical trials supporting these therapies are limited. Electroconvulsive therapy and psychotherapy offer additional treatment strategies. New nonpharmacologic therapies are under investigation. Remission is the goal of treatment.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for treatment-resistant depression in older patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ymwiC]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Methods

This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The protocol was prospectively registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO CRD42023494513). No ethics approval was required. We followed the published protocol, with the following changes: we substituted the Cochrane risk of bias-2 tool as the validity rating method, included the RCTs identified in the previous review (these changes on the advice of journal reviewers) and did not include global change as an outcome because few studies used it, while all measured depressive symptoms.

Search strategy

We searched three databases (PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Web of Science) from 8 January 2010 to 10 December 2023 using the keywords: (resist* OR refractory OR inadequate response OR partial response) AND (depress*) AND (elderly OR old* OR geriatric) AND (treatment OR trial). We repeated the searches of all databases on 14 July 2024 and found no further eligible studies. We imported results to 'Covidence' software. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, identifying all studies of potential relevance for full-text review. Any conflicts were resolved by discussion with a third author. We screened reference lists of studies identified for full-text review and relevant reviews. Full strategies for each database are in online supplemental material appendix 1.

Selection criteria

We drew on the 2011 systematic review methods, additionally restricting evidence to RCTs. We included primary research studies describing RCTs that compared an intervention intended as a treatment for depression against placebo or another active treatment; where all participants, or a separately analysed subgroup were, on average, aged > 55 years, had a clinical diagnosis of depressive disorder and were classified as treatment resistant at baseline. For this, the same, inclusive definition as the 2011 review: failure to respond to at least one adequate treatment (pharmacological or psychological; acceptable treatment trial and adherence) was used.

### Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder: Canadian expert consensus on definition and assessment [^117Ccn8h]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a debilitating chronic mental illness that confers increased morbidity and mortality, decreases the quality of life, impairs occupational, social, and offspring development, and translates into increased costs on the healthcare system. The goal of this study is to reach an agreement on the concept, definition, staging model, and assessment of TRD.

Methods

This study involved a review of the literature and a modified Delphi process for consensus agreement. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II guidelines were followed for the literature appraisal. Literature was assessed for quality and strength of evidence using the grading, assessment, development, and evaluations system. Canadian national experts in depression were invited for the modified Delphi process based on their prior clinical and research expertize. Survey items were considered to have reached a consensus if 80% or more of the experts supported the statement.

Results

Fourteen Canadian experts were recruited for three rounds of surveys to reach a consensus on a total of 27 items. Experts agreed that a dimensional definition for treatment resistance was a useful concept to describe the heterogeneity of this illness. The use of staging models and clinical scales was recommended in evaluating depression. Risk factors and comorbidities were identified as potential predictors for treatment resistance.

Conclusions

TRD is a meaningful concept both for clinical practice and research. An operational definition for TRD will allow for opportunities to improve the validity of predictors and therapeutic options for these patients.

### Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder: Canadian expert consensus on definition and assessment [^115u2LGG]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

Having a consensus for the definition of TRD could improve and standardize care by indicating when a treatment resistance algorithm should start. No current definition provides sufficient detail for the accurate triaging and staging of patients in clinical settings or proper assessment for the selection of research participants. Therefore, since the late 1990s, researchers have proposed more detailed staging models intended to serve both clinical and research needs. The lack of a universally accepted staging model or a consensus definition for TRD creates ongoing barriers for patients to receive the appropriate care based on the severity, chronicity, and treatment response.

The goal of this study is to reach an agreement on the concept, definition, staging model, and assessment of TRD. Creating an optimal definition for TRD will help improve research to address patient needs, better define this heterogeneous population, and allow clinicians to communicate using the same terminology. Operationally, this would allow more personalized care to match patients with the right treatment in a timely manner. Continued work on a more refined TRD definition and criteria can improve the comparability of research studies, enable international collaborations on the subject, and improve treatment outcomes in major depressive disorder (MDD).

### A Delphi-method-based consensus guideline for definition of treatment-resistant depression for clinical trials [^113UZ49B]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Previous antidepressant treatments

Here we discuss: (1) how many previous treatments should be considered, (2) in which episode (current and/or past) and (3) the way the treatment failure or partial response should be assessed for inclusion in clinical trials (prospectively and/or retrospectively).

Number of previous treatments

The FDA guidance acknowledges that no universally accepted definitions exist for TRD or PRD, and proposes that TRD studies should include people with MDD who have not responded to more than one (so, at least two) prior medications administered at an adequate dose and duration. Similarly, the EMA opts for the same definition of at least two failed treatments when considering the matter "in a clinical pragmatic view". This same definition is confirmed as the most common in the review by Gaynes and colleagues, and endorsed by the DTD consensus statement by McAllister–Williams and colleagues, although the last document states that some individuals might be considered to have DTD even with a single treatment failure, for example when standard treatments are contraindicated. There is also an uncertainty around PRD. EMA documents do not specify a precise number of previous treatments to diagnose PRD, while the FDA indicates that "for adjunctive treatment, studies should include patients with partial responses to other antidepressant therapies".

Consistent with the most commonly used criteria, we recommend that TRD should be defined after a minimum of two failed treatments with < 25% of improvement with adequate dosing and duration (strong consensus, 96%), while PRD can be defined even after a single treatment (improvement 25 to < 50%) with adequate dosing and duration (moderate consensus, 76%).

### A Delphi-method-based consensus guideline for definition of treatment-resistant depression for clinical trials [^1166xNR2]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Current or past episodes

The preferred definition of TRD for clinical trials includes a current failure and a past failure, i.e. subjects are currently receiving an antidepressant and they are still depressed according to current clinician's assessment, and they were also treated with another antidepressant in the past and showed no response based on retrospective assessment. However, it is unclear whether both of these treatments should apply to the same (current) episode or to clearly distinct episodes. Indeed, although the EMA definition of MDD emphasizes the current episode for the characterisation of the disease, it does not clarify whether the two failures should both be during the current episode. Of course, it is difficult to retrospectively defining the response to an antidepressant, especially if the current episode is of long duration (years) and the previous treatment was closer to the onset of the episode.

We recommend (with weak consensus, 51%) that the definition of TRD should include two treatment failures both within the current episode, and the definition of PRD should include partial response to at least one treatment within the current episode; moreover, for long current episodes, only treatment failures within the last two years should be considered. Of note, the "minority" position was split across a continuum of different opinions ranging from those who wanted to maintain that both antidepressants should be in the same episode but within a shorter period of time (shorter than two years) to those who wanted to consider two antidepressants "life-time"; thus, our recommendation sits in the middle of these extremes.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^117VTy5M]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most common neuropsychiatric conditions, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of approximately 12%. MDD imposes a substantial burden of illness and is the leading cause of disability internationally. The most common treatments for MDD are broadly classified as pharmacological or psychological, with a multitude of different treatments from each category available.

A significant proportion of patients with MDD do not respond to treatment(s) and are considered 'treatment resistant'. Although there is no universally accepted definition of treatment-resistant depression (TRD), the most frequently used criterion is the failure to respond to two trials of pharmacological therapy of adequate dose and duration, in the current episode. Less commonly, failure of psychological therapies is also considered to contribute towards the definition of treatment resistance. The most widely used staging model of TRD is the Thase and Rush model. In this model, failure to respond to one adequate antidepressant trial from a major antidepressant class is considered Stage I TRD, and those who then do not respond to a second adequate antidepressant trial (from a different class than the antidepressant used in Stage I) are termed Stage II TRD. There are variations between measures, studies and groups in terms of requiring a second antidepressant to be from a different class, however. It has been suggested that permitting two 'failed' treatments from within a class, and permitting psychological treatments, should be incorporated in updated definitions of Stage II TRD.

Abstract

Background

Treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) is a debilitating chronic mental illness that confers increased morbidity and mortality, decreases the quality of life, impairs occupational, social, and offspring development, and translates into increased costs on the healthcare system. The goal of this study is to reach an agreement on the concept, definition, staging model, and assessment of TRD.

Methods

This study involved a review of the literature and a modified Delphi process for consensus agreement. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II guidelines were followed for the literature appraisal. Literature was assessed for quality and strength of evidence using the grading, assessment, development, and evaluations system. Canadian national experts in depression were invited for the modified Delphi process based on their prior clinical and research expertize. Survey items were considered to have reached a consensus if 80% or more of the experts supported the statement.

Results

Fourteen Canadian experts were recruited for three rounds of surveys to reach a consensus on a total of 27 items. Experts agreed that a dimensional definition for treatment resistance was a useful concept to describe the heterogeneity of this illness. The use of staging models and clinical scales was recommended in evaluating depression. Risk factors and comorbidities were identified as potential predictors for treatment resistance.

Conclusions

TRD is a meaningful concept both for clinical practice and research. An operational definition for TRD will allow for opportunities to improve the validity of predictors and therapeutic options for these patients.

### Recent advances in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression: a narrative review of literature published from 2018 to 2023 [^113i1wRP]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We review recent advances in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression (TRD), a disorder with very limited treatment options until recently. We examine advances in psychotherapeutic, psychopharmacologic, and interventional psychiatry approaches to treatment of TRD. We also highlight various definitions of TRD in recent scientific literature.

Recent Findings

Recent evidence suggests some forms of psychotherapy can be effective as adjunctive treatments for TRD, but not as monotherapies alone. Little recent evidence supports the use of adjunctive non-antidepressant pharmacotherapies such as buprenorphine and antipsychotics for the treatment of TRD; side effects and increased medication discontinuation rates may outweigh the benefits of these adjunctive pharmacotherapies. Finally, a wealth of recent evidence supports the use of interventional approaches such as electroconvulsive therapy, ketamine/esketamine, and transcranial magnetic stimulation for TRD. Recent advances in our understanding of how to treat TRD have largely expanded our knowledge of best practices in, and efficacy of, interventional psychiatric approaches. Recent research has used a variety of TRD definitions for study inclusion criteria; research on TRD should adhere to inclusion criteria based on internationally defined guidelines for more meaningfully generalizable results.

3.3 What is the operational definition for initial treatment resistance?

On the basis of the most recent systematic review, no agreed‐upon dichotomous definition exists for TRD (GRADE‐high) (Gaynes et al. 2018). Although experts often agree on a requirement for two treatment failures, they do not agree on the definition for the adequacy of either dose or duration or outcome measures. Definitions do not regularly incorporate failure with regard to augmentation agents (Vaccarino & Kennedy, 2020). Besides differences in criteria, none of the definitions of TRD have been systematically examined for reliability and predictive value utility (GRADE‐high; Gaynes et al. 2018; Souery et al. 2006). In reviewing the STAR*D reports, one can clearly see that the crucial point at which the risk of treatment resistance markedly increased was after two treatment failures (Rush, Trivedi, Wisniewski, Nierenberg, et al. 2006).

### Effect of minocycline on depressive symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant depression: a randomized clinical trial [^116q2VmW]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does 6 weeks of minocycline treatment as add-on to standard antidepressant treatment reduce depressive symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant depression?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 168 patients with treatment-resistant depression, 6 weeks of minocycline treatment did not show a statistically significant advantage compared with placebo on the overall course of depressive symptoms.

Meaning

The findings of this randomized clinical trial suggest the need for more effective therapeutic interventions and biomarkers in this heterogeneous clinical condition.

### The identification, assessment and management of difficult-to-treat depression: an international consensus statement [^111YRew7]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Many depressed patients are not able to achieve or sustain symptom remission despite serial treatment trials - often termed "treatment resistant depression". A broader, perhaps more empathic concept of "difficult-to-treat depression" (DTD) was considered.

Methods

A consensus group discussed the definition, clinical recognition, assessment and management implications of the DTD heuristic.

Results

The group proposed that DTD be defined as "depression that continues to cause significant burden despite usual treatment efforts". All depression management should include a thorough initial assessment. When DTD is recognized, a regular reassessment that employs a multi-dimensional framework to identify addressable barriers to successful treatment (including patient-, illness- and treatment-related factors) is advised, along with specific recommendations for addressing these factors. The emphasis of treatment, in the first instance, shifts from a goal of remission to optimal symptom control, daily psychosocial functional and quality of life, based on a patient-centred approach with shared decision-making to enhance the timely consideration of all treatment options (including pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, neurostimulation, etc.) to optimize outcomes when sustained remission is elusive.

Limitations

The recommended definition and management of DTD is based largely on expert consensus. While DTD would seem to have clinical utility, its specificity and objectivity may be insufficient to define clinical populations for regulatory trial purposes, though DTD could define populations for service provision or phase 4 trials.

Conclusions

DTD provides a clinically useful conceptualization that implies a search for and remediation of specific patient-, illness- and treatment obstacles to optimizing outcomes of relevance to patients.

### Recognizing and assessing risk factors for difficult-to-treat depression and treatment-resistant depression [^112yqHSi]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Many patients will not respond adequately to their initial trial of antidepressant medication or subsequent trials. By identifying features that can signal potential treatment-resistant or difficult-to-treat depression early in the course of illness, clinicians may be able to find the right balance of treatment strategies to help patients achieve remission. Here, follow the case of Alice, a 32-year-old lawyer with a treatment-resistant depressive episode.

### Magnitude of the placebo response across treatment modalities used for treatment-resistant depression in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ofcm4]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

The placebo effect in depression clinical trials is a substantial factor associated with failure to establish efficacy of novel and repurposed treatments. However, the magnitude of the placebo effect and whether it differs across treatment modalities in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is unclear.

Objective

To examine the magnitude of the placebo effect in patients with TRD across different treatment modalities and its possible moderators.

Data Sources

Searches were conducted on MEDLINE, Web of Science, and PsychInfo from inception to June 21, 2021.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were included if they recruited patients with TRD and randomized them to a placebo or sham arm and a pharmacotherapy, brain stimulation, or psychotherapy arm.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Independent reviewers used standard forms for data extraction and quality assessment. Random-effects analyses and standard pairwise meta-analyses were performed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the Hedges g value for the reported depression scales. Secondary outcomes included moderators assessed via meta-regression and response and remission rates. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 test, and publication bias was evaluated using the Egger test and a funnel plot. Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used to estimate risks.

Results

Fifty RCTs were included involving various types of placebo or sham interventions with a total of 3228 participants (mean [SD] age, 45.8 [6.0] years; 1769 [54.8%] female). The pooled placebo effect size for all modalities was large (g = 1.05; 95% CI, 0.91–1.1); the placebo effect size in RCTs of specific treatment modalities did not significantly differ. Similarly, response and remission rates associated with placebo were comparable across modalities. Heterogeneity was large. Three variables were associated with a larger placebo effect size: open-label prospective treatment before double-blind placebo randomization (β = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.59; p = 0.004), later year of publication (β = 0.03; 95% CI, 0.003 to 0.05; p = 0.03), and industry-sponsored trials (β = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.58; p = 0.007). The number of failed interventions was associated with the probability a smaller placebo effect size (β = -0.12; 95% CI, -0.23 to -0.01, P = 0.03). The Egger test result was not significant for small studies' effects.

Conclusions and Relevance

This analysis may provide a benchmark for past and future clinical RCTs that recruit patients with TRD standardizing an expected placebo effect size.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^116ggtVb]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

The protocol for this systematic review was pre-registered (PROSPERO: CRD42018117366) and is described in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The full search and extraction strategy is described below. Studies were included based on the following a priori eligibility criteria:

Study designs

We included RCTs that assessed at least one augmentation or combination treatment (with sample sizes of 10 or more). To avoid duplication of data, where multiple manuscripts described one RCT, the eligible comparison with the largest sample size was included.

Participants

Adults (aged ⩾18 years old) with MDD who had failed to remit despite at least one adequate antidepressant monotherapy trial were included. MDD was defined using either validated rating scales (e.g. the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression;) or operationalised diagnostic criteria (e.g. the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders;). In keeping with previous meta-analyses, we considered an adequate antidepressant trial to be at least 4 weeks of treatment at recognised minimum-effective doses (where available). Inadequate response to both pharmacological and psychological therapies was permitted, consistent with previous meta-analyses on this subject and in keeping with standardised staging of TRD. RCTs in which the participant population contained ⩾10% of patients with diagnoses of either bipolar or psychotic depression were excluded because of accepted differences in treatment approaches.

### Cognitive behavioral therapy for treatment-resistant depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113zmtEz]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common psychotherapy characterized as treating mental diseases, such as depression. Though multiple studies have reported its effect in treatment-resistant depression, no qualified meta-analysis has ever assessed this effect before. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of CBT for treatment-resistant depression patients and its continuous effect. We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library from inception to February 2018 for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A total of six RCTs involving 847 participants were included. Pooled analysis indicated that CBT was an efficient invention in reducing depression symptoms. Besides, CBT was also superior to control group in increasing response and remission rates. These effects could take effect at post-treatment, and last for 6 months, or even 1 year long. No publication bias was detected. These findings suggested that compared with routine antidepressant treatment, CBT has greater potential in taking immediate effect and has better mid-term and long-term prognosis.

Schematic representation of the different phases of the Delphi-method-based process.

We provide a number of recommendations, each based on the view supported by the largest number of the experts, while highlighting areas of uncertainty and defining the 'level of consensus' on each recommendation: 'strong', indicating the top one-third of recommendations that had unanimous or almost unanimous (≥ 95%) agreement; 'moderate', indicating almost all the remaining two-thirds of recommendations, which had a substantial majority (61–94%); and 'weak', indicating the one recommendation that only reached the minimum consensus of 51%. We have summarised all the recommendations in Table 1 and Fig. 2. We suggest that: (1) recommendations with strong consensus should be immediately adopted; (2) recommendations with a moderate consensus could provide a working model for immediate implementation, but should be further confirmed by future research/discussion; and (3) recommendations with a weak consensus represent an area of uncertainty and thus require further research/discussion.

### Towards new mechanisms: an update on therapeutics for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder [^116ZPBTM]. Molecular Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Depression is a devastating disorder that places a significant burden on both the individual and society. As such, the discovery of novel therapeutics and innovative treatments — especially for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) — are essential. Research into antidepressant therapies for TRD has evolved from explorations of antidepressants with primary mechanisms of action on the monoaminergic neurotransmitter system to augmentation agents with primary mechanisms both within and outside of the serotonin/norepinephrine system. Now the field of antidepressant research has changed trajectories yet again; this time, compounds with primary mechanisms of action on the glutamatergic, cholinergic and opioid systems are in the forefront of antidepressant exploration. In this review, we will discuss the most recent research surrounding these novel compounds. In addition, we will discuss novel device-based therapeutics, with a particular focus on transcranial magnetic stimulation. In many cases of antidepressant drug discovery, the role of serendipity coupled with meticulous clinical observation in drug development in medicine was crucial. Moving forward, we must look toward the combination of innovation plus improvements on the remarkable discoveries thus far to advance the field of antidepressant research.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for treatment-resistant depression in older patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11458W9n]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Depression is the leading global cause of disability, affecting around 13% of older people, of whom a third meet the criteria for treatment resistance. Mental disorders (most commonly depression and anxiety) account for 10.6% of disability-adjusted life years among older adults. Antidepressant use by older people with depression is increasing, but the condition remains under-recognised and undertreated, and is more commonly resistant to treatment in this age group. Globally, around a quarter of deaths from suicide (27.2%) are among people aged 60 years or over. Depression may increase the risk of developing dementia.

The Food and Drugs Association defines treatment-resistant depression (TRD) as 'inadequate response to at least two antidepressants, where there was an acceptable treatment trial and adherence'. This definition does not account for psychological treatment, effective at treating late life depression. Lifestyle, such as dietary changes, can also be useful adjuncts to therapy. People with TRD have lower quality of life, activity impairment and use more healthcare resources than people with non-resistant depression and the general population.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) therapeutic guidelines for depression (NG222)unresponsive to initial treatment recommend increasing the dose, switching agents, adding psychological therapies or augmenting treatment with antidepressant medication, second-generation antipsychotics, lithium, electroconvulsive therapy, lamotrigine or triiodothyronine (liothyronine). Nuñez et al compared the efficacy of augmentation agents in TRD, finding the strongest evidence for atypical antipsychotics, thyroid hormones, dopamine compounds and lithium. Additional NICE guidelines support the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for depression.

Most evidence underpinning TRD therapeutic guidelines derives from research with younger adults, but optimal treatment of depression in older and younger populations may differ. Higher rates of physical and cognitive comorbidity, greater likelihood of polypharmacy and age-related pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic changes that increase susceptibility to side effects mean that specific guidelines for clinicians treating older adults with TRD are of value.

### Real-world evidence from a European cohort study of patients with treatment resistant depression: treatment patterns and clinical outcomes [^11618xgQ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment resistant depression (TRD) characterizes a subgroup of 10–30% of patients with major depressive disorder, and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. A consensus treatment for TRD does not exist, which often leads to wide variations in treatment strategies. Real-world studies on treatment patterns and outcomes in TRD patients in Europe are lacking and could help elucidate current treatment strategies and their efficacy.

Methods

This non-interventional cohort study of patients with TRD (defined as treatment failure on ≥ 2 oral antidepressants given at adequate dose and duration) with moderate to severe depression collected real-world data on treatment patterns and outcomes in several European countries. Patients were started on a new treatment for depression according to routine clinical practice.

Results

Among 411 patients enrolled, after 6 months, only 16.7% achieved remission and 73.5% showed no response. At Month 12, while 19.2% achieved remission and 69.2% showed no response, 33.3% of those in remission at Month 6 were no longer in remission. Pharmacological treatments employed were heterogenous; 54 different drugs were recorded at baseline, and the top 5 treatment types according to drug classes accounted for 40.0% of patients. Even though remission rates were very low, at Month 12, 60.0% of patients had not changed treatment since enrolment.

Conclusions

The heterogeneity of treatments highlights a lack of consensus. Moreover, despite low response rates, patients often remained on treatments for substantial periods of time. These data further support existence of an unmet treatment need for TRD patients in Europe.

### Ketamine vs electroconvulsive therapy for treatment-resistant depression: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^114CAaso]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are baseline clinical features associated with differential improvement with ketamine vs electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adults with treatment-resistant depression?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, 365 adults with nonpsychotic treatment-resistant major depression, moderately severe or severe pretreatment depression severity and initiating treatment as an outpatient were associated with greater improvement with ketamine vs ECT. Very severe pretreatment depression severity was associated with greater reduction in self-reported depression severity with ECT vs ketamine earlier during the treatment, but the scores were similar by the end-of-treatment visit.

Meaning

These results suggest that outpatients and those with moderately severe or severe depression may consider ketamine over ECT for treatment-resistant depression.

### Definition of treatment-resistant depression-Asia pacific perspectives [^113qC9oG]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The lack of uniformity in the definition of treatment resistant depression (TRD) within the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region may have implications for patient management. We aimed to characterize the most commonly used TRD definition in selected APAC countries.

Methods

A systematic literature review of TRD definitions in APAC countries was conducted in Medline and Embase (2010–2016) and conference proceedings (2014 and 2016). TRD guidelines (APAC, Europe regional, US, or international) were also searched. An expert-panel explored APAC nuances in TRD definitions to achieve consensus for a regional-level definition.

Results

Ten guidelines and 89 studies qualified for study inclusion. Among the studies, variations were observed in definitions regarding: number of antidepressants failed (range: ≥ 1 to ≥ 3), classes of antidepressants (same or different; 59% did not specify class), duration of previous treatments (range: 4–12 weeks), dosage adequacy, and consideration of adherence (yes/no; 88% of studies did not consider adherence). No TRD-specific guidelines were identified. The emerging consensus from the literature review and panel discussion was that TRD is most commonly defined as failure to ≥ 2 antidepressant therapies given at adequate doses, for 6–8 weeks during a major depressive episode.

Limitations

Few studies provided definitions of TRD used in daily clinical practice, and a limited number of countries were represented in the included studies and expert panel.

Conclusion

Attaining consensus on TRD definition may promote accurate, and possibly early detection of patients with TRD to enable appropriate intervention that may impact patient outcomes and quality of life.

Future directions

This section makes recommendations that are not immediately applicable to clinical trials and highlights research gaps and new opportunities identified throughout the consultative process. Future trial sponsors may wish to incorporate one or more of these areas to expand the knowledge base. A more detailed discussion of these points is presented in the Appendix; here, we want to emphasise the main recommendations:
Future research should recognize and target different clinical phenotypes of TRD (and PRD) underpinned by a specific biological mechanism (strong, 100%).
For future research, diagnostic and history-taking instruments should be implemented in clinical cohorts and electronic health records, to allow a reliable, comprehensive, and multidimensional evaluation of the PWLE (strong, 100%).
Currently, no biomarker has been validated in clinical practice or in clinical trials to identify subjects with TRD (and PRD), or to further stratify them; however, collection of biological samples for subsequent subgroup or stratified analyses is recommended (moderate, 91%).
Preferences, perspectives, and reported outcomes of PWLE should be included in future TRD (and PRD) diagnostic tools and outcome measures (strong, 100%).
The usefulness of adherence assessment using blood levels or other methods (also in a run-in period) should be assessed through research, before deciding whether it should be implemented in future clinical trials (moderate, 92%).

### Magnitude of the placebo response across treatment modalities used for treatment-resistant depression in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114S92xR]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a relapsing and remitting illness, and many patients do not respond to available treatments. The standard to evaluate a new intervention for MDD uses a randomized clinical trial (RCT) with placebo as the control design that can distinguish the benefit of an active treatment compared with the nonspecific benefit of the placebo response. The placebo response is defined as the therapeutic effect produced by a placebo or sham intervention that is not due to any inherent properties of the placebo. Several novel or repurposed treatments have not been able to establish efficacy in the context of large placebo effects. This phenomenon is a challenge for researchers; however, attention has begun to focus on trying to understand and quantify the magnitude of the placebo response.

In RCTs of non–treatment-resistant depression (non-TRD) in patients with MDD, the placebo effect has been found to have a large magnitude and to be associated with several factors, although with some inconsistent findings. These factors have included later publication years, number of trial arms, multicenter setting, dosing schedule, increased length of the trial, sham device placement, the magnitude of active response, early score fluctuations, and inflation of baseline severity. A large meta-analysis evaluating the placebo effect in depression (256 RCTs; n = 26 324) found placebo-response rates of about 35% to 40%. However, this analysis included only RCTs of antidepressant drugs in patients without TRD. Treatment-resistant depression is commonly defined as the lack of response to 2 separate antidepressant trials of adequate dose and duration. Previous meta-analyses have suggested that TRD is associated with a smaller placebo effect than non-TRD (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation [rTMS] and escitalopram trials). Nonetheless, to our knowledge, no analysis has assessed the placebo effect in patients with TRD receiving other treatment modalities.

### A Delphi-method-based consensus guideline for definition of treatment-resistant depression for clinical trials [^117UzK3r]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Prospective or retrospective assessment

A related issue, particularly important for regulatory clinical trials, is whether one treatment failure should be 'prospective within the trial', i.e. the trial starts with an established medication for MDD at an adequate dose, and then the person is offered a new intervention only if the medication fails to improve or eliminate MDD symptoms. We acknowledge that this, while ideal, would lead to operational execution challenges within a trial, with increased complexity and burden for the sites and study participants.

We recommend (with moderate consensus, 75%) that it is possible to assess ineffective past/current antidepressant treatment attempts, but only if properly documented, that is, based not only on subjective recollection or standardised instruments to assess psychiatric history and previous treatments (see below), but also on clinical documentation, such as pharmacy, hospital, or other health records. This documentation can also be used to confirm some degree of adherence to the failed treatments, and to screen people with depressive symptoms for previous episodes of mania, hypomania, or sub-threshold bipolarity, since these individuals should be excluded (see below).

Adherence to treatment is a well-recognized critical issue in both clinical and research settings. Rates of adherence vary across the literature and generally are limited by different and/or restricted time periods. However, people with MDD have typically high reported rates of non-adherence (up to more than 50%). It is therefore vital to properly confirm the individual's adherence in order to define non-response: many cases of TRD may not be true TRD, but, instead, represent partial or full non-adherence. However, the assessment of treatment adherence can be difficult and is often not addressed in everyday settings, or in most current studies in TRD. The most reliable method to assess adherence is to perform a blood test to measure the concentration of the medication in the plasma (which would also allow the recognition of fast and slow metabolisers), even though it may increase the participants' burden during the trial. Although this suggestion was clearly supported by the experts, systematic use of plasma level monitoring in TRD/PRD definitions is not current practice. It is important to note that the FDA does not accept data analyses that exclude individuals not compliant to the previous treatment based on a blood dosing of the medicine. Further discussion on adherence is presented in the Appendix. However, we recommend assessing the usefulness of different methods to measure a person's adherence for a potential (and desirable) future implementation (see Future directions).

### Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder: Canadian expert consensus on definition and assessment [^114tkpbm]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS/DISCUSSION

Results are presented as a logical sequence of essential questions and answers to assist with clinical and research utility. Each item contains a body of evidence‐based literature review and the experts' consensus opinions. The consensus results are complemented by the experts' comments. Table 2 presents the summary of the 27 items which reached consensus from this group of experts.

Table 2
Summary of statements from the modified Delphi methodology

3.1 Is TRD a useful concept?

The concept of TRD captures clinical reality since it reflects a large clinical population with a common clinical outcome. It is not a new concept as the term has been utilized by the mental health community since the 1970s. Historically, it has survived over more than 4 decades and has periodically attracted more attention every time a new potentially effective treatment emerges.

As with any concept, however, TRD does not perfectly fit the clinical variability of real‐life cases. Each of the two major components of the concept, response and treatment, has inherent limitations when it comes to individual responses. For instance, the line between response and nonresponse is clouded by partial responders, fully refractory cases and those with very different sets of symptoms and heterogeneity of treatment resistance (Malhi & Byrow, 2016). The treatment component is often characterized as treatment adequacy and may be difficult to assess due to the variability of treatment options, the match between treatment and sets of symptoms, or the presence of comorbid conditions and psychosocial factors.

Despite the imprecision of the concept of TRD, the expert panel reiterated its usefulness both for clinical practice and research. In the first round of the survey, 92% felt that TRD is a meaningful concept and 85% of respondents use a TRD definition in their clinical practice. All (100%) respondents indicated that an operational definition of TRD was needed. A definition for TRD helps clinicians to become aware of the persistence of depression in individual cases in a timely fashion and to foresee potential treatment challenges and consider more effective interventions.

### Depression: managing resistance and partial response to treatment [^115wYXzQ]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression is defined as absence of remission despite trials of two or more antidepressant medications and can occur in up to 31% of patients with major depressive disorder. Partial response to treatment is defined as less than 50% reduction in depression-rating scores. Before diagnosing treatment-resistant depression or partial response to treatment, adherence to adequate doses and duration of medications should be confirmed. Management strategies include adding psychotherapy, switching antidepressant medication class, or augmenting with additional medications. Current guidelines recommend augmentation with a second-generation antidepressant, an atypical antipsychotic, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, or a triiodothyronine medication as pharmacologic options. Ketamine and esketamine can also be used as augmentation for treatment-resistant depression and may help reduce suicidal ideation. Electroconvulsive therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may be effective. Pharmacogenetic testing has limited evidence and is not recommended. Nonpharmacologic therapies include psychotherapy, exercise, and focused dietary changes.

### Predictors of response to augmentation treatment in patients with treatment-resistant depression: a systematic review [^116NyV1K]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment-resistant depression is an important contributor to the global burden of depression. Antidepressant augmentation is a recommended treatment strategy for treatment-resistant patients, but outcomes remain poor. Identifying factors that are predictive of response to augmentation treatments may improve outcomes.

Aims

This review aimed to synthesise the existing literature examining predictors of response to augmentation treatments in patients who had insufficiently responded to initial treatment.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted identifying 2241 unique manuscripts. 24 examining predictors of outcome to pharmacological or psychological augmentation treatment were included in this review.

Results

Atypical antipsychotics were the most frequently assessed treatment class (nine studies), closely followed by mood stabilisers (eight studies). Only one eligible psychological augmentation study was identified. Early response to treatment (week 2) was the best-supported predictor of subsequent treatment outcome, reported by six studies. Many predictor variables were only assessed by one report and others such as pre-treatment severity yielded contradictory results, both within and across treatment classes.

Conclusions

This review highlights the importance of early response as a predictor of pharmacological augmentation outcome, with implications for both the monitoring and treatment of resistant unipolar patients. Further replication is needed across specific interventions to fully assess the generalisability of this finding. However, the clear lack of consistent evidence for other predictive factors both within and across treatments, and the scarce examination of psychological augmentation, demonstrates the need for much more research of a high quality if response prediction is to improve outcomes for patients with treatment-resistant depression.

### Treatment resistance in psychiatry: state of the art and new directions [^11778LoQ]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

However, whilst these core components are seen in the definitions of treatment resistance across disorders, there is considerable variation in the specific criteria used between different disorders. Surprisingly, marked variation in criteria is also seen within the same psychiatric diagnoses, particularly regarding how adequate pharmacotherapy is defined and how response to treatment is assessed. For example, the number of treatment trials that an individual should receive prior to a diagnosis of treatment resistance is, for some criteria for OCD and depression, either not defined, or inconsistent, ranging between 2–3 different drugs for depression. Furthermore, certain criteria for schizophrenia, depression, and OCD recommend using different drug classes (e.g. ensuring a trial of first and second-generation antipsychotics in some criteria for schizophrenia), while others do not make this specification. Moreover, the target drug dose is often not defined, despite some conditions having well-described dose-equivalents at which clinical response is expected. Thus, subtherapeutic trials of treatments may be erroneously considered adequate trials, leading to an over-inclusive classification of treatment resistance. For OCD, definitions of treatment trials also are inconsistent on whether or not psychological therapy should be included as a treatment alongside pharmacological therapy. For some criteria, recommended treatment durations are either not defined, or range between 2–12 weeks. Treatments such as those delivered in long-acting injectable formulation may take months to reach steady state, thus there is the risk that shorter trials of certain medications may be inadequate. There is also a lack of clarity regarding use of some neuro-stimulatory treatments. For example, although most MDD guidelines discuss use of transcranial magnetic stimulation as a therapeutic option, advice regarding its role in the context of treatment resistance, whether it should be used as monojunctive or adjunctive therapy, and what position it should take in a treatment algorithm for resistant symptoms is often not stated.

Type of medications

Different classes and mechanisms of action

The EMA mentions that the two treatment failures could be with medications of "same or different class". Other guidelines, including the FDA guidance, do not make this distinction. Interestingly, the concept of 'different mechanisms' may overlap with 'different classes', although the pharmacological overlap between classes and mechanism of action is not absolute; the Neuroscience-based Nomenclature (NbN) for psychotropic agents has greatly contributed to clarify this issue. Moreover, there are some geographically-relevant label limitations to the usage of some medications (see also Appendix).

We recommend (with moderate consensus, 75%) that, to define TRD, the two antidepressant treatment failures should be with two established (licensed) medications for MDD of different mechanisms of action. The two treatments could be separated by a drug free period (and there is failure to both), prescribed sequentially (switching, with failure to both), or one is prescribed as augmentation to the other (because of the first drug failing, and with the augmentation also failing).

Moreover, we also recommend (with moderate consensus, 78%) that a failed course of psychotherapy should not be included as one of the previous treatments required for the definition of TRD/PRD, but this information should be reported for staging (see below). Notably, this recommendation does not have implications for the role of psychotherapies in the treatment of TRD, and, similarly to other TRD models proposed, we support the use of psychotherapies as a treatment strategy for TRD in clinical practice.

### Managing treatment-resistant major depression [^111Ut3ER]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

A sizable proportion of patients suffering from nonpsychotic unipolar depression experience only partial or no clinical response to antidepressant treatment. Switching, augmenting, and combining various pharmaceutical agents can be effective strategies for patients with treatment-resistant depression. The empirical evidence supporting these approaches is inconsistent, however, and there is a paucity of controlled studies to support their efficacy. Additionally, it has been difficult to demonstrate the advantages of these strategies over increasing the dose or duration of the initial drug treatment. This article will review available evidence and clinical considerations regarding switching, augmenting, and combining various agents in the treatment of patients suffering from nonpsychotic unipolar depression who have failed adequate courses of antidepressant treatment. More research is needed that controls for continued time on the initial agent, that compares different strategies, and that determines which patients are the best candidates for which treatment.

### Treatment-resistant depression [^116LpCpY]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Up to two thirds of patients with major unipolar depression will not respond to the first medication prescribed. Depression may be considered resistant to treatment when at least two trials with antidepressants from different pharmacologic classes (adequate in dose, duration, and compliance) fail to produce a significant clinical improvement. Evidence regarding the effectiveness of psychotherapy for treatment-resistant depression is limited. A recent high-quality trial found that patients who did not respond to citalopram and who received cognitive behavior therapy (with or without continued citalopram) had similar response and remission rates to those who received other medication regimens. Initial remission rates in that trial were 37 percent, and even after three additional trials of different drugs or cognitive behavior therapy, the cumulative remission rate was only 67 percent. In general, patients who require more treatment steps have higher relapse rates, and fewer than one half of patients achieve sustained remission. No treatment strategy appears to be better than another. Electroconvulsive therapy is effective as short-term therapy of treatment-resistant depression. There is no good-quality evidence that vagal nerve stimulation is an effective treatment for this condition.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^111tKVfj]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly burdensome health condition, for which there are numerous accepted pharmacological and psychological interventions. Adjunctive treatment (augmentation/combination) is recommended for the ~50% of MDD patients who do not adequately respond to first-line treatment. We aimed to evaluate the current evidence for concomitant approaches for people with early-stage treatment-resistant depression (TRD; defined below).

Methods:

We systematically searched Medline and Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science to identify randomised controlled trials of adjunctive treatment of ⩾10 adults with MDD who had not responded to ⩾1 adequate antidepressant. The cochrane risk of bias (RoB) tool was used to assess study quality. Pre-post treatment meta-analyses were performed, allowing for comparison across heterogeneous study designs independent of comparator interventions.

Results:

In total, 115 trials investigating 48 treatments were synthesised. The mean intervention duration was 9 weeks (range 5 days to 18 months) with most studies assessed to have low (n = 57) or moderate (n = 51) RoB. The highest effect sizes (ESs) were from cognitive behavioural therapy (ES = 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09–2.07), (es)ketamine (ES = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.23–1.73) and risperidone (ES = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.29–1.61). Only aripiprazole and lithium were examined in ⩾10 studies. Pill placebo (ES = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81–0.98) had a not inconsiderable ES, and only six treatments' 95% CIs did not overlap with pill placebo's (aripiprazole, (es)ketamine, mirtazapine, olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone). We report marked heterogeneity between studies for almost all analyses.

Conclusions:

Our findings support cautious optimism for several augmentation strategies; although considering the high prevalence of TRD, evidence remains inadequate for each treatment option.

### Evidence-based treatment strategies for treatment-resistant bipolar depression: a systematic review [^111wajMa]. Bipolar Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Treatment resistance in bipolar depression is a common clinical problem that constitutes a major challenge for the treating clinician as there is a paucity of treatment options. The objective of this paper was to review the evidence for treatment options in treatment-resistant bipolar depression, as found in randomized controlled trials and with special attention to the definition and assessment of treatment resistance.

Methods

A Medline search (from database inception to May 2012) was performed using the search terms treatment resistance or treatment refractory, and bipolar depression or bipolar disorder, supplemented with 43 separate searches using the various pharmacologic agents or technical interventions as search terms.

Results

Only seven studies met our inclusion criteria. These studies examined the effects of ketamine (n = 1), (ar)modafinil (n = 2), pramipexole (n = 1), lamotrigine (n = 1), inositol (n = 1), risperidone (n = 1), and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (n = 2).

Conclusions

The available level I evidence for treatment strategies in resistant bipolar depression is extremely scarce, and although the response rates reported are reassuring, most of the strategies remain experimental. There is an urgent need for further study in homogeneous patient samples using a clear concept of treatment resistance.

### A Delphi-method-based consensus guideline for definition of treatment-resistant depression for clinical trials [^1127VWto]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Our Delphi-method-based approach

The Delphi approach is a method of choice for developing guidelines in health research. Indeed, a recent commentary to the aforementioned paper on DTD specifically recommends using a Delphi approach for consensus statement in depression. However, this method could be difficult to standardize, with poor reporting of findings. Probably the most important of these issues has been identified in the definition of consensus. Therefore, we clearly defined consensus as a percentage of agreement (vs. disagreement) on a precise recommendation, and further defined strong consensus when this percentage was equal or above 95%, moderate consensus between 61 and 94%, and weak consensus between 51 and 60%. Details of our Delphi process are available in the Appendix and summarized in Fig. 1. Briefly, it consisted of: (1) identification of experts with a track record of publications in this area or stakeholders with clear expertise, from clinical practice, academia, industry, and regulatory agencies; (2) first draft report, with an up-to-date narrative review on TRD/PRD definitions (in February 2020) and a questionnaire to gather opinions on the debated issues; (3) an online consensus meeting with academics and clinicians, on the 22nd of May 2020; (4) second draft report, integrating comments to the first draft with those from the meeting, and again circulated to all contributors; (5) third draft report (with an updated narrative review, in September 2020), circulated to a different group of stakeholders, including representatives of regulatory authorities, industry, and one PWLE; (6) an online consensus meeting with stakeholders, on the 9th of October 2020, with additional stakeholders providing written feedback; (7) fourth draft report (with a systematic review of the literature published from March 2020 to January 2021), integrating stakeholders comments, which was then circulated and approved by all authors, and submitted in its entirety (approximately 28,000 words) internally to IMI EU-PEARL (available from the corresponding author on request); (8) editing of the report into this shorter version for publication, again circulated and approved by all authors. Comments to the different versions of the report were always anonymized. Methodological details of the narrative reviews and of the subsequent systematic review are presented in the Appendix.

### Ketamine treatment for depression: opportunities for clinical innovation and ethical foresight [^115MCHBb]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

We present a review and analysis of the ethical considerations in off-label ketamine use for severe, treatment-resistant depression. The analysis of ethical considerations is contextualised in an overview of the evidence for ketamine use in depression, and a review of the drug's safety profile. We find that, based on current evidence, ketamine use for severe, treatment-resistant depression does not violate ethical principles; however, clinicians and professional bodies must take steps to ensure that guidelines for good practice are enacted, that all experimental and trial data are made available through national registries, and that the risk potential of ketamine treatment continues to be monitored and modelled. We conclude with a set of key recommendations for oversight bodies that would support safe, effective, and ethical use of ketamine in depression.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^116apAE7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Potential sources of variability not examined

Although we examined TRD severity as a dichotomous factor for its potential to influence treatment efficacy, we were neither able to look in detail at the different approaches used to assess treatment resistance (e.g.vs Massachusetts General Hospital staging models), nor we categorised studies employing a sequential design or prospective open-label standardised treatment to determine TRD. Relatedly, we did not examine the severity or chronicity of patients' depressive episodes as potential effect modifiers on clinical outcome.

There are several other factors confounders, which could have impacted ESs. These include blinding (and indeed incidences of unblinding), allegiance effects or statistical methods, as well as the extent of the likely efficacy expectation effect, recruitment sources of patients, trial-specific eligibility criteria and generalisability (clinical or demographic) and treatment delivery. It is important to note that these effect modifiers may even differ between treatments (e.g. newer interventions being subject to different methodologies than older interventions). In traditional between-subjects meta-analyses, these factors are largely accounted for, within each study, by the direct group comparisons. Our comparison of within-subjects ES' between treatments does not account for this study-to-study variability directly.

### What is the role of brain stimulation therapies in the treatment of depression? [^113Ds3hS]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Brain stimulation therapies have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of depression and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Non-invasive brain stimulation in the treatment of depression has grown substantially due to their favorable adverse effect profiles. The role of transcranial direct current stimulation in TRD is unclear, but emerging data suggests that it may be an effective add-on treatment. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has demonstrated efficacy in TRD that is supported by several multicenter randomized controlled trials. Though, vagus nerve stimulation has been found to be effective in some studies, sham controlled studies were equivocal. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a well-established brain stimulation treatment for severe depression and TRD, yet stigma and cognitive adverse effects limit its wider use. Magnetic seizure therapy has a more favorable cognitive adverse effect profile; however, equivalent efficacy to ECT needs to be established. Deep brain stimulation may play a role in severe TRD and controlled trials are now underway.

### Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder: Canadian expert consensus on definition and assessment [^1111HenB]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent reviews usually define failure to respond as "lack of decrease in depressive severity of at least 50%" (GRADE‐high) (Gaynes et al. 2018). The report from the European Group for the Study of Resistant Depression identifies resistance as less than 50% symptom reduction (Bartova et al. 2019). Although reports do not consistently agree on a definition of adequate dose and duration, the minimum duration cited is typically 4 weeks (Gaynes et al. 2018), and the range of 4–12 weeks (Ng et al. 2019). This expert panel proposes the following criteria for initial treatment resistance (Table 3).

Table 3
Operational definition suggested for the initial stage of treatment‐resistant depression (TRD)

The treatment failure component of the definition of TRD revealed a diversity of opinions among experts based on conflicting data on the effectiveness of switching antidepressants and the benefits of using antidepressants from different groups in managing TRD. There exists mixed evidence regarding the advantages of prescribing medications from the same class or different classes and therefore this study deliberately did not explore this (Bschor et al. 2018; Carvalho et al. 2014). The other area of consideration is how the failure of an antidepressant trial is defined. On one hand, failure of two antidepressants can mean nonresponse during the initiation of treatment, but the failure of an antidepressant may also occur during the maintenance phase of treatment with the relapse of a depressive episode following a remission despite being on adequate doses of medication. The mechanism of tachyphylaxis remains unclear and continues to be under investigation (Targum, 2014). Given the multifactorial etiology for medication failures, these considerations further warrant a dimensional approach to define TRD and clarify the heterogeneity of this population.

### Effect of adjunctive simvastatin on depressive symptoms among adults with treatment-resistant depression: a randomized clinical trial [^115eUzqu]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does adjunctive treatment with 20 mg/d of simvastatin lead to an improvement in depressive symptoms in adults with treatment-resistant depression?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 150 participants with treatment-resistant unipolar depression, 12 weeks of 20 mg/d of simvastatin added to standard care did not show a statistically significant benefit compared with placebo added to standard care on the overall course of depressive symptoms.

Meaning

In this study, simvastatin was not beneficial for the treatment of symptoms of treatment-resistant depression compared with standard care.

### Is ketamine an appropriate alternative to ECT for patients with treatment resistant depression? A systematic review [^114vyLDL]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Ketamine has repeatedly shown to have rapid and robust antidepressant effects in patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD). An important question is whether ketamine is as effective and safe as the current gold standard electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).

Methods

The literature was searched for trials comparing ketamine treatment with ECT for depression in the Pubmed/MEDLINE database and Cochrane Trials Library.

Results

A total of 137 manuscripts were identified, 6 articles were included in this review. Overall quality of the included studies was diverse with relevant risk of bias for some of the studies. Results suggest that ketamine treatment might give faster but perhaps less durable antidepressant effects. Side effects differed from ECT, in particular less cognitive impairment was apparent in ketamine treatment.

Limitations

The included studies have limited sample sizes, use different treatment protocols and in most trials, longer term follow up is lacking. Furthermore, allocation bias appears likely in the non-randomized trials.

Conclusions

Current available literature does not yet provide convincing evidence to consider ketamine as an equally effective treatment alternative to ECT in patients with TRD. There are indications for a more favourable short term cognitive side effect profile after ketamine treatment. Methodologically well-designed studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow up duration are warranted.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for treatment-resistant depression in older patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1155YRWn]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

Depression in older adults is often undertreated. A 2011 systematic review of treatments for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in older adults identified one placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial (RCT). We aimed to update this review, synthesising evidence for the effectiveness of treatments for TRD in older people.

Methods

We systematically searched electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science) from 9 January 2011 through 10 December 2023 (updating our search on 7 January 2024 for RCTs investigating TRD therapies in adults aged ≥ 55 years, defining treatment resistance as ≥ 1 unsuccessful treatment. We assessed bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) 2 tool, meta-analysed remission rates and evaluated evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) criteria.

Results

14 studies (11 newly identified, 3 from previous review) involving 1196 participants (mean age 65.0, male/female 548/648) met the inclusion criteria; 10 were placebo controlled and 4 were rated as low RoB. The pooled proportion of participants in intervention arms remitting was 0.35 (17 arms; 95% CI = 0.26; 0.45). Relative to placebo, intervention participants were more likely to remit (9 studies; OR 2.42 (95% CI = 1.49; 3.92)). Relative to controls, remission rates favoured ketamine (n = 3; OR 2.91 (1.11; 7.65)), with a trend towards transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (n = 3; 1.99 (0.71; 5.61)), and in single placebo-controlled studies, selegiline, aripiprazole augmentation, pharmacogenetic-guided prescribing (PGP) and cognitive remediation favoured interventions.

Conclusions

We identified weak evidence that ketamine therapy and aripiprazole augmentation, and very weak evidence that TMS, PGP and cognitive remediation increased remission. Lack of evidence regarding routinely prescribed antidepressants and psychosocial treatments is problematic, requiring clinicians to extend evidence from younger populations.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^113D9NHf]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly burdensome health condition, for which there are numerous accepted pharmacological and psychological interventions. Adjunctive treatment (augmentation/combination) is recommended for the ~50% of MDD patients who do not adequately respond to first-line treatment. We aimed to evaluate the current evidence for concomitant approaches for people with early-stage treatment-resistant depression (TRD; defined below).

Methods

We systematically searched Medline and Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science to identify randomised controlled trials of adjunctive treatment of ⩾10 adults with MDD who had not responded to ⩾1 adequate antidepressant. The cochrane risk of bias (RoB) tool was used to assess study quality. Pre-post treatment meta-analyses were performed, allowing for comparison across heterogeneous study designs independent of comparator interventions.

Results

In total, 115 trials investigating 48 treatments were synthesised. The mean intervention duration was 9weeks (range 5days to 18months) with most studies assessed to have low (n = 57) or moderate (n = 51) RoB. The highest effect sizes (ESs) were from cognitive behavioural therapy (ES = 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09–2.07), (es)ketamine (ES = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.23–1.73) and risperidone (ES = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.29–1.61). Only aripiprazole and lithium were examined in ⩾10 studies. Pill placebo (ES = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81–0.98) had a not inconsiderable ES, and only six treatments' 95% CIs did not overlap with pill placebo's (aripiprazole, (es)ketamine, mirtazapine, olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone). We report marked heterogeneity between studies for almost all analyses.

Conclusions

Our findings support cautious optimism for several augmentation strategies; although considering the high prevalence of TRD, evidence remains inadequate for each treatment option.

### What are the comparative benefits and harms of augmentation treatments in major depression? [^114VJXjM]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

The majority of depressed patients do not experience sufficient response to their initial antidepressant medication. Augmentation strategies, particularly the use of atypical antipsychotics to augment selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have proliferated over the last 15 years, and 2 atypical antipsychotics, aripiprazole and quetiapine, have received US Food and Drug Administration approval for adjunctive therapy in treatment-resistant depression. Alternatively, data in treatment-resistant depression exist for most of the atypicals and for other treatments, including lithium, bupropion, methylphenidate, pindolol, and buspirone.

### Major depressive disorder: understanding the significance of residual symptoms and balancing efficacy with tolerability [^112GrDhr]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder is a complex and frequent psychiatric condition that poses significant challenges to both the patients who experience it and the physicians who treat them. The goal of therapy is for patients to achieve remission, which requires identifying and measuring symptoms at the outset and throughout treatment to document both response and resistance to treatment. A number of validated instruments are available both for diagnosis of and response to treatment. Many factors affect a patient's ability to achieve remission, but although many patients do achieve remission, a significant number continue to have residual symptoms that cause functional impairment.

Methods

Review of the literature for treatment of major depression, including mechanisms of action, individualized treatment optimization, residual symptom reduction, and minimization of side effects.

Results

For sustained remission, all symptoms must be treated until they are undetectable. Patients who do not achieve remission after adequate treatment trials should be evaluated for adherence to treatment, as well as comorbid psychiatric and medical disorders. In these cases, consideration should be given to changing therapy by switching, combining, or augmenting initial therapy, as well as referring some patients to a psychiatrist for treatment with specialized modalities. Linking symptoms with malfunctioning brain circuits and neurotransmitters provides a targeted approach for achieving sustained remission. Neurobiology also provides a rational basis for combination therapy in patients with treatment-resistant depression, because it can aid selection of different drugs with different mechanisms of action or of multifunctional/multimodal antidepressant drugs that target more than 1 molecular mechanism.

Discussion

Recent advances and better understanding of neurobiology provide a rational basis for individualizing treatment of patients with major depression.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^117TyMdH]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Interventions

Studies were eligible for inclusion if participants were randomised to at least one condition where either their current continuation therapy was augmented by addition of a second intervention, or simultaneous commencement of two interventions (two pharmacological agents or one pharmacological and one psychological therapy). For both pharmacological continuation and augmentation agents, treatments included in the Maudsley Treatment Inventory were permitted, in addition to pharmacological therapies which had reached significance in at least one meta-analysis for depression.

Psychological therapies from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines, or those which had reached meta-analysis significance for treating MDD were deemed eligible. We made the decision to exclude neurostimulatory treatments, such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation, as exploration of these was considered beyond the scope of this review. Pharmacological or psychological comparators were examined in the review (i.e. pill placebo, a different pharmacological treatment, another psychological therapy, waiting list or treatment as usual (TAU)) although other physical treatment comparators (e.g. ECT) were not considered in the current review.

Outcome measures

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported clinical improvement of depression following treatment.

Primary outcome: Our primary outcome measure was clinical improvement of depression (or depression symptoms) using validated instruments, summarised with an ES between pre- and post-treatment time points for all eligible treatment and comparator arms. We selected one efficacy instrument per study, giving preference to clinician-rated measures of depression severity. If this was not available, a patient-rated depression severity scale or an assessment of global improvement was reported.

Secondary outcomes: We reported any measure of treatment adherence (e.g. participant drop-out due to any cause or specific treatment adherence information) and treatment tolerability (e.g. data on side effects or adverse events) where this data was provided.

### Efficacy and safety of eight enhanced therapies for treatment-resistant depression: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of RCTs [^113eWvap]. Psychiatry Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD) challenges psychiatric treatment, with existing guidelines covering only a subset of augmentation strategies.

Methods

A network meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines examined the efficacy and safety of TRD treatments, analyzing 72 randomized controlled trials from eight databases, assessing response and remission rates, tolerability, and safety through the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and CINeMA framework.

Findings

Including 12,105 participants, the analysis highlighted ECT, Ketamine, Esketamine, and Psilocybin as superior first-line treatments due to their optimal balance between effectiveness and tolerability. Brexpiprazole and Quetiapine showed no significant efficacy over placebo in response rates, while Esketamine and Psilocybin exhibited lower tolerability.

Interpretation

The results advocate for ECT, Ketamine, Esketamine, and Psilocybin as preferred treatments for TRD, guiding clinical practice with evidence-based recommendations for enhancing treatment outcomes. This study underscores the importance of considering both efficacy and safety in selecting augmentation strategies for TRD.

### Examination of the utility of psychotherapy for patients with treatment resistant depression: a systematic review [^113ieToV]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the utility of psychotherapy in managing treatment resistant depression.

Data Sources

PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase, Cochrane Registry of Controlled Clinical Trials, article bibliographies.

Review Methods

Eligible articles had to be in English and include English-speaking adult outpatients from general medical or mental health clinics. Studies had to be randomized clinical trials (RCT) involving at least one of the following psychotherapy modalities: cognitive therapy, interpersonal therapy, or behavior therapy. Patients were considered treatment resistant if they reported partial or no remission following treatment with an adequate antidepressant dose for ≥ 6 weeks. Exclusion criteria included receiving psychotherapy at the time of recruitment, and/or comorbid psychiatric conditions unlikely to be treated outside of specialized mental health care (e.g., severe substance abuse). Due to heterogeneity in study designs, a summary estimate of effect was not calculated. Studies were critically analyzed and a qualitative synthesis was conducted.

Results

Of 941 original titles, 13 articles evaluating 7 unique treatment comparisons were included. Psychotherapy was examined as an augmentation to antidepressants in five studies and as substitution treatment in two studies. A total of 592 patients were evaluated (Mean age ~40 y; Females = 50–85%; Caucasians ≥ 75%). The STAR*D trial used an equipoise stratified randomization design; the remaining studies were RCTs. Compared to active management, two good quality trials showed similar benefit from augmenting antidepressants with psychotherapy; one fair quality and one poor quality trial showed benefit from psychotherapy augmentation; and one good and one poor trial found similar benefit from substituting psychotherapy for antidepressants. One fair quality trial showed lithium augmentation to be more beneficial than psychotherapy.

Conclusions

Review demonstrates the utility of psychotherapy in managing treatment resistant depression. However, evidence is sparse and results are mixed. Given that quality trials are lacking, rigorous clinical trials are recommended to guide practice. In the interim, primary care providers should consider psychotherapy when treating patients with treatment resistant depression.

### Augmentation and combination strategies in treatment-resistant depression [^116JUvqC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

A substantial proportion of depressed patients show only partial or no response to antidepressants, and even among responders to antidepressant treatment, residual symptoms are rather common. When depressions do not respond adequately to treatment with an antidepressant, clinicians may choose to keep the same antidepressant and add another "augmenting" compound. Such augmentation strategies involve the use of a pharmacologic agent that is not considered to be a standard antidepressant but may boost or enhance the effect of an antidepressant. Alternatively, clinicians may choose combination strategies, in which they combine the antidepressant that did not produce adequate response with another antidepressant, typically of a different class. There are only a few controlled clinical trials of these 2 strategies among patients with treatment-resistant depression or among patients who have only partially benefited from antidepressant treatment. Most of the time, clinicians' decisions are, therefore, guided by anecdotal reports, case series, and by some relatively smaller, uncontrolled clinical trials. These augmentation and combination strategies appear to be relatively safe and effective approaches to treatment-resistant depressions, although there is a relative paucity of controlled studies to support their efficacy. These strategies typically aim at obtaining a different neurochemical effect than the one obtained with the antidepressant that has not produced adequate response. While drug-drug interactions may limit the use of some of these strategies, the potential loss of partial benefit from the failed drug inherent in switching may increase the acceptability of augmentation and combination strategies among partial responders. Further studies are clearly needed to evaluate the comparative efficacy and tolerability of these different approaches in treatment-resistant depressions.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^112NwbFk]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Older adult depression — prevalence and course is marked by high inpatient rates, frequent relapse, and treatment resistance. Prevalence is reported as higher still (10%-42%) among older patients in inpatient settings, including long-term care. Subthreshold depression is 2–3 times more common than major depression in older adults, and 8%-10% of those with subthreshold symptoms develop major depression each year. The clinical presentation in older adults differs from earlier life by following a relapsing and recurrent course, and depression is often treatment resistant, with partial response linked to continuing disability, caregiver burden, and elevated risk for early relapse and recurrence.

### Defining treatment-resistant bipolar depression: recommendations from the ISBD task force [^1174mPAa]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Despite the availability of approved treatments, a substantial proportion of patients with bipolar disorder experience treatment-resistant bipolar depression (TRBD), characterized by persistent depressive symptoms unresponsive to standard therapies. However, a universally accepted definition of TRBD is lacking. This consensus document, developed by the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) Task Force on TRBD, aims to provide a standardized definition of TRBD to facilitate clinical trials, research, and treatment strategies.

Methods

The Task Force employed a literature review, clinical trials analysis, and expert consensus meetings to define TRBD.

Results

TRBD was defined as the failure to achieve a significant and sustained clinical response after at least two approved and adequately dosed pharmacological treatments, administered for a sufficient duration with treatment adherence. For bipolar I (BD-I) depression, approved treatments included quetiapine (300–600mg/day for ≥ 8weeks), lurasidone (20–120mg/day for ≥ 6weeks), the combination of olanzapine (6–12mg/day) and fluoxetine (25–75mg/day for ≥ 8weeks), cariprazine (1.5–3mg/day for ≥ 6weeks), and lumateperone (42mg/day for ≥ 6weeks). For bipolar II (BD-II) depression, approved treatments included quetiapine (300–600mg/day for ≥ 8weeks) and lumateperone (42mg/day for ≥ 6weeks).

Conclusion

This consensus definition aims to provide clarity for clinical trials, improve consistency in research, and guide treatment approaches and inform regulatory pathways. It represents a foundational step in addressing the unmet needs in TRBD and promoting the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. Future efforts will focus on adapting the definition to better align with real-world clinical challenges and optimize patient care.

### Developing a treatment-resistant depression consultation program, part II: assessment [^116TuV4Y]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective: To provide recommendations regarding the critical elements of the assessment package in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) consultation programs. This is a complementary manuscript to Part I, which discusses practical and logistical considerations for developing and sustaining a subspecialized TRD consultation program.

Participants: A group of 12 clinicians, researchers, administrators, and patient advocates from the National Network of Depression Centers (NNDC) TRD Task Group.

Evidence: The recommendations are based on expert opinion. This consensus statement reflects the effort of the NNDC's TRD Task Group to reach agreement on a set of principles that those interested in establishing new consultation programs could use to guide their effort and a set of recommendations that could serve as a basis for future empirical work.

Consensus Process: Each member of the NNDC TRD Task Group provided a written description of the procedures used at their home institution, which were used during a day-long forum to achieve consensus on recommendations for each component of a TRD consultation program. Subgroups were formed to draft recommendations, and points of disagreement were resolved at subsequent meetings of the full task group.

Conclusions: We describe consensus recommendations regarding the goals of a TRD consultation, which include establishing the primary diagnosis and comorbidities, clarifying medical and psychiatric symptoms, identifying goals, documenting treatment history, identifying treatment barriers, and developing actionable treatment recommendations. We detail important components of the consultation evaluation process, the assessment tools to consider in establishing a TRD consultation program, and the qualifications of providers.

### Augmentation and combination strategies in resistant depression [^115edWSK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

A minority of patients with depression achieves remission with first-line antidepressant treatment; consequently, a second medication is often added to enhance the effects of the initial agent. The second medication may or may not be another antidepressant. Clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of many agents commonly used for augmentation or combination therapy, but well-designed, large trials with a clear definition of treatment resistance are needed.

### A Delphi-method-based consensus guideline for definition of treatment-resistant depression for clinical trials [^116YX3Ln]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation

TRD and PRD symptoms

People living with MDD have a range of symptoms specifiers (for example, with melancholic features, with atypical features, with psychotic features), as well as the presence of comorbid diagnoses (for example, comorbid anxiety, bipolar depression). Potentially, some of these symptoms may be more difficult to treat compared with others, such as MDD with anxious distress.

We recommend (with strong consensus, 95%) that all specifiers of depression (melancholic, atypical, anxious, psychotic, mixed) should be considered within the TRD/PRD definition, except for bipolar depression, which should be excluded as this is part of bipolar disorder.

### A Delphi-method-based consensus guideline for definition of treatment-resistant depression for clinical trials [^113TQ5qD]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Exclusion from TRD/PRD studies

Many people with lived experience (PWLE) who fulfil the proposed criteria for TRD may have tried many ineffective antidepressants (multi-drug resistance) or other (licensed or unlicensed) pharmacological augmentation interventions (see also Appendix). We discussed whether these individuals should be considered to have TRD which is 'too severe' for inclusion in clinical trials.

We recommend (with moderate consensus, 93%) that multiple-drug resistant individuals, and individuals in whom augmentation strategies failed to improve/eliminate MDD symptoms should not be excluded from TRD/PRD studies, provided the other criteria are met. We also recommend (with strong consensus, 100%) that a previous structured psychotherapy failing to improve MDD symptoms is not an exclusion criterion. Rather, all this information should be recorded for staging and for potential subgroup analyses.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) are continuous treatments in which a neurostimulator (usually implanted in the chest wall) is connected to intracerebral electrodes or the left vagus nerve. Because of the invasiveness of these intervention, people selected for these treatments have tried an unusually large number of ineffective treatments, and thus are different from other people living with TRD.

We recommend (with moderate consensus, 62%) that individuals with MDD in whom DBS and VNS failed to improve/eliminate MDD symptoms should be excluded from TRD/PRD clinical studies. However, we also recommend (with moderate consensus, 88%) that individuals with MDD in whom other non-continuous/non-invasive brain stimulation interventions, such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), failed to improve/eliminate MDD symptoms should not be excluded.

### ECT in treatment-resistant depression [^116qrpgG]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which has been in use for 75 years, is an important treatment for severe and treatment-resistant depression. Although it is acknowledged as the most effective acute treatment for severe mood and psychotic disorders, it remains controversial because of misperceptions about its use and lack of familiarity among health care professionals about modern ECT technique. The authors present an illustrative case of a patient for whom ECT is indicated. They review the basic and clinical science related to ECT's mechanism of action and discuss clinical issues in the administration of a course of ECT, including the consent process.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^1168DWgo]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Subgroup effects — There are no clear indications regarding which patient with which characteristics will benefit from which treatment, patient preferences indicate many patients prefer psychotherapy over pharmacotherapy although an important minority (about 25%) prefer pharmacotherapy, combined treatments of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are more effective than either of the treatments alone in some subpopulations but carry greater costs and risks, some research suggests combined treatment may interfere with enduring effects of psychotherapy, and for patients with chronic and treatment-resistant depression combined treatment is usually recommended.

### Using adjunctive treatments when first-line antidepressants fail [^112bwbGJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression is a common challenge for clinicians, as the majority of patients with depression do not achieve remission after an initial antidepressant trial. Major strategies for managing treatment-resistant depression include switching to another antidepressant or augmenting the initial antidepressant with another medication. Switching may be appropriate for patients experiencing little or no symptom relief or intolerable side effects with the initial antidepressant. For patients who experience partial response from the first-line antidepressant, adjunctive therapies avoid the loss of this response and the wash-out and cross-titration that are required when switching antidepressants. Several effective antidepressant augmentation agents are available, including lithium, thyroid hormone, anti-anxiety medications, and atypical antipsychotics. The evidence for the efficacy and risks of these strategies is discussed.

### Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder: Canadian expert consensus on definition and assessment [^117PraQK]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Depressive disorders constitute one of the most common disabling diseases worldwide with an estimated prevalence of 264 million globally (Disease, and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators, 2018). In the Canadian population, depression has a lifetime prevalence of 9.9% (Patten et al. 2015) with an estimated economic cost of 12 billion dollars a year (Tanner et al. 2020). Among those who receive first‐line treatment for depression, approximately 50% do not achieve remission and about two‐thirds require further sequential treatment trials to achieve remission (Ferrari et al. 2013; Rush, Trivedi, Wisniewski, Stewart, et al. 2006). This disease burden confers increased morbidity and mortality, decreases the quality of life (Alonso et al. 2011), impairs occupational, social, and offspring development (Greenberg et al. 2015; Ishak et al. 2013; Lim et al. 2008), and translates into increased costs on the health‐care system (Coiro et al. 2012; Weissman et al. 2014). For both patients living with depression that does not remit despite multiple treatment trials, and clinicians providing treatment, consensus on the definition, and treatment protocols for treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) are needed.

There is a lack of consensus on the definition of TRD. Broadly conceptualized as partial or no response to adequate evidence‐based trials of treatment, TRD has a prevalence of up to 60% of the depression cohort (Berman et al. 1997). Treatment resistance may be conceptualized to include characteristics, such as chronic and persistent symptoms of low mood, repeated depressive episodes, or poor response to medications or other therapies. The challenges of defining TRD include the heterogeneity of the syndrome, lack of standardization of criteria for an "adequate trial", and whether to include nonpharmacological treatments, resulting in a lack of consensus and validity of definition. The most utilized definition in the last 2 decades with support from the largest naturalistic trial (sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression [STAR*D]) is the lack of response after two antidepressant treatment trials (Berman et al. 1997). Several countries have suggested an internationally accepted TRD definition (Vaccarino & Kennedy, 2020), but unanimity has been elusive (Fava, 2003).

### What role do atypical antipsychotic drugs have in treatment-resistant depression? [^1157HQkk]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Despite significant advances in the treatment of depression, many patients fail to respond to treatment with adequate dose and duration. Multiple therapeutic approaches are available for the treatment of patients not responding to standard antidepressant medication. These include switching medication or combination and augmentation strategies. A substantial number of patients do not respond to multiple treatment trials. These patients suffer from treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and represent a challenge to the treating physician. There have been a growing number of reports on the use of atypical antipsychotics as augmenting agents in nonpsychotic TRD. Second-generation antipsychotics are less likely to provoke parkinsonian side effects. It has also been reported that these agents produce lower rates of tardive movement disorders than traditional neuroleptics. Furthermore, second-generation antipsychotics are serotonin-2A/2C antagonists, possibly allowing them to improve the efficacy and some aspects of the side effect profile of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Weight gain and sedation are likely to be the most common adverse events of such combined therapy. In a recent controlled clinical trial, the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine was combined with fluoxetine therapy in an 8-week, double-blind clinical trial in patients with TRD. This combination drug therapy demonstrated clinical efficacy on several rating scales and showed rapid onset of action. Although more studies will be required to confirm and extend these findings, the results suggest that there may be a clinical benefit to combining atypical antipsychotics with SSRIs in nonpsychotic TRD.

### Finding treatment-resistant depression in real-world data: how a data-driven approach compares with expert-based heuristics [^1122h4YG]. Depression and Anxiety (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Depression is associated with substantial morbidity, heathcare cost, mortality and family burden (Kessler, 2012; Rush et al. 2006b), and affects 5% to 8% of the adult US population annually (Blazer, Kessler, McGonagle, & Swartz, 1994; Cepeda, Stang, & Makadia, 2016; Kessler, Chiu, Demler, Merikangas, & Walters, 2005; Pratt & Brody, 2008).

No single treatment for depression is universally effective and sequential interventions are often needed (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2016; Rush et al. 2006b). About 20% of those receiving treatment do not achieve remission, while 50% have no response at all (Trivedi et al. 2006). Relapse rates increase with increases in the number of treatments required (Rush et al. 2006a). When a patient does not respond to multiple therapeutic courses of antidepressant medications, the patient is classified as having treatment‐resistant depression (TRD).

### Magnitude of the placebo response across treatment modalities used for treatment-resistant depression in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112nh9Rv]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Data were extracted by 3 of us (L.B.R. J.K. L.S.M.) and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Data were confirmed by 1 of us (B.D.M.J.). Variables extracted included demographic characteristics, methodologic data, clinical/outcome data, and placebo-specific data. The demographic characteristics were age and sex. Methodological data included treatment strategy (augmentation vs monotherapy), multicenter setting, length of the trial (calculated as number of days for double-blind treatment), number of treatment arms, year of publication, trial design (ie, whether the trial used open-label prospective treatment to determine treatment resistance before double-blind randomization), and whether the trial was industry sponsored (defined as being sponsored by a pharmaceutical company or a medical device manufacturer). Randomized clinical trials funded by the US Department of Veterans Affairs; government agencies, such as the Canadian Institutes of Health Research or National Institute of Mental Health; nonprofit foundations, such as National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia & Depression, or Brain & Behavior Research Foundation; or hospitals or universities were not considered to be industry sponsored. Clinical/outcome data comprised treatment modality, sample size, mean (SD) scores of depression rating scales at baseline and end point in both the placebo and active groups, number of responders/remitters (as defined by the individual studies), number of failed antidepressant trials, past depressive episodes, and length of the current episode. Placebo-specific data included route (eg, oral vs parenteral) of administration and number of days receiving placebo. This variable was calculated by determining how many days during the trial period participants would receive placebo or sham intervention.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for treatment-resistant depression in older patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115FXB99]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Overall treatment efficacy

We first investigated the likelihood of achieving remission across all the studies. In our pooled meta-analysis of the proportion of participants in active intervention groups achieving remission, we included 17 active interventions, as four studies compared active treatments. We were unable to include one study that did not report remission rates. Over study periods of 1–12 weeks, the overall odds of remission was 0.35 (n = 17; 95% CI = 0.26; 0.45). There was considerable heterogeneity between groups (I 2 = 79.7% (95% CI = 66.6%; 88.0%)).

We then compared the odds of achieving remission in active intervention relative to placebo arms. We could not include the four studies that did not have a placebo-control arm, nor one placebo-controlled trial as required data were unavailable. In our random effects model, the overall OR of 2.42 (n = 9; 95% CI = 1.49; 3.92) favoured the intervention arms. The funnel plot displayed reasonable symmetry, indicating that there was no significant publication bias and we did not find evidence of heterogeneity (I 2 statistic = 28.6%).

Only two interventions were studied in more than one RCT: ketamine and interventions involving transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Subgroup analysis findings are discussed below.

### Pharmacotherapy for treatment-resistant depression: antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics [^112PJVkg]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) affects one in three patients with major depressive disorder and is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. Studies of real-world practices suggest that antidepressant monotherapy continues to be the most widely used treatment after inadequate response to a first-line treatment. However, rates of remission with antidepressants in TRD are suboptimal. Atypical antipsychotics are the most widely studied augmentation agent and aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, quetiapine extended-release, and olanzapine-fluoxetine combination are approved for depression. Benefits of using atypical antipsychotics for TRD has to be weighted against their potential adverse events, such as weight gain, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia.

### Synthesizing the evidence for ketamine and esketamine in treatment-resistant depression: an international expert opinion on the available evidence and implementation [^114eeZaR]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Replicated international studies have underscored the human and societal costs associated with major depressive disorder. Despite the proven efficacy of monoamine-based antidepressants in major depression, the majority of treated individuals fail to achieve full syndromal and functional recovery with the index and subsequent pharmacological treatments. Ketamine and esketamine represent pharmacologically novel treatment avenues for adults with treatment-resistant depression. In addition to providing hope to affected persons, these agents represent the first non-monoaminergic agents with proven rapid-onset efficacy in major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, concerns remain about the safety and tolerability of ketamine and esketamine in mood disorders. Moreover, there is uncertainty about the appropriate position of these agents in treatment algorithms, their comparative effectiveness, and the appropriate setting, infrastructure, and personnel required for their competent and safe implementation. In this article, an international group of mood disorder experts provides a synthesis of the literature with respect to the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ketamine and esketamine in adults with treatment-resistant depression. The authors also provide guidance for the implementation of these agents in clinical practice, with particular attention to practice parameters at point of care. Areas of consensus and future research vistas are discussed.

### Cost-effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy vs pharmacotherapy / psychotherapy for treatment-resistant depression in the United States [^117MCudZ]. JAMA Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for depression but is infrequently used owing to stigma, uncertainty about indications, adverse effects, and perceived high cost.

Objective

To assess the cost-effectiveness of ECT compared with pharmacotherapy/psychotherapy for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder in the United States.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A decision analytic model integrating data on clinical efficacy, costs, and quality-of-life effects of ECT compared with pharmacotherapy/psychotherapy was used to simulate depression treatment during a 4-year horizon from a US health care sector perspective. Model input data were drawn from multiple meta-analyses, randomized trials, and observational studies of patients with depression. Where possible, data sources were restricted to US-based studies of nonpsychotic major depression. Data were analyzed between June 2017 and January 2018.

Interventions

Six alternative strategies for incorporating ECT into depression treatment (after failure of 0–5 lines of pharmacotherapy/psychotherapy) compared with no ECT.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Remission, response, and nonresponse of depression; quality-adjusted life-years; costs in 2013 US dollars; and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Strategies with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year or less were designated cost-effective.

Results

Based on the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial, we simulated a population with a mean (SD) age of 40.7 (13.2) years, and 62.2% women. Over 4 years, ECT was projected to reduce time with uncontrolled depression from 50% of life-years to 33% to 37% of life-years, with greater improvements when ECT is offered earlier. Mean health care costs were increased by $7300 to $12 000, with greater incremental costs when ECT was offered earlier. In the base case, third-line ECT was cost-effective, with an ICER of $54 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Third-line ECT remained cost-effective in a range of univariate, scenario, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Incorporating all input data uncertainty, we estimate a 74% to 78% likelihood that at least 1 of the ECT strategies is cost-effective and a 56% to 58% likelihood that third-line ECT is the optimal strategy.

Conclusions and Relevance

For US patients with treatment-resistant depression, ECT may be an effective and cost-effective treatment option. Although many factors influence the decision to proceed with ECT, these data suggest that, from a health-economic standpoint, ECT should be considered after failure of 2 or more lines of pharmacotherapy/psychotherapy.

### Clinical research challenges posed by difficult-to-treat depression [^114ApQ3Y]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over one-third of persons with major depressive disorder (MDD) will not achieve sustained symptom remission after several treatment trials (Agency for Healthcare Research and Policy (AHQR)). The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial found that only two-thirds of patients reached remission after four treatment steps. Furthermore, the relapse rate over the year subsequent to remission ranged from 35% to 70%, increasing with the number of acute treatment trials needed to achieve remission (Rush et al.).

These and other findings formed the basis for the heuristic, treatment-resistant depression (TRD), which is typically defined by the number of previously failed acute phase treatment trials, based on lack of short-term improvement in overall depressive symptom severity (Fava; Sackeim; Thase & Rush). Various reports have used thresholds ranging from 1 to 4 or more failed acute phase treatment trials to define various levels of treatment resistance (Agency for Healthcare Research and Policy (AHQR); Conway, George, & Sackeim; Lisanby et al.). While the FDA recognizes the utility of TRD in its approval and labeling of interventions, the heuristic poses a myriad of clinical and research challenges (McAllister-Williams et al; Rush, Aaronson, & Demyttenaere).

### Treatment resistance in psychiatry: state of the art and new directions [^1123Sgxd]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

We were unable to identify operationalised definitions of treatment resistance for mania, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance dependence. This is surprising given the evidence that nonresponse to standard therapies is a common clinical challenge in the treatment of these disorders, and represents a key outstanding issue for the field. It is not clear why this is the case but may reflect the fact that drug treatments for some of these disorders are less well established than for conditions like schizophrenia and major depression. Another consideration for definitions is whether functional impact is needed in addition to on-going symptoms. Only one criterion required a quantitative assessment of functioning to define treatment response.

Finally, a core component of the concept of treatment resistance is that the patient has taken the prescribed medication. Despite this, Table 1 shows that assessment of medication adherence is rarely included as a criterion for treatment resistance, and only one guideline recommended checking plasma drug levels to assess adherence. Thus, there is a risk that non-adherent patients may be considered as treatment resistant, which has implications for clinical trials of drugs for treatment resistance. Over a third of patients with schizophrenia identified as 'treatment resistant' show evidence of poor adherence, and poor adherence is reported in 10–60% of patients with depression; this could mean that a large proportion of patients entering a trial are non-adherent rather than treatment resistant, potentially obscuring an effect or biasing results. Non-adherence is one contributor to pseudo-resistance, which is considered in the next section. Table 1 also shows that, where adherence is mentioned, most of the guidelines use statements such as 'ensure adherence' or 'exclude poor adherence' without making clear what constitutes adherence or poor adherence.

Overall, our review of the criteria shows considerable variability and lack of specificity in definitions of treatment resistance across psychiatric disorders, which has both clinical and research implications. The lack of clear definitions and, thus, risk of marked differences in patient characteristics between studies could be addressed by the use of standardised rating scales with established psychometric properties coupled with operationalising criteria to provide clear cut-offs. Heterogeneity could be reduced by harmonising criteria across guidelines within a disorder. Difficulties in knowing if studies recruited similar patients could be addressed by using a reporting checklist for treatment resistance that make clear, how each of the three components of treatment resistance was established in patients, an example of which is provided in Box 1.

### Accelerated theta-burst stimulation for treatment-resistant depression: a randomized clinical trial [^111UFK1J]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

The study TTT was published by Matheus Rassi F Ramos and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA Psychiatry. This study is related to the following diseases: Major depressive disorder. In the TTT study, the trial question was: what is the effect of accelerated theta-burst stimulation in patients with treatment-resistant depression? In the TTT study, the study design was: single center, double blinded, RCT. In the TTT study, the population was: 100 patients (84 female, 16 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients, aged 18–65 years, with treatment-resistant depression. The key exclusion criteria were other psychiatric disorders; neurological condition; personality disorder; contraindications to theta-burst stimulation; pregnancy. In the TTT study, the interventions were: n = 50 active accelerated theta-burst stimulation (3 sessions of 1,200 pulses each 30 minutes apart per day, total of 45 sessions, targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) n = 50 sham accelerated theta-burst stimulation (same setup as active group but without active stimulation). In the TTT study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in mean reduction in 17-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score at 5 weeks (9.68 points vs. 5.57 points; MD 4.11, 95% CI 1.67 to 6.55). In the TTT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score (13.34 points vs. 8.04 points;) Significant increase in response rate (52% vs. 22%; OR 4.11, 95% CI 1.66 to 10.13) Significant increase in remission rate (34% vs. 16%; OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.03 to 7.24). In the TTT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. significant differences in scalp pain at week 1 (17.4% vs. 4.4%), increased distractibility at week 3 (17.8% vs. 4.6%). In the TTT study, the conclusion was: in adult patients, aged 18–65 years, with treatment-resistant depression, active accelerated theta-burst stimulation was superior to sham accelerated theta-burst stimulation with respect to mean reduction in 17-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score at 5 weeks.

### New approaches to managing difficult-to-treat depressions [^111AWheU]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

In a sense, all depression is difficult to treat. Most depressions are episodic conditions that, not infrequently, are slow to fully remit. Most also are complicated by comorbid psychiatric and general medical disorders. However, a minority of such difficult-to-treat depressions are treatment resistant. The most common cause of initial treatment failure is not resistance but undertreatment-that is, an insufficient duration of treatment, a subtherapeutic dosage of antidepressant, and/or poor adherence to the prescribed regimen. Complicating factors such as undiagnosed hypothyroidism or substance abuse can result in apparent treatment resistance unless addressed. Challenging subtypes of illness, including psychotic and bipolar subtypes of depression, are not necessarily inherently refractory but must be met with modified treatment approaches.

### Defining treatment-resistant bipolar depression: recommendations from the ISBD task force [^1125Jtv4]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Although there are approved and guideline‐recommended medications for bipolar depression, a significant unmet need remains in effectively addressing its treatment. Achieving improvement often necessitates the use of multiple drug classes in combination; yet this approach does not always guarantee clinically meaningful improvement in depressive symptoms.

Indeed, approximately 25% of patients experience treatment‐resistant bipolar depression (TRBD), defined by severe, persistent depressive symptoms unresponsive to standard treatments. TRBD is characterized by significant heterogeneity, influenced by factors such as genetic predisposition, bipolar subtype distinctions, rapid cycling course, cognitive impairments, and increased suicide risk. Comorbid psychiatric and physical conditions, including anxiety, substance use disorders, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease, further compound this complexity, resulting in diverse depressive phenotypes and challenges in achieving uniform therapeutic responses. Some authors have argued that clinical formulation is a pragmatic way to individualize treatment in such circumstances.

Similar to treatment‐resistant Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), no universal and validated definition of TRBD exists. This absence complicates prevalence estimates and hinders the development of precise treatment strategies.

A consensus definition of TRBD is essential for several reasons. It would provide a basis for reliable diagnosis, enable interpretable research results, and ensure uniformity in clinical trials and regulatory submissions. Such standardization could also improve estimates for research and development (R&D), facilitate clinical decision‐making, and inform reimbursement policies. Furthermore, defining TRBD with clinical and predictive validity could support the development of innovative therapeutic interventions tailored to individual patient profiles.

Recognizing these challenges, the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) Task Force on TRBD was established. The Task Force aims to refine the definition of TRBD, identify mechanisms underlying treatment resistance, develop evidence‐based guidelines for clinicians, researchers, regulators, and the industry, and promote research into novel therapeutic approaches. This report focuses on establishing a clear definition of TRBD and providing initial evidence‐based management recommendations. While the Task Force's mandate includes broader aims (e.g. identifying biological mechanisms and promoting novel therapies), the present manuscript addresses the definition and clinical consensus recommendations as a foundational first step. This consensus document represents a foundational step in achieving these objectives and aims to provide a clear and actionable definition of TRBD for clinical trials while recognizing the ongoing need to address the intricate realities of TRBD in everyday clinical settings.

### Experimental medication treatment approaches for depression [^116DtpAG]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Antidepressant efficacy: a review of current standards and challenges

How effective are antidepressants in treating patients with MDD? Data from STAR*D — the largest comparison trial, to date, of antidepressant effectiveness among agents from different classes — support the use of antidepressants in patients with MDD, as there was a cumulative 67% response rate after all four steps of the study. Furthermore, in an analysis that was independent of the STAR*D data set, Gibbons et al. found an estimated response rate of 58.4% (versus 39.9% for placebo) to antidepressants. Indeed, antidepressants can be helpful to many patients.

However, antidepressant monotherapy alone may not always be enough to treat depression. Towards this end, augmentation strategies with other classes of medications can be a useful option. For example, a meta-analysis of antipsychotic efficacy in 16 trials (n = 3480) found that adjunctive atypical antipsychotics significantly outperformed placebo as treatment strategies for depression response and remission (though their use is associated with an increased risk of discontinuation due to adverse events). Quetiapine and aripiprazole are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as adjunctive therapies for the treatment of depression, while olanzapine/fluoxetine combination therapy is approved for patients with treatment-resistant depression (as per the FDA definition ⩾2 failed treatments). Furthermore, ziprasidone was recently found to significantly outperform placebo in patients with depression (n = 139) with regard to reductions in depression scores (as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; HDRS). Similarly, 8-week adjunctive use of the atypical antipsychotic cariprazine 2–4.5 mg per day (n = 276) was effective for treating depression in patients with refractory disease compared with cariprazine 1–2 mg per day (n = 274) or placebo (n = 269). Drug tolerability was favorable, adding to its potential promise for treatment-resistant depression.

### Current treatments used in clinical practice for major depressive disorder and treatment resistant depression in england: a retrospective database study [^114QDM8n]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic recurrent or episodic psychiatric illness that can be successfully treated with oral antidepressants, yet one-in-three patients do not respond to currently-available treatments. According to the FDA and EMA, patients are considered to have treatment-resistant depression (TRD) when their MDD fails to respond adequately to ≥ 2 successive antidepressants in a single episode.

Aims

To describe current clinical management of patients with MDD and TRD in England, including treatment strategies and referral to secondary mental healthcare.

Method

A retrospective cohort study of adult patients identified in primary care with diagnosed MDD, including a TRD subgroup (≥ 2 treatment failures as determined by treatment dynamics) was conducted using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD primary care database linked to Hospital Episode Statistics and Mental Health Services Data Set data (Protocol 19_019R).

Results

41,375 patients with MDD (mean age 44yrs, 62% female, median follow-up 29mths); and 1,051 (3%) patients with TRD were identified. Mean time-to-TRD was 18 months. Most patients (> 99%) received first-line antidepressant monotherapy. Following TRD criteria being met, antidepressant monotherapy use remained most frequent from TRD first-line (70%) to fifth-line (48%). Dual/triple antidepressant use remained constant (range:24%-26%), while augmented antidepressant use increased from TRD first-line (7%) to third-line (17%). Minimal non-pharmacological therapies were observed.

Conclusions

Despite current clinical guidelines recommending a stepwise approach, many patients frequently cycle through numerous antidepressants with similar mechanisms of action and efficacy. These findings indicate a high unmet need for new treatments that improve outcomes in these patient populations.

### Evaluating atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of refractory depression [^115ARm4F]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Treatment resistance is a common clinical occurrence among patients treated for major depressive disorder. Clinicians have several options when treating resistant depression, including switching antidepressants within the same class, switching outside the class, and augmenting with various agents, including atypical antipsychotics. Atypical antipsychotics have shown efficacy as adjuncts to antidepressants in the treatment of resistant depression, although long-term efficacy is undetermined. Atypical antipsychotics need to be compared for efficacy against specific target symptoms, as well as for differences in safety and tolerability.

### Treatment… [^115qyw3L]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Treatment Treatment options for depression include psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy. Evidence regarding psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy has recently been enhanced by results from the STARD study, a seven-year randomized controlled trial that evaluated medication switching and augmentation in 3, 671 outpatients with unipolar depression. 11 Citalopram was the initial treatment. Three additional levels of treatment were included, based on response. Each treatment level was sustained for at least 12 weeks before response was determined. 3, 12 However, evidence regarding the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic techniques in patients with treatment-resistant depression is limited.

One systematic review found no adequate-quality RCTs that assessed the effectiveness of psychotherapy on treatment-refractory depression. 13 The STARD trial found that patients who received CBT after failing to respond to citalopram had similar rates of response and remission as those who received other medication regimens. 13 The STARD trial significantly expanded the evidence base for pharmacotherapy of treatment-resistant unipolar major depression. Medications included in the trial are presented in Table 3*. 11, 14, 16–20 Remission rates after the first level of treatment were 37 percent; after the second level, 31 percent; after the third level, 14 percent; and after the fourth level, 13 percent.

ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY Electroconvulsive therapy is used primarily for treatment-resistant depression, although it may be used in high-risk cases of severe or psychotic depression, or when pharmacotherapy is contraindicated or not tolerated. Multiple reviews have found it to be more effective than placebo, simulated electroconvulsive therapy, or antidepressants, although the long-term effectiveness is unclear. Other treatments for which there is no or limited evidence of effectiveness for treatment-resistant depression include light therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy, deep brain stimulation, St. Johns wort, and acupuncture. 2.

### Treatment-resistant depression-resistant to placebos as well? [^112NgcNa]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

The article by Jones et al1 applies meta-analysis to examine placebo responses across different treatment modalities in clinical trials conducted in patients with treatment-resistant depression. While high rates of placebo responses are a well-established challenge in studying depression treatments, it has generally been assumed that placebo response rates should be lower in TRD studies. The authors examined 50 studies including 3228 participants, and the resulting effect size for placebo would be considered large, albeit smaller than that typically observed in major depressive disorder trials in individuals without TRD. The pooled response rate for placebo/sham treatment across all treatment modalities in TRD was 23. 5%, and the remission rate was
15. 5%, substantially lower than the average response rate to placebo in MDD trials.

The meta-analysis also considered study characteristics associated with differential placebo effect sizes. Some of these were to be expected, such as lower number of prior treatments indicating less treatment resistance; the varying definitions of TRD contribute substantially to heterogeneity across studies. 2 Others may be more surprising, including industry sponsorship and inclusion of an open-label prospective treatment phase. Over the past 2 decades, pharmaceutical companies have invested tremendous effort in minimizing the placebo response rate in clinical trials, including adopting novel or more complex study designs.

3 Colloca and Barsky4 suggested other strategies to minimize unwanted placebo responses in the context of clinical trials, such as including measurements of patients' expectations of individual improvements, measurements of patients' beliefs about the efficacy of an active treatment, and adoption of standardized language for benefit/risk profile of the treatment, duration of the visits, and checklists for assessing adverse effects. Novel interventions may be administered along with a complex set of psychosocial stimuli which tell the patient that a clinical improvement should be occurring shortly. "5 Complex or invasive procedures in TRD interventions might contribute to increase the placebo response.

While this meta-analysis showed that placebo responses are similar across treatment modalities in TRD, this is not the case for other disorders; for example, a meta-analysis in migraine prophylaxis pointed out that sham acupuncture and sham surgery resulted in higher placebo responses than oral placebos. 6 The fact that placebo response ratios vary across disorders and treatments outlines the need for more mechanistic research to be translated into clinical trial methodology and development.
