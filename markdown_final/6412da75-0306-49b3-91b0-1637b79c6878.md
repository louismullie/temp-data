first line treatment fi fubromyalgia

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about first-line treatment for fibromyalgia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching care philosophy and whether nonpharmacologic care is truly foundational. Then, I should verify which nonpharmacologic interventions have the strongest evidence and how to implement them. Next, I will check when to add medications, which agents to choose based on symptom clusters, dosing, and stopping rules. After that, I need to review what to avoid up front, confirm any nuances like cyclobenzaprine, and consider sleep-focused strategies. Finally, I will synthesize this into a practical first-line algorithm and ensure the recommendations align with major guidelines and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle so I don't jump to conclusions: fibromyalgia management should be multimodal, with nonpharmacologic strategies as the core and medications as adjuncts, delivered through shared decision-making and tailored to predominant symptoms and patient preferences, which EULAR and Canadian guidelines emphasize and high-quality evidence summaries support [^112NPA7J] [^1113VaDS].

> I need to verify which nonpharmacologic intervention deserves top billing; exercise reliably shows the broadest, most durable benefits across pain, function, mood, sleep, and fatigue, so I should recommend a paced, graduated program that the patient will actually do (aerobic, strengthening, and mind-body options like tai chi or yoga), starting low and progressing slowly to enhance adherence and minimize flares, given consistent benefits in guidelines and recent meta-analyses [^111mo8hb] [^115CdrK7] [^115iY79t].

> Hold on, I should also review psychological therapies rather than assume exercise alone is enough; cognitive behavioral therapy improves pain and function in the short term and can address catastrophizing, fear-avoidance, and mood comorbidities, and even brief courses can help, so offering CBT early alongside exercise is reasonable based on EULAR, Canadian guidance, and Cochrane data [^111Lw2Wh] [^111dgTXp] [^1154RY38].

> Next, I will examine patient education and self-management because they anchor the care trajectory; explaining fibromyalgia as a positive clinical diagnosis, setting specific functional goals, encouraging ongoing work participation, and avoiding unnecessary repeat testing after diagnosis improve outcomes and locus of control per Canadian guidance and allied consensus statements, so I need to ensure these steps happen at the first visit and are reinforced at follow-up [^113RTssR] [^114g5GC6] [^115UB6Jo].

> Now, I need to check when to introduce pharmacotherapy and how to trial it; medications should be added only if symptoms remain function-limiting after optimizing nonpharmacologic measures, with a "start low, go slow" titration and explicit stopping rules if there is no meaningful benefit by about 4–6 weeks, consistent with AAFP guidance and Cochrane overviews emphasizing modest average benefits and the importance of limiting exposure to ineffective drugs [^1117j6zr] [^117NePTq].

> For pain with prominent mood disturbance or fatigue, I should consider SNRIs; let me verify this choice and dosing: duloxetine or milnacipran are FDA-approved for fibromyalgia, typically starting duloxetine 30 mg daily and increasing to 60 mg as tolerated, or using standard milnacipran dosing per labeling, with expected benefits in a subset over 4–12 weeks, acknowledging that only about one in ten achieves substantial pain relief in trials [^1117j6zr] [^116V6Nzc].

> For pain with prominent sleep disturbance, I should double-check the role of pregabalin; it is FDA-approved, often started at 75 mg nightly with gradual titration (commonly toward 300–450 mg/day) balancing analgesia and somnolence, and may be preferred when sleep disruption is a leading complaint, though I must counsel on dizziness and sedation risks and assess benefit within 4–6 weeks [^117NePTq] [^116EkB7i].

> Let me consider low-dose amitriptyline as an alternative when sleep is a dominant issue; doses of 10–25 mg at bedtime can help pain and sleep in some patients, but I should confirm evidence quality and bias concerns, recognizing EULAR's conditional recommendation and Cochrane's caution about publication bias and variable effect sizes, which justifies careful trialing with early reassessment and deprescribing if ineffective [^115X2LXu] [^116V6Nzc].

> Wait, I initially thought to avoid all muscle relaxants, including cyclobenzaprine, up front due to side effects, but I should verify nuance here; EULAR does suggest offering cyclobenzaprine, so a short, low-dose, nighttime trial can be reasonable for selected patients with severe sleep disturbance and muscle tension, provided we monitor for anticholinergic effects and daytime sedation and discontinue if benefits are not evident within a few weeks [^113jvdwi].

> I need to ensure we are clear about what not to use first-line; NSAIDs target peripheral inflammation and generally do not help centralized pain, strong opioids should be avoided, weak opioids like tramadol reserved only for refractory cases, and agents such as antipsychotics and cannabinoids have limited or inconsistent evidence in rigorous reviews, although I should note emerging guidance that cannabinoids may be considered adjunctively for patients failing standard options, which warrants cautious, shared decision-making and attention to local regulations and adverse effects [^112RwQdp] [^11261TiD] [^116V6Nzc] [^114XzM1b].

> But wait, what about combination pharmacotherapy if monotherapy is only partially effective; let me double-check the data before recommending it routinely, because high-quality overviews find limited evidence for combinations, yet a small crossover RCT of duloxetine plus pregabalin showed additional pain and function benefits versus monotherapy at the cost of more adverse effects, so I would reserve combinations for patients who have had thoughtful monotherapy trials and accept the trade-offs [^1147DvH1] [^112ixjFs].

> I will now examine sleep-specific management because poor sleep amplifies pain and fatigue; beyond medication choices that aid sleep, I should confirm that exercise modalities improve sleep quality and consider targeted behavioral sleep interventions such as CBT-I when accessible, as recent network meta-analyses support exercise-based improvements and suggest behavioral therapies can help sleep outcomes, even though certainty varies and heterogeneity is high [^115iY79t] [^1135s7ds].

> Next, I should review how to operationalize follow-up and define response; reassess at 6–8 weeks to evaluate adherence, barriers, and progress toward individualized functional goals, using a meaningful improvement threshold such as about 30% reduction in pain or improvement on validated global/functional measures, which aligns with responder definitions used in high-quality analgesic evidence syntheses and with guideline emphasis on shared, patient-centered outcomes [^116V6Nzc] [^112NPA7J].

> Let me synthesize the first-line algorithm to ensure internal consistency: start with education that establishes a positive diagnosis, initiate a paced aerobic and strengthening program with a mind-body option the patient prefers, offer CBT in parallel, optimize sleep hygiene, set concrete functional and work-participation goals, and only then layer in one medication tailored to the leading symptom cluster with explicit 4–6 week stopping rules, escalating or combining therapies only after careful monotherapy trials and continuous optimization of nonpharmacologic care, which reflects the convergent guidance of EULAR, Canadian recommendations, and high-quality evidence summaries [^111JTbbj] [^111mo8hb] [^11686q9h].

The first-line treatment for fibromyalgia is **nonpharmacologic therapy** [^111Lw2Wh] — specifically, **aerobic or mind-body exercise** and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) [^111Lw2Wh] — because they improve pain, function, and quality of life with low risk [^111mo8hb] [^11686q9h]. Pharmacologic options (**duloxetine, milnacipran, pregabalin**) [^1117j6zr] [^116EkB7i] are reserved for patients with severe symptoms or inadequate response to nonpharmacologic care, and should be trialed for 4–6 weeks with stopping rules if ineffective [^117NePTq] [^116V6Nzc]. Strong opioids are not recommended [^112RwQdp], and treatment should be individualized with shared decision-making and regular reassessment [^112NPA7J] [^111JTbbj].

---

## Nonpharmacologic interventions (first-line therapy)

Nonpharmacologic interventions are recommended as **first-line therapy** [^111Lw2Wh] because they are effective, safe, and patient-centered [^115CdrK7].

---

### Exercise therapy

- **Aerobic exercise**: Regular aerobic exercise (e.g. walking, cycling, swimming) significantly [^115CdrK7] improves pain, fatigue, sleep, and quality of life [^111mo8hb] [^112VM8yn].

- **Mind-body exercise**: Yoga, tai chi, and qigong [^113PTUdL] improve pain, function, and psychological well-being [^112VM8yn].

- **Aquatic exercise**: Particularly beneficial for patients with joint pain or mobility limitations [^1135s7ds] [^112VM8yn].

---

### Psychological interventions

Cognitive behavioral therapy (**CBT**) [^1154RY38] reduces pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and psychological distress [^111Lw2Wh] [^111dgTXp], and **mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)** [^113PTUdL] improves psychological well-being and reduces stress.

---

### Patient education and self-management

Patient education and self-management are integral to treatment [^1113VaDS] and improve **adherence and outcomes** [^112MfhoB].

---

## Pharmacologic interventions (adjunctive therapy)

Pharmacologic treatments are used as **adjunctive therapy** for patients with severe symptoms or an inadequate response to nonpharmacologic interventions [^111JTbbj].

---

### Antidepressants

Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (**SNRIs**) (duloxetine and milnacipran) [^1117j6zr] are recommended for pain, fatigue, and mood symptoms [^111C1oe9] [^116QAfQb], and low-dose **tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)** such as amitriptyline are effective for pain and sleep disturbances [^115X2LXu] [^112BqytG].

---

### Anticonvulsants

Pregabalin is recommended for pain, sleep disturbances, and anxiety symptoms [^116EkB7i] [^116Qxs9m], and **gabapentin** may be considered for pain and sleep disturbances, though evidence is less robust than for **pregabalin** [^116V6Nzc].

---

### Other pharmacologic options

Other pharmacologic options include **cyclobenzaprine** [^113jvdwi] for muscle relaxation and sleep improvement and **cannabinoid-based medicines** as adjunctive treatment for patients not responding to standard analgesics [^114XzM1b].

---

## Multidisciplinary and individualized approach

A multidisciplinary approach that combines nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments is **recommended** [^112NPA7J]. Treatment should be **individualized** based on symptom severity, patient preferences, and comorbidities [^111JTbbj].

---

## Summary of first-line treatment recommendations

### EULAR revised recommendations for the management of fibromyalgia [^112NPA7J]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of fibromyalgia, specifically concerning general principles, the EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend aiming to improve health-related quality of life (QoL). This involves balancing the benefits and risks of treatment, often necessitating a multidisciplinary approach combining nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatment modalities. Treatment should be tailored according to pain intensity, function, associated features such as depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and patient preferences and comorbidities. This should be done through shared decision-making with the patient.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological therapies for fibromyalgia syndrome in adults: An overview of Cochrane reviews [^117NePTq]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin have good evidence of efficacy in a small proportion of patients and might be recommended for use in primary care for a trial period of 4–6 weeks. Treatment should cease if substantial pain relief is not experienced by six weeks. Because relatively few trial participants achieved substantial pain relief with duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin, it is important to establish stopping rules so that when someone does not respond within a specified time, they can be switched to a suitable alternative treatment. This would reduce the number of individuals exposed to adverse events from medications in the absence of benefit. Evidence from this overview does not support guidelines recommending amitriptyline at doses below 50 mg daily, cyclobenzaprine, and tramadol.

The combination of this overview of pharmacological interventions, together with a previous overview examining non-pharmacological interventions, included data from 31 Cochrane reviews, representing 268 clinical trials and the involvement of over 29,000 patients with FMS. It is disappointing that 27 of those reviews had no, or inadequate, information that might help guide therapy.

### Milnacipran for pain in fibromyalgia in adults [^116qp2AW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 2012. That review considered both fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain, but the efficacy of milnacipran for neuropathic pain is now dealt with in a separate review. Milnacipran is a serotonin-norepinephrine (noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that is licensed for the treatment of fibromyalgia in some countries, including Canada, Russia, and the United States.

- **Objectives**: To assess the analgesic efficacy of milnacipran for pain in fibromyalgia in adults and the adverse events associated with its use in clinical trials.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE up to May 18, 2015, together with reference lists of retrieved papers and reviews, and two clinical trial registries. For the earlier review, we also contacted the manufacturer.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, double-blind studies of eight weeks' duration or longer, comparing milnacipran with placebo or another active treatment in fibromyalgia in adults.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and two review authors examined issues of study quality independently.

- **Main results**: We identified one new study with 100 participants for the pooled analysis. We also identified two additional reports of a study using an enriched enrolment randomized withdrawal (EERW) design that included participants from earlier randomized controlled trials and an open-label study.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115iY79t]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Fifty-two studies (n = 7,127 participants, 35 interventions) of the 56 studies that reported the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) were included in the network meta-analysis (NMA); four studies were excluded as they did not form part of the main network. Results are detailed in the supplementary material. Improvements in FIQ were observed for several interventions compared with placebo or sham. These include:

- **Land-based aerobic exercise combined with mixed flexibility exercise training (n = 32)**: Mean Difference (MD) −19.91, 95% Credible Interval (CrI) −34.89 to −4.94
- **Multidisciplinary training (n = 81)**: MD −17.31, 95% CrI −28.38 to −6.29
- **Land-based mind-body exercise training (n = 420)**: MD −16.18, 95% CrI −22.72 to −9.73
- **Generic psychological or behavioral therapy (PT/BT generic) with relaxation (n = 29)**: MD −12.07, 95% CrI −20.75 to −3.35
- **PT/BT sleep (n = 77)**: MD −11.68, 95% CrI −20.34 to −3.11
- **Generic PT/BT (n = 145)**: MD −6.23, 95% CrI −12.02 to −0.62

Positive effects were also observed for participants receiving antioxidants (n = 12; MD −17.75, 95% CrI −34.91 to −0.61), iron replacement (n = 38; MD −15.10, 95% CrI −30.41 to −0.06), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI) (n = 573; MD −9.85, 95% CrI −15.80 to −3.80), and central nervous system (CNS) depressants (n = 881; MD −8.83, 95% CrI −14.77 to −2.74). In general, the magnitude of effects varied across interventions. A large positive effect was observed after hyperbaric oxygen therapy (n = 9; MD −26.29, 95% CrI −37.56 to −15.15); however, the reliability of this estimate is questioned due to the very small sample size (nine patients in the intervention group) and lack of a proper comparator intervention.

### Management of fibromyalgia in primary care [^111JuMw1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Most treatments for patients with fibromyalgia can be provided in primary care practices. When clinicians, therapists, and community resources work together, a range of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments can be tailored to provide effective long-term care. Treatments found to be effective for various fibromyalgia symptoms, such as pain and problems with sleep or mood, include antidepressants and anticonvulsants. Additionally, other effective strategies include patient education, light exercise, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological therapies for fibromyalgia syndrome in adults: an overview of Cochrane reviews [^114bVT1m]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Of 21 Cochrane Reviews of pharmacological treatments for fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), seven found no trials, seven found some trials but with insufficient data to form any conclusion, and two had potential publication bias, making them unreliable. Only five reviews contained trustworthy evidence of some or no effect. Effect sizes for the primary outcome of at least 50% pain intensity reduction were modest, with risk difference values of 0.09–0.14 and numbers needed to treat (NNTs) of 6.9–14 compared with placebo. Duloxetine, pregabalin, and milnacipran were capable of producing substantial pain relief lasting for at least 12 weeks in about 1 in 10 people with moderate or severe pain associated with FMS. While adverse events were common, serious adverse events were rare. Enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal (EERW) trials of pregabalin suggested that initial benefit (4–6 weeks) is likely to be maintained for six months, with no evidence that early failure was followed by later success. By contrast, more participants switched to ongoing placebo lost a therapeutic response compared to those receiving ongoing pregabalin.

The FDA licensed duloxetine (2008), milnacipran (2009), and pregabalin (2007) for the treatment of FMS in the United States. However, the European Union has not licensed these medications. A 2018 written answer to a question in the European Parliament explained that: "After careful examination, the European Medicines Agency [EMA] was of the opinion that the benefits of these medicines in the treatment of fibromyalgia did not outweigh the risks and therefore recommended that the marketing authorization be refused in this indication". This applies also in the United Kingdom.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological therapies for fibromyalgia syndrome in adults: An overview of Cochrane reviews [^1168MgEM]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

A potential weakness was that some overview authors were also authors of some reviews, but data extraction and assessment were performed by uninvolved overview authors, and all authors were able to comment at all stages. The overview is in broad agreement with a previous Cochrane overview examining antiepileptic drugs for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia; other overviews found no other useful data.

A strength of this overview is that participant demographics reflected those of people with FMS, predominantly women in their fifth and sixth decades of life, but with a preponderance of white people. A recognized set of diagnostic criteria was commonly used, though trials often excluded people with depression and/or anxiety or with more serious mental disorders. All studies excluded people with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. FMS is common in people with these diseases; thus, this represents a major weakness of the pharmacological studies, as their populations were not representative of patients in routine clinical care.

Most of the reviews examined pain as a primary outcome. Pain is a presenting symptom, but it is well recognized that there are many other problematic concomitant symptoms, including fatigue, depression, and sleep disturbance. The symptom burden often precludes work and leads to a substantial reduction in quality of life. Only average changes in these symptoms were reported, and averages showed no substantial benefit for these other key symptoms of FMS, where measures were assessed. Analysis at the individual patient level could provide a more relevant analysis.

### Pharmacotherapy for patients with fibromyalgia [^115cwT4n]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common and disabling syndrome. Despite research detailing the efficacy of a variety of medicinal treatments, most notably tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and alpha(2)delta ligands, there is still widespread routine use of agents that are mostly ineffective in treating the central nature of fibromyalgic pain. This article discusses pharmacotherapeutic options for fibromyalgia, including those with high-level evidence for efficacy, moderate-level evidence, and little or no evidence for efficacy. The importance of an integrated treatment approach is emphasized, which includes pharmacotherapy and at least one, but preferably more, of the most effective nonmedicinal treatment options available, such as education, aerobic exercise, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological therapies for fibromyalgia syndrome in adults: an overview of Cochrane reviews [^116V6Nzc]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to summarize and evaluate Cochrane reviews of pharmacological therapies for adults with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) pain.

- **Methods**: A systematic search of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was conducted up to May 2024. The generic quality assessment used AMSTAR-2 criteria, with validity checks of potentially critical factors in the evaluation of analgesic efficacy and an assessment of the susceptibility of results to publication bias. Pain outcomes were participant-reported pain relief of ≥ 30% or ≥ 50%, or Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) assessed as much or very much improved.

- **Results**: Twenty-one reviews (87 trials, 17,631 patients) were included. All were rated as moderate (15 reviews) or high-quality (6 reviews) using AMSTAR-2, and at least seven of the eight critical pain criteria were met by 13 of the 21 reviews. Diagnosis of FMS was based on recognized criteria. Seven reviews found no trials for certain drugs (carbamazepine, clonazepam, lamotrigine, phenytoin, oxycodone, topiramate, or valproate), while seven reviews had limited and inadequate data (antipsychotics, cannabinoids, combination therapy, gabapentin, lacosamide, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, NSAIDs). Two reviews were subject to publication bias (amitriptyline, SSRI). Mirtazapine had moderate evidence of no effect. Duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin demonstrated moderate to good evidence of substantial pain relief for 4 to 12 weeks in about 1 in 10 adults with moderate or severe FMS pain, without evidence of efficacy beyond six months. Serious adverse events were no more common than with a placebo. There was no evidence to determine who might benefit or experience adverse events, and no substantial efficacy evidence for other medicines was found.

- **Conclusions**: Duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin showed potential short-term benefits for FMS pain management.

### 2012 Canadian guidelines for the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia syndrome: Executive summary [^111C1oe9]. Pain Research & Management (2013). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for fibromyalgia, more specifically with respect to antidepressants, the NFGAP 2013 guidelines recommend considering offering TCAs, SSRIs, or SNRIs for pain and other symptoms in patients with FM. The choice of antidepressants should depend on available evidence for efficacy, physician knowledge, patient characteristics, and the side effect profile.

### Fibromyalgia: Diagnosis and management for the primary healthcare provider [^1112oT98]. Journal of Women's Health (2008). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by chronic generalized musculoskeletal pain, affecting 2% of the general population, with an increased frequency in women. Clinical diagnosis relies on patient history and research-supported tender point criteria. A multidimensional approach optimizes treatment response, as seen in other chronic pain syndromes.

Empirical data and consensus support the use of nonpharmacological modalities such as education, aerobic exercise, and cognitive behavioral therapy in the management of fibromyalgia. Evidence-supported pharmacological interventions include tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, alpha-2-delta ligands, and other serotonergic-noradrenergic analgesic agents, such as tramadol.

This paper offers the primary healthcare provider a systematic approach to the diagnosis of fibromyalgia and management strategies based on available evidence, consensus, and empirical data.

### Longitudinal observation of treatment patterns and outcomes for patients with fibromyalgia: 12-month findings from the reflections study [^113ovJWL]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

To describe 12-month treatment patterns and outcomes for patients starting a new medication for fibromyalgia in routine clinical practice, data from 1,700 patients were collected at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Repeated measures and Poisson regression models, controlling for demographic, clinical, and baseline outcomes, were used to assess changes in health outcomes, including the Brief Pain Inventory severity and interference, Sheehan Disability Scale, and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire. Additionally, satisfaction and economic factors were assessed for patients who began treatment with pregabalin (214, 12.6%), duloxetine (264, 15.5%), milnacipran (134, 7.9%), or tricyclic antidepressants (66, 3.9%). Sensitivity analyses were run using propensity-matched cohorts.

Patients started on 145 unique drugs for fibromyalgia, with over 75% taking two or more medications concurrently at each assessment point. Overall, patients showed improvement on the four health outcomes, with few differences across medication cohorts. At baseline, patients reported annual averages of 20.3 outpatient care visits, 27.7 missed workdays, and 32.6 days of care by an unpaid caregiver. The duloxetine and milnacipran cohorts, as compared to pregabalin or tricyclic antidepressant groups, had fewer outpatient visits during the 12-month study. Patients reported satisfaction with overall treatment and their fibromyalgia medication (46.0% and 42.8%, respectively).

In this real-world setting, patients with fibromyalgia reported modest improvements, high resource utilization, and satisfactory treatment outcomes over the 12-month period.

### 2012 Canadian guidelines for the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia syndrome: Executive summary [^112RwQdp]. Pain Research & Management (2013). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of fibromyalgia, particularly concerning opioids, the NFGAP 2013 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of strong opioids. Patients continuing opioid treatment should exhibit improved pain management and function. It is crucial to monitor for continued efficacy, side effects, or any evidence of aberrant drug behaviors.

### Efficacy of milnacipran in patients with fibromyalgia [^1136yaTH]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a common musculoskeletal condition characterized by widespread pain, tenderness, and a variety of other somatic symptoms. Treatments are modestly effective. Arguably, the best studied and most effective compounds are tricyclic antidepressants (TCA). Milnacipran, a nontricyclic compound that inhibits the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine, may provide many of the beneficial effects of TCA with a superior side effect profile.

- **Methods**: One hundred twenty-five patients with FM were randomly assigned in a 3:3:2 ratio to receive milnacipran twice daily, milnacipran once daily, or placebo for 3 months in a double-blind dose-escalation trial. 92% of twice-daily and 81% of once-daily participants achieved dose escalation to the target milnacipran dose of 200 mg.

- **Results**: The primary endpoint was reduction of pain. Both the once- and twice-daily groups showed statistically significant improvements in pain, as well as improvements in global well-being, fatigue, and other domains. Response rates for patients receiving milnacipran were equal in patients with and without comorbid depression, but placebo response rates were considerably higher in depressed patients, leading to significantly greater overall efficacy in the nondepressed group.

- **Conclusion**: In this Phase II study, milnacipran led to statistically significant improvements in pain and other symptoms of FM. The effect sizes were equal to those previously found with TCA, and the drug was generally well tolerated.

### Canadian pain society and Canadian rheumatology association recommendations for rational care of persons with fibromyalgia: A summary report [^114f8gKA]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

To summarize the development of evidence-based guidelines for the clinical care of persons with fibromyalgia (FM), we consider advances in understanding the pathogenesis of FM, new diagnostic criteria, and new treatment options.

Recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and patient follow-up were drafted according to the classification system of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Upon review, they were endorsed by the Canadian Rheumatology Association and the Canadian Pain Society.

FM is a polysymptomatic syndrome presenting a spectrum of severity, with body pain as the pivotal symptom. FM is a positive clinical diagnosis, not a diagnosis of exclusion, and does not require specialist confirmation. There are no confirmatory laboratory tests, although some investigations may be indicated to exclude other conditions.

Ideal care occurs in the primary care setting, incorporating non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies in a multimodal approach with active patient participation. The treatment objective should focus on the reduction of symptoms and improved function through a patient-tailored, symptom-based treatment approach. Self-management strategies, combining good lifestyle habits and fostering a strong locus of control, are imperative. Medications afford only modest relief, often in lower doses than suggested, with drug combinations used according to clinical judgment. There is a need for continued reassessment of the risk-benefit ratio for any drug treatment. The outcome should be aimed toward functioning within a normal life.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological therapies for fibromyalgia syndrome in adults: An overview of Cochrane reviews [^115XDN4s]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

To summarize and evaluate Cochrane reviews of pharmacological therapies for adults with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) pain, a systematic search of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was conducted up to May 2024. The generic quality assessment utilized AMSTAR-2 criteria, with validity checks on potentially critical factors in the evaluation of analgesic efficacy and the assessment of susceptibility of results to publication bias. Pain outcomes were based on participant-reported pain relief of ≥ 30% or ≥ 50%, or Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) indicating much or very much improvement.

Twenty-one reviews, encompassing 87 trials with 17,631 patients, were included. All reviews were rated as moderate (15 reviews) or high-quality (6 reviews) using AMSTAR-2. Thirteen reviews met at least seven of eight critical pain criteria, with FMS diagnosis based on recognized criteria.

- **No trials found**: Seven reviews found no trials regarding carbamazepine, clonazepam, lamotrigine, phenytoin, oxycodone, topiramate, or valproate.
- **Limited and inadequate data**: Seven reviews contained limited and inadequate data on antipsychotics, cannabinoids, combination therapy, gabapentin, lacosamide, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and NSAIDs.
- **Subject to publication bias**: Two reviews, amitriptyline and SSRIs, were subject to publication bias.
- **Moderate evidence of no effect**: Mirtazapine showed moderate evidence of no significant effect.
- **Moderate/good evidence of substantial pain relief**: Duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin provided moderate to good evidence of substantial pain relief over a period of 4–12 weeks in approximately 1 in 10 adults with moderate to severe FMS pain. However, there was no evidence of efficacy beyond six months. Serious adverse events were not more common than with placebo. There was no evidence on predicting who might benefit or experience adverse events. There was no substantial efficacy evidence for other medications.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114f5kK2]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

The primary outcomes of interest were sleep quality, defined as the patient's experience of sleep and perceived sleep quality, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included sleep efficiency, calculated as total sleep time divided by total time in bed, multiplied by 100%, duration of sleep and/or total sleep time, and disease-specific quality of life (QoL).

For assessing sleep quality, we utilized an update of a previously published systematic review, identifying five patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) validated for individuals with fibromyalgia. These measures included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS-SS), the Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS), the Fibromyalgia Sleep Diary (FMSD), and the Sleep Quality Numeric Rating Scale (SQ-NRS). Additional proxy measures, such as single-item numerical rating scales (NRS) or visual analog scales (VAS), which broadly measure a similar sleep quality construct as the SQ-NRS, were considered.

In the absence of an accepted fibromyalgia-specific QoL tool, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) were used as proxies for disease-specific measures. Notably, information on the assessment of sleep duration and efficiency, whether self-reported or objectively measured, was inconsistently reported among the included studies. Adverse events recorded were those occurring in ≥ 10% of participants in the included studies and any serious adverse events. Outcomes were collected at the end of the intervention period or at the first assessment point thereafter.

### Update on fibromyalgia therapy [^117XpCts]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Primary fibromyalgia, a poorly understood chronic pain syndrome, is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, nonrestorative sleep, fatigue, psychological distress, and specific regions of localized tenderness, all in the absence of otherwise apparent organic disease. While the etiology of fibromyalgia is unclear, accumulating data suggest that disordered central pain processing likely plays a role in the pathogenesis of symptoms. Although various pharmacological treatments have been studied and espoused for treating fibromyalgia, no single drug or group of drugs has proved to be particularly useful in treating fibromyalgia patients as a whole, and only one drug at the time of writing has earned U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for treating the syndrome in the United States. This review critically and systematically evaluates clinical investigations of medicinal and nonmedicinal treatments for fibromyalgia dating from 1970 to 2007.

### Combination of pregabalin with duloxetine for fibromyalgia: a randomized controlled trial [^112ixjFs]. Pain (2016). High credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a syndrome characterized by chronic widespread pain and associated with sleep disturbance, depression, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction. Polypharmacy is commonly used, but supportive evidence is limited. Most fibromyalgia trials focus primarily on pain reduction with monotherapy. This trial compares a pregabalin-duloxetine combination to each monotherapy. Using a randomized, double-blind, four-period crossover design, participants received maximally tolerated doses of placebo, pregabalin, duloxetine, and the pregabalin-duloxetine combination for six weeks.

The primary outcome was daily pain (0–10); secondary outcomes included global pain relief, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, SF-36 survey, Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), adverse events, and other measures. Of 41 participants randomized, 39 completed at least two treatments. Daily pain scores during placebo, pregabalin, duloxetine, and combination were 5.1, 5.0, 4.1, and 3.7, respectively (P < 0.05 only for combination vs. placebo and pregabalin). Participants (%) reporting moderate or greater global pain relief were 18%, 39%, 42%, and 68%, respectively (P < 0.05 for combination vs. placebo, pregabalin, and duloxetine).

Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire scores were 42.9, 37.4, 36.0, and 29.8, respectively (P < 0.05 for combination vs. placebo, pregabalin, and duloxetine). SF-36 scores were 50.2, 55.7, 56.0, and 61.2, respectively (P < 0.05 for combination vs. placebo, pregabalin, and duloxetine). Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale scores were 48.9, 35.2, 46.1, and 32.1, respectively (P < 0.05 only for combination vs. placebo).

### Fibromyalgia: Diagnosis and management [^117KDjuF]. American Family Physician (2023). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic, centralized pain syndrome characterized by disordered processing of painful stimuli. It is diagnosed more frequently in women and occurs globally, affecting 2% of the population in the United States. Patients with fibromyalgia experience diffuse chronic pain, poor sleep, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and mood disturbances. Comorbid conditions such as functional somatic syndromes, psychiatric diagnoses, and rheumatologic conditions may be present.

The Fibromyalgia Rapid Screening Tool is a helpful method for screening patients with diffuse chronic pain. The American College of Rheumatology criteria or the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations Innovations Opportunities and Networks-American Pain Society Pain Taxonomy diagnostic criteria can be used to diagnose fibromyalgia. Establishing the diagnosis and providing education can reassure patients and decrease unnecessary testing.

A multidisciplinary approach that incorporates nonpharmacologic therapies and medications to address problematic symptoms is most effective. Patient education, exercise, and cognitive behavior therapy can improve pain and function. Medications such as duloxetine, milnacipran, pregabalin, and amitriptyline are potentially effective for fibromyalgia. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids have not demonstrated benefits for fibromyalgia and have significant limitations.

Regarding screening and diagnosis of fibromyalgia, specifically concerning diagnostic criteria, the NFGAP 2013 guidelines recommend establishing the diagnosis of FM as early as possible by a primary care physician. Confirmation by a specialist is not required. It is important to communicate this diagnosis to the patient and avoid repeated investigations after diagnosis unless prompted by new-onset symptoms or signs on physical examination.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1135s7ds]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a complex, heterogeneous condition that affects 2% to 3% of the global population. In the absence of a cure, a range of treatments is offered to alleviate symptoms. Most people with fibromyalgia complain about sleep problems. Fibromyalgia-related sleep problems are poorly managed, and after an initial diagnosis, people continue to seek help to improve their sleep for many years.

- **Significance & innovations**: This systematic review and network meta-analysis provides a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of randomized clinical trials investigating pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for fibromyalgia-related sleep problems. A wide range of interventions, especially nonpharmacologic interventions, have been tested in fibromyalgia trials, with very low-to-moderate certainty regarding effectiveness. Our results indicate that engaging in some forms of exercise — such as land-based aerobic exercise training in combination with flexibility training and aquatic-based aerobic exercise training — may improve sleep quality in people with fibromyalgia. Certain pharmacologic interventions may also be effective in improving sleep but not without side effects.

The 2015 European guidelines for the management of fibromyalgia considered sleep as a key outcome of interest. Although general recommendations were made for interventions to manage sleep, these were graded as "weak" due to a paucity of published evidence at that time. Additionally, sleep was not the primary focus of the guidelines. Previously published evidence reviews informed the National Institute.

### Association of therapies with reduced pain and improved quality of life in patients with fibromyalgia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^11686q9h]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition that results in a significant burden to individuals and society. The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of therapies for reducing pain and improving the quality of life (QOL) in people with fibromyalgia.

Searches were performed in the MEDLINE, Cochrane, Embase, AMED, PsycInfo, and PEDro databases without language or date restrictions on December 11, 2018, and updated on July 15, 2020. All published randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials that investigated therapies for individuals with fibromyalgia were screened for inclusion.

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the 0 to 10 PEDro scale. Effect sizes for specific therapies were pooled using random-effects models. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment (GRADE) approach. The main outcomes and measures included pain intensity measured by the visual analog scale, numerical rating scales, and other valid instruments. Quality of life was measured by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire.

A total of 224 trials including 29,962 participants were included. High-quality evidence was found in favor of cognitive behavioral therapy (weighted mean difference [WMD], -0.9; 95% CI, -1.4 to -0.3) for pain in the short term and was found in favor of central nervous system depressants (WMD, -1.2; 95% CI, -1.6 to -0.8) and antidepressants (WMD, -0.5; 95% CI, -0.7 to -0.4) for pain in the medium term.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^11751wpH]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

- **Sleep duration**: Sleep duration was reported in two studies (n = 363 participants, three interventions). There was insufficient evidence that gabapentinoid (n = 169) increased sleep duration compared with placebo or sham (n = 179; MD 7.40, 95% Crl −9.84 to 24.74), whereas SRI (n = 15) appeared to be detrimental to sleep duration compared with placebo or sham (n = 179; MD −24.40, 95% Crl −59.81 to 21.96).

- **Consistency between direct and indirect evidence**: For sleep quality, there was evidence of inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence for usual care and aquatic-based aerobic exercise compared with land-based mind-body exercise, land-based flexibility exercise compared with usual care, and land-based flexibility exercise compared with aquatic-based aerobic exercise. For FIQ, for some intervention comparisons (generic psychological or behavioral therapy compared with placebo or sham, and sleep-focused psychological or behavioral therapy compared with education or usual care), the node-splitting analysis showed significant disagreement (inconsistency) between direct and indirect estimates. For SF-36 MCS and PCS, there was no need to check for the presence of inconsistency between direct and indirect estimates as the only two closed loops in the network were from a single three-arm trial.

- **Ranking of interventions**: For sleep quality and FIQ, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and land-based aerobic with flexibility exercise training were ranked as the top two interventions.

### Antipsychotics for fibromyalgia in adults [^115Dk71j]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

This review is one of a series on drugs used to treat fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is a clinically well-defined chronic condition of unknown etiology characterized by chronic widespread pain that often co-exists with sleep problems and fatigue. It affects approximately 2% of the general population. Up to 70% of patients with fibromyalgia meet the criteria for a depressive or anxiety disorder. People often report high disability levels and poor health-related quality of life. Drug therapy focuses on reducing key symptoms and disability, and improving health-related quality of life. Antipsychotics might reduce fibromyalgia and associated mental health symptoms.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of antipsychotics in fibromyalgia in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE, and EMBASE up to May 20, 2016, together with reference lists of retrieved papers and reviews and two clinical trial registries. We also contacted trial authors.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected controlled trials of at least four weeks duration of any formulation of antipsychotics used for the treatment of fibromyalgia in adults.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted the data from all included studies and two review authors independently assessed study risks of bias. We resolved discrepancies by discussion. We performed analysis using three tiers of evidence. We derived first-tier evidence from data meeting best standards and subject to minimal risk of bias (outcome equivalent to substantial pain intensity reduction, intention-to-treat).

### Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for fibromyalgia [^116QAfQb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a clinically defined chronic condition of unknown etiology characterized by chronic widespread pain that often co-exists with sleep disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, and fatigue. People with fibromyalgia frequently report high disability levels and poor quality of life. Drug therapy, such as serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), focuses on reducing key symptoms and improving the quality of life. This review updates and extends the 2013 version of this systematic review.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) compared with placebo or other active drug(s) in the treatment of fibromyalgia in adults.

- **Search methods**: For this update, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the US National Institutes of Health, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for published and ongoing trials and examined the reference lists of reviewed articles, up to 8 August 2017.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomized, controlled trials of any formulation of SNRIs against placebo or any other active treatment of fibromyalgia in adults.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three review authors independently extracted data, examined study quality, and assessed risk of bias. For efficacy, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) for pain relief of 50% or greater and of 30% or greater, the patient's global impression to be much or very much improved, dropout rates due to lack of efficacy, and the safety profile of these treatments.

### Cognitive-behavioural therapies and exercise programmes for patients with fibromyalgia: State of the art and future directions [^114nZwBe]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

This review provides an overview of the effects of non-pharmacological treatments for patients with fibromyalgia (FM), including cognitive-behavioural therapy, exercise training programmes, or a combination of the two. After summarising and discussing preliminary evidence of the rationale of non-pharmacological treatment in patients with FM, we reviewed randomised controlled trials for possible predictors of the success of treatment, such as patient and treatment characteristics. In spite of support for their suitability in FM, the effects of non-pharmacological interventions are limited, and positive outcomes largely disappear in the long term. However, within the various populations with FM, treatment outcomes showed considerable individual variations. In particular, specific subgroups of patients characterised by relatively high levels of psychological distress seem to benefit most from non-pharmacological interventions. Preliminary evidence of retrospective treatment analyses suggests that the efficacy may be enhanced by offering tailored treatment approaches at an early stage to patients who are at risk of developing chronic physical and psychological impairments.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111Qnwcu]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted in line with the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The study protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42021296922).

- **Search strategy**: Comprehensive search strategies were developed by an information scientist, with input from our expert advisers, to identify RCTs in patients with fibromyalgia with sleep as an outcome. The searches were not restricted by publication date or language, and we used the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy filter for identifying RCTs. The following databases were searched in November 2021: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PyscINFO, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, EBSCO CINAHL, Clarivate Science Citation Index, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Reference lists of systematic reviews and included studies were checked to identify additional potentially relevant reports. Details of the search strategies are reported in Supplementary Material S2.

- **Study selection**: Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were RCTs with a parallel-group, cross-over, or cluster design comparing pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions to treat sleep problems in adults and children with fibromyalgia versus usual care, placebo, no treatment (including waiting list), or another active intervention.

### Duloxetine and pregabalin: Safe and effective for the long-term treatment of fibromyalgia [^112N3qMa]. Nature Clinical Practice Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

This Practice Point commentary discusses the first two trials of long-term drug treatment in fibromyalgia. In Russell et al.'s study, 33% of patients receiving 6-month treatment with 60 mg/day duloxetine responded to therapy; the number needed to treat was seven. In the three treatment arms, 15% (60 mg/day duloxetine), 27% (120 mg/day duloxetine), and 13% (placebo) of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events, with nausea (24%) and fatigue (14%) being the most common.

In Crofford et al.'s study, 32% of patients who received pregabalin experienced a loss of therapeutic response, compared with 61% of patients treated with placebo. The discontinuation rate due to adverse events (dizziness in 36% of cases and somnolence in 22%) during the randomized treatment phase was 16% with pregabalin and 7% with placebo.

This commentary discusses the implications of these trials for clinical practice and considers areas for future research in the field. In view of the results, duloxetine and pregabalin could be administered together and as part of multimodal and multidisciplinary therapy, but treatment should "start low and go slow".

### Amitriptyline for fibromyalgia in adults [^112BqytG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 12, 2012. The earlier review considered both fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain, but the efficacy of amitriptyline for neuropathic pain is now addressed in a separate review. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is widely used to treat fibromyalgia and is recommended in many guidelines. It is usually administered at doses lower than those used for antidepressant purposes.

- **Objectives**: To assess the analgesic efficacy of amitriptyline for the relief of fibromyalgia and the adverse events associated with its use in clinical trials.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE up to March 2015, alongside reference lists of retrieved papers, previous systematic reviews, other reviews, and two clinical trial registries. Our own manually searched database for older studies was also utilized.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, double-blind studies of at least four weeks' duration, comparing amitriptyline with placebo or another active treatment in fibromyalgia.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and two study authors independently examined issues of study quality. Analysis was performed using three tiers of evidence. First-tier evidence was derived from data meeting the best standards and subject to minimal risk of bias (outcomes equivalent to substantial pain intensity reduction, intention-to-treat analysis without imputation for dropouts, at least 200 participants in the comparison, 8 to 12 weeks duration, parallel design).

- **Definition**: FM is a syndrome characterized by chronic widespread pain, fatigue, and sleep disruption.

- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of FM is unknown; however, central sensitization involving genetic, immunological, and hormonal factors have been implicated.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of FM include:
	- **Pain characteristics**: Chronic widespread pain (diffuse, multifocal, deep, gnawing, burning, waxing and waning, migratory)
	- **Musculoskeletal symptoms**: Tender joints, morning stiffness, restless legs
	- **Systemic symptoms**: Fatigue, sleep disturbances, weight fluctuations, heat and cold intolerance
	- **Digestive and urinary symptoms**: Irritable bowel disease, irritable bladder syndrome
	- **Neurological and psychological symptoms**: Cognitive disturbance, depression, anxiety, headaches
	- **Vascular symptoms**: Raynaud's phenomenon

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: FM is not associated with increased mortality.

### Cognitive behavioural therapies for fibromyalgia [^1154RY38]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). High credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a clinically well-defined chronic condition of unknown etiology characterized by chronic widespread pain that often co-exists with sleep disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, and fatigue. Patients often report high disability levels and negative mood. Psychotherapies focus on reducing key symptoms, improving daily functioning, mood, and sense of personal control over pain.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of cognitive behavioural therapies (CBTs) for treating FM at the end of treatment and at long-term (at least six months) follow-up.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1966 to 28 August 2013), PsycINFO (1966 to 28 August 2013), and SCOPUS (1980 to 28 August 2013). We searched http://www.clinicaltrials.gov (website of the US National Institutes of Health) and the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/) for ongoing trials (last search 28 August 2013), and the reference lists of reviewed articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomized controlled trials of CBTs with children, adolescents, and adults diagnosed with FM.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The data of all included studies were extracted and the risks of bias of the studies were assessed independently by two review authors. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion.

- **Main results**: Twenty-three studies with 24 study arms with CBTs were included. A total of 2031 patients were included, with 1073 patients in CBT groups and the remainder in control groups.

### Safety and efficacy of pregabalin in adolescents with fibromyalgia: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and a 6-month open-label extension study [^112Cx5bR]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

As fibromyalgia (FM) is multi-symptomatic and consists of both neurobiological and psychosocial components, a multimodal treatment approach is recommended. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to be effective in improving functional disability and symptoms of depression in adolescent patients with FM, while exercise programs may also be an effective treatment option. While there are three pharmacological treatments (pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran) approved for adult patients with FM, there are no approved options for adolescent patients with FM. We are aware of only one completed pharmacological trial in adolescent patients with FM: an exploratory open-label trial of fluoxetine, with clinical trials of milnacipran in adolescents with FM terminated early due to low enrollment.

A study of pregabalin in adolescents with FM was a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) post-marketing requirement following approval of pregabalin for the treatment of adults with FM in the United States. Based on the evidence from clinical studies of pregabalin in adults with FM, we hypothesized that pregabalin would be safe and efficacious in reducing pain severity in adolescents with FM. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study and an open-label safety study to assess the safety and efficacy of pregabalin in outpatient adolescents meeting the Yunus and Masi criteria for FM. A flexible-dose range of 75–450 mg/day was utilized in the study to improve general tolerability by allowing a wider dose range.

Regarding medical management for fibromyalgia, specifically in relation to general principles, the NFGAP 2013 guidelines recommend tailoring pharmacotherapy to target the most bothersome symptoms. Ideally, this should address multiple symptoms simultaneously and may require a combination of medications, in which case attention must be paid to drug interactions.

### Pharmacologic therapy for fibromyalgia [^115mrMDK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

While nonpharmacologic strategies can help patients understand and accept the diagnosis of fibromyalgia, pharmacologic therapy can provide important additional symptom relief and improvement in functioning. Pharmacologic therapy must be individualized based on a comprehensive evaluation of the patient and continued assessment of symptoms and response to treatment. Patient symptoms and impairments related to each of the dimensions of the "fibromyalgia triad" (pain, sleep dysfunction, and mood disorders) as well as any other comorbidities, past experiences with treatment, and patient preferences should guide therapy selection.

### Nonpharmacologic care of patients with fibromyalgia [^117RU6Yh]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A key long-term goal for patients with fibromyalgia is for them to become experts in understanding their own symptoms and treatment responses to further successful self-management of their condition. Patient education about fibromyalgia is crucial, as are several nonpharmacologic strategies. These include encouraging the patient to have a realistic, positive attitude and outlook; engaging in a regular, paced program of physical activity and exercise; and adopting positive sleep hygiene practices. To meet their goals, patients with fibromyalgia will need support and understanding from the clinician and other treatment team members.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115jpYw6]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Whenever possible, we performed pairwise and network meta-analyses (NMAs) of all relevant outcome variables. For each pairwise meta-analysis, a random-effects model was used to compare the direct evidence, with the percentage of variation across studies due to heterogeneity being assessed by the I² statistic.

For each outcome, an NMA was performed to combine both direct and indirect evidence using a Bayesian framework, according to guidance from the NICE Decision Support Unit in the United Kingdom and reported in adherence with the PRISMA for NMAs. Random-effects models with a normal likelihood were employed because all our outcomes were continuous. Convergence was assessed using history, autocorrelation, and Brooks-Gelman Rubin plots. A sensitivity analysis, which removed pharmacologic interventions from the main analysis, showed only minimal differences (results not presented).

Consistency was evaluated by examining the agreement between direct and indirect evidence in all closed loops. To explore the presence of inconsistency for any treatment contrast in the network, we performed a node-splitting analysis. We also estimated the ranking probabilities of the different interventions using the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve, which is a numeric presentation of the likelihood that an intervention is successful, as well as rankograms. The network diagrams and the node-splitting analysis were performed in Stata 17, whereas all remaining analyses were completed using WinBUGS (Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit).

### Topiramate for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults [^114xHMtR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). High credibility.

Topiramate is an antiepileptic drug with multiple possible mechanisms of action. Antiepileptic drugs are widely used to treat chronic neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage) and fibromyalgia, and many guidelines recommend them.

- **Objectives**: To assess the analgesic efficacy and associated adverse events of topiramate for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults (aged 18 years and above).

- **Search methods**: On 8 May 2013, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We reviewed the bibliographies of all randomized trials identified and review articles, and also searched two clinical trial databases, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, to identify additional published or unpublished data.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with double-blind assessment of participant outcomes following two weeks of treatment or longer (though the emphasis of the review was on studies of eight weeks or longer) that used a placebo or active comparator.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and two study authors examined issues of study quality independently. We performed analysis using two tiers of evidence. The first tier used data where studies reported the outcome of at least 50% pain reduction from baseline, lasted at least eight weeks, had a parallel group design, included 200 or more participants in the comparison, and reported an intention-to-treat analysis.

### Strategies for managing fibromyalgia [^116ahm4o]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The presentation of fibromyalgia is heterogeneous, and the treatment approach should be individualized for each patient, depending on the severity of the patient's pain, the presence of other symptoms or comorbidities, and the degree of functional impairment. The management of fibromyalgia includes the identification and treatment of all pain sources that may be present in addition to fibromyalgia, such as peripheral pain generators (e.g. comorbid osteoarthritis or neuropathic pain) or visceral pain (e.g. comorbid irritable bowel syndrome).

It is also important to address other symptoms or disorders that commonly occur in patients with fibromyalgia, such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, stiffness, and mood or anxiety disorders. Finally, the treatment should strive to improve the patient's function and global health status. In most cases, the management of fibromyalgia involves both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. This report provides an in-depth review of randomized, controlled trials for pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches to fibromyalgia therapy.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113NVRtM]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

- **Sleep quality outcome**: Sixty-five studies (72%) assessed sleep quality and were included in the network meta-analysis (NMA; n = 8,247 participants, 35 treatments). Studies were excluded from the network if they did not provide all required data (13 studies), were disconnected from the main network (4 studies), evaluated an intervention and a comparator that belonged to the same category (5 studies), or did not clarify whether the outcome was an index or subscale of a validated scale (2 studies). One study was removed because of data outliers, as the mean and standard deviation were considerably different.

The network comprises 39 studies providing Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) outcome data, 13 providing Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS-SS) data, 6 providing Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS) data, 3 providing Visual Analog Scale (VAS) data, 2 providing Sleep Quality Numeric Rating Scale (SQ-NRS) data, and 1 study each providing Fibromyalgia Multidimensional Scales and NRS data. Most interventions were compared with either placebo, sham, or usual care. Of the 35 interventions, most were nonpharmacologic (n = 26). For cross-over trials, only data from the first phase before the cross-over were used.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological therapies for fibromyalgia syndrome in adults: an overview of Cochrane reviews [^1147DvH1]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Searches identified 49 Cochrane reviews. We excluded 27 reviews at the initial screening and one after full-text assessment (see Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data S5, available at Rheumatology online); thus, 21 reviews were included. Seven reviews addressed antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), nine examined antiepileptics, and one each focused on antipsychotics, cannabinoids, oxycodone, NSAIDs, and combination therapy (details in Supplementary Table S6 and Supplementary Table S7, available at Rheumatology online). Duloxetine and milnacipran were reviewed separately and as part of a review on serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). We utilized the most recent data available.

- **Study flow diagram**: Figure 1.

- **Findings**:
	- Seven Group 1 reviews found no trials.
	- Seven Group 2 reviews found inadequate amounts of evidence.
	- Two Group 3 reviews had data potentially subject to publication bias.
	- One Group 4 review found good evidence of no effect.
	- Four Group 5 reviews found trustworthy evidence of clinically relevant effect.

All included reviews involved randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using placebo comparators. Most reviews were completed with no update planned. Diagnostic criteria were specified in reviews with data, almost uniformly following the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 or 2010 criteria or their variants. The mean age of patients in trials was typically between 39–53 years, with at least 85% female participants. Reviews specified or accepted participants with initial pain of at least moderate intensity, typically scoring 4 or more on a 0–10 scale.

Confidence in the certainty of the evidence was assessed using AMSTAR-2.

### Efficacy of nonpharmacological interventions for individual features of fibromyalgia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115CdrK7]. Pain (2022). High credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a highly heterogeneous condition, characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, poor sleep, and low mood. Nonpharmacological interventions are recommended as first-line treatment for fibromyalgia. However, the effectiveness of these interventions for various symptoms is not well understood. This study aims to assess the efficacy of nonpharmacological interventions on symptoms and disease-specific quality of life.

Seven databases were searched from their inception until June 1, 2020. Randomised controlled trials comparing any nonpharmacological intervention to usual care, waiting list, or placebo in individuals with fibromyalgia, aged over 16, were included without language restriction. The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) was the primary outcome measure. The standardised mean difference and 95% confidence interval were calculated using a random effects model. The risk of bias was evaluated using the modified Cochrane tool.

Of the 16,251 studies identified, 167 randomised controlled trials (n = 11,012) assessing 22 nonpharmacological interventions were included. Exercise, psychological treatments, multidisciplinary modality, balneotherapy, and massage improved FIQ scores. A subgroup analysis of different exercise interventions found that all forms of exercise improved pain (effect size [ES] -0.72 to -0.96) and depression (ES -0.35 to -1.22) except for flexibility exercise. Mind-body and strengthening exercises improved fatigue (ES -0.77 to -1.00), whereas aerobic and strengthening exercises improved sleep (ES -0.74 to -1.33).

### Management of fibromyalgia syndrome [^116LDQ7D]. JAMA (2004). Low credibility.

The optimal management of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is unclear, and comprehensive evidence-based guidelines have not been reported. To address this, the objective was to provide up-to-date evidence-based guidelines for the optimal treatment of FMS.

- **Data sources, selection, and extraction**: A search of all human trials, including randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, of FMS was conducted using Cochrane Collaboration Reviews (1993–2004), MEDLINE (1966–2004), CINAHL (1982–2004), EMBASE (1988–2004), PubMed (1966–2004), Healthstar (1975–2000), Contents (2000–2004), Web of Science (1980–2004), PsychInfo (1887–2004), and Science Citation Indexes (1996–2004). The literature review was performed by an interdisciplinary panel composed of 13 experts in various pain management disciplines, selected by the American Pain Society (APS), and was supplemented by selected literature reviews by APS staff members and the Utah Drug Information Service. A total of 505 articles were reviewed.

- **Data synthesis**: There are major limitations to the FMS literature, with many treatment trials compromised by short duration and lack of masking. No medical therapies have been specifically approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the management of FMS. Nonetheless, evidence suggests the efficacy of low-dose tricyclic antidepressants, cardiovascular exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, and patient education. Several other commonly used FMS therapies, such as trigger point injections, have not been adequately evaluated.

### Fibromyalgia treatment update [^111eExgs]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to highlight the recent literature from April 2005 through September 2006 involving treatment options for fibromyalgia, a common chronic pain disorder characterized by complex symptomatology and few consistently effective treatments.

- **Recent findings**: Prior evidence suggests that medication and self-management approaches to care can improve symptoms, function, and well-being in this patient population. Recent studies examining the efficacy of two serotonin and norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors — duloxetine and milnacipran — and the anticonvulsant pregabalin are encouraging. Studies evaluating different forms of exercise continue to support the belief that increased physical activity is an essential component of any treatment plan for patients with fibromyalgia. Three studies added to the understanding of treatment adherence. Finally, three studies evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of fibromyalgia showed conflicting results but added to the knowledge needed for clinicians to have substantive conversations with patients.

- **Summary**: Recent studies support the recommendation of a multimodal approach to treatment involving individualized, evidence-based pharmacotherapy and self-management. Treatment goals should include the improvement of symptoms, primarily pain and sleep, and the promotion of positive health behaviors with the aim of improving physical function and emotional well-being.

### Clinical characteristics and medication uses among fibromyalgia patients newly prescribed amitriptyline, duloxetine, gabapentin, or pregabalin [^1153SiNk]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common chronic pain disorder with unclear etiology. No definitive treatment is available for fibromyalgia, and treatment with antidepressants or antiepileptics is often used for symptom management.

- **Methods**: Using US health care utilization data, a large population-based cohort study was conducted to describe clinical characteristics and medication use patterns in patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia who newly started amitriptyline, duloxetine, gabapentin, or pregabalin.

- **Results**: There were 13,404 amitriptyline starters, 18,420 duloxetine starters, 23,268 gabapentin starters, and 19,286 pregabalin starters. The mean age ranged from 48 to 51 years, and 72–84% in each group were women. Back pain was the most frequent comorbidity in all four groups (range 48–64%), and hypertension, headache, depression, and sleep disorder were also common. The median daily dose at the start of follow-up was 25 mg for amitriptyline, 60 mg for duloxetine, 300 mg for gabapentin, and 75 mg for pregabalin, with over 60% of patients remaining on the same dose throughout the follow-up period. Only one-fifth of patients continued the treatment started for ≥ 1 year. The mean number of different prescription drugs at baseline ranged from 8 to 10 across the groups. More than half of the patients took opioids, and one-third took benzodiazepines, sleep disorder drugs, and muscle relaxants.

- **Conclusion**: Patients who started one of the four common drugs for fibromyalgia similarly had multiple comorbidities and other fibromyalgia-related medication use, but continued the treatment only for a short time.

### Common questions about the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia [^1148MUVn]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia has a distinct pathophysiology involving the central amplification of peripheral sensory signals. The core symptoms include chronic widespread pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Most patients with fibromyalgia experience muscle pain and tenderness, as well as forgetfulness or problems concentrating, accompanied by significant functional limitations.

Fibromyalgia is diagnosed using an updated set of clinical criteria that no longer depend on tender point examination. Laboratory testing may rule out other disorders that commonly present with fatigue, such as anemia and thyroid disease. Patients with fibromyalgia should be evaluated for comorbid functional pain syndromes and mood disorders.

Management of fibromyalgia should encompass patient education, symptom relief, and regular aerobic physical activity. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptics, and muscle relaxants have the strongest evidence of benefit for improving pain, fatigue, sleep symptoms, and quality of life. Multiple complementary and alternative medicine therapies have been used but have limited evidence of effectiveness. Opioids should be used to relieve pain in carefully selected patients only if alternative therapies are ineffective.

### Pain management in fibromyalgia [^1125VA94]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Pain is the primary presenting symptom in the vast majority of inflammatory and non-inflammatory rheumatic diseases, and patients often express that improved pain relief is a principal concern. Many pain complaints respond incompletely to the treatment of the primary rheumatic disorder, and pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia do not respond to traditional analgesic medications. Therefore, proper management requires consideration of additional medications for symptomatic relief. This review addresses newer strategies for the treatment of pain in patients with fibromyalgia that may also be useful in patients with other rheumatic diseases.

Recent studies have led to the development of new medications with a better understanding of chronic pain mechanisms, addressing pain neurobiology at the levels of the spinal cord and the brain. Clinical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the alpha-2-delta ligands, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, as well as the norepinephrine/serotonin reuptake inhibitors, including duloxetine and milnacipran, in fibromyalgia.

Patients with chronic pain, best classified as fibromyalgia, either primary or in association with other rheumatic disorders, may experience benefits from new therapies targeting central pain mechanisms.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114AuF2m]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

We pooled all sleep quality PROMs to form an overarching sleep quality outcome. Each individual outcome was also analyzed through sensitivity analyses (results not presented).

For studies reporting more than one sleep quality outcome, we established a hierarchy based on the most frequently reported outcome across the studies included. The adopted hierarchical order was as follows: PSQI, MOS-SS, JSS, FMSD, and SQ-NRS. A mixture of "change from baseline" and "final score" was available from the included studies, so we converted the final score to "change from baseline" when baseline values were available. For the imputation of the change from baseline SD, we used a correlation coefficient as recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. As we had no available data to calculate the correlation coefficient, we selected a value of 0.5 and conducted a sensitivity analysis assuming a correlation coefficient of 0.8 to assess any changes in results.

The effect size was calculated as the standardized mean difference (SMD), which divides the difference in mean between interventions by the estimated pooled between-person SD for that trial. Small sample sizes in some studies led us to use the Hedges (adjusted) G method. Effect sizes reported included SMD for the sleep quality outcome and mean differences (MD) for the remaining outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals or credible intervals (CrI).

### Effectiveness of pharmacological therapies for fibromyalgia syndrome in adults: An overview of Cochrane reviews [^116H1JDn]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

A protocol for the overview was published. Amendments to the protocol prior statement are in Supplementary Data S1 and Supplementary Data S2, available at Rheumatology online.

We included Cochrane reviews of pharmacological therapies in adults (≥ 18 years) diagnosed with FMS using an established diagnostic criterion. Reviews of children or mixed populations not reporting outcomes separately were excluded. Any pharmacological therapy and any comparator were eligible. We sought outcomes as close as possible to three months (13 weeks) after treatment; those earlier than one month (four weeks) after beginning treatment were not eligible.

Eligible study designs were RCTs or non-RCTs providing details of inclusion and exclusion criteria, databases searched and search strategies, patient-reported pain or pain relief, and summary results for at least one desired outcome. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2021 issue 12 of Cochrane Library Wiley interface on 1 January 2022, using no limits on date or language, and checked again on 1 May 2024.

Two reviewers independently selected reviews for inclusion, carried out assessments of methodological quality, extracted data, analyzed data if required, assessed how the review authors used the GRADE criteria, and made their own GRADE assessments based on the information provided. Reviewers resolved disagreements by consensus among all authors; all authors saw all data.

Information was collected on the number of included studies and participants, medicine, dose and route of administration, and baseline demographic information.
