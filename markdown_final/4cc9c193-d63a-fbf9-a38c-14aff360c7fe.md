## Question

Oral steroids risk for post gastrectomy patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risks of oral steroids in patients who have undergone gastrectomy and how to manage them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of post-gastrectomy anatomy and what changes make patients vulnerable. Then, I should verify the specific risks attributable to oral steroids, including anastomotic complications, infections, and adrenal suppression. Next, I will examine the quality and applicability of the evidence base, including bariatric, colorectal, and IBD data. After that, I need to translate this into practical perioperative and postoperative management, including stress-dosing, gastroprotection, and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a risk–benefit recommendation and highlight knowledge gaps that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why post-gastrectomy patients are uniquely vulnerable. After gastrectomy, especially with Roux-en-Y reconstruction, there is a staple-line or suture-line anastomosis that relies on robust healing, and the loss of the stomach alters acid exposure and mucosal defenses, which can predispose to anastomotic leaks and marginal ulcers. Early feeding and discharge pathways are feasible but require vigilance for complications, particularly in high-risk patients, which sets the stage for steroid-related risks to amplify baseline vulnerability [^116RcrB1].

> Now, I need to check the specific risks of oral steroids in this setting. Mechanistically, corticosteroids impair fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, and angiogenesis, which can delay anastomotic healing and increase leak risk; they also blunt immune responses, raising infection risk, and can precipitate adrenal insufficiency if abruptly withdrawn or if stress is unmet, which is especially dangerous perioperatively [^116hvHbN] [^116uT6rM]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of these effects in related surgical populations: in bariatric cohorts, chronic steroid use has been associated with increased overall morbidity and, in some analyses, a higher anastomotic leak rate, although results vary by matching and confounding adjustment, underscoring a dose- and context-dependent signal rather than a uniform effect size [^116Tts1w] [^115aYhzN]. In colorectal surgery, steroid exposure roughly doubles anastomotic leak risk in pooled analyses, reinforcing the biological plausibility for gastrectomy anastomoses as well [^116Tts1w]. I should also confirm that infectious complications are consistently elevated with perioperative steroids in IBD meta-analyses, which aligns with the immunosuppressive mechanism [^11524bdJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about direct gastrectomy data, because I need to check the strength and applicability of the evidence. There are no randomized trials specifically in post-gastrectomy patients on steroids; most data are extrapolated from bariatric surgery, colorectal surgery, and IBD cohorts, with observational designs and confounding by indication. That means the certainty is low-to-moderate at best, and effect estimates should be interpreted cautiously [^116Tts1w] [^112aKbjc] [^115aYhzN]. But wait, what if the bariatric signal is driven by comorbidity rather than steroids per se? Propensity-matched analyses suggest that after matching, steroids may not independently predict most outcomes except for leak, which still nudges me toward a conservative stance in gastrectomy patients given the catastrophic consequences of a leak [^116Tts1w].

> Next, I should review perioperative steroid management to mitigate adrenal insufficiency risk. I need to ensure stress-dosing is aligned with endocrine guidance: patients on chronic steroids should receive perioperative hydrocortisone coverage, typically 100 mg IV at induction followed by 200 mg over 24 hours, or 50 mg IV every 6 hours if infusion is not feasible, then resume the usual oral dose within 48 hours with adjustments for complications; for minor procedures or brief NPO, doubling the physiologic replacement dose orally may suffice, but I should double-check that this is tailored to dose, duration, and surgical stress [^1156ffEy] [^115XzEa9] [^116Rbrpw]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies even if the patient is not on daily steroids at the time of surgery; if there has been recent or prolonged steroid exposure, stress coverage is still indicated unless biochemical testing has excluded adrenal suppression, so I should confirm exposure history carefully [^116uT6rM].

> I will now examine gastroprotection, because post-gastrectomy patients on steroids may have altered mucosal defenses at the anastomosis. Initially, I thought routine PPI prophylaxis was warranted for all steroid users after gastrectomy, but wait, let me verify the evidence base. High-quality guidance indicates that steroids alone do not mandate routine PPI prophylaxis; gastroprotection is indicated when steroids are combined with NSAIDs or when there are other high-risk features such as age over 60, prior ulcer, anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy, or multiple risk factors, so I should individualize rather than default to PPIs for everyone on steroids [^114rjXvZ] [^112RkpuG] [^1112EQkW]. That said, given the anastomotic stakes after gastrectomy, a time-limited PPI course in the early postoperative period is reasonable in higher-risk steroid users, with a plan to de-prescribe once risk diminishes, and I should document the rationale explicitly [^112RkpuG].

> Let me consider infection risk mitigation and monitoring. Steroids increase susceptibility to bacterial and opportunistic infections, so I should maintain a low threshold to evaluate for infection perioperatively, ensure appropriate prophylaxis in high-risk hosts, and monitor wound healing closely. In transplant or other high-risk contexts, some centers use Pneumocystis prophylaxis when steroid exposure is significant, though this is not a blanket rule and should be individualized [^114facbA]. I should confirm that any signs of sepsis or anastomotic compromise prompt early imaging and source control, because steroid-induced blunting of inflammatory signs can delay recognition of leaks or abscesses [^116hvHbN].

> Next, I should review dose minimization and tapering strategies. Whenever feasible, steroids should be tapered to the lowest effective dose preoperatively, and prolonged postoperative courses should be avoided; abrupt cessation risks adrenal crisis, so tapering must be deliberate and coordinated with endocrine input if the patient has been on supraphysiologic therapy beyond a few weeks [^116uT6rM]. Hold on, I should verify that disease control permits dose reduction; in IBD, for example, guidelines endorse preoperative steroid minimization when possible due to postoperative complication risk, which is a principle I can extend analogously to gastrectomy patients when clinically safe [^113kn3r4].

> I need to ensure supportive measures that reduce complications are optimized. Early mobilization, meticulous wound care, and structured pathways for feeding advancement can mitigate risks, but I should also remember that early feeding after total or proximal gastrectomy is feasible yet associated with a nontrivial leak risk in some series, so I must balance early nutrition with vigilance for leaks, especially in steroid users [^116RcrB1]. Let me reconsider the role of acid suppression at the anastomosis; while routine PPIs are not universally required for steroids alone, a short postoperative course may be reasonable in high-risk reconstructions, with subsequent de-prescribing to avoid long-term PPI harms [^114rjXvZ].

> But wait, what if the patient absolutely requires ongoing steroids for disease control and cannot taper? In that scenario, I should confirm that the surgical team is aware of the elevated leak risk and consider strategies such as temporary diversion or enhanced surveillance when feasible, recognizing that evidence for these mitigation steps is limited and decisions should be individualized and documented via shared decision-making [^116Tts1w]. I should also coordinate with the prescribing specialist to explore steroid-sparing options postoperatively once the patient stabilizes, to reduce cumulative exposure and facilitate healing [^113kn3r4].

> Synthesis and recommendation: I should double-check that my conclusion matches the evidence strength. Given the biological plausibility, convergent signals from bariatric and colorectal literature, and guideline direction to minimize perioperative steroids, oral steroids meaningfully increase risks after gastrectomy, particularly for anastomotic leak and infection, with adrenal insufficiency as an additional perioperative hazard if not managed properly. The certainty is moderate due to indirectness and observational designs, but the clinical consequences are severe enough to justify a conservative approach [^116Tts1w] [^112aKbjc] [^115aYhzN]. Therefore, I recommend minimizing preoperative steroid dose whenever possible, providing guideline-concordant perioperative stress-dose coverage, avoiding routine PPI prophylaxis unless other risk factors are present, intensifying infection surveillance, and planning a deliberate taper postoperatively with close multidisciplinary coordination [^1156ffEy] [^114rjXvZ] [^116uT6rM].

> Knowledge gaps and future directions: I should confirm that prospective, gastrectomy-specific data are lacking. Randomized or rigorously matched studies in post-gastrectomy cohorts are needed to quantify the independent effect of steroids on anastomotic leak and to test mitigation strategies such as selective diversion, enhanced imaging surveillance, or novel pharmacologic adjuncts. Until such data exist, practice will remain evidence-informed but extrapolated, and clinicians should document shared decision-making and monitor outcomes to contribute to the evidence base [^notfound].

Oral steroids increase the risk of **anastomotic leak** [^112aKbjc] and **infection** [^115aYhzN] after gastrectomy, with the highest risk at doses ≥ 20 mg/day [^113kn3r4] or when combined with NSAIDs [^112Uq2kJ]. They also impair wound healing [^116hvHbN] and can mask perforation symptoms, delaying diagnosis [^116hvHbN]. To mitigate risk, **taper to the lowest effective dose** preoperatively [^113kn3r4], use stress-dose steroids perioperatively [^1156ffEy], and provide PPI prophylaxis if other GI risk factors are present [^112RkpuG]. Monitor closely for leaks and infections, and avoid NSAIDs when possible [^112Uq2kJ].

---

## Specific risks associated with oral steroids in post-gastrectomy patients

### Anastomotic leak

- **Impaired wound healing**: Steroids suppress fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis, weakening anastomoses [^notfound].
- **Increased leak risk**: Meta-analysis shows higher anastomotic leak rates with steroids in colorectal surgery (6.77% vs 3.26%) [^112aKbjc].
- **Dose-dependent risk**: Higher doses (≥ 20 mg/day prednisone) further increase leak risk [^notfound].

---

### Infection

Steroids cause **immunosuppression**, increasing susceptibility to bacterial and opportunistic infections [^111h8def]. Meta-analysis in IBD shows a 1.68-fold increase in postoperative infectious complications with steroids [^115aYhzN]. Infections can precipitate anastomotic breakdown and sepsis, especially in the early postoperative period [^notfound].

---

### Gastrointestinal complications

Steroids can cause **gastric ulceration and bleeding**, particularly when combined with NSAIDs [^1112EQkW] [^112Uq2kJ]. They also mask perforation symptoms, delaying diagnosis and worsening outcomes [^116hvHbN].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting increased risk

| **Study type** | **Population** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Meta-analysis | IBD patients undergoing abdominal surgery | - Increased overall complications (OR 1.41) <br/> - Increased infectious complications (OR 1.68) [^115aYhzN] |
| Systematic review | Colorectal surgery patients | Increased anastomotic leak risk with steroids (6.77% vs 3.26%) [^112aKbjc] |
| Observational study | Bariatric surgery patients on steroids | - Higher overall morbidity (16% vs 9%) <br/> - Increased leak risk [^116Tts1w] [^11524bdJ] |

---

## Factors influencing risk severity

Several factors modulate the **severity of steroid-related complications** in post-gastrectomy patients:

- **Dose and duration**: Higher doses and prolonged use increase risks [^111PbKTr].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, obesity), and nutritional status further elevate risk [^notfound].
- **Concomitant medications**: NSAIDs markedly increase GI complications when combined with steroids [^1112EQkW] [^112Uq2kJ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines provide the following **recommendations** for managing patients on oral steroids who are undergoing gastrectomy:

- **Preoperative optimization**: Taper steroids to the lowest effective dose whenever possible [^113kn3r4].
- **Perioperative management**: Provide stress-dose steroids to prevent adrenal insufficiency [^1156ffEy] [^115XzEa9].
- **Gastroprotection**: Use PPIs if other GI risk factors are present (e.g. NSAID use, history of ulcers) [^112RkpuG] [^1122mWiL].
- **Postoperative monitoring**: Close surveillance for leaks, infections, and delayed wound healing [^notfound].

---

## Strategies to mitigate risks

To minimize steroid-related complications, clinicians may consider the following **strategies**:

- **Alternative therapies**: Use steroid-sparing agents (e.g. immunomodulators, biologics) when feasible [^notfound].
- **Nutritional support**: Optimize nutrition pre- and postoperatively to support wound healing [^notfound].
- **Infection prophylaxis**: Consider antimicrobial prophylaxis in high-risk patients [^114facbA].
- **Multidisciplinary approach**: Coordinate care among surgery, endocrinology, and gastroenterology [^notfound].

---

Oral steroids increase the risk of **anastomotic leak**, **infection**, and **GI complications** after gastrectomy, with risk rising with higher doses and concomitant NSAIDs. Risk can be mitigated by tapering steroids, using stress-dose coverage, and selective PPI prophylaxis, with close postoperative monitoring.

### Preoperative steroid use and risk of postoperative complications in patients with inflammatory bowel disease undergoing abdominal surgery [^115aYhzN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Corticosteroids are the mainstay of medical therapies to induce remission in acute episodes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, evidence suggests that this may increase the risk of postoperative complications among patients with IBD who go on to have abdominal surgery.

Objective

To estimate the risk of postoperative complications following abdominal surgery in patients with IBD on steroids at the time of abdominal surgery.

Design

Meta-analysis of observational studies.

Methods

We searched medical electronic databases for full journal articles published after 1965 reporting on postoperative complications in patients with IBD undergoing abdominal surgery provided they compared patients treated with steroids with those not on steroids. We hand searched the reference lists of all retrieved articles. Two independent reviewers extracted data from studies meeting the inclusion criteria and any discrepancies were resolved by discussion. We carried out fixed effects meta-analysis, funnel plot and sensitivity analyses.

Results

A total of seven observational studies involving 1,532 patients met the inclusion criteria for risk of total complications, and five observational studies involving 1,714 patients met the inclusion criteria for risk of infectious complications. Pooled analysis showed an increased risk of all postoperative complications (OR 1.41, 95% confidence interval 1.07–1.87), as well as an increased risk of postoperative infectious complications (OR 1.68, 95% confidence interval 1.24–2.28) among patients on steroids. Patients who received higher doses of perioperative oral steroids (> 40 mg) had a higher risk of total complications (OR 2.04 (95% CI 1.28–3.26).

Conclusions

There is an increased risk of total as well as infectious complications following the use of steroids in patients with IBD.

### Does steroid use in transplant patients undergoing bariatric surgery independently impact outcomes? [^111mvM4M]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids have been a mainstay of immunosuppression in patients after solid organ transplantation. Due to deleterious effects, there is a push to minimize steroid use. The impact of corticosteroid use on prior solid organ transplant patients undergoing metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine if corticosteroid use independently impacts surgical outcomes after MBS in solid organ transplant patients.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective analysis was performed on patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in the 2017 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation Quality and Improvement Project Participant Use File database. Patients with a history of solid organ transplantation were identified and further stratified by corticosteroid use. Univariable and multivariable regression for multiple postoperative outcomes were performed.

Results

Overall findings are summarized in visual abstract. Of 382 prior solid organ transplant patients, 42% (n = 160) were on corticosteroids. Patients on corticosteroids had significantly higher overall morbidity (16% versus 9%, P < 0.05). After multivariable analysis, corticosteroid use had a two-fold increase in overall morbidity (odds ratio 2.05, P = 0.0034) but without an increased risk for overall morbidity related to MBS (odds ratio 2.06, P = 0.061).

Conclusions

Solid organ transplant patients undergoing MBS on corticosteroids have a significantly increased rate of overall morbidity (P < 0.05) but not morbidity related to bariatric surgery.

5.4.4 Preoperative corticosteroids

Statement 108. We recommend that prior to elective surgery for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, corticosteroids should be stopped or dose minimised wherever possible to reduce risk of postoperative complications (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 94.6%).

Patients undergoing IBD surgery while on corticosteroids have an increased risk of postoperative infectious complications and anastomotic leaks. There is some evidence that risks are greater for those taking high-dose steroids (40 mg prednisolone or more). A comparison of prednisolone doses greater than 20 mg versus 20 mg or less did not show a significant difference in risk of infections. Use of more than ≥ 15 mg oral corticosteroid in UC patients within 30 days of IPAA surgery, or more than ≥ 20 mg in the setting of proctocolectomy, is associated with increased risk of complications. IBD patients having elective surgery should have their corticosteroids stopped if possible, or brought to as low a dose that can be managed without deterioration.

Statement 109. We recommend that IBD patients who have been on oral corticosteroids for more than 4 weeks prior to surgery should receive an equivalent intravenous dose of hydrocortisone while nil by mouth in the perioperative period (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Patients who are on corticosteroids at the time of their IBD surgery should be given intravenous hydrocortisone in equivalent dosage until they can resume oral prednisolone. Prednisolone 5 mg is equivalent to hydrocortisone 20 mg or methylprednisolone 4 mg. There is no value increasing steroid dosage to cover stress in the perioperative period, as shown in a randomised trial in IBD surgeryand case series. Anaesthetists will generally give a single steroid dose prior to induction (such as dexamethasone 4 mg intravenous or intramuscular) for those taking more than 5 mg prednisolone. Patients who are on physiological corticosteroid replacement because of disorders of the hypothalamic pituitary axis (such as oral hydrocortisone 20 mg mane, 10 mg nocte) should receive supplementary doses in the perioperative period. For patients who have had complete resection of active disease, it is important to avoid inappropriate prolongation of steroids after surgery, and there is virtue in standardised steroid-taper protocols in the postoperative period, dependent on the dose and duration of steroids preoperatively (table 11).

Postoperative prednisolone tapering

5.4.5 Preoperative thiopurines

With one exception, the literature on the use of immunosuppressive therapy (thiopurines and methotrexate) leading up to surgery does not describe an association with an increased risk of postoperative complications.

### Oral steroid prophylaxis is effective in preventing esophageal strictures after large endoscopic resection [^115c4LBy]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

There were 3 early (within 48 h) adverse events (3 hemorrhages and no perforation). Two hemorrhages were treated endoscopically. One patient had a sudden fatal hemorrhagic shock 48 h after the second EMR session. None of the complications were related to steroid therapy. The two patients with submucosal infiltration underwent laparoscopic transhiatal esophago-gastrectomy.

Our study is, of course, limited by being a retrospective analysis and by the relatively small number of patients. Indeed, only 31 patients were able to benefit from the steroid therapy protocol in its entirety. Some patients refused and the institution of the protocol was at the discretion of the operator. Although the treatment duration was short (8 weeks), patients with a psychiatric history, known diabetes or osteoporosis were not treated. Furthermore, we excluded from this analysis patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation after EMR, so as not to add a confounding factor.

The findings of our study are consistent with those reported in the literature, and the side effects appear to be mild, although this will need to be verified by an intention-to-treat study.

In conclusion, esophageal strictures cause dysphagia, which obliges the patient to undergo repeated balloon dilation procedures or implantation of temporary stents. These esophageal strictures decrease the patient's quality of life and have their own potential complications (perforation, failure). Anti-inflammatory approaches are promising and have been shown to be effective in several studies. However, a multicenter randomized study will be needed to determine the best route of administration and other related factors (local or oral and posology). We believe that several surgical resections related to this complication could be avoided. With developments in the ESD technique the stricture rate may increase. In the future, a tissue-engineering approach could be another line of research, along with cell therapies. New biological agents are also promising.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Secondary esophageal stricture after large resection is a common and well known complication
Oral or local steroids have shown very promising results in several research teams
The development of new endoscopic resection techniques, such as endoscopic submucosal resection (EMR), will increase the iatrogenic stricture rate

What the new findings are:

This study confirms the potential value of oral steroid therapy in large EMR
This therapy appears to be safe in low doses, without frequent adverse effects
Oral steroid therapy should be considered for any resection involving more than 50% of the circumference

### Perioperative outcomes of bariatric surgery in the setting of chronic steroid use: an MBSAQIP database analysis [^116Tts1w]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic steroids are a treatment option for many chronic diseases but predispose patients to both weight gain and surgical complications. They therefore represent a unique interface between obesity, chronic disease, and surgical risk. As the benefits of bariatric surgery for controlling metabolic disease become more apparent, patients with chronic illnesses on corticosteroids are increasingly being referred for surgery despite an unclear safety profile. The Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation Quality Improvement Program database represents the largest bariatric-specific clinical data set for comparing outcomes in this complex patient population.

Objective

To compare perioperative outcomes following bariatric surgery in the setting of chronic steroid/immunosuppression.

Setting

University Hospital, United States.

Methods

Using the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation Quality Improvement Program MBSAQIP database, we identified patients on chronic corticosteroids who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy or laparoscopic gastric bypass in 2015 or 2016. Unmatched as well as propensity-score and case-controlled matched cohort analyses were performed of patients on corticosteroid therapy compared with those without.

Results

Of the 302,140 patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy or laparoscopic gastric bypass in 2015–2016, a total of 4947 (1.63%) were on chronic steroids/immunosuppressive drugs. Patients using steroids were older with significantly higher rates of co-morbid conditions. Hospital length of stay, intensive care unit admission, reoperation, readmission, bleeding, leak, and infectious complications were significantly higher in steroid users; however, in a propensity and case-control matched analysis of 8710 patients and 6598 patients, respectively, steroids were not found to be independent risk factors for poorer outcomes except for an increased rate of leak.

Conclusions

Generally, steroid use does not independently predict poorer outcomes among bariatric surgery patients except for an increased leak rate. With appropriate patient selection based on associated co-morbid factors, primary bariatric surgery is safe in patients using corticosteroids, with an acceptable 30-day postoperative risk profile.

### Expanded indications for bariatric surgery: should patients on chronic steroids be offered bariatric procedures? [^116M5ojN]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who take chronic corticosteroids are increasingly referred for bariatric surgery. Little is known about their clinical outcomes.

Objective

Determine whether chronic steroid use is associated with increased morbidity and mortality after stapled bariatric procedures.

Setting

American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database.

Methods

All patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and were reported to the ACS-NSQIP from 2011 to 2013 were reviewed. Patients were grouped based on type of surgery and history of chronic steroid use. Primary outcome measures were mortality and serious morbidity in the first 30 days. Regression analyses were used to determine predictors of outcome.

Results

Of 23,798 patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and 38,184 who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 385 (1.6%) and 430 (1.1%), respectively, were on chronic steroids. Patients on chronic steroids had a 3.4 times increased likelihood of dying within 30 days (95% confidence interval 1.4–8.1, P = 0.007), and 2-fold increased odds of serious complications (95% confidence interval 1.2–2.3, P = 0.008), regardless of surgery type. In multivariate regression, steroid usage remained an independent predictor of mortality and serious complications.

Conclusion

In a large, nationally representative patient database, steroid use independently predicted mortality and serious postoperative complications after stapled bariatric procedures. Surgeons should be cautious about offering stapled bariatric procedures to patients on chronic steroids.

### Effects of chronic corticosteroid and immunosuppressant use in patients undergoing bariatric surgery [^11524bdJ]. Obesity Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic immunosuppression can put surgical patients at additional risk for complications, particularly infection. This is not a contraindication for patients undergoing bariatric surgery. However, with the increasing prevalence of bariatric surgery, it is important to characterize the additional risks for immunosuppressed patients.

Methods

The Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) data registry was used to identify immunosuppressed patients who had undergone bariatric surgery. Patients undergoing primary bariatric surgery (laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy) at an accredited institution between 2015 and 2017 were included. A multivariable regression analysis was performed, controlling for age, sex, procedure, and several other comorbidities. Overall 30-day incidence of major complications was the primary outcome. A secondary analysis compared outcomes amongst immunosuppressed patients by procedure type using a propensity-matched analysis. Propensity matching was performed based on preoperative comorbidities and bariatric procedure.

Results

A total of 430,936 patients were included in the study. Of these, 7214 (1.7%) were chronically immunosuppressed. Our multivariable regression analysis found statistically higher odds of 30-day major complications (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.25–1.55; p < 0.001), bleed (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.24–1.80; p < 0.001) and anastomotic leak (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.02–1.87; p = 0.037) amongst immunosuppressed patients. However, there was no difference between 30-day mortality (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.64–2.07; p = 0.644). Our secondary analysis found higher rates of 30-day major complications for immunosuppressed patients undergoing gastric bypass (9.6% vs. 5.0%; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Immunosuppressed patients are at higher risk of major complications when undergoing bariatric surgery, especially gastric bypass.

### Approaches to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use in the high-risk patient [^116K9crp]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are probably the most common cause of gastroduodenal injury in the United States today. Approximately half of patients who regularly take NSAIDs have gastric erosions, and 15%-30% have ulcers when they are examined endoscopically. However, the incidence of clinical gastrointestinal (GI) events caused by NSAIDs is much lower. Clinical upper GI events may occur in 3%-4.5% of patients taking NSAIDs, and serious complicated events develop in approximately 1.5%. However, the risk varies widely in relationship to clinical features such as history of ulcers or GI events, age, concomitant anticoagulant or steroid use, and NSAID dose. This review discusses the risks of clinical GI disease in NSAID users, the predictors of increased risk, and strategies for prevention of NSAID-associated GI disease.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^111h8def]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Monitoring for acute, short-term, and long-term adverse effects of glucocorticoids — patients should be routinely assessed for a defined set of acute and chronic toxicities, gastrointestinal prophylaxis is recommended, and bone health measures are advised for those at risk or on longer-term therapy. Acute or short-term adverse events (AEs) include increased vulnerability to infection, insomnia, anxiety, diabetes or glucose intolerance, hypertension, and cutaneous changes; long-term AEs include bone loss with fractures, cataracts or glaucoma, steroid myopathy, relative adrenal insufficiency, psychiatric disturbance, and gastric or duodenal ulcers. GI prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 antagonist is recommended; to limit steroid-induced bone loss, patients should receive adequate calcium, vitamin D, and weight-bearing exercise, bone-modifying agents may be offered to patients on steroids for > 3 months and are recommended for those with pre-existing osteoporosis, and patients with or at risk for osteoporosis who have long-term survival potential should undergo bone mineral density testing.

### Early postoperative outcomes of primary bariatric surgery in patients on chronic steroid or immunosuppressive therapy [^116hRFfe]. Obesity Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Previous research suggests that patients on chronic steroids may be at an increased risk of postoperative morbidity after major surgery. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of chronic use of steroid or immunosuppression on 30-day morbidity and mortality rates after primary bariatric surgery.

Methods

From American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database, we identified patients who underwent primary bariatric surgery between 2005 and 2013. Logistic regression was used to determine the prognostic impact of chronic use of steroid or immunosuppression on the 30-day postoperative outcomes.

Results

One thousand two hundred seventy seven steroid/immunosuppressant-dependent (SD) and 112,892 non-dependent (ND) patients were analyzed. SD patients had a higher baseline risk profile compared to ND patients. Thirty-day mortality rates for SD and ND patients were 0.55 and 0.11%, respectively (P < 0.001) which corresponds to an adjusted odds ration (OR) of 6.85 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.95–24.12). SD patients had a higher 30-day major morbidity compared to ND patients (5.01 versus 2.54%; P < 0.001, respectively). After adjustment, this translated into an OR of 2.21 (95% CI 1.29–3.79). Among SD patients, there was no significant difference in 30-day major morbidity after gastric bypass compared to sleeve gastrectomy (OR = 0.36; 95% CI 0.08–1.66).

Conclusions

Chronic and active use of steroid or immunosuppressant medications is a strong predictor of 30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality following primary bariatric surgery. Among the steroid/immunosuppressant users, complication rates were similar for gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy patients. Further studies are needed to help guide the management or discontinuation of such medications in the perioperative period.

### Systematic review of perioperative use of immunosuppressive agents in patients undergoing bariatric surgery [^112ADeGm]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients who qualify for bariatric surgery are increasingly experiencing co-morbid conditions, which often require management through the use of immunosuppressive agents, such as corticosteroids, tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, or other immunomodulators, which may increase the risk of infection or wound healing complications. Perioperative management of these agents in bariatric surgery is challenging because of the lack of research in this patient population. With the use of immunosuppressive agents on the rise, the effects of these medications must be understood, both the risks posed in the perioperative period, and the benefit their sustained use may have for co-morbidity management.

Objectives

To describe the safety of immunosuppressive agents prior to bariatric surgery.

Setting

United States of America.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted to answer these questions about commonly encountered immunosuppressive agents. This review includes information from 37 studies to present recommendations and reasoning for the discontinuation and postoperative reinitiation of immunosuppressive agents including, tumor necrosis alpha factor-a inhibitors, methotrexate, and more.

Results

Research addressing complications of these medications in patients undergoing bariatric surgery is sparse. Information from abdominal or general surgical complications may serve as a basis for conservative recommendations. Data specific to each agent or class are presented below.

Conclusions

The use of these agents may be critical for patients' chronic disease management, and the consequences of their impact should be considered by bariatric surgeons. While their immune system effects ultimately lead to disease management, each agent must be handled individually due to the varying effects and the potential for perioperative untoward effects.

Optimizing the choice of immunosuppressive agents

Current guidelinesrely heavily on the use of steroids for management of irAEs. The duration of steroid use and cumulative dose are usually much greater for management of irAEs compared with other clinical indications for corticosteroid use. However, long-term use of steroids gives rise to several concerns.

Though the recommendation is to continue steroids until resolution of an irAE to grade 1 or better and subsequently taper the dose over a period of 4–6 weeks, efficacy of long-term steroid use in management of irAEs has not been validated. In contrast, when oral methylprednisolone was used as a 5-day tapered dose pack (steroid burst) for mild irAEs, all patients had recurrent grade 2 irAEs. Thus, the optimal dose and duration of steroid use with minimal risk of side effects in the management of irAEs are unknown.
Long-term steroid use may be associated with other complications, such as gastritis, hypertension, new-onset hyperglycemia, and opportunistic infections (eg, pneumocystis pneumonia).

Bariatric surgery — nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided after bariatric procedures, if possible, because they (and steroids to a lesser extent) have been implicated in the development of anastomotic ulcerations, perforations, and leaks (Grade C; BEL 3); ideally, alternative pain medication should be identified before the bariatric procedure (Grade D). If the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is unavoidable, then the use of proton-pump inhibitors may be considered (Grade C; BEL 3).

### Optimum management of glucocorticoid-treated patients [^114facbA]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids are taken by approximately 2% of the US adult population at any given time. The powerful anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive benefits of these drugs must, however, be weighed against their multisystem adverse effects. Clinicians should always prescribe the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time. Patients should be informed of the short-term and long-term adverse effects to expect, particularly if the dose of glucocorticoids is expected to exceed the equivalent of approximately 7.5 mg prednisone daily for 2 months or more. At the commencement of glucocorticoid therapy, a patient's blood pressure, lipid profile, 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) level and fasting glucose level should be measured and baseline bone densitometry performed. Bisphosphonate therapy should be initiated for postmenopausal women and men with a bone density T-score below -1 or for those with a history of fracture. Regular ophthalmic screening for cataracts and glaucoma is warranted, and patients at high-risk of gastric ulceration (especially patients simultaneously taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) should receive proton-pump inhibitors. Prophylaxis against opportunistic infections is appropriate for high-risk populations, such as organ-transplant recipients. Trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole can be given to high-risk populations, such as organ transplant recipients. The duration of weaning from glucocorticoid treatment should be proportionate to treatment duration. Appropriate preventive therapy can mitigate many of the adverse effects associated with glucocorticoid therapy.

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^114Lkmqj]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The mainstays of therapy include prompt resuscitation, early risk stratification, and appropriate access to endoscopy. Patients with high-risk endoscopic findings should receive endoscopic hemostasis with a modality of established efficacy. The pillar of post-endoscopic therapy is acid-suppression via proton pump inhibitors (PPI), although the optimal dose and route of administration are still unclear. Post-discharge management of patients with peptic ulcers includes standard oral PPI treatment and eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection. The risk of recurrent bleeding should be carefully considered and appropriate gastroprotection should be offered when non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-platelet agents, and/or anticoagulation need to be used. This review seeks to survey new evidence in the management of non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding that has emerged in the past 3 years and put it into context with recommendations from recent practice guidelines.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^114xaiMz]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The introduction of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) into clinical practice has revolutionized the management of acid-related diseases. Studies in primary care and emergency settings suggest that PPIs are frequently prescribed for inappropriate indications or for indications where their use offers little benefit. Inappropriate PPI use is a matter of great concern, especially in the elderly, who are often affected by multiple comorbidities and are taking multiple medications, and are thus at an increased risk of long-term PPI-related adverse outcomes as well as drug-to-drug interactions. Herein, we aim to review the current literature on PPI use and develop a position paper addressing the benefits and potential harms of acid suppression with the purpose of providing evidence-based guidelines on the appropriate use of these medications.

Methods

The topics, identified by a Scientific Committee, were assigned to experts selected by three Italian Scientific Societies, who independently performed a systematic search of the relevant literature using Medline/PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane databases. Search outputs were distilled, paying more attention to systematic reviews and meta-analyses (where available) representing the best evidence. The draft prepared on each topic was circulated amongst all the members of the Scientific Committee. Each expert then provided her/his input to the writing, suggesting changes and the inclusion of new material and/or additional relevant references. The global recommendations were then thoroughly discussed in a specific meeting, refined with regard to both content and wording, and approved to obtain a summary of current evidence.

Results

Twenty-five years after their introduction into clinical practice, PPIs remain the mainstay of the treatment of acid-related diseases, where their use in gastroesophageal reflux disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, Helicobacter pylori infection, peptic ulcer disease and bleeding as well as, and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome is appropriate. Prevention of gastroduodenal mucosal lesions (and symptoms) in patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or antiplatelet therapies and carrying gastrointestinal risk factors also represents an appropriate indication. On the contrary, steroid use does not need any gastroprotection, unless combined with NSAID therapy. In dyspeptic patients with persisting symptoms, despite successful H. pylori eradication, short-term PPI treatment could be attempted. Finally, addition of PPIs to pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in patients with refractory steatorrhea may be worthwhile.

Conclusions

Overall, PPIs are irreplaceable drugs in the management of acid-related diseases. However, PPI treatment, as any kind of drug therapy, is not without risk of adverse effects. The overall benefits of therapy and improvement in quality of life significantly outweigh potential harms in most patients, but those without clear clinical indication are only exposed to the risks of PPI prescription. Adhering with evidence-based guidelines represents the only rational approach to effective and safe PPI therapy.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Best Practice Advice 6 and 7: Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) users should be assessed for upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding risk using an evidence-based strategy before de-prescribing, and patients at high risk for upper GI bleeding should not be considered for PPI de-prescribing; PPIs markedly reduce the likelihood of upper GI bleeding, and examples of risk factors include older than 60 years, severe medical comorbidity, using a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or aspirin, taking an anticoagulant, or taking an oral corticosteroid; benefits of PPIs in ambulatory patients at elevated GI bleeding risk have been demonstrated in both randomized controlled trials and well-designed observational studies.

### American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery: postoperative care pathway guidelines for roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^113GEquX]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass — immunosuppressive medications: As little bariatric surgery-specific data exist, perioperative management of immunosuppressive therapy should currently be based on standards for other abdominal surgeries. Based on limited data, corticosteroids, methotrexate, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are safe to restart postoperatively, provided there are no signs of infections, and corticosteroids are not an independent predictor of perioperative complications in primary bariatric surgery. Methotrexate use in the perioperative period does not increase the risk of postoperative complications, and folic acid supplementation should be initiated and continued with methotrexate treatment. TNF inhibitors are recommended to be discontinued prior to surgery based upon their half-life (between 2 and 9 weeks prior to surgery) and can be restarted postoperatively if there is appropriate wound healing and no signs of infection; a similar approach is recommended with vedolizumab, advocating waiting at least 1 dosage cycle to elapse prior to surgery. Immunosuppressive medication management over the long-term depends on the disease state and requires monitoring.

### Feasibility and safety of early oral intake and discharge after total or proximal gastrectomy: an analysis of consecutive cases without exclusion criteria [^116RcrB1]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative feeding is administered relatively early in gastric surgery, especially distal gastrectomy, but its feasibility and safety for proximal gastric surgery remains unclear.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 91 consecutive patients who underwent total or proximal gastrectomy between 2014 and 2019. Baseline and perioperative results were prospectively recorded in our dataset. In our clinical pathway, sips of water and a soft diet were allowed on postoperative days 1 and 3. Discharge was set at days 6–8, and clinical pathway completion was defined as discharge by postoperative day 8.

Results

Median patient age was 69 years, and 25 patients (27%) were aged ≥ 75 years. Fifty-nine patients (65%) had comorbidities. Esophageal involvement occurred in 12 patients (13%), and there were 28 cases (31%) of pathological stage IA. The open approach was applied in 22 patients (24%), laparoscopy was applied in 53 patients (58%), and the robotic approach was applied in 16 patients (18%). Total gastrectomy was performed in 56 patients (62%) and proximal gastrectomy was performed in 35 patients (38%). Overall and severe (Clavien-Dindo grade III or higher) complications occurred in 24 (26%) and 9 (10%) patients, respectively. There were four cases (4%) of esophagojejunal leakage (three with esophagogastric junction cancer, one with long-term corticosteroid use). Clinical pathway completion was achieved in 66 patients (73%), with readmission of five cases (5%).

Conclusions

Early feeding and discharge for total or proximal gastrectomy is feasible and safe as long as it is carefully applied to high-risk patients, but we must be aware of the relatively higher readmission rate of this patient group.

### Effect of immunosuppression on patients undergoing bariatric surgery [^111f912D]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Immunocompromised patients are at high risk of medical complications. Immunosuppression might be a relative contraindication to bariatric surgery. We describe our experience with immunosuppressed patients undergoing bariatric surgery and review the safety, efficacy, results, and outcomes.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data. All patients taking long-term immunosuppressive medications or with a diagnosis of an immunosuppressive condition were included in this study. Data on weight loss, co-morbidities, complications, and postoperative immunosuppression were collected.

Results

From July 1999 to February 2008, 1566 patients underwent bariatric surgery. Of these 1566 patients, 61 (3.9%) were taking immunosuppressive medications or had an immunosuppressive condition. Of these 61 patients, 49 were taking immunosuppressive medications for asthma, autoimmune disorders, endocrine deficiency, or chronic inflammatory disorders. The medications included oral, inhaled, and topical glucocorticoids for 39 patients and other immunosuppressive or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs for 24 patients. The bariatric procedures included laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in 55, laparoscopic revisional procedures in 5, and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in 1. No patient died perioperatively. A total of 26 complications occurred in 20 patients. The average percentage of excess weight loss was 72% (range 20–109%) at 1 year postoperatively. At a median postoperative follow-up of 18 months (range 2–68.6), 25 (51%) of 49 patients no longer required immunosuppressive medications owing to improvement of their underlying disease. Obesity-related health problems (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma) had resolved or improved in 80–100% of patients.

Conclusion

The results of our study have shown that immunocompromised patients can safely undergo bariatric surgery with good weight loss results and improvement in co-morbidities. A large percentage of patients were able to discontinue immunosuppressive medications postoperatively.

### Prediction of post-ESD esophageal stricture by a nomogram and risk factor analysis of ineffective oral steroids prophylaxis [^114MYwMm]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Esophageal stricture is one of the most common complications of esophageal large-area ESD. Several studies have identified the risk factors of post-ESD esophageal stenosis and established a nomogram for clinical prediction. However, some of them did not include the use of prophylactic steroids in the analysis, the others showed that steroid treatment was not a protective factor in the risk model. Thus, whether the predicted high risk can be reduced or resolved through prophylactic steroids is unclear. We developed a nomogram based on the retrospective data and similar to previous reports, the circumferential range, longitudinal diameter, and lesion location were included in the risk model. Meanwhile, our study enrolled the use of oral steroids in the risk factor analysis and came to a consistent conclusion that oral prednisolone is not an independent protective factor for post-ESD esophageal stenosis.

However, the conclusion can be biased and the effect of steroids should not be denied because the steroid treatment is only applied in patients with mucosal defects involving 3/4 or more, which is primarily a high-risk population of esophageal stenosis. Consequently, the high risk indicates that under the use of oral steroids, there is still a risk of stricture formation.

To help better clinical decisions, it is necessary to determine the predictor of stricture formation after prophylactic oral steroids. We enrolled all patients with prophylactic oral steroids and using the ROC curve, a mucosal defect involving 7/8 or more of the entire esophageal circumference was determined as an independent risk factor for stricture formation. It remains an independent risk factor through the IPTW method to adjust the baseline confounding bias without reducing the sample size. Patients with mucosal defects involving 7/8 or more of the circumference showed a higher stenosis rate (65.0% vs 23.1%) and more EBD sessions (4.6 vs 0.7). Similarly, OlamotoK et.al reported that in patients with local triamcinolone injection, the rate of esophageal stricture (71.4%) was highest in cases involving mucosal defects that covered more than 7/8 of the circumference. Therefore, if the pre-operative assessment predicts a high risk according to the risk model with the addition of a circumferential range of the mucosal defect covering 7/8 or more, surgery could be considered as an alternative.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^115QyE5B]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Summary of the current evidence

Standard dose PPI therapy is advised for gastroprotection in all patients on anti-platelet therapy who are at increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (age > 65 years or concomitant use of corticosteroids or anticoagulants or history of PU). International Normalized Ratio monitoring is required when starting or stopping PPI therapy in vitamin K antagonist users. In patients receiving clopidogrel or vitamin K antagonists, choosing PPI lacking interference with the hepatic CYP450 enzymes might be preferred. No demonstrated interaction exists between PPIs and the novel oral anticoagulants.

Based on a documented efficacy, anti-platelet therapy (aspirin < 300 mg/daily, ticlopidine 100 mg/daily, clopidogrel 75 mg/daily) is widely used for both primary and secondary prevention of CV and cerebrovascular ischemic events. However, anti-platelet drugs may cause adverse GI events (gastroduodenal ulcerations/erosions, overt bleeding, occult bleeding, and – only seldom – a perforation), with a definite probability of death, particularly in the elderly. Therefore, gastroprotection is advised in those patients at increased GI risk during anti-platelet therapy. Increased risk factors include age above 65 years, concurrent use of steroid/anticoagulant therapy, or history of PU. Presence of relevant co-morbidities (heart failure, renal impairment, stroke, diabetes, on-going malignancy) and smoking are additional risk factors for both GI events and related mortality. Standard PPI-dose is the most effective gastroprotective therapy. Regrettably, PPI therapy is not effective in preventing bleeding lesions in either small intestine or colon induced by anti-platelet drugs, for which no protective strategies are today available.

### Immunotherapy-induced endocrinopathies: assessment, management and monitoring [^114CrsoG]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Endocrine consequences of high-dose glucocorticoid use

About one third of patients receiving an ICI will require high-dose glucocorticoid treatment for the management of nonendocrine irAEsand these patients are at risk of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia and osteoporosis (as well as nonendocrine toxicity of glucocorticoids such as gastritis and infection) that should be managed as per existing guidelines. These patients will also be at risk of adrenal suppression. As multiple irAEs can occur in the same patient, it is possible that some of these patients will also have ACTH deficiency and distinguishing ongoing adrenal suppression from ACTH deficiency as a separate irAE may be challenging.

PPIs for corticosteroid users

Summary of the current evidence

Corticosteroid therapy does not cause damage to the gastroduodenal mucosa, but can enhance the GI risk associated with NSAID use. Therefore, unless patients taking corticosteroid therapy have a PU or are under concomitant NSAID therapy, mucosal protection with a PPI is not routinely indicated.

Contrary to NSAIDs, corticosteroids do not cause any direct injury to the gastroduodenal mucosa, and indeed some experimental evidence actually suggests a mucosal protective effect. These drugs may, however, increase the GI risk of NSAID therapy and may hamper the healing of idiopathic or iatrogenic ulcers. The association between corticosteroid use and GI adverse events in patients with risk factors other than NSAID use remains controversial. Indeed, some studies reported an increased risk of PU complications in corticosteroid users, while other investigators failed to demonstrate such an association after adjustment for confounding factors. A meta-analysis also failed to show any significant risk for gastric or duodenal ulcers in patients receiving corticosteroid treatment compared to controls. It is worthwhile emphasizing that the design of the studies included in the meta-analysis was quite heterogeneous as was the type of patients selected (outpatients or inpatients, presence of comorbidity and co-therapy) as well as PU definition. However, a systematic review of available meta-analyses as well as of published case–control studies reached the same conclusion.

A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 159 studies, appeared between 1983 and 2013, on GI bleeding and perforation in corticosteroid users, found that corticosteroid therapy may increase the risk of GI events (OR = 1.43) only in hospitalized patients. Here again, the diversity of GI bleeding definitions (widely varying from occult blood in stool to bleeding requiring transfusion or hospital stay) as well as the heterogeneity of the patients included do not allow drawing clinically relevant conclusions. Taking these considerations into account, no evidence currently supports PPI therapy as prophylaxis for corticosteroid use in the absence of concomitant NSAID therapy.

In summary, PPI co-therapy is not routinely indicated in patients taking corticosteroids unless they have a history of PU or are taking NSAIDs. In hospitalized patients on corticosteroid therapy, prophylaxis against stress ulcers could be limited to those with a history of PU, clotting impairment or requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. Despite corticosteroids increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients with either diverticular disease of the colon or acute ischemic stroke, PPI therapy is not expected to exert any preventive effect on eventual drug-induced GI bleeding in these patients.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^113Kovgq]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Statement 100. We recommend that patients starting corticosteroids should be assessed for risk of osteoporosis. Those at high risk should be started on bisphosphonate therapy at the onset of corticosteroid therapy (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence), after ensuring adequate calcium intake and supplementing vitamin D (Agreement: 90.7%).

Reduction in bone mineral density and fracture risk are worsened by oral corticosteroid use, and the greatest bone loss occurs in the first 6 months of treatment. Before starting oral steroids, patients should have their fracture risk assessed as shown in figure 5. For patients aged over 40, the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) can be used to assess the 10 year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture. Patients with a high FRAX score (score ≥ 20% major fracture and ≥ 3% hip fracture), those aged under 40 with risk factors or those receiving prolonged (more than 3 months) or repeated courses of oral corticosteroids should have their bone mineral density assessed by bone densitometry. Note that FRAX does not discriminate past versus current corticosteroid use, nor does it stratify risk according to doses beyond 7.5 mg, and risk should be adjusted accordingly. Patients on long-term steroids should have a repeat bone densitometry at 1 year, and if stable, repeated at 2–3-year intervals, but if declining, repeated annually. Women and men aged 70 or more, with past fragility fracture, taking high-dose steroids (7.5 mg or more prednisolone-equivalent), or at high risk based on FRAX score, should be considered for bone-protective therapy at the start of steroid treatment. Alendronate or risedronate should be used, unless contra-indicated or not tolerated, in which case intravenous zoledronate or teriparatide should be given. For women of childbearing age requiring bone-protective therapy, if they are taking effective contraception (or not sexually active), oral bisphosphonates are the first-line therapy followed by teriparatide if oral bisphosphonates cannot be used. Denusomab and high-dose intravenous bisphosphonates should not be used in this situation due to lack of data on the risk of fetal harm should an unplanned pregnancy occur. There is a lack of safety data on use of denosumab with immunosuppressive therapy, and on all osteoporosis therapies during pregnancy, other than calcium and vitamin D.

### Treatment with corticosteroids and the risk of anastomotic leakage following lower gastrointestinal surgery: a literature survey [^112aKbjc]. Colorectal Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

Background Anastomotic leakage is a serious complication in colorectal surgery. Treatment with corticosteroids is known to impair wound healing but their effect on the healing of a colorectal anastomosis remains unclear, and studies have reported conflicting results. Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the current evidence regarding the effect of corticosteroids on the risk of anastomotic leakage following colorectal surgery.

Method

Search strategy A systematic review was conducted following a search of PubMed and Embase. Selection criteria Inclusion criteria were studies published in English and involving humans. A minimum cohort of 50 patients was required and anastomoses involving the ileum, colon and rectum were included. Studies that investigated corticosteroids as a risk factor for anastomotic leakage were included regardless of the duration and the dose of corticosteroids. Data Collection and analysis A comparison was conducted between anastomotic leakage in noncorticosteroid- and corticosteroid-treated patients. The main outcome measure was the risk of anastomotic leakage.

Results

Twelve studies with a total of 9564 patients were included in the review. In total, 1034 patients received corticosteroids in the preoperative period, and 344 patients were diagnosed with anastomotic leakage, 70 of whom had received corticosteroids. Six of the 12 studies showed an increased risk for anastomotic leakage in the corticosteroid group. Overall, the anastomotic leakage rate was 6.77% (95% CI: 5.48–9.06) in the corticosteroid group and 3.26% (95% CI: 2.94–3.58) in the noncorticosteroid group.

Conclusion

Caution should be shown in patients scheduled for lower gastrointestinal surgery with anastomosis.

R 3.2 — We suggest that in patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and present with hemodynamic instability, vomiting, or diarrhea, the diagnosis of adrenal crisis should be considered irrespective of the glucocorticoid type, mode of administration, and dose; patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be treated with parenteral glucocorticoids and fluid resuscitation. (Good clinical practice)

Management of patients at risk of or with diagnosed glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency with suspected adrenal crisis or during exposure to stress.

Table 8.
Suggested glucocorticoid regimens in patients at risk of or with diagnosed glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency during exposure to stress

Rationale

Adrenal crisis (also known as acute adrenal insufficiency or Addisonian crisis) can occur in patients taking oral supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, if drug availability suddenly decreases (eg, missed doses, gastroenteritis). It is a life-threatening emergency that must be promptly recognized and treated. Therefore, timely therapy is essential and takes precedence over the evaluation for other causes of symptoms that are in accordance with adrenal crisis. Adrenal crisis is characterized by the inability of the adrenal cortex to produce enough cortisol to respond appropriately to stressors such as infections, trauma, and surgery (Table 9). The pathophysiology of adrenal crisis is complex and not fully understood, but it is invariably characterized by volume depletion and vasoplegia resulting in hypotension and — if left untreated — shock and eventually death. Adrenal crisis can occur not only in patients treated with oral glucocorticoids but also in patients receiving only inhaled, topical, intra-articular, or other glucocorticoid formulations. This highlights the potential clinical risks associated with the untoward systemic absorption of non-oral glucocorticoids. As mentioned above, adrenal crisis should be considered in patients in the period immediately following cessation of glucocorticoid therapy.

3 Prescribing oral corticosteroids in short courses may seem to be free from significant adverse effects; however, a large national data set of private insurance claims, which included approximately 1. 5 million people, showed that a short course of oral steroids was associated with an increased risk of sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and fracture in the five to 30 days after steroid initiation compared with those who had not received a short course of steroids. 1 The estimated number needed to harm after a short course of steroids was 140 for fracture, 454 for venous thromboembolism, and 1, 250 for sepsis. There are also case reports of avascular necrosis developing after even one course of systemic steroids. 4, 5 It is well understood that short-term systemic steroids can cause hyperglycemia, elevated blood pressure, immunocompromised state, mood and sleep disturbance, and fat necrosis when injected.

Acute Bronchitis Short-term systemic corticosteroids are often prescribed for patients with acute bronchitis. P = 0. 71). 18 However, patients receiving steroids had more adverse effects, including epigastric symptoms, mood changes, and hyperglycemia. 18 After that systematic review, an RCT identified 269 patients with acute lumbar radiculopathy attributable to a herniated disk; the patients were randomly prescribed prednisone or placebo. 30 In the other study, prednisolone may have helped with rash healing and acute pain at seven and 14 days but not beyond. 31 Neither study showed that steroids decreased the risk for postherpetic neuralgia. 32 Adverse effects of corticosteroids were reported, including gastrointestinal symptoms, and edema. Corticosteroids could potentially increase the risk of secondary bacterial skin infection, which is a possible complication of herpes zoster.

33, 34 Steroids should not be used without antivirals, may help decrease acute pain for zoster when used concomitantly with antivirals, and do not reduce the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia. Research is needed to determine whether there is a role for steroid use after antiviral therapy in those with recalcitrant symptoms. Given the lack of clear effectiveness for steroids and possible adverse effects, routine steroid use for zoster is not supported by evidence.

### Prediction of post-ESD esophageal stricture by a nomogram and risk factor analysis of ineffective oral steroids prophylaxis [^115pvotF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Esophageal cancer ranks seventh in terms of incidence (604,000 new cases) and sixth in mortality overall (544,000 deaths) in 2020 while Eastern Asia exhibits the highest regional incidence rates with a large burden in China. Superficial esophageal neoplasms (SENs) are being diagnosed increasingly frequently and endoscopic submucosal resection (ESD) is widely used as a therapeutic method for SENs providing excellent oncologic outcomes. However, esophageal stricture, as one of the major complications of esophageal ESD, severely impairs patients' quality of life.

Recent guidelines strongly recommend steroid management in patients with mucosal defects involving 3/4 or more of the circumference to prevent stenosis after ESD. Six studies have developed risk-scoring models for post-ESD esophageal stricture prediction. However, some of them did not include the use of steroids (local injection or oral administration) in the risk analysis. Therefore, the efficacy of risk ratings may be insufficient because it was not clarified whether the high risk predicted by these models should be treated by prophylactic steroids or surgery.

Risk factors of esophageal stricture under prophylactic steroids treatment were also explored by a few studies. It helped to determine which patients are suitable for steroid therapy or for whom surgical treatment is recommended. But most of them are focused on local triamcinolone injection and the sample size of patients with oral prednisolone is relatively small.

Glucocorticoid sensitivity is a new perspective that has not been explored in the post-ESD esophageal stricture formation until now. Glucocorticoids exert their action via intracellular glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and GR has two isoforms; while GRα is the predominant isoform, capable of binding to specific glucocorticoid response element (GRE) DNA sequences and inducing gene transcription, GRβ does not bind glucocorticoids and is transcriptionally inactive as a candidate for a dominant negative inhibitor of GRα activity, which may participate in defining the sensitivity of target tissues to glucocorticoids.

Here, we developed a nomogram based on the patients with ESD for esophageal superficial neoplasms, and the use of steroids was enrolled in the analysis. Meanwhile, the predictors of ineffective steroid prophylaxis were analyzed to aid in clinical decision-making. The association of GR expression and glucocorticoid response was explored in several pairs of patients.

### A different look at corticosteroids… [^1176iZBL]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

15 Once antibiotic therapy for PCP is initiated, a further deterioration in lung function often occurs, resulting from an increase in inflammation possibly resulting from the lysis of P. carinii organisms. Since the late 1980s, adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids has been documented in case reports and research studies with favorable clinical results, and it is currently endorsed by the National Institutes of Health as a standard therapy.
16. Documented benefits of corticosteroid therapy in patients with PCP include reduced morbidity and mortality, decreased need for mechanical ventilation assistance and a reduced long-term decline in pulmonary function or exercise tolerance. 16 In addition, studies suggest that steroids may decrease the severity of toxic side effects, such as fever and rash associated with the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, the primary anti-pneumocystis treatment.

15, 17 This benefit may enable the patient to complete the required course of antibiotic therapy. Progression of other opportunistic infections associated with HIV infection as a result of the immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids is a risk that must be considered. While some studies report only minor complications associated with steroid therapy, such as reactivation of localized herpetic lesions, 18 others have reported an increased incidence of infection and cancer. 15 Whether the development of these severe complications is due to effects of the steroids or to the increased longevity and survival rate of these severely immunocompromised patients is unknown.
15. Based on the benefits and risks of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy, the current recommendations are not intended for all patients but only for those with confirmed or suspected HIV and PCP infection who are at high risk of respiratory failure and death.

Patients at risk include those with an arterial oxygen pressure of less than 70 mm Hg or an arterial-alveolar gradient of more than 35 mm Hg. Further investigation is required to determine the appropriate use and benefits of steroid therapy when the patient has concomitant life-threatening infections and when the patient has already received more than three days of anti-pneumocystis therapy and has developed significant hypoxia. Perioperative use of corticosteroids has been advocated to reduce pain and decrease edema and trismus following oral surgical procedures. The most significant improvement occurs in the treatment of postoperative edema. Dosages of prednisone between 40 and 80 mg per day can be used. Maximal benefit has been achieved after third-molar extraction, although some benefit has been reported after other surgeries.

KDIGO 2022 — children with nephrotic syndrome — general principles include indications for kidney biopsy, genetic testing, vitamin D/calcium, and gastroprotection. Indication for kidney biopsy includes "Children presenting with nephrotic syndrome ≥ 12 years of age", "Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome or subsequent failure to respond to glucocorticoids in a steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (secondary steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome)", "A high index of suspicion of a different underlying pathology (macroscopic hematuria, systemic symptoms of vasculitis, hypocomplementemia, etc.)", and "At onset, kidney failure not related to hypovolemia. Subsequently, decreasing kidney function in children receiving calcineurin inhibitors or prolonged exposure to calcineurin inhibitors (2 to 3 years)". Genetic testing lists "Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome", "Congenital and infantile forms of nephrotic syndrome (< 1 year of age)", "Nephrotic syndrome associated with syndromic features", and "Family history of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis". For vitamin D/calcium, "In patients with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome and normal vitamin D levels, supplementation is not required", and "in frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome in children or in the presence of a known vitamin D deficiency, a reduction in bone mineral content can be prevented by oral supplementation with oral calcium and vitamin D". Under gastroprotection, "There is insufficient evidence of benefit to recommend prophylactic use of proton-pump inhibitors in children with nephrotic syndrome in the absence of risk factors for gastotoxicity or of gastric symptoms".

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^115JWA3C]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Aspirin for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) — evidence and bleeding risk: In adults < 40 years of age, there is insufficient evidence to judge the risk–benefit ratio of routine aspirin; although "routine use is not recommended in these settings", there is also insufficient evidence to comment on whether physicians might discuss prophylactic aspirin with adults < 40 years of age or > 70 years of age. As inferred from the first recommendation, there is "no justification for the routine administration of low-dose aspirin" among adults at low estimated ASCVD risk; in the ARRIVE trial the observed average 10-year ASCVD risk was < 10%, and "the overall benefits of prophylactic aspirin by intention-to-treat were negligible". Accumulated data "support avoiding prophylactic aspirin" when bleeding risk factors are present, including "a history of previous gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcer disease or bleeding at other sites, age > 70 years, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, chronic kidney disease (CKD)", and concurrent use of agents that increase bleeding risk such as "nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, direct oral anticoagulants, and warfarin".

Treatment-emergent adverse events

Two studies (n = 247) assessed the risk of treatment-emergent adverse events. The list of adverse events included (but was not limited to) hyperglycemia, hypertension, secondary infection, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, acute psychiatric illness requiring a consultation, an invasive procedure, or initiation of a specific therapy. The studies revealed a statistically significant increased risk of adverse events with oral steroid use versus no oral steroid (RR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.16–2.34; P = 0.006). There was low certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE (absolute risk effect was 174 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 43 more to 359 more).

Summary

Based on the five critical outcomes using RCT evidence and completion of the GRADE evidence table, the overall certainty of evidence was judged to be "low" and this certainty was assigned to the final recommendation as per GRADE guidance.

Committee discussion

The panel believed that maintenance oral steroid therapy has not been shown in clinical trials to improve clinical outcomes, and the available evidence suggests that chronic oral steroid therapy has a potential for harm. Two RCTs revealed an increased risk of adverse events with oral steroid use, suggesting excess adverse events (harms) in patients who are prescribed daily oral steroids. However, this recommendation was based on RCTs that had small sample sizes, a small number of events, short durations, and broad CIs around the point estimates. In addition, these studies occurred when there was a paucity of medications available for maintenance therapy. The quality of the underlying evidence was poor, and therefore the panel believed that a recommendation in favor of maintenance oral steroid use would be problematic given the concerns surrounding patient safety. The panel also believed that well-informed patients would place a greater value on avoiding the potential harms of adverse events and less value on the uncertain benefits of decreased dyspnea and hospital admissions.

After considering these issues and the low certainty of the evidence, the panel concluded that in patients with COPD and a history of severe and frequent exacerbations, the balance of benefits of maintenance oral steroid therapy did not outweigh the risks when compared with no steroid use. Given that the panel recommended against the intervention, issues related to feasibility, acceptability, and health equity were not discussed.

Steroids and steroid-related immune suppression — use in interventional pain procedures: In COVID-19-era practice, steroids may be used but should be administered at the lowest possible effective dose, and at this time there are no interventional risk reduction strategies specifically based on COVID-19; the systemic and immunosuppressive effects of injected steroids at the lowest effective dose would be considerably less than a three-to-five-day course of oral steroids, and for high-risk patients consideration should be given to the clinical presentation and diagnoses to determine if steroids should be used at all and whether the procedural risk is warranted, and it may also be worth considering performing the procedure in high-risk patients without steroids or with a reduced dose of steroids.

### Defining high bleeding risk in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^113pjAyX]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Long-Term Oral NSAID or Steroid Use

Long-term steroid or oral NSAID use (defined as planned daily intake for ≥ 4 d/wk) is considered a minor ARC-HBR criterion (Table 3).

NSAIDs represent the most widely used class of medications worldwide. Both oral NSAIDs and steroids are associated with increased gastrointestinal bleeding risk, which is dose-dependent and increases with long-term use. There is a paucity of data on bleeding risk in patients with long-term oral NSAID or steroid use after PCI because of underrepresentation or underreporting in randomized trials. Although long-term NSAID or steroid use was an inclusion criterion in both LEADERS FREE and ZEUS-HBR, this criterion was met in only 72 patients (2.8%) and 25 patients (3%), respectively. Moreover, their bleeding rates were not reported.

The risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding is higher with NSAID monotherapy compared with aspirin monotherapy, and concomitant use of NSAIDs and aspirin substantially further increases the risk. In the CONCERN trial (n = 514), patients with arthritis presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding on NSAIDs with a requirement for low-dose aspirin were randomized to celecoxib or naproxen (plus aspirin and esomeprazole) after confirmed ulcer healing. Recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (defined in the) rates were 5.6% and 12.3% at 18 months, respectively (HR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.23–0.82]; P = 0.008). In the CLASS study (Celecoxib Long-Term Arthritis Safety Study; n = 8059), patients with arthritis were randomized to celecoxib or either ibuprofen or diclofenac. In the subgroup of patients taking aspirin, the rates of symptomatic upper gastrointestinal ulcers or complications (bleeding, perforation, and obstruction) at 6 months were 4.7% and 6.0%, respectively (P = 0.49).

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — management and observed risks note that in patients with very high body weight, higher doses might be considered, identifiable triggers should be treated where possible, and short-term parenteral glucocorticoids are safe such that treatment should be initiated even if adrenal crisis is later ruled out; evidence on incidence is limited, some data suggest low risk during long-term glucocorticoids, one study reported higher adrenal crisis incidence precipitated by infections in about half of cases, a population-based study found increased manifestations of untreated adrenal insufficiency after discontinuation of long-term oral glucocorticoids with higher risk in those exposed to infections and in older individuals on higher and longer dosing, and another study found a sharp mortality increase in the first 3 to 6 months after cessation of long-term oral glucocorticoids.

General principles for children with nephrotic syndrome — practice point and figure content indicate that indications for kidney biopsy include children presenting with nephrotic syndrome ≥ 12 years of age; steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome or subsequent failure to respond to glucocorticoids in steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (secondary steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome); a high index of suspicion for a different underlying pathology (macroscopic hematuria, systemic symptoms of vasculitis, hypocomplementemia, etc); and at onset, kidney failure not related to hypovolemia with subsequent decreasing kidney function in children receiving calcineurin inhibitors or prolonged exposure to calcineurin inhibitors (2 to 3 years). Genetic testing is noted for steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome; congenital and infantile forms of nephrotic syndrome (< 1 year of age); nephrotic syndrome associated with syndromic features; and family history of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Vitamin D/calcium guidance states that in patients with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome and normal vitamin D levels, supplementation is not required, whereas in frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome in children or with known vitamin D deficiency, a reduction in bone mineral content can be prevented by oral supplementation with oral calcium and vitamin D. Gastroprotection states there is insufficient evidence of benefit to recommend prophylactic use of proton-pump inhibitors in children with nephrotic syndrome in the absence of risk factors for gastropathy or of gastric symptoms.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: overall risks and management. complementary roles for COX-2 inhibitors and proton pump inhibitors [^112EHFVw]. Gut (2003). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are well recognised as causing peptic ulceration and ulcer complications. However, several critical issues, including the amount of both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disease affected by NSAIDs, their interaction with ancillary risk factors, and how to optimise management in subgroups, remain poorly understood. In this article, strategies for subgroups that take account of non-specific gastrointestinal risks, minimisation of residual risk, and the importance of non-gastrointestinal toxicity are suggested, and areas for research identified.

Literature searches, evidence synthesis and grading of evidence

A literature search was undertaken by each subgroup with predefined search terms, electronic databases used (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and Medline) and the time period covered. Where appropriate, conference abstracts were used to help formulate recommendations, provided that these were of sufficient scientific rigour.

The PICOs were used to guide the search for evidence and the highest quality studies were prioritised. Systematic reviews or meta-analyses were selected initially. Where systematic reviews, meta-analyses or critically appraised articles were unavailable, lower levels of evidence were selected. Where reviews use poor-quality studies such as that by Spence et al, for example, where the review was based on small, often single-centre cohort studies resulting in high levels of heterogenicity, this is discussed in the evidence review and highlighted in the evidence tables. In this instance, more weight is given to larger studies using large databases, which are likely to be more accurate. This hierarchy of searching was performed in a pyramidal sequence from top (high quality) to bottom (low quality), cascading from recently published systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies, to RCTs, and subsequently to observational studies providing that no evidence is available from the higher quality categories. The selected evidence was tabulated in an evidence table categorising each study into the study design, intervention/clinical question, participants/population, reference standard, results and conclusions/comments.

Although randomised controlled studies are deemed the most appropriate type of study to assess the effectiveness of an intervention, other types of studies were included to assess types of effectiveness, such as ways of delivering service or outcomes from registries in clinical practice. If evidence from studies was weak or contradictory, searches for alternative sources were undertaken to see if the evidence concurred or contradicted (triangulation of searches). All available negative studies were included in the searches. The subgroups discussed the external validity of the studies and whether the study outcomes are applicable to the target population for the guidelines. Literature searches were transparent and reproducible to reduce 'dissemination biases'.

All evidence tables and references were downloaded to a shared reference manager (F1000Workspace), to which all GDG members had access. Shortly before the statements were finalised, a further literature search was undertaken. The quality of the evidence was assessed following the GRADE terminology using table 2. Evidence is graded as high, moderate, low and very low quality (table 2).

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^116PgqMj]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

The UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group (NOGG), advocates a more proactive approach(summarised in figure 3) than previous AIH guidelines to preserving bone health. Prior to starting steroids, they recommend calculating the 10-year risk of major osteoporotic fracture or 'FRAX' score, available online. The score is an algorithm incorporating parameters associated with fracture risk: age, gender, BMI, smoking, alcohol use, personal or parental fracture history, comorbidities such as rheumatoid arthritis and corticosteroid use.

Figure 3
Summary of suggested bone health strategy for patients on steroids.

The score has very high, high, intermediate and low-risk categories, all age-dependent. In very high- or high-risk patients, NOGG recommend starting bisphosphonates along with corticosteroids, rather than awaiting the DEXA scan result. Patients at intermediate risk should have a DEXA scan soon after starting corticosteroids. The scan result is then integrated to give a modified FRAX score. If there is delay (> 6 months) in performing a DEXA scan, proactive bisphosphonate should be considered. If the FRAX score is in the low-risk category, neither DEXA nor bisphosphonates are needed.

An alternative approach to bone health is detailed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Network, which uses QF fracture, another online fracture risk estimator.

It remains unclear how this proactive approach to bone protection can be incorporated into management of patients with AIH. Capacity will be centre-specific and additional resources/infrastructure might be required.

Before starting bisphosphonates, patients need advice about potential adverse effects. Intravenous preparations are preferred in patients with oesophageal varices and in those developing AEs with oral bisphosphonates.

Rare but serious AEs of bisphosphonates include osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ, 1 event per 10 000–100 000 patient-year, when given for osteoporosis)and atypical femoral fractures (AFF; 1.7-fold increase, one event per 30 000 patient-years). Over the first few years of bisphosphonate use, ONJ and AFF numbers are 10–100-fold lower than estimated number of fractures per year saved in high-risk patients. Thereafter, the relative advantages of bisphosphonates might diminish, underlying the importance of steroid withdrawal, when possible, with the potential for also stopping bisphosphonates.

Adrenal crisis prevention and stress dosing with current or recent glucocorticoid use — we recommend that patients who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should receive stress dose coverage when exposed to stress, with oral glucocorticoids used for minor stress without hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting/diarrhea and parenteral glucocorticoids for moderate to major stress, anesthesia, prolonged avoidance/inability of oral intake, or when there are signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting/diarrhea. Such patients under minor stress or local anesthesia will require coverage with stress doses of oral glucocorticoids, and the recommended stress dose is double the physiologic replacement dose (ie, hydrocortisone 40 mg daily).

5. WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS & ADVERSE REACTIONS

5.1 Risk of Serious Cardiovascular and Gastrointestinal Events

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use. NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can lead to new onset of hypertension, or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Avoid the use of diclofenac external in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac external is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. Avoid using NSAIDs within 14 days following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk for serious GI events. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

### Prediction of post-ESD esophageal stricture by a nomogram and risk factor analysis of ineffective oral steroids prophylaxis [^1168hciA]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and aims

Several risk models for esophageal stricture after endoscopic submucosal dissection have been developed. However, some of them did not include the use of steroids in the risk analysis. Glucocorticoid sensitivity mediated by glucocorticoid receptor expression has not been discussed in this condition.

Methods

Clinical and endoscopic characteristics were included in the logistic regression model to establish a nomogram for stenosis prediction. The score for each risk factor was estimated. Risk factors of ineffective oral steroid prophylaxis were analyzed and glucocorticoid receptor expressions were detected by immunohistochemistry.

Results

Three hundred fourteen patients of endoscopic submucosal dissection for esophageal superficial neoplasms were included to develop the nomogram. The circumferential range(≤ 3/4, 3/4–1 or the whole circumference), longitudinal diameter reached 4 cm (yes or not) and lesion location (the cervical and upper thoracic part, the middle thoracic part or the lower thoracic part) consisted of the nomogram. Patients have a high risk of esophageal stricture if they have a total point greater than 36. In the simplified risk score model, the corresponding cutoff score was 1. 92 patients with oral steroid prophylaxis were separately analyzed and the circumferential mucosal defect involving 7/8 or more was an independent risk factor of ineffective prevention (OR 12.2, 95%CI 5.27–28.11). The expression of glucocorticoid receptor β was higher in the stricture group (p = 0.042 for AOD; p = 0.016 for the scoring system).

Conclusions

We established a nomogram for esophageal stricture prediction. Depending on the characteristics of lesions, it is possible to estimate the risk of stricture under routine post-ESD treatments (no steroids or oral steroids). Alternative treatments should be considered if the risk is extremely high, especially for patients with mucosal defects involving 7/8 or more of circumference in which oral steroid treatment tends to be ineffective. The higher glucocorticoid receptor β may indicate potential glucocorticoid resistance.

### Mitigating GI risks associated with the use of NSAIDs [^114VXTG7]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have multiple established adverse effects on various organ systems. Among those associated with high mortality are gastrointestinal complications. We address the scope of the problem and the scientific basis for risk mitigation.

Design

This review covers the most successful of such strategies published to date.

Results

Mitigation strategies to enable ongoing anti-inflammatory benefit are well studied, albeit imperfect.

Conclusions

Such strategies may involve the choice of NSAID or the combined use of gastroprotective measures in association with NSAIDs.

### Corticosteroid use and mortality risk in patients with perforated colonic diverticular disease: a population-based cohort study [^1142B7Xv]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We examined mortality risks between corticosteroid users and non-users among patients with perforated diverticular disease. One-year mortality risk for current users of corticosteroids was 47.6%, double that of non-users after adjustment for confounders. One-year mortality risk was even higher for new corticosteroid users: 52.5%. Thus, corticosteroid use was clearly associated with an increased mortality risk for patients with perforated diverticular disease, continuing until at least 1 year after diagnosis, regardless of corticosteroid dose.

This is the first large cohort study comparing mortality risks between corticosteroid users and non-users among patients with perforated diverticular disease. The advantage of the cohort approach is the ability to calculate absolute mortality risks, which can inform clinical practice. Our study showed that corticosteroid use is a strong indicator for 1-year mortality. An earlier study of patients with perforated peptic ulcer disease reported a 30-day mortality ratio of 2.1 after corticosteroid use. This is in line with the increased mortality risk (adjusted HR of 1.96 for 30-day mortality) that we found among current users of systemic corticosteroids in the present study.

The following study limitations need to be taken into account in interpreting our results. Determination of exposure was based on redeemed prescriptions, which may not always coincide completely with medication taken by patients. We also did not consider use of corticosteroids for longer than a year before hospital admission. Also, since prednisolone and prednisone were the most frequently used systemic steroids (89%), the results in first line apply to this patient category; whether our results also apply to patients using steroids with high first pass metabolism needs further study. Finally, perforated diverticular disease may be misclassified, as the sensitivity of relevant ICD codes is not 100% accurate. Since misclassification is probably more likely in corticosteroid users (due to blinding of symptoms and severity of the condition), mortality risk is potentially overestimated if less severe cases in corticosteroid users go undetected. However, in analyses stratified by type of surgery, which most likely harmonises the diagnostic category, a similar increased risk was found.

### Glucocorticoid induced adrenal insufficiency [^116uT6rM]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Synthetic glucocorticoids are widely used for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions. A possible unwanted effect of glucocorticoid treatment is suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which can lead to adrenal insufficiency. Factors affecting the risk of glucocorticoid induced adrenal insufficiency (GI-AI) include the duration of glucocorticoid therapy, mode of administration, glucocorticoid dose and potency, concomitant drugs that interfere with glucocorticoid metabolism, and individual susceptibility. Patients with exogenous glucocorticoid use may develop features of Cushing's syndrome and, subsequently, glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome when the treatment is tapered down. Symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal can overlap with those of the underlying disorder, as well as of GI-AI. A careful approach to the glucocorticoid taper and appropriate patient counseling are needed to assure a successful taper. Glucocorticoid therapy should not be completely stopped until recovery of adrenal function is achieved. In this review, we discuss the factors affecting the risk of GI-AI, propose a regimen for the glucocorticoid taper, and make suggestions for assessment of adrenal function recovery. We also describe current gaps in the management of patients with GI-AI and make suggestions for an approach to the glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome, chronic management of glucocorticoid therapy, and education on GI-AI for patients and providers.

### Defining high bleeding risk in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: a consensus document from the academic research consortium for high bleeding risk [^1135fLto]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Long-term oral NSAID or steroid use

Long-term steroid or oral NSAID use (defined as planned daily intake for ≥ 4 d/wk) is considered a minor ARC-HBR criterion (Table 3).

NSAIDs represent the most widely used class of medications worldwide. Both oral NSAIDs and steroids are associated with increased gastrointestinal bleeding risk, which is dose-dependent and increases with long-term use. There is a paucity of data on bleeding risk in patients with long-term oral NSAID or steroid use after PCI because of underrepresentation or underreporting in randomized trials. Although long-term NSAID or steroid use was an inclusion criterion in both LEADERS FREE and ZEUS-HBR, this criterion was met in only 72 patients (2.8%) and 25 patients (3%), respectively. Moreover, their bleeding rates were not reported.

The risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding is higher with NSAID monotherapy compared with aspirin monotherapy, and concomitant use of NSAIDs and aspirin substantially further increases the risk. In the CONCERN trial (n = 514), patients with arthritis presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding on NSAIDs with a requirement for low-dose aspirin were randomized to celecoxib or naproxen (plus aspirin and esomeprazole) after confirmed ulcer healing. Recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (defined in the Appendix in the online-only Data Supplement) rates were 5.6% and 12.3% at 18 months, respectively (HR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.23–0.82]; P = 0.008). In the CLASS study (Celecoxib Long-Term Arthritis Safety Study; n = 8059), patients with arthritis were randomized to celecoxib or either ibuprofen or diclofenac. In the subgroup of patients taking aspirin, the rates of symptomatic upper gastrointestinal ulcers or complications (bleeding, perforation, and obstruction) at 6 months were 4.7% and 6.0%, respectively (P = 0.49).

Undesired effects of prescribed glucocorticoids related to dose and duration of treatment

The contribution of duration of GC treatment and its relationship with the development of side effects is also difficult to establish. Some studies have demonstrated harmful effects even after a single dose or brief treatment duration, and therefore clinicians will use therapeutic GCs in the lowest doses and for the shortest periods of time to achieve the desired therapeutic response.

Within this review, we discuss the clinical data that describes the breadth of adverse effects associated with GC therapy and explore the current and developing strategies to treat and limit adverse effects aiming to preserve the good and limit the bad.

Corticosteroids are one of the most frequently prescribed medications for the management of inflammatory bowel disease. While corticosteroids have a critical role for select cases for induction of remission, there is a notable risk of over-use and miss-use of corticosteroids. This narrative review updates the evolving use of corticosteroids in the management of inflammatory bowel disease. The review focuses on the appropriate use, route of administration and duration for the use of corticosteroids. Additionally, this review summarizes the side effects, use of steroids in special populations (e.g. geriatrics, pregnancy, underrepresented minorities), and their use in the peri-operative setting.

### Oral bisphosphonates as a cause of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws: clinical findings, assessment of risks, and preventive strategies [^113i4n1h]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Oral bisphosphonates are known to have potentially profound effects on oral health. A review of the evidence supporting answers to key clinical questions is necessary to assist surgeons in the care of their patients who are receiving oral bisphosphonates.

Materials and Methods

The literature is reviewed to address several questions, ie, what is the risk of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ) in my patient on oral bisphosphonates? Why are so few cases of BRONJ attributable to oral bisphosphonate use? What is the importance of cofactors in the development of osteonecrosis? How major a clinical problem is BRONJ, typically, in the oral bisphosphonate patient? What dental procedures are associated with a risk of BRONJ? Are other findings apart from BRONJ of importance in the oral bisphosphonate patient? Are there proven strategies to prevent BRONJ in the oral bisphosphonate patient? Should my patient discontinue the use of oral bisphosphonates temporarily or permanently?

Results

A review of the evidence offers information that will help in clinical decision-making. In general, the risk of BRONJ is between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 100,000, but may increase to 1 in 300 after dental extraction. The great majority of BRONJ cases will likely remain in the intravenous population. Cofactors have not been firmly established, although smoking, steroid use, anemia, hypoxemia, diabetes, infection, and immune deficiency may be important. Rarely does BRONJ in the oral bisphosphonate patient appear to progress beyond stage 2, and many cases reverse with discontinuation of oral medication. Extraction is the only dental procedure shown to increase the risk of BRONJ. Dental implant therapy should be used with caution in the oral bisphosphonate patient. The benefits and risks of oral bisphosphonate use must be weighed individually and in consultation with the prescribing physician, before determining the need for temporary or permanent cessation of medication.

Conclusion

Emerging evidence supports clinical decisions in favor of the oral and maxillofacial surgery patient taking oral bisphosphonates.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114DBJ9A]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Bleeding risk factors and aspirin dosing: The risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and hemorrhagic stroke, with or without aspirin use, increases with older age, and other risk factors include male sex, diabetes, history of gastrointestinal issues (such as peptic ulcer disease), liver disease, smoking, and elevated blood pressure; certain medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, and anticoagulants, increase the risk of bleeding. The benefits of aspirin for CVD prevention appear similar for low dose (≤ 100 mg/d) and for all doses studied in CVD prevention trials (50 to 500 mg/d), and a pragmatic approach would be to use 81 mg/d, which is the most commonly prescribed dose in the US.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114S22jn]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 — Acute lymphoblastic leukemia — steroid-associated acute toxicities and supportive measures notes that acute side effects of steroids may include hyperglycemia and steroid-induced diabetes mellitus, and patients should be monitored for glucose control to minimize the risk of developing infectious complications. Another acute side effect includes peptic ulceration and dyspeptic symptoms; the use of histamine-2 receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors should be considered during steroid therapy to reduce these risks. There may also be important drug interactions between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and methotrexate that need to be considered prior to initiation of methotrexate-based therapy. Although uncommon, high-dose corticosteroids can be associated with mood alterations, psychosis, and other neuropsychiatric complications; in this context, consider anti-psychotics, and if no response, dose reductions may be required.

### Prediction of post-ESD esophageal stricture by a nomogram and risk factor analysis of ineffective oral steroids prophylaxis [^1141ZxrB]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Several risk models for esophageal stricture after endoscopic submucosal dissection have been developed. However, some of them did not include the use of steroids in the risk analysis. Glucocorticoid sensitivity mediated by glucocorticoid receptor expression has not been discussed in this condition.

Methods

Clinical and endoscopic characteristics were included in the logistic regression model to establish a nomogram for stenosis prediction. The score for each risk factor was estimated. Risk factors of ineffective oral steroid prophylaxis were analyzed and glucocorticoid receptor expressions were detected by immunohistochemistry.

Results

Three hundred fourteen patients of endoscopic submucosal dissection for esophageal superficial neoplasms were included to develop the nomogram. The circumferential range(≤ 3/4, 3/4–1 or the whole circumference), longitudinal diameter reached 4 cm (yes or not) and lesion location (the cervical and upper thoracic part, the middle thoracic part or the lower thoracic part) consisted of the nomogram. Patients have a high risk of esophageal stricture if they have a total point greater than 36. In the simplified risk score model, the corresponding cutoff score was 1. 92 patients with oral steroid prophylaxis were separately analyzed and the circumferential mucosal defect involving 7/8 or more was an independent risk factor of ineffective prevention (OR 12.2, 95%CI 5.27–28.11). The expression of glucocorticoid receptor β was higher in the stricture group (p = 0.042 for AOD; p = 0.016 for the scoring system).

Conclusions

We established a nomogram for esophageal stricture prediction. Depending on the characteristics of lesions, it is possible to estimate the risk of stricture under routine post-ESD treatments (no steroids or oral steroids). Alternative treatments should be considered if the risk is extremely high, especially for patients with mucosal defects involving 7/8 or more of circumference in which oral steroid treatment tends to be ineffective. The higher glucocorticoid receptor β may indicate potential glucocorticoid resistance.

### Risk of uncomplicated peptic ulcer disease in a cohort of new users of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events [^112mqKbF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Overall, current use of NSAIDs (selective cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2] inhibitors and traditional NSAIDs) was associated with a significantly increased risk of uncomplicated PUD (adjusted OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.06–2.13). When considered separately, the association was significant for COX-2 inhibitors (adjusted OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.13–4.79) but was not for traditional NSAIDs (adjusted OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.93–1.99). Current use of oral steroids and current use of paracetamol were also associated with an increased risk of PUD (adjusted OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.09–3.25 and adjusted OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.08–1.95, respectively) (Table 3). An association between acid-suppressing drugs and uncomplicated PUD was observed: current users of PPIs and current users of histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H 2 RAs) were significantly more likely to have uncomplicated PUD than non-users of these drugs (adjusted OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.26–2.25 and adjusted OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.34–3.82, respectively). When current users of PPI therapy were divided into subgroups, current use of PPI therapy initiated more than 30 days after the start date was significantly associated with an increased risk of uncomplicated PUD (adjusted OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.65–3.42), whereas current use of PPI intitiated before the start date or within the 30 days after the start date was not significantly associated (adjusted OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.86–1.80).

### Risk of uncomplicated peptic ulcer disease in a cohort of new users of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events [^113tSL1c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Few epidemiological studies have investigated risk factors for uncomplicated PUD separately from risk factors for complicated PUD, particularly in a population of new users of ASA. The overall incidence of uncomplicated PUD in this population was 1.41 per 1000 person-years and was higher than the incidence calculated for the general population. A similar incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding was observed in the same cohort of new users of ASA (1.12 per 1000 person-years).

Our results indicate that the development of uncomplicated PUD in new users of low-dose ASA for the prevention of cardiovascular events was associated with social deprivation, a history of PUD, smoking, stress, depression, anaemia and use of NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors and oral steroids. This was in line with the risk factors for uncomplicated PUD observed in the general population. Many of the risk factors for uncomplicated PUD identified in this study have also been demonstrated to increase the risk of complications of PUD in the general population; previous studies have reported an increased risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding associated with smoking, use of NSAIDs, use of COX-2 inhibitors and use of high doses of oral steroids.

### Hydrocortisone sodium succinate [^116hvHbN]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General:

The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual.

Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.

Cardio-renal:

As sodium retention with resultant edema and potassium loss may occur in patients receiving corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency.

Endocrine:

Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients. Changes in thyroid status of the patient may necessitate adjustment in dosage.

Gastrointestinal:

Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and non-specific ulcerative colitis, since they may increase the risk of a perforation. Signs of peritoneal irritation following gastrointestinal perforation in patients receiving corticosteroids may be minimal or absent.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^114GwpLX]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — aspirin risk stratification and age cautions — Prior U.S. guidelines recommended prophylactic aspirin only in the setting of elevated ASCVD risk, for example using risk estimators like the PCE or specific ASCVD risk factors, and historical meta-regression shows observed ASCVD risk tracks reasonably well with baseline-estimated ASCVD risk, whereas observed bleeding risk on aspirin is less well correlated. Scenarios associated with increased bleeding risk include a history of previous gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcer disease or bleeding from other sites, age > 70 years, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, CKD, and concurrent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, direct oral anticoagulants, and warfarin. Post hoc analysis of older trials suggests the benefit–risk ratio for prophylactic aspirin generally becomes more favorable at > 10% estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, but prophylactic aspirin in primary-prevention adults > 70 years of age is potentially harmful and difficult to justify for routine use.

### Strategies to optimize treatment with NSAIDs in patients at risk for gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse events [^113ASFbB]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

NSAIDs, including cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, are among the most widely prescribed medications worldwide. However, NSAIDs have been associated with gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. The cardiovascular (CV) toxicity associated with COX-2 inhibitors and some other NSAIDs further complicates the choice of therapy.

Objective

The aim of this commentary was to appraise current NSAID treatment strategies and provide clinicians with guidance on the GI and CV risks of these strategies and choosing an appropriate treatment in individual patients.

Methods

A literature search of PubMed was conducted (1989-August 2009) to gather relevant studies, meta-analyses, reviews, and treatment guidelines using the following terms, either alone or in combination: NSAID, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, toxicity, gastroprotection, proton pump inhibitor, COX-2 inhibitor, aspirin, fixed-dose combination, and adherence.

Results

Based on the data from the literature search, gastroprotective strategies (eg, proton pump inhibitors [PPIs]) are underused in patients at risk for NSAIDrelated GI complications, including in those patients most at risk. Risk factors for GI toxicity with NSAID use include high NSAID dose, a history of NSAID-associated GI adverse events or the presence of upper GI symptoms, advanced age, corticosteroid use, concurrent aspirin use, and certain comorbidities (eg, rheumatoid arthritis). Risk factors for CV toxicity with NSAID use include established CV disease or an estimated 10-year CV risk > 20%. Findings from randomized controlled trials have suggested that, in patients with an increased risk for GI complications, the use of a nonselective NSAID with a PPI may be at least as effective as the use of a COX-2 selective inhibitor in preventing the recurrence of ulcer complications. In patients with a high GI risk and a moderate CV risk, the use of a COX-2 inhibitor with a PPI may be appropriate.

Conclusions

The choice of NSAID should be tailored to the GI and CV risks in the patient. The risk profile can be affected by numerous factors, including NSAID dosing and concurrent aspirin use. Thus, individualized risk stratification should be the clinician's primary consideration when selecting treatment.

### Prasterone and ibuprofen (prastera) [^112TBDvD]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal Effects-Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including ibuprofen tablets, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1%of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2–4%of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients treated with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Stress hyperglycaemia is a transiently raised blood glucose concentration in people not known previously to have diabetes mellitus. It occurs most frequently in people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, including, but not limited to: people living with obesity; a previous history of gestational diabetes mellitus; a family history of diabetes mellitus; long‐term glucocorticoid use; age > 40 y; or people of South Asian ancestry. People who develop stress hyperglycaemia have more adverse peri‐operative outcomes than those with diabetes mellitus. People not known to have diabetes mellitus but who develop hyperglycaemia do not have their glucose tested as frequently as those with diabetes mellitus, nor is intervention started despite poor glycaemic control. Thus, people using a GLP‐1RA for obesity are at risk of stress hyperglycaemia and should have regular capillary glucose measurements with prompt intervention, should hyperglycaemia occur. The impact that GLP‐1RA use, or of cessation and recommencement of GLP‐1 RAs in people with obesity on the risk of developing stress hyperglycaemia, remains unclear.

Given the complexities highlighted, recommendations on pre‐operative timing of cessation alone are probably not sufficient to manage peri‐operative risk in patients receiving anaesthesia for procedures (Box 1). However, the interplay between variables, risk factors and patient outcomes is complex.

Box 1
Recommendations for the peri‐operative management of patients taking glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists and glucose‐dependent insulinotropic peptide.

The risk of pulmonary aspiration and mitigation strategies should be discussed with the patient using a shared decision‐making approach.
Patients should continue to take glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists throughout the peri‐operative period.
Patients and clinicians should adhere to recommended fasting guidelines.
Upper gastrointestinal symptoms alone should not be used to determine gastric content.
Regional anaesthesia should be considered as the primary anaesthetic technique, if appropriate.
Point‐of‐care gastric ultrasound should be considered before induction of anaesthesia to facilitate risk stratification, if appropriate.
Individualised pulmonary aspiration risk assessment should be completed, accounting for drug, patient and procedural factors.
Anaesthesia and airway management should aim to reduce the risk of pulmonary aspiration on induction of anaesthesia, during maintenance and after emergence of anaesthesia. This could include: administering prokinetics; using a tracheal tube; modified rapid sequence intubation (with or without cricoid force, depending on local practice); head‐up position for induction of anaesthesia; potential use of gastric tubes to empty the stomach before induction of anaesthesia and tracheal extubation; and awake tracheal extubation.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in chronic pain: implications of new data for clinical practice [^113vm5uH]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs

Potential GI side effects of NSAID therapy are a concern for physicians. Traditionally, adverse upper-GI-tract effects have been the focus, but there is increasing recognition that lower-GI complications are also an important issue.–Infection with Helicobacter pylori is also relevant and may be more common in some populations.– H. pylori infection increases the risk of GI complications during NSAID therapy, and eradication of H. pylori prior to commencing long-term antiplatelet therapy is recommended to reduce GI risk.

Other risk factors for upper-GI-tract complications during NSAID therapy include older age (≥ 60 years), history of dyspepsia, concomitant use of corticosteroids and/or oral anticoagulants, and a history of peptic ulcer bleeding. In the last few decades, mortality rates in patients with NSAID-associated upper-GI bleed or perforation have increased. Serious GI complications necessitating emergency surgery or hospitalization can occur without prior symptoms. Approximately 60%–80% of arthritis patients hospitalized or requiring surgery for serious GI complications during NSAID therapy report no previous GI symptoms. This highlights the need for a proactive approach to risk management, given that lack of symptoms makes it difficult to intervene before GI events become life-threatening.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^115vQVvb]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Since symptoms are not a reliable indicator of mucosal damage, it is important to identify factors that predict the risk of GI events in NSAID users. The risk factors for upper GI bleeding (UGIB) associated with NSAID use have been well defined by several studies. Among them, the most important are prior history of complicated ulcer and age. Older age is common in NSAID users and those aged above 65 years carry a risk similar to those with a history of PU. Advancing age increases the risk by about 4% per year, probably because of the presence of other associated risk factors. The presence of multiple risk factors greatly increases the risk of GI complications. The role of H. pylori infection in patients taking NSAIDs and the potential benefit of eradication on upper GI risk in infected NSAID users has been controversial. However, eradication of associated H. pylori infection is beneficial when starting treatment with NSAIDs or aspirin, especially in the presence of an ulcer history.

An often forgotten risk factor for upper GI complications is represented by drug combinations with NSAIDs. While the role of steroids, antiplatelet drugs, and anticoagulants is long known, the synergistic effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has until recently been overlooked. Over the past 15 years, several epidemiologic studies, summarized by three recent meta-analyses, have shown an association between SSRI use and the occurrence of UGIB, and found that this risk is further increased among patients, who concomitantly use NSAIDs and/or hold H. pylori infection, while it is lowered by concomitant PPI intake. The most plausible mechanisms underlying this detrimental effect include a marked decrease in serotonin platelet content, with consequent impairment of platelet aggregation in response to injury and prolongation of bleeding time as well as an increase in gastric acid secretion, with potential ulcerogenic activity. When given with NSAIDs, SSRIs may inhibit their metabolism, raising their blood levels and – through impairment of the hemostasis – may promote more severe bleeding. Since the concomitant use of both these drugs results in a significantly higher risk of UGIB than either drug alone, this combination should be avoided whenever possible and, if unavoidable, adequate gastroprotection should be adopted from the very beginning.

### Widespread use of proton pump inhibitors or potassium-competitive acid blocker has changed the status of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with ischemic heart disease: real-world data from high volume centers [^113aUagj]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding upper gastrointestinal bleeding, the diseases varied widely. Mallory–Weiss syndrome and gastric polyp bleeding were probably caused by antithrombotic medications, which exacerbated the bleeding tendency. Recent studies have shown that anticoagulant use is a risk factor for post-endoscopic submucosal dissection bleeding, whereas age is not a significant factor. One case of gastric ulcer occurred; however, insufficient acid suppression was not considered because 10 mg of vonoprazan was approximately two times as effective in inhibiting acid secretion as regular PPI. These appear to be a combination of various adverse conditions of steroid-induced intractable mucosal injury. Although the number of cases in this study was relatively small to be definitive, patients taking steroids might also experience peptic ulcers even when taking 10 mg of vonoprazan, indicating that PPIs or PCAB alone may have poor efficacy in some patients.

Twenty-two of the patients who did not have gastrointestinal bleeding were not taking PPI/PCAB medication, and nine of them had HBR. Previous studies reported that the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding is reduced to 30% when clopidogrel is combined with a PPI. Lué et al. revealed that PPIs should be administered to patients taking LDA to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding, although this may increase the risk of small intestinal bleeding (particularly LDA-induced small intestinal mucosal injury). Several effective medications for LDA-induced small intestinal mucosal injury are available. Fortunately, gastrointestinal bleeding did not occur in these 22 patients, and PPI/PCAB should have been taken. Although lower gastrointestinal bleeding was more common in this present case, we do not believe that PPIs or PCAB pose a risk for lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Previous reports have indicated that the risk factors for lower gastrointestinal bleeding include age, NSAID, LDA, clopidogrel, and warfarin, whereas the presence or type of PPI is not a risk factor. The rate of PPI use in patients with lower gastrointestinal bleeding was only 26.8%. Therefore, we believe that the high incidence of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in our study was not caused by an increase in the number of lower gastrointestinal bleeding cases due to PPI/PCAB but by a relative increase in lower gastrointestinal bleeding as PPI/PCAB decreased the number of upper gastrointestinal bleeding cases.

### Risk of uncomplicated peptic ulcer disease in a cohort of new users of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events [^1134DSp5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Among the risk factors identified in our study, a history of PUD has been shown by other investigators to increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in ASA users. The use of drugs such as NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors and oral steroids has also been shown to increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in users of ASA. In a similar population of new ASA users, patients using NSAIDs were almost three times more likely to develop upper gastrointestinal bleeding than non-users of NSAIDs. This is higher than the observed risk for uncomplicated PUD in the current study, and may suggest that some cases of PUD remain undiagnosed until complications occur.

Current use of acid-suppressing therapy (PPIs or H 2 RAs) was associated with an increased risk of developing uncomplicated PUD in new ASA users. A similar association between the use of PPIs and an increased risk of PUD recurrence was observed in Finland. In our study, the association between PPIs and uncomplicated PUD was mainly observed for a subgroup of individuals whose PPI therapy started more than 30 days after their first ASA prescription. In contrast, no increased risk was observed for individuals whose PPI therapy had been started before or at the same time as their first ASA prescription. In line with observations from others, this association is likely to be explained by confounding by indication. PPIs prescribed at some point after initiating ASA therapy might be a marker of developing upper gastrointestinal symptoms during ASA therapy in patients who may be at greater background ulcer risk than individuals not starting PPI therapy during their follow-up. Similarly, the increased risk of uncomplicated PUD observed in current users of H 2 RAs is likely due to confounding by indication, whereby H 2 RAs are prescribed to treat the symptoms of uncomplicated PUD.

### How to run a multiple sclerosis relapse clinic [^114GF6Vx]. Practical Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Oral corticosteroids have the advantages of being more convenient for patients, less expensive and less demanding of healthcare resources. However, intravenous corticosteroids can be safely given in the home setting, reducing cost and improving patients' experience of relapse management compared with treatment in hospital. Current NICE guidelines recommend treating acute relapses of MS with oral methylprednisolone 500 mg daily for 5 days and reserving intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3–5 days for patients who have not tolerated or responded to oral methylprednisolone or those who require admission to hospital.

Patients receiving high-dose corticosteroids require counselling about the common side effects, including headache, mood disturbance, gastrointestinal upset, fatigue, insomnia, metallic taste and rash. Although pulsed methylprednisolone probably does not increase the risk of osteoporosis, it is worth considering the rare but serious complication of avascular osteonecrosis. The overall risk of this in patients receiving corticosteroid treatment is 3–25%. The risk varies with underlying disease and dosing regimen. Two large series documenting pulsed corticosteroid use in MS suggested that the short-term risk of symptomatic avascular osteonecrosis is less than 1%. However, the risk appears to be cumulative; a separate study found MRI evidence of avascular osteonecrosis in up to 15% of patients with MS who had frequent courses of pulsed corticosteroids. Patients with a clinical history of indigestion or peptic ulcer disease may benefit from a short course of proton-pump inhibitor, although the risk of peptic ulcer disease from corticosteroids is probably negligible unless the patient also takes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Clinicians should also be cautious when treating patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension and those with coexisting infection. There is no evidence regarding the most appropriate means to screen for infection, but guidance suggests that patients with MS relapse should have body temperature and urine dipstick routinely checked. Patients with symptoms of infection need a more focused examination and investigations and in most cases, their infection should be treated before they start corticosteroids. There is useful guidance for administering corticosteroids in patients with an isolated positive urine dipstick.

5.2.8.5 Other metabolic complications of corticosteroids

Good Practice Recommendation 19. Patients on prolonged corticosteroids should have blood pressure, glycaemic control and serum potassium monitored. They should receive vaccinations as for those on immunomodulatory therapy (Agreement: 82.6%).

Before starting oral corticosteroid therapy for 3 months or longer or repeating oral steroids within 6 months of a previous course, record height, weight, blood pressure, full blood count, fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c and lipids. Blood pressure and BMI should be measured at every clinic visit. For patients with dyslipidaemia or a raised cardiovascular risk at initiation, repeat a lipid profile 1 month after initiation and then every 3–6 months. Monitor fasting glucose or HbA1c every 3 months. An annual examination by an ophthalmologist is required for patients with symptoms of cataracts, a personal or family history of open angle glaucoma, diabetes mellitus, high myopia or connective tissue disease (particularly rheumatoid arthritis). Mood disturbance such as depression or sleep disturbance should be questioned at every clinic visit. Steroids may exacerbate the potassium-lowering effects of thiazide or loop diuretics, and potassium should be monitored. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head is a serious complication of prolonged steroid use, and if hip pain develops should be considered, and if suspected urgent MRI is recommended along with cessation of steroids. Patients on long-term steroids should be vaccinated as for those on immunosuppressive therapy (see Section 5.2.1.3: Common Disease Considerations, Immunosuppressive therapy, Vaccination).

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^115BVyy5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Post-discharge management

For patients with lesions identified on endoscopy, it is recommended they be started on an oral anti-secretory agent. PPIs are the pharmacologic agent of choice in these patients; H 2 RAs are generally regarded as inadequate. This was demonstrated most recently by an excellent publication by Ng et al in 2010. 130 patients who experienced dyspepsia or bleeding while taking acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and were found to have peptic ulcers or multiple erosions at endoscopy were randomized to receive either famotidine 40 mg twice daily or pantoprazole 20 mg once daily (with evening placebo) for 7 weeks. All patients remained on ASA (160 mg daily), and were treated for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection if this was present. Patients on pantoprazole experienced significantly fewer symptoms from ulcers or erosions and, most importantly, significantly fewer bleeding episodes.

Practice guidelines recommend the use of PPI for all patients with previous ulcer bleeding who require treatment with any non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). They make particular note that the use of clopidogrel alone presents a greater risk for rebleeding than does the use of ASA combined with a PPI.

Many patients who experience upper GI bleeding are already taking or will eventually require treatment with ASA. While ASA is a known risk factor for the development of peptic ulcer disease, many patients should be taking ASA for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. As weighing the risks of bleeding versus coronary artery disease can be difficult, Sung et al recently performed a single-center, non-inferiority double blind RCT in Hong Kong wherein they randomized 156 patients who developed peptic ulcer bleeding while prescribed ASA to restart (immediately after endoscopic hemostasis) taking ASA 80 mg daily over 8 weeks or switch to placebo for 8 weeks. All patients were given daily omeprazole. Patients taking ASA had a non-significant increase in the rate of rebleeding, but also a significantly lower all-cause mortality rate (HR 0.2, 95% CI 0.05–0.90). This lends more credibility to the idea that ASA should be resumed in patients even after experiencing a bleeding ulcer. It would be useful if future studies compare less extreme strategies (e.g. restarting ASA immediately or 2 days after endoscopic hemostasis versus restarting in 7 days).

Regarding specific circumstances for corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to patients with immune thrombocytopenia (fracture risk assessment), BSH 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain a DEXA and femoral neck bone mineral density testing (entered into FRAX) in patients at intermediate risk to define high or low risk. Consider making decisions in patients receiving a short corticosteroid regimen (≤ 12 weeks) clinically, particularly when a DEXA result is unlikely to be available during treatment, as not all patients require bone-protective treatment.

### Corticosteroid use and mortality risk in patients with perforated colonic diverticular disease: a population-based cohort study [^111XR3eK]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abdominal surgical procedures

In total, 2497 (53.8%) of 4640 patients had a diverticulitis-related surgical procedure (table 1). The percentage of patients with surgery within 30 days before or after incident perforated diverticular disease was higher among systemic corticosteroid users (62.9%) compared with users of inhalation corticosteroids only (56.6%) and non-users (52.1%). Patients using systemic corticosteroids had a surgical procedure resulting in a stoma (33.8%) more often than patients not using corticosteroids (22.6%).

Within categories of surgery (explorative surgery including lavage, stoma, resection with primary anastomosis), mortality risk was increased when comparing current users to non-users. After explorative surgery, mortality risk after 1 year was 14.8% for non-users and 43.5% for current users (adjusted HR 1.12 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.83)). For patients who received a stoma, mortality risk after 1 year was 26.5% for non-users and 48.8% for current users (adjusted HR 1.37 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.82)). After a resection with primary anastomosis, mortality risk after 1 year was 15.2% for non-users and 54.1% for current users (adjusted HR 2.88 (95% CI 1.57 to 5.28)).

Subgroup and sensitivity analyses

The mortality risk among patients currently using systemic corticosteroids only (13.9% after 7 days and 48.0% after 1 year) was comparable to that among patients using systemic corticosteroids regardless of other corticosteroid use (figure 2). Compared with non-users, patients who currently used only inhaled corticosteroids also had an increased mortality risk (6.2% after 7 days and 22.3% after 1 year), with an adjusted HR ranging from 1.44 to 1.85 (table 4).

Cumulative mortality in patients with systemic use of corticosteroids only.

When we excluded patients with malignancies, inflammatory bowel disease, a previous code for diverticular disease, or rheumatic diseases including mixed connective tissue disease, the results of the analysis of current users of systemic corticosteroids regardless of use of other corticosteroids did not materially change for mortality risk after 7, 30, 90 days or 1 year.
