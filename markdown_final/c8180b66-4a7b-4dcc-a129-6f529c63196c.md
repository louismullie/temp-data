## Question

What is the treatment duration for Bactrim to treat Haemophilus Influenzae upper respiratory infection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate treatment duration for Bactrim (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) in Haemophilus influenzae upper respiratory infections, and whether TMP-SMX is even appropriate empirically given resistance patterns. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "upper respiratory infection" encompasses and whether antibiotics are indicated at all. Then, I should verify which upper respiratory syndromes are actually caused by H. influenzae and whether TMP-SMX is recommended for those entities. Next, I will check contemporary resistance data and guideline positions on TMP-SMX for these syndromes. After that, I need to review duration recommendations for each relevant condition and reconcile any discrepancies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation with caveats for special populations and close with a clear bottom line.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities involved. "Upper respiratory infection" in this context typically includes acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, acute otitis media, and sometimes acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis; however, the latter is more accurately a lower respiratory tract process even though it often presents with upper respiratory symptoms, so I should be careful not to conflate categories. H. influenzae is a common pathogen in ABRS and AOM, and a frequent cause of AECB, so the question is clinically meaningful if we specify the syndrome rather than use "URI" generically [^116EmD3D] [^113LDeQ3] [^116MfTZj].

> Wait, let me verify whether antibiotics are even indicated for these upper respiratory syndromes before discussing duration. For uncomplicated viral URIs, antibiotics are not recommended; for ABRS, antibiotics are reserved for patients meeting bacterial diagnostic criteria or with persistent or severe symptoms; for AOM, observation without immediate antibiotics is appropriate in selected children; for AECB, antibiotics are advised only when clinically indicated by increased dyspnea, sputum volume, or sputum purulence. So, I need to ensure we are not overgeneralizing antibiotic use to all URIs, which would be inappropriate [^116EmD3D] [^117W6Ztp] [^116MfTZj].

> Next, I should review whether TMP-SMX is an appropriate empiric choice for these H. influenzae–associated syndromes. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — guidelines have moved away from TMP-SMX for ABRS and AOM due to resistance. The 2025 AAO-HNS adult sinusitis guideline explicitly does not recommend TMP-SMX for initial ABRS therapy because resistance among S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae is too high, and the 2012 IDSA ABRS guideline similarly advised against TMP-SMX empirically. For AOM, contemporary pediatric guidance prioritizes amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate, with TMP-SMX reserved as a nonpreferred alternative in specific contexts, reflecting resistance concerns and inferior bacteriologic outcomes in older studies [^116EmD3D] [^113DZ39o] [^117RDWL8] [^116SRDgE].

> I need to check the resistance data to quantify the concern. TMP-SMX resistance among respiratory isolates of H. influenzae is commonly reported in the 20–30% range in North America, with some surveillance showing approximately 27% resistance, and higher rates reported internationally; importantly, β-lactamase production is widespread in nontypeable H. influenzae, and there are also BLNAR strains, which further complicate empiric choices. Mechanistically, resistance involves mutations in folA and folP and acquisition of sul genes, and susceptibility testing nuances can misclassify some isolates if inappropriate media or breakpoints are used, reinforcing the empiric caution with TMP-SMX for respiratory infections [^116EmD3D] [^116LjMpi] [^1118YMQy].

> Now, regarding duration, I should confirm what the labels and guidelines say for the syndromes where TMP-SMX has been used historically. For acute otitis media in children, the FDA-labeled pediatric regimen is TMP-SMX 8 mg/kg trimethoprim plus 40 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole per day divided every 12 hours for 10 days; however, hold on, I should verify whether shorter courses are acceptable in older children — AAP suggests 10 days for children under 2 years, 7 days for ages 2–5 with mild to moderate disease, and 5–7 days for children 6 years and older, so a uniform 10-day TMP-SMX course is conservative and may be longer than necessary in older children. For acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, high-quality guidelines recommend 5–7 days for adults and 10–14 days for children, and they do not endorse TMP-SMX as first-line. For AECB, FDA labeling lists 14 days of TMP-SMX, but more recent stewardship-focused guidance supports 5 days for most patients who are clinically improving, reflecting the broader "shorter is better" evidence base in respiratory infections [^113ZJWLa] [^1135fz6j] [^11618bS1] [^111jEgvb] [^112hvETt] [^112fdQqB] [^1115KrVP].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought TMP-SMX might be reasonable for a 5–7 day "short course" approach across URIs based on general stewardship principles, but I should double-check that assumption against resistance realities and guideline positions. The IDSA sinusitis guideline explicitly advises against TMP-SMX empirically due to resistance, and the AAO-HNS update likewise removes TMP-SMX from recommended initial therapy for ABRS; for AOM, TMP-SMX is not preferred and showed high bacteriologic failure in older efficacy studies; for AECB, although 5-day therapy is supported by evidence, TMP-SMX is not a contemporary first-line choice given resistance and better alternatives. So, my initial inclination to generalize a 5–7 day TMP-SMX course to "URIs due to H. influenzae" was off and needs correction toward syndrome-specific, non–TMP-SMX regimens when antibiotics are truly indicated [^113DZ39o] [^116EmD3D] [^117RDWL8] [^116SRDgE] [^112fdQqB].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer while keeping the syndrome front and center. If, despite resistance concerns, TMP-SMX is used for pediatric acute otitis media — typically as a second-line alternative when amoxicillin is not suitable — then the labeled pediatric duration is 10 days, acknowledging that 7 days may suffice in children 2–5 years and 5–7 days in children 6 years and older with mild to moderate disease. If TMP-SMX were considered for adult acute bacterial rhinosinusitis — which is not recommended — duration would be 5–7 days for adults, but preferred agents are amoxicillin-clavulanate or doxycycline, not TMP-SMX. For acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, FDA labeling specifies 14 days of TMP-SMX, yet contemporary guidance supports 5 days for most patients when clinically improving, and again TMP-SMX is not a preferred empiric agent due to resistance. Across all of these, I need to ensure antibiotics are reserved for patients who meet bacterial diagnostic criteria or have persistent or severe symptoms, and that local susceptibility data guide any empiric selection [^113ZJWLa] [^1135fz6j] [^11618bS1] [^112fdQqB].

> I should confirm special populations and caveats. In pregnancy, TMP-SMX is generally avoided in the first trimester due to teratogenic risk and near term because of kernicterus risk, so it should not be selected for URIs in pregnancy. In patients with significant renal impairment, TMP-SMX requires dose adjustment and may be contraindicated depending on severity. In children under 2 months, TMP-SMX is contraindicated. For immunocompromised hosts, TMP-SMX is used for Pneumocystis prophylaxis, but that is distinct from treating routine upper respiratory bacterial infections and should not be extrapolated to URI therapy duration decisions [^112psvoK] [^113ZJWLa] [^1141auqE].

> Bottom line, I need to be precise. TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric treatment of H. influenzae upper respiratory infections such as ABRS or AOM due to substantial resistance, and it is not a preferred agent for AECB despite historical labeling. If, in select circumstances, TMP-SMX is used for pediatric AOM, the labeled duration is 10 days, with shorter validated courses acceptable by age and severity; if it were used for adult ABRS, 5–7 days would align with guideline durations, but it should not be first-line; for AECB, labeling lists 14 days, yet 5 days is supported by modern evidence when patients improve clinically. Therefore, there is no single "TMP-SMX duration for H. influenzae URI"; duration must follow the syndrome-specific guideline and local resistance patterns, and in most cases, alternative agents will be preferable to TMP-SMX [^116EmD3D] [^11618bS1] [^1135fz6j] [^112fdQqB] [^113ZJWLa].

Bactrim (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) is **not recommended for empiric treatment** of Haemophilus influenzae upper respiratory infections due to high resistance rates (about 27–40%) [^113DZ39o] [^116EmD3D]. If susceptibility is confirmed, a typical course is **5–7 days** for adults and 7–10 days for children, adjusted to clinical response and severity. For acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, 5–7 days is sufficient in adults [^11618bS1] [^111jEgvb]; for acute otitis media in children, 7–10 days is standard [^1135fz6j]. Always confirm susceptibility before use and consider alternatives if resistance is likely [^111hGs5u].

---

## Clinical indications for Bactrim in H. influenzae infections

Bactrim is indicated for certain H. influenzae infections, including:

- **Acute otitis media (AOM)**: Pediatric patients with susceptible strains [^111hGs5u].
- **Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB)**: Adults with susceptible strains [^111PQgfk].
- **Sinusitis**: Only if susceptibility is confirmed due to resistance concerns [^notfound].

---

## Recommended duration of Bactrim therapy

The duration of Bactrim therapy for H. influenzae upper respiratory infections **varies by clinical condition**, patient age, and severity:

| **Clinical condition** | **Recommended duration** | **Patient population** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute otitis media (AOM) | 7–10 days | Children |
| Acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) | 5–7 days | Adults |
| Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) | 7–14 days | Adults |

---

These durations are supported by clinical guidelines and studies emphasizing **shorter effective courses** to minimize resistance and adverse effects [^1115KrVP] [^112fdQqB].

---

## Factors influencing duration of therapy

Several factors **influence the appropriate duration** of Bactrim therapy:

- **Patient age**: Children typically require longer courses (7–10 days) than adults (5–7 days).
- **Severity of infection**: More severe infections may necessitate longer treatment durations.
- **Clinical response**: Therapy should be individualized based on patient response and resolution of symptoms.
- **Susceptibility testing**: Results should guide therapy duration and antibiotic selection [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting recommended durations

Recent studies and guidelines support **shorter antibiotic courses** (5–7 days) for upper respiratory infections, including those caused by H. influenzae. Shorter courses are effective, reduce adverse effects, and help limit resistance development [^113J62JG] [^11618bS1].

---

## Resistance considerations

H. influenzae resistance to Bactrim is a significant concern, with resistance rates approximately 27–40% [^113DZ39o]. Empiric use is **not recommended** unless susceptibility is confirmed. Alternative antibiotics, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate or fluoroquinolones, may be preferred in cases of confirmed resistance [^1171i37K].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different durations

Clinical outcomes with shorter courses (5–7 days) are **comparable to longer courses (10–14 days)** for upper respiratory infections. Shorter courses are associated with fewer adverse effects, improved adherence, and reduced resistance development [^1115KrVP] [^112fdQqB].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Longer courses (7–10 days) are recommended for AOM and other pediatric upper respiratory infections [^1135fz6j] [^116NUwQa].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Therapy may need to be extended based on clinical judgment and response.
- **Pregnant women**: Bactrim is generally avoided during pregnancy due to potential fetal risks.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring of **clinical response** is essential. If there is no improvement within 48–72 hours, reassess the diagnosis, consider resistance, and adjust therapy accordingly [^117Go1ag].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Empiric use**: Not recommended due to high resistance rates.
- **Confirmed susceptibility**: Use Bactrim for 5–7 days in adults and 7–10 days in children.
- **Clinical response**: Adjust duration based on patient response and severity.
- **Alternative antibiotics**: Consider amoxicillin-clavulanate or fluoroquinolones if resistance is confirmed.

---

Bactrim is **not recommended for empiric treatment** of H. influenzae upper respiratory infections due to resistance. If susceptibility is confirmed, treat for 5–7 days in adults and 7–10 days in children, adjusting based on clinical response and severity.

WHO recommendations for early antimicrobial treatment of childhood pneumonia have been effective in reducing childhood mortality, but the last major revision was over 10 years ago. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance, new pneumonia pathogens, and new drugs have prompted WHO to assemble an international panel to review the literature on childhood pneumonia and to develop evidence-based recommendations for the empirical treatment of non-severe pneumonia among children managed by first-level health providers. Treatment should target the bacterial causes most likely to lead to severe disease, including Streptoccocus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The best first-line agent is amoxicillin, given twice daily for 3–5 days, although co-trimoxazole may be an alternative in some settings. Treatment failure should be defined in a child who develops signs warranting immediate referral or who does not have a decrease in respiratory rate after 48–72 h of therapy. If failure occurs, and no indication for immediate referral exists, possible explanations for failure should be systematically determined, including non-adherence to therapy and alternative diagnoses. If failure of the first-line agent remains a possible explanation, suitable second-line agents include high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with or without an affordable macrolide for children over 3 years of age.

### Guidelines for the use of antibiotics in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^117W6Ztp]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

To help physicians with the appropriate use of antibiotics in children and adults with upper respiratory tract infection, a multidisciplinary team evaluated existing guidelines and summarized key practice points. Acute otitis media in children should be diagnosed only if there is abrupt onset, signs of middle ear effusion, and symptoms of inflammation. A period of observation without immediate use of antibiotics is an option for certain children. In patients with sinus infection, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be diagnosed and treated with antibiotics only if symptoms have not improved after 10 days or have worsened after five to seven days. In patients with sore throat, a diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis generally requires confirmation with rapid antigen testing, although other guidelines allow for empiric therapy if a validated clinical rule suggests a high likelihood of infection. Acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults should not be treated with antibiotics; delayed prescriptions may help ease patient fears and simultaneously reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics.

### Antibiotic courses for common infections… [^112fdQqB]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In patients with COPD exacerbations, antibiotic courses should be limited to five days.
- In patients with community-acquired pneumonia, the initial antibiotic course should be limited to five days with follow-up before completion of the course.
- For women with uncomplicated bacterial cystitis, taking nitrofurantoin for five days, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for three days, or a single dose of fosfomycin is effective.
- In patients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis, taking a fluoroquinolone for five to seven days is the most effective empiric treatment. From the AFP Editors. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Antibiotic courses of five days are as effective as longer courses based on a meta-analysis of studies enrolling more than 10, 000 patients. This is the lower course recommendation of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, which recommends five to seven days.

Community-Acquired Pneumonia In patients with community-acquired pneumonia, initial antibiotic courses should be limited to five days with monitoring for signs of improvement. Antibiotic therapy should be extended for ongoing vital sign abnormalities, inability to eat, or concerns with mentation. This recommendation does not apply to patients who are immunocompromised. In a meta-analysis of 21 studies, an antibiotic course of six days or less is as effective as a longer course while still reducing mortality and serious adverse events. Recommended antibiotics for healthy adults include amoxicillin, doxycycline, and azithromycin, which target the common pathogens. Escherichia coli, which accounts for 75% of all bacterial cystitis. Fluoroquinolones are not recommended for empiric treatment because of their higher adverse effect profile and growing resistance of Enterobacteriaceae.

In patients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis, five- to seven-day courses of fluoroquinolones are recommended. Shorter courses of fluoroquinolones are as effective as longer courses in women and men with pyelonephritis, so a five-day course works as well as a 10-day course. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should be avoided for empiric therapy in pyelonephritis because of resistance in nearly 20% of infections.

### Antibiotic use in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^1138EQug]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Upper respiratory tract infections account for millions of visits to family physicians each year in the United States. Although warranted in some cases, antibiotics are greatly overused. This article outlines the guidelines and indications for appropriate antibiotic use for common upper respiratory infections. Early antibiotic treatment may be indicated in patients with acute otitis media, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, epiglottitis, or bronchitis caused by pertussis. Persistent cases of rhinosinusitis may necessitate the use of antibiotics if symptoms persist beyond a period of observation. Antibiotics should not be considered in patients with the common cold or laryngitis. Judicious, evidence-based use of antibiotics will help contain costs and prevent adverse effects and drug resistance.

### Sulfatrim [^116vctXN]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

In vitro studies have shown that bacterial resistance develops more slowly with both sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim in combination than with either sulfamethoxazole or trimethoprim alone.

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim have been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section.

Aerobic gram-positive microorganisms:

Streptococcus pneumoniae

Aerobic gram-negative microorganisms:

Escherichia coli (including susceptible enterotoxigenic strains implicated in traveler's diarrhea)

Klebsiella species

Enterobacter species

Haemophilus influenzae

Morganella morganii

Proteus mirabilis

Proteus vulgaris

Shigella flexneri

Shigella sonnei

Other Organisms:

Pneumocystis carinii

Susceptibility Testing Methods:

Dilution Techniques:

Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method4 (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria:

For testing Enterobacteriaceae:

MIC (μg/mL) Interpretation

≤ 2/38 Susceptible (S)

≥ 4/76 Resistant (R)

When testing either Haemophilus influenzaea or Streptococcus pneumoniaeb:

MIC (μg/mL) Interpretationb

≤ 0.5/9.5 Susceptible (S)

1/19–2/38 Intermediate (I)

≥ 4/76 Resistant (R)

a. These interpretative standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility tests with Haemophilus influenzae using Haemophilus Test Medium (HTM).4

### Shorter and longer courses of antibiotics for common infections and the association with reductions of infection-related complications including hospital admissions [^117MZ3ck]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The most commonly prescribed antibiotic was amoxicillin for RTIs. Interestingly, the dose increased with duration from 5 to 6 or 7 days. However, the most commonly prescribed antibiotic for 8–15 days was phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) or doxycycline and frequently issued as an oral suspension. Trimethoprim was most commonly prescribed for UTIs (Supplementary Table 4).

Examining events that occurred in the first few days of follow-up, patients who received longer antibiotic prescription durations had greater risk of developing an infection-related complication compared to patients who received the shortest prescription (HR: 1.40 [CI: 1.29–1.52] and HR: 1.74 [CI: 1.52–1.99], respectively) (Table 3). This effect was also true when stratified by infection. Patients with increased comorbidity were also more likely to experience an infection-related hospitalization in the first 5 days of the treatment overall (Charlson Moderate HR: 1.42 [CI: 1.26–1.60]; High HR: 1.61 [CI: 1.35–1.92], Very High HR: 1.91 [CI: 1.49–2.44]; Supplementary Table 5). This increased risk of hospitalization with increasing comorbidity severity was also true for each infection and was greatest for UTIs (Charlson Moderate HR: 2.59 [CI: 1.45–4.63]), suggesting some difference in underlying patient health and choice of treatment strategy. Patients with a low BMI, currently smoking, or who had an outpatient's referral or hospital admission in the previous 12 months were also at greater risk of complication, whereas being female or having had an influenza vaccination in the previous 12 months was protective (Supplementary Table 5).

Risk of bias in studies and heterogeneity assessment

The risk of bias was assessed based on the study design for the outcome of resistance, not the original study design for the outcome of efficacy. The overall risk of bias was low, although bias due to selective reporting was uncertain for most RCTs because resistance was often not nominated as an outcome and there was an unclear risk of bias for the outcome measurement in the cohort studies (Fig. 2). We were not able to test for publication bias for the examined outcomes because of the very low number of studies in each funnel plot (Fig. 8 in the Appendix). There was considerable variation in the heterogeneity between studies, particularly for the cohort studies (Figs. 3, 4 and 5).

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^111vE9pW]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Supplemental Table XIII — prescribing information for dapsone for acne vulgaris details topical use, dosing, efficacy, safety, interactions, and special populations. Indication is "Topical treatment of acne vulgaris". Dosing states "Apply approximately a pea-sized amount, in a thin layer to the acne affected area, twice daily", with duration guidance "If there is no improvement after 12 weeks, treatment should be reassessed". Contraindications are "None". Efficacy notes "In clinical trials, 35–42% of patients using topical dapsone were successfully treated (using the Global Acne Assessment Score)". Reported adverse effects/toxicities include "Oiliness, peeling, dryness, erythema, burning, pruritus, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory infection, sinusitis, influenza, pharyngitis, cough, joint sprain, headache, suicide attempt, depression, psychosis, tonic clonic movements, abdominal pain, severe vomiting, and pancreatitis". Drug interactions list "Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, topical benzoyl peroxide, rifampin, anticonvulsants, St John's wort, and folic acid antagonists". Other issues state "Some subjects with glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency developed changes suggestive of mild hemolysis. Observe for signs and symptoms of hemolysis, peripheral neuropathy, and skin reactions". Pregnancy category is "C". Nursing guidance states, "It is known that dapsone is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for oral dapsone to cause adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue use". Pediatric use cautions that "Safety and efficacy was not studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age".

### Antimicrobial resistance in Haemophilus influenzae: how can we prevent the inevitable? Commentary on antimicrobial resistance in H. influenzae based on data from the TARGETed surveillance program [^116Bjd34]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Haemophilus influenzae is an important cause of respiratory tract infections, particularly in elderly persons. It is the major bacterial pathogen in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) and also causes otitis media and sinusitis. In many cases, treatment is empiric, and there is a lack of understanding of resistance issues with this bacterium. There is little understanding of the epidemiology of H. influenzae respiratory infections, although some strains may be replaced by new strains that cause more severe infections. There is almost no information on how these bacteria may spread in the community. Ampicillin resistance is significant (it may be > 30%), and there are few oral agents capable of reducing organism burden. There is little understanding of the epidemiology of H. influenzae respiratory infections, and almost no information on how these bacteria may spread in the community. Recent evidence suggests that these bacteria may behave in a similar way to Streptococcus pneumoniae. If that proves correct, then it will be important to follow these organisms in the community to determine if resistance determinants may spread more widely than we have thus far believed. The implications for treatment, infection prevention and control, and public health should not be underestimated as it has been with other organisms such as S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Bactrim DS) [^111PQgfk]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets and other antibacterial drugs, BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy.

Urinary Tract Infections

For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination.

Acute Otitis Media

For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when in the judgment of the physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents. To date, there are limited data on the safety of repeated use of BACTRIM in pediatric patients under two years of age. BACTRIM is not indicated for prophylactic or prolonged administration in otitis media at any age.

Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis in Adults

For the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when a physician deems that BACTRIM could offer some advantage over the use of a single antimicrobial agent.

Shigellosis

For the treatment of enteritis caused by susceptible strains of Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei when antibacterial therapy is indicated.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^111f9mKR]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The importance of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties for correct dosing of antibiotics

Craig et al. refined the concept of the importance of the time above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for beta-lactam antibiotics, which refers to the duration of time that serum levels of the antibiotic remain above the MIC at the site of infection. They suggested that for penicillins, this parameter or index should reach at least 50% of the dosing interval to ensure treatment effectiveness. For antibiotics like fluoroquinolones, the optimal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index is the area under the curve above the MIC (AUC/MIC ratio).

In a recent randomised clinical trial concerning phenoxymethylpenicillin treatment of streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis it was shown that a short course of higher doses of penicillin V, taken four times daily for five days, was non-inferior in clinical outcome to the standard dose taken thrice daily for 10 days. This fits with the above concept that penicillin V due to its relatively short serum elimination half-life should be dosed at least every 6 h to secure a time > MIC of at least 50%. Optimising the bacterial kill also shortens the duration of treatment needed for effect. The optimised dosing regimen concurrently reduces selection of resistance.

### Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim (sulfamethox-TMP DS) [^112Ug4CR]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets and other antibacterial drugs, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy.

Urinary Tract Infections: For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination.

Acute Otitis Media: For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when in the judgment of the physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents. To date, there are limited data on the safety of repeated use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets in pediatric patients under two years of age. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets are not indicated for prophylactic or prolonged administration in otitis media at any age.

Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis in Adults: For the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when a physician deems that sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim could offer some advantage over the use of a single antimicrobial agent.

Shigellosis: For the treatment of enteritis caused by susceptible strains of Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei when antibacterial therapy is indicated.

Pneumocystis jiroveci Pneumonia: For the treatment of documented Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and for prophylaxis against P. jiroveci pneumonia in individuals who are immunosuppressed and considered to be at an increased risk of developing P. jiroveci pneumonia.

Traveler's Diarrhea in Adults: For the treatment of traveler's diarrhea due to susceptible strains of enterotoxigenic E. coli.

### Clinical overview of Haemophilus influenzae disease… [^113LDeQ3]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points Haemophilus influenzaecan cause infections ranging from minor to serious, even deadly.
- Chemoprophylaxis and vaccination are recommended to prevent one type of H. influenzaedisease — type b or Hib.
- While other H. influenzaedisease are uncommon, they've been increasing in recent years.
- Stay up to date on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention recommendations. Cause H. influenzae are gram-negative bacteria. They can be encapsulated or unencapsulated. The 6 encapsulated serotypes are designated a through f. Nontypeable H. influenzae Nontypeable H. influenzae commonly cause acute otitis media and sinusitis episodes in children. They commonly cause bronchitis in adults. Nontypeable H. influenzae can also cause invasive disease in people of all ages. Prevention Chemoprophylaxis CDC recommends chemoprophylaxis for close contacts of Hib cases.

CDC doesn't have similar guidelines for other types of H. influenzae disease. Vaccination Hib vaccine is a routine U. S. childhood vaccination. Keep ReadingHib Vaccine Recommendations There are no vaccines for non-b or nontypeable H. influenzae disease. Diagnosis Diagnosis of invasive disease caused by H. influenzae is based on clinical presentation and laboratory tests. These tests can include culture and nucleic acid amplification by a validated assay. Treatment and recovery For treatment guidelines, see the H. influenzae chapter of the Red Book. Complications Between 3% to 6% of Hib cases in children are fatal. People 65 years or older with invasive H. influenzae disease have higher case-fatality ratios than children. Up to 20% of patients who survive Hib meningitis have permanent hearing loss or other long-term neurological sequelae. Haemophilus influenzaedisease in adults ≥ 65 years, United States, 2011.

### Late effects of blood and marrow transplantation [^1162tDKj]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Infectious diseases

All HCT survivors have some degree of immunodeficiency, particularly during the first year after HCT. If patients are able to stop immunosuppressive medications without GvHD or recurrent disease, many recover adequate immune function by one year after HCT. Patients with chronic GvHD, however, remain immunodeficient and have a high risk of infections. Common late infections are caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii, encapsulated bacteria, fungi, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus, and respiratory viruses. Patients may report more frequent episodes of upper respiratory infections and sinusitis.

All patients should receive prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii for at least one year after HCT or until 3–6 months after all immunosuppressive medication is discontinued, whichever occurs later. The preferred drug is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, but dapsone or atovaquone could be substituted for patients who are allergic to or intolerant of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

In particular, patients with chronic GvHD are highly susceptible to encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis due to low levels of opsonizing antibodies, low CD4 + T-cell counts, poor reticuloendothelial function and suppressive effects of immunosuppressive medications on phagocytosis. Vaccination against these bacteria is recommended. Efficacy of vaccination in increasing antibody levels has been shown in several prospective studies. Chemoprophylaxis is always recommended due to the unpredictable protection provided by vaccination. The first-line drug is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, but if it is not tolerated, penicillin or azithromycin is substituted until 3–6 months after discontinuation of all immunosuppressive medications.

Invasive fungal infection occurs in 1% of patients after autologous HCT and in 6%–8% of patients after allogeneic HCT. GvHD and long-term use of corticosteroids have been a major risk factor associated with onset of invasive fungal infection. As recommended in the European guidelines, mold prophylaxis with posaconazole or voriconazole may be considered for patients with GvHD requiring high-dose corticosteroid treatment.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Sulfatrim) [^113Zhkm2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Geriatric Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of sulfamethoxazole 800 mg and trimethoprim 160 mg were studied in 6 geriatric subjects (mean age: 78.6 years) and 6 young healthy subjects (mean age: 29.3 years) using a non-U.S. approved formulation. Pharmacokinetic values for sulfamethoxazole in geriatric subjects were similar to those observed in young adult subjects. The mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was significantly lowered in geriatric subjects compared with young adult subjects (19 mL/h/kg vs. 55 mL/h/kg). However, after normalizing by body weight, the apparent total body clearance of trimethoprim was an average 19% lower in geriatric subjects compared with young adult subjects.3

Microbiology

Sulfamethoxazole inhibits bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by competing with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Trimethoprim blocks the production of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolic acid by binding to and reversibly inhibiting the required enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase. Thus, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim blocks two consecutive steps in the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins essential to many bacteria.

In vitro studies have shown that bacterial resistance develops more slowly with both sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim in combination than with either sulfamethoxazole or trimethoprim alone.

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim have been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section.

Aerobic gram-positive microorganisms:

Streptococcus pneumoniae

Aerobic gram-negative microorganisms:

Escherichis coli (including susceptible enterotoxigenic strains implicated in traveler's diarrhea)

### Durations of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media and variability in prescribed durations across two large academic health systems [^112HrX2y]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Amoxicillin is the recommended antibiotic for most children who have not had AOM in the prior 30 days, but we observed only 70% of antibiotic prescriptions at index encounters for AOM were for amoxicillin. This is in the range of prior studies using commercial insurance claims databases where 57–71% of patients were prescribed amoxicillin. Notably, 16% of antibiotic prescriptions in our cohort were for cefdinir. This may in part be a response to reported beta-lactam allergies, present in 11% of encounters. However, it is known that over 90% of children with a reported allergy are able to tolerate the antibiotic. A study among children enrolled in Kentucky Medicaid found similarly high rates of cefdinir prescribing for AOM, with 27–30% of all cefdinir prescriptions having an indication of AOM. Cefdinir is a broader-spectrum antibiotic than amoxicillin, and based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, oral cephalosporins are unlikely to achieve sufficiently high levels in middle ear fluid to effectively treat most pneumococcal ear infections. Rising rates of cefdinir use for common outpatient infections are concerning and, therefore, represent a target for future stewardship interventions.

### Immediate versus delayed versus no antibiotics for respiratory infections [^1113PHUr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Concerns exist regarding antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) owing to adverse reactions, cost and antibacterial resistance. One proposed strategy to reduce antibiotic prescribing is to provide prescriptions, but to advise delay in antibiotic use with the expectation that symptoms will resolve first. This is an update of a Cochrane Review originally published in 2007, and updated in 2010, 2013 and 2017.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects on duration and/or severity of clinical outcomes (pain, malaise, fever, cough and rhinorrhoea), antibiotic use, antibiotic resistance and patient satisfaction of advising a delayed prescription of antibiotics in respiratory tract infections.

Search Methods

From May 2017 until 20 August 2022, this was a living systematic review with monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 20 August 2022. Due to the abundance of evidence supporting the review's key findings, it ceased being a living systematic review on 21 August 2022.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials involving participants of all ages with an RTI, where delayed antibiotics were compared to immediate or no antibiotics. We defined a delayed antibiotic as advice to delay the filling of an antibiotic prescription by at least 48 hours. We considered all RTIs regardless of whether antibiotics were recommended or not.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

For this 2022 update, we added one new trial enrolling 448 children (436 analysed) with uncomplicated acute RTIs. Overall, this review includes 12 studies with a total of 3968 participants, of which data from 3750 are available for analysis. These 12 studies involved acute RTIs including acute otitis media (three studies), streptococcal pharyngitis (three studies), cough (two studies), sore throat (one study), common cold (one study) and a variety of RTIs (two studies). Six studies involved only children, two only adults and four included both adults and children. Six studies were conducted in primary care, four in paediatric clinics and two in emergency departments. Studies were well reported and appeared to provide moderate-certainty evidence. Randomisation was not adequately described in two trials. Four trials blinded the outcome assessor, and three included blinding of participants and doctors. We conducted meta-analyses for pain, malaise, fever, adverse effects, antibiotic use and patient satisfaction. Cough (four studies): we found no differences amongst delayed, immediate and no prescribed antibiotics for clinical outcomes in any of the four studies. Sore throat (six studies): for the outcome of fever with sore throat, four of the six studies favoured immediate antibiotics, and two found no difference. For the outcome of pain related to sore throat, two studies favoured immediate antibiotics, and four found no difference. Two studies compared delayed antibiotics with no antibiotic for sore throat, and found no difference in clinical outcomes. Acute otitis media (four studies): two studies compared immediate with delayed antibiotics - one found no difference for fever, and the other favoured immediate antibiotics for pain and malaise severity on Day 3. Two studies compared delayed with no antibiotics: one found no difference for pain and fever severity on Day 3, and the other found no difference for the number of children with fever on Day 3. Common cold (two studies): neither study found differences for clinical outcomes between delayed and immediate antibiotic groups. One study found delayed antibiotics were probably favoured over no antibiotics for pain, fever and cough duration (moderate-certainty evidence).

Adverse Effects

there were either no differences for adverse effects or results may have favoured delayed over immediate antibiotics with no significant differences in complication rates (low-certainty evidence). Antibiotic use: delayed antibiotics probably resulted in a reduction in antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics (odds ratio (OR) 0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.07; 8 studies, 2257 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). However, a delayed antibiotic was probably more likely to result in reported antibiotic use than no antibiotics (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.69 to 3.75; 5 studies, 1529 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Patient satisfaction: patient satisfaction probably favoured delayed over no antibiotics (OR 1.45, 1.08 to 1.96; 5 studies, 1523 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was probably no difference in patient satisfaction between delayed and immediate antibiotics (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.29; 7 studies, 1927 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No studies evaluated antibiotic resistance. Reconsultation rates and use of alternative medicines were similar for delayed, immediate and no antibiotic strategies. In one of the four studies reporting use of alternative medicines, less paracetamol was used in the immediate group compared to the delayed group.

Authors' Conclusions

For many clinical outcomes, there were no differences between prescribing strategies. Symptoms for acute otitis media and sore throat were modestly improved by immediate antibiotics compared with delayed antibiotics. There were no differences in complication rates. Delaying prescribing did not result in significantly different levels of patient satisfaction compared with immediate provision of antibiotics (86% versus 91%; moderate-certainty evidence). However, delay was favoured over no antibiotics (87% versus 82%). Delayed antibiotics achieved lower rates of antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics (30% versus 93%). The strategy of no antibiotics further reduced antibiotic use compared to delaying prescription for antibiotics (13% versus 27%). Delayed antibiotics for people with acute respiratory infection reduced antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics, but was not shown to be different to no antibiotics in terms of symptom control and disease complications. Where clinicians feel it is safe not to prescribe antibiotics immediately for people with RTIs, no antibiotics with advice to return if symptoms do not resolve is likely to result in the least antibiotic use while maintaining similar patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes to delayed antibiotics. Where clinicians are not confident in not prescribing antibiotics, delayed antibiotics may be an acceptable compromise in place of immediate prescribing to significantly reduce unnecessary antibiotic use for RTIs, while maintaining patient safety and satisfaction levels. Further research into antibiotic prescribing strategies for RTIs may best be focused on identifying patient groups at high risk of disease complications, enhancing doctors' communication with patients to maintain satisfaction, ways of increasing doctors' confidence to not prescribe antibiotics for RTIs, and policy measures to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing for RTIs.

### Haemophilus influenzae type b as an important cause of culture-positive acute otitis media in young children in Thailand: a tympanocentesis-based, multi-center, cross-sectional study [^1145fy2C]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

The distribution of S. pneumoniae serotypes was similar to what has been reported in the literature prior to PCV introduction. The generally mild profile of AOM experienced by the children in our study may explain the slightly higher than expected proportion of M. catarrhalis isolates, as this pathogen is often associated with milder disease.

Due to the risk of treatment failures, up-to-date information on antibiotic resistance has important clinical implications for determining the best approach for treatment of AOM. Our results show high levels of resistance of S. pneumoniae to some antibiotics commonly given in Thailand for respiratory infections (Azithromycin, Cefuroxime, Erythromycin, Tetracycline, Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole), and a high level of multidrug resistance. This was consistent with results from another study in Asian countries, which also noted a high level of resistance to macrolides. In our study only a low rate of cefotaxime non-susceptibility was seen, likely due to the fact that cephalosporins are generally only prescribed for children presenting with severe illness (moderate to severe otalgia or fever of 39°C) at first visit or for patients who do not respond to initial treatment. Antibiotic resistance was less common for H. influenzae, and was similar to previously published estimates, though our isolates had lower levels of resistance to chloramphenicol (10% versus 25%) and ampicillin (15% versus 48%). It is possible that more severe AOM cases than were seen in this study would be enriched for more resistant AOM.

### Assessment of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole susceptibility testing methods for fastidious Haemophilus spp [^1118YMQy]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare the determinants of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance with established susceptibility values for fastidious Haemophilus spp., to provide recommendations for optimal trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole measurement.

Methods

We collected 50 strains each of Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae at Bellvitge University Hospital. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole susceptibility was tested by microdilution, E-test and disc diffusion using both Mueller-Hinton fastidious (MH-F) medium and Haemophilus test medium (HTM) following EUCAST and CLSI criteria, respectively. Mutations in folA, folP and additional determinants of resistance were identified in whole-genome-sequenced isolates.

Results

Strains presented generally higher rates of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance when grown on HTM than on MH-F, independent of the methodology used (average MIC 2.6-fold higher in H. influenzae and 1.2-fold higher in H. parainfluenzae). The main resistance-related determinants were as follows: I95L and F154S/V in folA; 3- and 15-bp insertions and substitutions in folP; acquisition of sul genes; and FolA overproduction potentially linked to mutations in -35 and -10 promoter motifs. Of note, 2 of 19 H. influenzae strains (10.5%) and 9 of 33 H. parainfluenzae strains (27.3%) with mutations and assigned as resistant by microdilution were inaccurately considered susceptible by disc diffusion. This misinterpretation was resolved by raising the clinical resistance breakpoint of the EUCAST guidelines to ≤ 30 mm.

Conclusions

Given the routine use of disc diffusion, a significant number of strains could potentially be miscategorized as susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole despite having resistance-related mutations. A simple modification to the current clinical resistance breakpoint given by the EUCAST guideline for MH-F ensures correct interpretation and correlation with the reference standard method of microdilution.

### Clinical efficacy of newer agents in short-duration therapy for community-acquired pneumonia [^111prQpn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most important respiratory tract pathogen implicated in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), is becoming increasingly resistant in vitro to the beta -lactams and macrolides, and fluoroquinolone resistance has been detected. A growing body of evidence suggests that prolonged antimicrobial use may contribute directly and indirectly to increased antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Long-term exposure to antimicrobial agents, especially less-potent agents, directly increases selection pressure for resistance. Indirectly, poor patient compliance, multiple daily dosing, and the increased risk of adverse events further complicate the resistance issue and diminish the efficacy of long-term antimicrobial use. Controlled clinical trials addressing the appropriate duration of therapy for CAP are lacking. However, available data suggest that with appropriate antibiotic selection, based on appropriate spectrum, potency, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, lower respiratory tract infections in outpatients can be successfully treated in < 7 days rather than the 7–14 days currently recommended.

When restricting to antibiotic prescriptions beyond the recommended durations, the median number of days beyond the guideline recommendation was 2 (5th-95th centile 2–3 days) for acute cough and bronchitis, 2 (2–8) days for acute otitis media, and 3 (1–7) days for acute sinusitis. This was 7 (3–8) days for cellulitis (using seven days as threshold), and for acute cystitis 4 (2–4) days for females and 7 (3–32) days for males. In general, the tendency was to write prescriptions with a duration of five or seven days or multiples thereof (fig 1 and supplementary figs S1-S8). The peak at seven days, however, tended to be higher than for five days, even for conditions where a duration of five days is recommended. For conditions where guidelines recommend longer durations, the percentage of prescriptions beyond the recommendation was substantially lower than for conditions where guidelines recommend a relatively short duration.

For respiratory tract indications the total number of days of prescribed antibiotics beyond the recommended duration (approximately 1.1 million excess days in total) comprised a substantial proportion of the total number of days of antibiotics prescribed for these indications — for example, 29.5% for acute cough and bronchitis (table 2).

Fewer prescriptions exceeded recommended durations for non-respiratory tract indications, but still more than half of the antibiotic prescriptions were for longer than guidelines recommend for acute cystitis among females (54.6%, 95% confidence interval 54.1% to 55.0%) (table 2). Although guidelines recommend a shorter duration for fosfomycin, this did not affect our comparisons because this antibiotic was only used in two patients with acute cystitis. For acute prostatitis, the percentage of antibiotics prescribed for longer than the recommended duration was 12.5% (11.1% to 14.2%) using the recommendation of treatment for 28 days (table 2). When antibiotics are indicated for gastroenteritis, guidelines recommend prescribing antibiotics for 5–7 days. Setting the threshold at five days, 53.3% (50.8% to 55.8%) of prescriptions were for longer than guideline recommendations, whereas this percentage was 6.3% (5.2% to 7.7%) when using the seven day threshold (table 2).

### The evidence base for the optimal antibiotic treatment duration of upper and lower respiratory tract infections: an umbrella review [^1115KrVP]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

Many trials, reviews, and meta-analyses have been performed on the comparison of short versus long antibiotic treatment in respiratory tract infections, generally supporting shorter treatment. The aim of this umbrella review is to assess the soundness of the current evidence base for optimal antibiotic treatment duration.

Methods

A search in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Clarivate Analytics Web of Science Core Collection was performed on May 1, 2024, without date and language restrictions. Systematic reviews addressing treatment durations in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), acute sinusitis, and streptococcal pharyngitis, tonsillitis, or pharyngotonsillitis were included. Studies from inpatient and outpatient settings were included; reviews in paediatric populations were excluded. Outcomes of interest were clinical and bacteriological cure, microbiological eradication, mortality, relapse rate, and adverse events. The quality of the reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 tool, risk of bias of all included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (version 1), and overall quality of evidence according to GRADE.

Findings

We identified 30 systematic reviews meeting the criteria; they were generally of a low to critically low quality. 21 reviews conducted a meta-analysis. For CAP outside the intensive care unit (ICU; 14 reviews, of which eight did a meta-analysis) and AECOPD (eight reviews, of which five did a meta-analysis), there was sufficient evidence supporting a treatment duration of 5 days; evidence for shorter durations is scarce. Evidence on non-ventilator-associated HAP is absent, despite identifying three reviews (of which one did a meta-analysis), since no trials were conducted exclusively in this population. For sinusitis the evidence appears to support a shorter regimen, but more evidence is needed in the population who actually require antibiotic treatment. For pharyngotonsillitis (eight reviews, of which six did a meta-analysis), sufficient evidence exists to support short-course cephalosporin but not short-course penicillin when dosed three times a day.

Interpretation

The available evidence for non-ICU CAP and AECOPD supports a short-course treatment duration of 5 days in patients who have clinically improved. Efforts of the scientific community should be directed at implementing this evidence in daily practice. High-quality RCTs are needed to underpin even shorter treatment durations for CAP and AECOPD, to establish the optimal treatment duration of HAP and acute sinusitis, and to evaluate shorter duration using an optimal penicillin dosing schedule in patients with pharyngotonsillitis.

### Epidemiology of clinically diagnosed community-acquired pneumonia in the primary care setting: results from the 1999–2000 respiratory surveillance program [^117X9AGA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

To evaluate the prevalence of typical pathogens, level of resistance, and risk factors associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the outpatient primary care setting and define current antibiotic treatment for office-based CAP, the Respiratory Surveillance Program (RESP) recruited 1,200 primary care clinics during the 1999–2000 respiratory infection season. Participating community-based physicians submitted sputum samples from patients presenting with a community-acquired respiratory infection including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). All patients were aged ≥ 18 years. Patient demographics and risk factors were collected. Physicians express-mailed the specimens to a central laboratory for identification and susceptibility testing. All isolates were tested against a select panel of antimicrobial agents that are used to treat CAP. Patients with CAP were diagnosed by the treating physicians. Chest radiographs were not required as part of the study. A total of 610 specimens were submitted from patients with CAP. A smoking history or reported history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were present in > 50% of those diagnosed with CAP. The most common pathogens were, in order of prevalence, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. During the study period, a variety of antibiotics were prescribed for the treatment of outpatient CAP. The top 3 prescribed antibiotics include levofloxacin (23%), clarithromycin (19%), and azithromycin (10%). Gatifloxacin, which was approved in December 1999 and therefore available for only part of the study, accounted for 4% of the prescriptions. Of S pneumoniae isolates, 8% demonstrated high-level resistance to penicillin (≥ 2 microg/mL) and 33% were found resistant to macrolides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. All S pneumoniae isolates were sensitive to gatifloxacin, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. Other less common organisms isolated were staphylococci, streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp, and Acinetobacter spp. The choice of antibiotic to treat outpatient CAP varies from practice to practice and does not appear to be influenced by the patient's age, the patient's history of smoking, or comorbidity.

### Extended versus standard antibiotic course duration in children [^117BHQyp]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

High-level evidence is limited for antibiotic duration in children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) from First Nations and other at-risk populations of chronic respiratory disorders. As part of a larger study, we determined whether an extended antibiotic course is superior to a standard course for achieving clinical cure at 4 weeks in children 3 months to ≤ 5 years old hospitalized with CAP.

Methods

In our multinational (Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia), double-blind, superiority randomized controlled trial, children hospitalized with uncomplicated, radiographic-confirmed, CAP received 1–3 days of intravenous antibiotics followed by 3 days of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (80mg/kg, amoxicillin component, divided twice daily) and then randomized to extended (13–14 days duration) or standard (5–6 days) antibiotics. The primary outcome was clinical cure (complete resolution of respiratory symptoms/signs) 4 weeks postenrollment. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, nasopharyngeal bacterial pathogens and antimicrobial resistance at 4 weeks.

Results

Of 372 children enrolled, 324 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were randomized. Using intention-to-treat analysis, between-group clinical cure rates were similar (extended course: n = 127/163, 77.9%; standard course: n = 131/161, 81.3%; relative risk = 0.96, 95% confidence interval = 0.86–1.07). There were no significant between-group differences for adverse events (extended course: n = 43/163, 26.4%; standard course, n = 32/161, 19.9%) or nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus or antimicrobial resistance.

Conclusions

Among children hospitalized with pneumonia and at-risk of chronic respiratory illnesses, an extended antibiotic course was not superior to a standard course at achieving clinical cure at 4 weeks. Additional research will identify if an extended course provides longer-term benefits.

### A comparison between 12 versus 20 weeks of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as oral eradication treatment for melioidosis: an open-label, pragmatic, multicenter, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial [^114Hjhz5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

The trial was powered for a noninferiority design because the intervention group (12-week regimen) received a shorter duration of antimicrobial therapy than the control group (20-week regimen). We hypothesized that both regimens had equivalent efficacy. The expected incidence rate for the primary end point was based on the results of the most recent previous RCT. The noninferiority margin was defined by the study steering committee as a hazard ratio (HR) for culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis of 2.0. We calculated that 800 participants were needed to determine noninferiority with a power of 80% at an alpha error of 5%. The trial recruitment was terminated at 667 participants after consulting with the data safety monitoring board at Year 7 of the study (June 2018), due to futility of the primary outcome. The loss of power was mitigated using a secondary composite end point combining overall recurrence and mortality. The noninferiority margin defined was used for both the primary and secondary end points.

All patients were analyzed on the basis of intention to treat. Continuous variables are presented as medians and interquartile ranges. Categorical data are presented as numbers (%). We did survival analyses using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models. Time was measured from the day of study enrollment. We calculated the probabilities of event outcomes at each time point using the Kaplan-Meier method. For the primary analysis with culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis as the failure outcome, participants were censored on the day of the last follow-up or death due to other causes. We tested noninferiority of the 12-week regimen by calculating the HR for the efficacy of the 12-week regimen over that of the 20-week regimen, and compared the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) to the noninferiority margin. To accept the noninferiority margin of the 12-week regimen, the upper limit of the 95% CI needed to be equal to or less than 2.0. A 1-sided test at an alpha error of 2.5% was also calculated for the noninferiority margin.

### Prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of bacteria in children with acute otitis media and ear discharge: a systematic review [^115xVu5A]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial Resistance

AMR data were mainly reported for S. pneumoniae with very limited data reported for the remaining bacteria (Table, Supplemental Digital Content 5). Nonsusceptibility rates of S. pneumoniae to commonly used antibiotics varied widely between countries. Nonsusceptibility rates of pneumococcus to penicillin ranged from 0% to 65.8% (median 10.0%; 8 studies). Albeit being highly sensitive to quinolones (median nonsusceptibility rate 0.9%, range 0%–5.5%; median; 3 studies), nonsusceptibility rates to other antibiotics varied widely; amoxicillin: median 16.7% (range 0%–64.8%; 4 studies), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: median 27.3% (range 0%–93.5%; 5 studies), erythromycin: median 36.5% (range 10.5%–99.1%; 6 studies) and cephalosporins: median 5.4% (range 0%–63.0%; 6 studies).

Nonsusceptibility rates of S. pneumoniae did not clearly change over time (Fig. 2). The limited data available did not permit us to assess the impact of children's PCV status on AMR.

### Optimizing antibacterial therapy for community-acquired respiratory tract infections in children in an era of bacterial resistance [^111dJa63]. Clinical Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

The spread of antibacterial resistance in bacteria that commonly cause childhood community-acquired respiratory tract infections (RTIs), such as acute otitis media, community-acquired pneumonia, and acute pharyngitis, is a major healthcare problem. One of the foremost concerns is the rapid increase in penicillin, macrolide, and multidrug resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. There is also a rising prevalence of macrolide resistance in Streptococcus pyogenes in pockets of the United States, and beta-lactamase production in Haemophilus influenzae is widespread. Although data are limited, some evidence suggests that resistance to antibacterials can impair bacteriologic and clinical outcomes in childhood RTIs. Optimizing antibacterial use is important both in the care of individual patients and within strategies to address the wider problem of antibacterial resistance. This involves encouraging judicious antibacterial use (i.e., reducing overuse for viral infection and prophylaxis), and preventing misuse through the wrong choice, dosage, and duration of therapy. Given that initial therapy is usually empiric, antibacterials used to treat community-acquired RTIs in children should ideally have the following properties: an optimal targeted spectrum of activity; high clinical and bacteriologic efficacy against respiratory pathogens, including resistant strains; simple, short-course therapy; and good tolerability and palatability. New antibacterials will continue to have a role in the treatment of RTIs in children, especially where resistance compromises existing therapies.

### Effect of short-course, high-dose amoxicillin therapy on resistant pneumococcal carriage: a randomized trial [^113J62JG]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

Emerging drug resistance threatens the effectiveness of existing therapies for pneumococcal infections. Modifying the dose and duration of antibiotic therapy may limit the spread of resistant pneumococci.

Objective

To determine whether short-course, high-dose amoxicillin therapy reduces risk of posttreatment resistant pneumococcal carriage among children with respiratory tract infections.

Design and Setting

Randomized trial conducted in an outpatient clinic in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, October 1999 through July 2000.

Participants

Children aged 6 to 59 months who were receiving antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory tract illness (n = 795).

Interventions

Children were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 2 twice-daily regimens of amoxicillin: 90 mg/kg per day for 5 days (n = 398) or 40 mg/kg per day for 10 days (n = 397).

Main Outcome Measures

Penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage, assessed in nasopharyngeal specimens collected at days 0, 5, 10, and 28; baseline risk factors for nonsusceptible pneumococcal carriage; and adherence to regimen, compared between the 2 groups.

Results

At the day 28 visit, risk of penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococcal carriage was significantly lower in the short-course, high-dose group (24%) compared with the standard-course group (32%); relative risk (RR), 0.77; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.60–0.97; p = 0.03; risk of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole nonsusceptibility was also lower in the short-course, high-dose group (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.58–1.03; p = 0.08). The protective effect of short-course, high-dose therapy was stronger in households with 3 or more children (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52–0.98). Adherence to treatment was higher in the short-course, high-dose group (82% vs 74%; p = 0.02).

Conclusion

Short-course, high-dose outpatient antibiotic therapy appears promising as an intervention to minimize the impact of antibiotic use on the spread of drug-resistant pneumococci.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^115Lxx2S]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment for respiratory tract infections to combat antimicrobial resistance

Most bacterial RTIs show equal efficacy with fewer adverse events in shorter compared to standard antibiotic courses in clinical trials. This is based on the principle of 'shorter is better', initially conceived one decade ago. However, there are two notable exceptions: otitis media among children under the age of two and streptococcal pharyngitis, in which shorter first-line antibiotic courses are less effective than standard antibiotic courses.

Over the last few decades, most guidelines have recommended standard antimicrobial therapy durations of seven to ten days for lower RTIs. However, few randomised clinical trials have been conducted to determine the minimal effective treatment durations. Despite the low number of patients included in some of these studies, shorter treatment durations, such as two to three days, have been demonstrated not to be inferior to longer durations in terms of clinical efficacy. Initially advocated for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in the early 2000s, an increasing body of evidence suggests that shorter durations of antibiotics are also effective in treating most RTIs (Table 2). Some recent clinical guidelines, like the WHO AWaRe antibiotic book, advocate for five-day courses of antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis, COPD exacerbations, and community-acquired pneumonia. Despite this evidence, most clinicians still use standard or longer courses.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^111ha7rk]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics — management with penicillin allergy: Recent publications indicate that the risk of a serious allergic reaction to second- and third-generation cephalosporins in patients with penicillin or amoxicillin allergy appears to be almost nil and no greater than the risk among patients without such allergy, so patients allergic to amoxicillin with a non–type 1 (late or delayed, > 72 hours) hypersensitivity reaction can safely be treated with cefdinir, cefuroxime, or cefpodoxime, and patients with a history of a serious type 1 immediate or accelerated (anaphylactic) reaction to amoxicillin can also safely be treated with these agents. Clinicians may wish to determine individual tolerance by referral to an allergist for penicillin and/or cephalosporin skin-testing before initiation of therapy. The susceptibility of S pneumoniae to cefdinir, cefpodoxime, and cefuroxime varies from 60% to 75%, and the susceptibility of H influenzae varies from 85% to 100%. In young children (< 2 years) with a serious type 1 hypersensitivity to penicillin and moderate or more severe sinusitis, it may be prudent to use a combination of clindamycin (or linezolid) and cefixime; linezolid has excellent activity against all S pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, but lacks activity against H influenzae and M catarrhalis. Alternatively, a quinolone such as levofloxacin may be prescribed, and resistance of pneumococcus and H influenzae to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin is sufficient to preclude their use for acute bacterial sinusitis in patients with penicillin hypersensitivity.

### Bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for treatment of acute otitis media [^116SRDgE]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (T/S) has often been used as first and second line of treatment for acute otitis media (AOM). Because of the increasing resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae to T/S, we undertook the present study to investigate the bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of this drug in AOM.

Methods

Fifty-four culture-positive evaluable patients ages 3 to 32 months with AOM were treated with T/S 4/20 mg/kg in two divided daily doses for 10 days. Middle ear fluid (MEF) was cultured at enrollment (Day 1) and on Days 4 and 5 after initiation of treatment. Additional MEF cultures were obtained if clinical relapse occurred. Clinical failure was determined when the symptoms and signs of AOM did not improve or recurred during therapy. Bacteriologic failure was defined by positive culture on Days 4 and 5, or negative on Days 4 and 5 but positive again before the end of treatment. Patients were followed until Day 28 ± 2.

Results

A total of 67 organisms were isolated from MEF specimens of the 54 study patients: S. pneumoniae, 24; H. influenzae, 40; and Streptococcus pyogenes, 3. Fifteen (63%) of 24 S. pneumoniae were nonsusceptible to T/S (trimethoprim MIC, > 0.5 microg/ml), of which 10 (67%) were highly resistant to T/S (trimethoprim MIC, ≥ 4.0 microg/ml). Twelve (30%) of 40 H. influenzae and all 3 S. pyogenes isolates were nonsusceptible to T/S (MIC ≥ 4.0 microg/ml). Bacteriologic eradication occurred in 9 of 9 (100%) and 27 of 27 (100%) T/S-susceptible S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, respectively, vs. 4 of 15 (27%) and 6 of 12 (50%) T/S-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, respectively (P < 0.001). The 3 patients with S. pyogenes failed bacteriologically. Nine new organisms, not initially isolated, emerged during treatment, 7 of which (77%) were resistant to T/S. Altogether bacteriologic failure (organisms not eradicated plus newly emerged) occurred in 29 (53%) of 54 patients. Clinical failures occurred in 8 (15%) of 54 patients, and in 7 of these 8 cases the clinical failures occurred in those with bacteriologic failures. Ten patients relapsed clinically after completion of treatment and in 8 of them tympanocentesis for MEF culture was performed. Six of these 8 cultures were positive, and the initial pathogen was isolated in 4 of 6 (67%).

Conclusions

A high bacteriologic failure rate as well as a considerable clinical failure rate occurred among patients with AOM treated with T/S. We believe that T/S is no longer an appropriate empiric choice for the treatment of AOM in regions where high T/S resistance among respiratory pathogens is reported.

Contraindications regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole IV (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):
- Concomitant use of leucovorin: avoid using leucovorin with TMP/SMX for the treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-positive due to the associated risks of treatment failure and increased mortality.
- Pediatric patients aged < 2 months: use caution in pediatric patients aged ≥ 2 months because of the risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity, including gasping syndrome.
- Porphyria: avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with porphyria, as sulfonamides can precipitate porphyria crisis.
- Possible folate deficiency: avoid using TMP/SMX in patients with possible folate deficiency, including the elderly, patients with alcohol use disorder, malabsorption syndrome, malnutrition, or receiving anticonvulsant therapy, as well as in patients with severe allergy or asthma.
- Thyroid dysfunction: avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with thyroid dysfunction, as sulfonamides can precipitate hypothyroidism.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### Streptococcus pneumoniae: epidemiology and patterns of resistance [^113vU2tu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, meningitis, otitis media, and sinusitis; it results in significant morbidity and mortality in patients with pneumonia and meningitis. The pneumococcus is a common colonizing bacterium in the respiratory tract; it is especially common in the respiratory tracts of children, where it is frequently exposed to antimicrobial agents. This exposure can lead to resistance. Penicillin nonsusceptibility is found in nearly 40% of strains causing disease in adults, although often these cases are treatable with appropriate dosing regimens of many oral and parenteral beta-lactam agents. In the United States resistance to macrolides is widespread — averaging approximately 28% — but geographically variable, ranging from 23% in the northwest to 30% in the northeast. Resistance to tetracyclines and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are reported in approximately 20% and 35% of isolates, respectively, and resistance to multiple classes of agents is increasingly common. Amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, respiratory fluoroquinolones, and clindamycin are currently the most effective agents for treatment of respiratory tract infections caused by S pneumoniae, with > 90% of isolates in the United States being susceptible. Vancomycin is the only agent against which resistance has not emerged. Patient groups that are at increased risk for developing resistant pneumococcal infections have been identified and include patients with malignancies, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and sickle-cell disease. Judicious use of antimicrobials is the key to preventing the emergence of further resistance, particularly as few new classes of agents are likely to become available for clinical use in the short term.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^116EmD3D]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Agents not recommended for initial ABRS — Macrolide antibiotics (including azithromycin and clarithromycin) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are not recommended for initial therapy of ABRS; the high prevalence of macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in the US (> 30%) and resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole among S. pneumoniae (50%–75%) and Haemophilus influenzae (27%) preclude their initial empirical use even with reported penicillin allergy. Respiratory fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) are no longer recommended as first-line treatment for uncomplicated ABRS due to FDA "black box" warnings of increased risks of serious adverse events including tendinitis, tendon rupture, aortic rupture, and peripheral neuropathy.

### Pneumonia in pregnancy [^114xjuk4]. Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Historically, pneumonia during pregnancy has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality compared with nonpregnant women. The goal of this article is to review current literature describing pneumonia in pregnancy. This review will identify maternal risk factors, potential complications, and prenatal outcomes associated with pneumonia and describe the contemporary management of the varied causes of pneumonia in pregnancy.

Results

Coexisting maternal disease, including asthma and anemia, increase the risk of contracting pneumonia in pregnancy. Neonatal effects of pneumonia in pregnancy include low birth weight and increased risk of preterm birth, and serious maternal complications include respiratory failure. Community-acquired pneumonia is the most common form of pneumonia in pregnancy, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae accounting for most identified bacterial organisms. Beta-lactam and macrolide antibiotics are considered safe in pregnancy and are effective for most community-acquired pneumonia in pregnancy. Viral respiratory infections, including varicella, influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome, can be associated with maternal pneumonia. Current antiviral and respiratory therapies can reduce maternal morbidity and mortality from viral pneumonia. Influenza vaccination can reduce the prevalence of respiratory hospitalizations among pregnant women during influenza season. Pneumocystis pneumonia continues to carry significant maternal risk to an immunocompromised population. Prevention and treatment of Pneumocystis pneumonia with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is effective in reducing this risk.

Conclusions

Prompt diagnosis and treatment with contemporary antimicrobial therapy and intensive care unit management of respiratory compromise has reduced the maternal morbidity and mortality due to pneumonia in pregnancy. Prevention with vaccination in at-risk populations may reduce the prevalence and severity of pneumonia in pregnant women.

### Erythromycin (Ery-tab) [^114QHFxB]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ERY-TAB®and other antibacterial drugs, ERY-TAB®should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

ERY-TAB®tablets are indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below:

Upper respiratory tract infections of mild to moderate degree caused by Streptococcus pyogenes; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Haemophilus influenzae (when used concomitantly with adequate doses of sulfonamides, since many strains of H. influenzae are not susceptible to the erythromycin concentrations ordinarily achieved). (See appropriate sulfonamide labeling for prescribing information.)

Lower respiratory tract infections of mild to moderate severity caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Listeriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes.

Respiratory tract infections due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

Skin and skin structure infections of mild to moderate severity caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus (resistant staphylococci may emerge during treatment).

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus doxycycline as oral eradicative treatment for melioidosis (MERTH): a multicentre, double-blind, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^114muego]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

All patients were analysed on the basis of their original allocation group (intention-to-treat analysis). Continuous variables are presented as median (IQR). IQRs are presented in terms of 25th and 75th percentiles. Categorical data are presented as number (%). We did survival analyses using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models. Time was measured from the day of study enrolment. For the primary analysis (intention-to-treat analysis) with culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis as the failure outcome, participants were censored on the day of last follow-up or death due to other causes. We tested non-inferiority of the TMP-SMX plus placebo group by calculating the HR for the efficacy of TMP-SMX plus placebo over the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline, and compared the upper limit of the 95% CI to the non-inferiority margin. To accept the non-inferiority of TMP-SMX plus placebo to TMP-SMX plus doxycycline, the upper limit of the 95% CI needed to be equal to or less than 1·7. A one sided-test at an alpha error of 5% was also calculated for the non-inferiority margin. For the secondary analyses with treatment changes and treatment failure as the outcomes, participants were censored on the day of recurrent melioidosis or death due to other causes. We calculated the probabilities of event outcomes at each timepoint using the Kaplan-Meier method. For the Cox Proportional Hazard model, we assessed whether the hazard ratio was constant over time using Schoenfeld residuals. The analysis was repeated for the primary outcome in the per-protocol population, in which those who did not complete 20 weeks of study drug were excluded.

As recurrent melioidosis can be caused by either relapse or re-infection, we also assessed the efficacy of TMP-SMX for culture-confirmed relapse in a sensitivity analysis on the basis that we would not expect antimicrobial treatment to prevent re-infection after treatment has been completed. We did this using culture-confirmed relapse as a failure outcome and excluding patients who had no paired bacterial isolates available for genotyping from the first and recurrent episode and those with paired isolates and genotyping results that confirmed re-infection.

For safety analyses, we assessed the proportion of patients who had adverse drug reactions by treatment group. We compared proportions using the Fisher's exact test and continuous variables using the Mann-Whitney test. We used STATA (version 12.1) for all statistical analyses.

### Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim (sulfamethox-TMP DS) [^113gNLoG]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim distribute to sputum, vaginal fluid and middle ear fluid; trimethoprim also distributes to bronchial secretion, and both pass the placental barrier and are excreted in human milk.

Geriatric Pharmacokinetics: The pharmacokinetics of sulfamethoxazole 800 mg and trimethoprim 160 mg were studied in 6 geriatric subjects (mean age: 78.6 years) and 6 young healthy subjects (mean age: 29.3 years) using a non-US approved formulation. Pharmacokinetic values for sulfamethoxazole in geriatric subjects were similar to those observed in young adult subjects. The mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was significantly lower in geriatric subjects compared with young adult subjects (19 mL/h/kg vs. 55 mL/h/kg). However, after normalizing by body weight, the apparent total body clearance of trimethoprim was on average 19% lower in geriatric subjects compared with young adult subjects3.

Microbiology

Sulfamethoxazole inhibits bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by competing with paraaminobenzoic acid (PABA). Trimethoprim blocks the production of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolic acid by binding to and reversibly inhibiting the required enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase. Thus, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim blocks two consecutive steps in the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins essential to many bacteria.

In vitro studies have shown that bacterial resistance develops more slowly with both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in combination than with either sulfamethoxazole or trimethoprim alone.

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim have been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both i n vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section.

Aerobic Gram-Positive Microorganisms:

Streptococcus pneumoniae

Aerobic Gram-Negative Microorganisms:

### Diagnosis and treatment of upper respiratory tract infections in the primary care setting [^116Gwx1k]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory tract infections such as acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), acute otitis media (AOM), and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) account for approximately 75% of antibiotic prescriptions written and are among the leading reasons for physician office visits in the United States. Resistance of the predominant pathogens in respiratory tract infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) to available antibiotics has led clinicians to reevaluate the diagnosis and management of these infections.

Objective

The purpose of this review is to provide primary care practitioners with an accessible combined resource for the management of AECB, AOM, and ABRS.

Methods

This review was based on discussions from a roundtable meeting (sponsored by an educational grant from GlaxoSmithKline) that convened clinicians versed in the management of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. In addition, primary articles were identified by a MEDLINE search and through secondary sources.

Results

To reduce the prevalence of resistance, judicious and appropriate use of antibiotics must be implemented in clinical practice. With accurate diagnosis of bacterial and nonbacterial conditions, and patient education on antibiotic use and misuse, the excessive use of antibiotics and ensuing resistance can be reduced. The incorporation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data with minimum inhibitory concentration values can provide a more comprehensive assessment of antibiotic activity in vivo. Stratification of patients with AECB according to patient characteristics and frequency of exacerbation can be used to determine which patients will benefit from antibiotic treatment and to guide clinicians in their choice of antibiotic. The Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group has issued recommendations on the management of AOM based on prior antibiotic therapy, which is a risk factor for antimicrobial resistance. The Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership guidelines for the treatment of ABRS in adults and children are based on the predicted efficacy of various antibiotics as well as patient age, severity of disease, likelihood of bacterial infection, likelihood of spontaneous resolution, and in vitro susceptibility of the predominant pathogens based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic breakpoints.

Conclusions

Guidelines for the management of AECB, AOM, and ABRS emphasize the importance of differentiating between bacterial and nonbacterial infections, choosing an antibiotic based on the likelihood of infection with resistant pathogens, and providing coverage against the predominant pathogens. The judicious use of antibiotics also has been identified as an instrumental part of controlling unnecessary antibiotic use and subsequent resistance.

Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients

A simulation conducted with data from a pharmacokinetic study in 153 infants and children demonstrated that mean steady state AUC and maximum plasma concentration of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole would be comparable between pediatric patients 2 months to 18 years receiving 8/40 (trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole) mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours and adult patients receiving 320/1600 (trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole) mg/day.

### Impact of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment on the long-term prognosis of community acquired pneumonia [^115vKX89]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment in community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is not well established: discrepancies exist between the different guidelines published to date. In 2007, IDSA / ATS included a minimum treatment of 5 days, provided the patient remains free of fever for 48–72 h and without more than one criterion of clinical instability. Recently published updated guidelines keep the same recommendation.

The negative impact of the overuse of antibiotics is well known. In this regard, an increase in nasopharyngeal carriers of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae has been observed with the use of low-dose beta-lactams for more than 5 days in children. The unnecessarily prolonged use of antibiotics has been associated with a greater incidence of resistance, a higher number of adverse effects, worse adherence to treatment, and a higher cost.

Several studies have been published with the aim of evaluating the safety of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with CAP. In a recent meta-analysis involving five clinical trials involving adults with mild-to-moderate CAP comparing the same types of antibiotic, short 3 to 7 day regimens of antibiotics were compared to 7 to 10 day regimens. The authors did not observe significant differences in terms of cure rate, mortality and adverse effects. Surprisingly, a new meta-analysis comparing ≤ 6 day versus ≥ 7 day regimens, observed a lower mortality rate in the shorter compared to the long regimen group (RR 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33–0.82), with similar cure and relapse rates in both groups. When evaluating only the most severe patients, mortality was 2.2% in the group with a shorter regimen compared to 4.7% in the long regimen group.

### Case-based audit and feedback around a decision aid improved antibiotic choice and duration for uncomplicated cystitis in primary care clinics [^113HmjFr]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance is a well-recognised threat to global health, with the USA alone accounting for 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections and 35 000 deaths each year. Increasing realisation of the need to minimise this public health threat can be seen in the efforts of regulatory bodies such as the Joint Commission, which recently established requirements for antimicrobial stewardship for ambulatory healthcare organisations, effective at the beginning of 2020. The new requirements mandate that such organisations provide resources to practitioners to promote appropriate antibiotic prescribing practices.

Although most studies of outpatients have focused on implementing antibiotic stewardship for upper respiratory infections, there is also a high prevalence of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in primary care, including overuse of fluoroquinolones and longer duration of treatment than recommended by guidelines. A study in France found that only 20% of outpatient UTIs were treated with the guidelines-recommended drug, dose and duration. An Irish study found that only 55% of the antibiotic prescriptions for UTI in general practice were appropriate. Of 7738 outpatient encounters for UTI in Israel, 91% were treated with a longer duration of antibiotics than recommended by guidelines. A recent US study revealed that fluoroquinolones were the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for uncomplicated UTI, comprising up to 49% of prescriptions. Inappropriate use of fluoroquinolones is especially concerning because it promotes the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli strain sequence type 131. In addition, continued overprescribing of fluoroquinolones for uncomplicated cystitis in patients with other treatment options is occurring in the USAdespite two black-box warnings from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for fluoroquinolones due to an association between their use and serious side effects. In addition, fluoroquinolones were associated with more central nervous system-related and gastrointestinal-related adverse events compared with other types of antimicrobials in a recent meta-analysis. Excessive treatment duration for uncomplicated cystitis is another common problem documented internationally. Current Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelinesrecommend nitrofurantoin for 5 days, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole for 3 days and a single dose of fosfomycin as the first-line regimens for uncomplicated cystitis. In our previous study in the same setting, most prescriptions for trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin and fluoroquinolones had a treatment duration longer than recommended.

### Clinical resistance encountered in the respiratory surveillance program (RESP) study: a review of the implications for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections [^1171i37K]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The Respiratory Surveillance Program (RESP) is a large-scale surveillance study of potential bacterial pathogens from respiratory tract infections that was performed over a 10-month period (July to April) during the 1999–2000 respiratory infection season. It is also the first study of its kind to derive its information entirely from community-based medical practices. This study, therefore, provides insight into the identity, frequency, and susceptibility of the possible pathogens isolated from patients encountered by primary care physicians. Reduction of antibiotic susceptibility in various bacterial pathogens may be of academic interest. However, it is only the emergence of clinical resistance (strains exhibiting minimum inhibitory concentrations above the resistance breakpoint) to commonly used antibacterial agents in the most prevalent species that has significant impact on empiric therapy choices. A review of data from RESP indicated that the most prevalent species were Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. As expected, the prevalence of these bacterial isolates varied by disease state. The prevalence of clinical resistance to various antibiotics ranged, within these 4 species, between 0% and 92%. Resistance to the greatest number of drugs was expressed by S pneumoniae, followed by S aureus, H influenzae, and M catarrhalis. The prevalence of antibiotic resistance found among these community-isolated pathogens was surprisingly similar to that reported in hospital-based studies, suggesting that resistance is as important an issue in the community as it is in hospitals. With few exceptions, the prevalence of resistance was fairly uniform across disease states. The antibiotics most likely to encounter clinically resistant isolates during the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections were penicillins, macrolides, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The antibiotics least likely to encounter resistance were quinolones, followed by ceftriaxone and amoxicillin/clavulanate.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: background [^113vs9MS]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised.1. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. 2. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever.3. Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases. 4. Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms-especially those with unilateral facial pain-regardless of duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, should be used.

### Issues in the management of bacterial sinusitis [^116g1zbi]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Office visits for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) have increased steadily in the past 2 decades, and ABRS accounted for 0.4% of ambulatory diagnoses in 1995, ranking as the fifth most common diagnosis for which an antibiotic is prescribed. ABRS typically begins as a viral respiratory tract infection, but bacterial growth is demonstrated in 60% of adults with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms of at least 10 days duration. Important factors to consider when selecting an antibiotic regimen for ABRS include: severity of disease, rate of disease progression, earlier antibiotic treatment, regional resistance rates, and, in children, an age < 5 years and attendance in day care centers. The most prevalent causative pathogens of sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Antimicrobial agent use is under significant scrutiny in this era of emerging bacterial resistance, and antibiotic treatment for sinusitis should include consideration of drug pharmacodynamics. Several agents, once considered first-line therapies, can no longer be considered dependable in this role. Rather, newer antibiotics may be called on to provide efficacy and forestall additional antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens.

### The clinical course of acute otitis media in high-risk Australian aboriginal children: a longitudinal study [^111jMTX8]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Antibiotic treatment

Six children were known to be receiving antibiotics effective against respiratory pathogens at the time of the initial AOM diagnosis (amoxicillin 50 mg/kg/day). All the other children had received antibiotics for otitis media in the past but the time since their last treatment was not recorded. Following diagnosis, antibiotic treatment was started in an additional 22 children. Two of the three children not treated initially developed moderate bulging of the TM and started treatment on day 6–8 (A31 and A32). One child (A19) did not receive any antibiotics. The antibiotics prescribed were twice daily amoxicillin (25), amoxicillin-clavulanate (1), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (3), or daily intramuscular procaine penicillin (1). The mean dose of penicillin or amoxicillin was 52 mg/kg/day (standard deviation 15, range 25–100). Recommended treatment duration was at least 7 days for AOM without perforation and at least 14 days for AOM with perforation. Compliance with prescribed treatment was poor. Overall, we documented 462/1151 prescribed doses (40%) as taken, and estimated that 17/30 participants (57%) took less than half their recommended treatment.

### Are Haemophilus influenzae infections a significant problem in India? A prospective study and review [^117Buymh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

It has been suggested Haemophilus influenzae serotype b (Hib) disease is uncommon in Asia. During 1993–1997, we conducted prospective surveillance of acute infections caused by H. influenzae in 6 academic referral Indian hospitals. The study included 5798 patients aged 1 month to 50 years who had diseases likely to be caused by H. influenzae; 75% of the patients were aged < 5 years. A total of 125 H. influenzae infections were detected, 97% of which were caused by Hib. Of 125 isolates, 108 (86%) were from children aged < 5 years, and 11 (9%) were from adults aged > 18 years. Sixty-two percent of the patients had meningitis. The case-fatality rate was 11% overall and 20% in infants with Hib meningitis. Up to 60% of all isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or erythromycin; 32% were resistant to ≥ 3 antimicrobial drugs, but none were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. These data suggest that available Hib vaccines will benefit Indian children.

### Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, an under-recognised pathogen [^116LjMpi]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a major cause of mucosal infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, conjunctivitis, and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In some regions, a strong causal relation links this pathogen with infections of the lower respiratory tract. In the past 20 years, a steady but constant increase has occurred in invasive NTHi worldwide, with perinatal infants, young children, and elderly people most at risk. Individuals with underlying comorbidities are most susceptible and infection is associated with high mortality. β-lactamase production is the predominant mechanism of resistance. However, the emergence and spread of β-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains in many regions of the world is of substantial concern, potentially necessitating changes to antibiotic treatment guidelines for community-acquired infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and potentially increasing morbidity associated with invasive NTHi infections. Standardised surveillance protocols and typing methodologies to monitor this emerging pathogen should be implemented. International scientific organisations need to raise the profile of NTHi and to document the pathobiology of this microbe.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

HIV-associated bacterial pneumonia — prevention and prophylaxis emphasizes that H. influenzae type b vaccine is not usually recommended for adult use (BIII) unless a patient also has anatomic or functional asplenia; antiretroviral therapy (ART) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis are associated with decreased risk, and daily TMP-SMX for PCP prophylaxis reduced the frequency of bacterial respiratory infections; however, TMP-SMX should not be prescribed solely to prevent bacterial respiratory infection (AIII), and clarithromycin or azithromycin should not be prescribed solely to prevent bacterial respiratory infection (AIII); a decreased absolute neutrophil count (e.g., < 500 cells/mm3) is associated with increased risk, and clinicians should take steps to reverse neutropenia, such as by stopping myelosuppressive drugs (CIII), while studies of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor in persons with HIV have failed to document benefit; modifiable risks include smoking cigarettes, using injection drugs, and consuming alcohol, and clinicians should encourage cessation, refer to services, and/or prescribe medications to support quitting; data demonstrate that smoking cessation can decrease the risk of bacterial pneumonia.

Antibiotics: Early Use and Prophylaxis

When IGRT is not indicated based on laboratory evaluation, not preferred, or not an option based on access or cost, prophylactic antibiotics should be considered in those requiring frequent courses of antibiotics due to recurrent bacterial respiratory tract infections. Prophylactic use of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole has shown symptomatic improvement in individuals with 22q11.2del and an impaired response to the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Alternatively, early initiation of antibiotics at the onset of symptoms of a respiratory tract infection may be considered. This option might be appropriate in cases when viral upper respiratory tract infections ("colds") are intermittent but frequently progress to either bacterial sinus or ear infections requiring antibiotics to clear, and the patient has evidence of significant immune deficiency or an anatomical abnormality that predisposes to these infections. Preventing the progression to bacterial sinusitis can reduce the severity and duration of symptoms, time out of work, and missed school days. Early initiation of antibiotics may also reduce the overall use of antimicrobials versus daily administration.

### Antibiotics for COPD exacerbations: does drug or duration matter? A primary care database analysis [^116MfTZj]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are globally the most common infectious cause of morbidity. Despite this prevalence, observed duration of antibiotic treatment for LRTI varies greatly, and there is disagreement between guidelines on the optimal duration. Effective first-line treatment for non-pneumonic LRTI in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients ('infective exacerbations') is an area of particular uncertainty.

COPD is a common cause of disability, and estimated to become the third leading cause of death worldwide in 2030. Exacerbations form a large part of the disease burden and can lead to a cough with discoloured phlegm irrespective of causation. Over £250 million is spent on treating COPD exacerbations annually in the UK, and recurrent exacerbations are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

Up to half of all COPD exacerbations are thought to be caused by bacteria, the remainder by viruses or environmental irritants. The most common pathogens are Haemophilus influenza e, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Initial studies suggested that the administration of antibiotics was associated with a lower risk of symptom persistence. However, a Cochrane review concluded that a statistically significant improvement in treatment failure rate was only seen in severe exacerbations, with more adverse events in the antibiotic group. Hence, the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society and international guidelines advise, based on moderate evidence, the prescription of antibiotics for ambulatory patients 'if clinically indicated'. However, our understanding of the success of real-life prescribing practices is limited.

Acute otitis media (AOM) duration of therapy by age and severity: The optimal duration is uncertain, but for children younger than 2 years and children with severe symptoms, a standard 10-day course is recommended. A 7-day course appears equally effective in children 2 to 5 years of age with mild or moderate AOM, and for children 6 years and older with mild to moderate symptoms, a 5- to 7-day course is adequate treatment.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim ds [^117Dkdjw]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Microbiology: Sulfamethoxazole inhibits bacterial
synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by competing with para -aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Trimethoprim blocks the
production of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolic acid by binding to and
reversibly inhibiting the required enzyme,

dihydrofolate reductase. Thus, this combination blocks two consecutive steps
in the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins essential to many
bacteria.

In vitro studies have shown that bacterial
resistance develops more slowly with this combination than with either
sulfamethoxazole or trimethoprim alone.

In vitro serial dilution tests have shown that the
spectrum of antibacterial activity of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim includes
the common urinary tract pathogens with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The following organisms are usually
susceptible: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteus species including Proteus
vulgaris. The usual spectrum of antimicrobial activity of
sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim includes the following bacterial pathogens
isolated from middle ear exudate and from bronchial secretions: Haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant
strains, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei are usually susceptible. The usual spectrum also includes enterotoxigenic
strains of Escherichia coli (ETEC) causing bacterial
gastroenteritis.

The recommended quantitative disc susceptibility
method may be used for estimating the susceptibility of bacteria to
sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.

With this
procedure, a report from the laboratory of "Susceptible to trimethoprim and
sulfamethoxazole" indicates that the infection is likely to respond to therapy
with this product. If the infection is confined to the urine, a report of
"Intermediate susceptibility to trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole" also
indicates that the infection is likely to respond. A report of "Resistant to
trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole" indicates that the infection is unlikely to
respond to therapy with this product.

### Treatment and prevention of otitis media [^113tSKY3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and summarize recent advances in the treatment and prevention of otitis media (OM).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1996-March 2000) was performed to identify relevant primary and review articles. References from these articles were also reviewed if deemed important.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language primary and review articles focusing on the treatment and prevention of acute otitis media (AOM) were included. Studies focusing exclusively on OM with effusion or serous OM and chronic suppurative OM were excluded. Information regarding prevention and drug therapy was reviewed, with an emphasis placed on advances made in the last two years.

Data Synthesis

Recently, an expert panel of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended use of only three of 16 systemic antibiotics approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of AOM: amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and ceftriaxone. Controversy exists over the importance of key selection factors used by the expert panel in determining which antibiotics to recommend in a two-step treatment algorithm, that is, in vitro data, pharmacodynamic profiles, and necessity for coverage of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae at all steps of empiric treatment. Additional antibiotic and patient selection factors useful for individualizing therapy include clinical efficacy, adverse effects, frequency and duration of administration, taste, cost, comorbid infections, and ramifications should bacterial resistance develop to the chosen antibiotic. Presumed or past patient/caregiver adherence (especially when antibiotic failure has occurred) is also paramount in selecting antibiotic therapy. A three-step treatment algorithm for refractory AOM that employs amoxicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (depending on the prior dose of and adherence to amoxicillin therapy), and ceftriaxone or tympanocentesis at steps 1, 2, and 3, respectively, appears rational and cost-effective. The recent upsurge in antimicrobial resistance is highlighted, and recommendations are presented for the treatment of AOM and prevention of recurrent otitis media (rAOM).

Conclusions

Amoxicillin remains the antibiotic of choice for initial empiric treatment of AOM, although the traditional dosage should be increased in patients at risk for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae. In cases refractory to high-dose amoxicillin, TMP/SMX should be prescribed if adherence to prior therapy seemed good or complete, or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate if adherence was incomplete or questionable. Ceftriaxone should be reserved as third-line treatment. The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae emphasizes the importance of alternative medical approaches for the prevention of OM, as well as judicious antibiotic use in established cases. Removal of modifiable risk factors should be first-line therapy for prevention of rAOM. We support the use of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine per guidelines for prevention of rAOM from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with consideration given to influenza vaccine for cases of rAOM that historically worsen during the flu season. Sulfisoxazole prophylaxis should be reserved for children who are immunocompromised, have concurrent disease states exacerbated by AOM, or meet the criteria of rAOM despite conjugate pneumococcal and influenza vaccination. Therapy should be intermittent, beginning at the first sign of an upper respiratory infection, and should continue for 10 days. The invasive nature and risks of anesthesia relegate myringotomy, tympanostomy tubes, and adenoidectomy to last-line therapies for rAOM.

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for 357, 390 children with otitis media [^117RDWL8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Otitis media (OM) is a common complication of respiratory tract infections in children. Over 130,000 acute OM cases were diagnosed and treated in Finnish children in public health care centers in 2014. Nearly half of the infants have suffered from acute OM during their first living year and 70% before the age of 2 years. Among 17 European evidence-based guidelines, all recommend analgesics, and 15 recommend the wait-and-see practice in selected cases, and when treated, 14 recommend amoxicillin as the first-choice antibiotics: 7 with the dose of 40–50 mg/kg/day and 7 with the dose of 90 mg/kg/day.

The Finnish Current Care Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of OM, which were published in 2011 and updated in 2017, are in line with the European guidelines. The Finnish guidelines recommend that children younger than 24 months of age, and children with bulging eardrum, draining middle ear or purulent OM in both ears should be treated immediately, and the first-line antibiotics are amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. High amoxicillin dosing is not needed due to the low frequency of pneumococcal penicillin resistance in the country. Second-generation cephalosporins, trimethoprim-sulfa and macrolides are the second-line drugs recommended for those allergic to penicillin. Children 2 years of age and upward with less prominent clinical findings can be left without antibiotics, but they must be reexamined after 2 to 3 days if the symptoms continue.

A task force set up by the European Paediatric Association concluded that the overconsumption of antibiotics in children with spontaneously recovering respiratory tract infections is 1 of the 4 most important health care problems in children in Europe. Indeed, many children with signs and symptoms of OM during acute respiratory infection recover spontaneously, and a wait-and-see practice with delayed introduction of antibiotics, if needed, is justified in appropriate cases and eventually reduces the consumption of antibiotics at the population level.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate antibiotic prescriptions for children with OM in a nationwide private network of outpatient clinics in Finland. Special focus was paid to amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid prescriptions, which have been the first-choice recommendations since 2017, according to Finnish guidelines. A nationwide dataset allowed an estimation of variations by age, time, region and the specialty of the physicians. Further, we were interested in identifying potential needs and specific areas for future active interventions antibiotic use among children with OM.

### The safety of delayed versus immediate antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections [^112ibS17]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, waiting to treat URTI was associated with increased risk of infection-related complications. There was considerable variation in the risks of infection-related hospital admission, although the probability of delayed antibiotic prescribing was unrelated to these. There is an important need to better target delayed antibiotic prescribing to patients with URTI with moderate risks of complications and immediate antibiotic prescribing to those with higher risks. Further research on the cost-effectiveness of the most optimal threshold is needed to establish the treatment thresholds.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^111jEgvb]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — antibiotic selection and duration: The antibiotics currently approved by the FDA for ABRS are azithromycin, clarithromycin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefprozil, cefuroxime axetil, loracarbef, levofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and moxifloxacin. It should be noted that, owing to concerns over bacterial resistance, the Infectious Diseases Society of America no longer recommends the use of macrolides for empiric treatment of ABRS, and that organization recommends amoxicillin-clavulanate as first-line therapy and doxycycline, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin in adult patients allergic to penicillin. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends 5 to 7 days of treatment with antibiotics for uncomplicated ABRS in adults and 10 to 14 days in children. Intravenous antibiotics may be considered in children who cannot tolerate oral medications for ABRS or in those with orbital, subperiosteal, or epidural abscesses. Summary Statement 21: To avoid resistance and potential adverse effects from antibiotics, the workgroup recommends evaluation of β-lactam allergy by penicillin skin testing and/or graded oral challenge if β-lactam is the most appropriate antibiotic (Rec, B).

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^116htSCm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Evidence summary — early neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) therapy in outpatients: Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials that established the efficacy of NAIs in reducing the duration of fever and symptoms by approximately 1–2 days were conducted among mostly non–high-risk adult and pediatric outpatients with uncomplicated laboratory-confirmed influenza, enrolled within 36–48 hours of illness onset. Greater clinical benefit was reported when NAI treatment was started very early; in both adults and children, NAI treatment started within 6 hours of illness onset reduced symptoms by about 4 days. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials indicate that early initiation (within 2 days of illness onset) of antiviral treatment can reduce the duration of fever and symptoms, especially in nonasthmatic children; decrease the risk of otitis media in children; and reduce the risk of lower respiratory tract complications requiring antibiotics and of hospitalization in adults.

Discussion

HCP reasonably may consider empiric antibiotic treatment in instances when a patient has new symptoms (eg, new fever after initial defervescence) and/or changes in lung imaging, signs of production of purulent sputum, dense lobar consolidation on radiograph, or rapid progression to severe COVID-19 requiring intubation and pressor support. Because the bacterial pathogens responsible for CAP often colonize the upper airway and opportunistically infect the lung, it is speculated that these same bacteria should be considered in patients with respiratory virus–related pneumonia including COVID-19 within the first days of hospitalization and guidelines for CAP treatment should be followed. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the pathogen most frequently associated with influenza, followed mainly by S. aureus, and Hemophilus influenzae. Recent studies have identified S. pneumoniae and S. aureus as the main causative agents of community-acquired coinfection at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Data on bacterial coinfections in patients who are immunosuppressed are sparse, but there may be scenarios, such as patients with febrile neutropenia, in which empiric antibiotic therapy at the time of COVID-19 or other respiratory viral diagnosis is justified.

It is important that HCP also consider the possibility of coinfection with viruses other than the pandemic strain. The use of nonpharmacologic interventions (eg, mask use, social distancing) significantly disrupted the transmission of non–SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses during the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic such that influenza activity decreased in March 2020 and remained at historic lows. As these nonpharmacologic interventions are relaxed, HCP should anticipate rising circulation of influenza and other respiratory viruses to include the possibility of coinfection with SARS-CoV-2. In the event of cocirculating influenza and SARS-CoV-2, NIH guidelines suggest HCP initiate empiric oseltamivir pending the exclusion of influenza by nucleic acid detection assay in upper-respiratory-tract specimens for non-intubated patients and in both upper- and lower-respiratory-tract specimens for intubated patients.

Patients who are admitted for > 48 hours are at increased risk for HAI, including those that are multidrug resistant. It is reasonable to consider antibiotic choices that include activity against healthcare-associated pathogens such as P. aeruginosa. Fungal infection, such as bloodstream infection in patients with prolonged central venous catheters, should also be considered if appropriate.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: background [^116JknDp]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever. Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases. Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms-especially those with unilateral facial pain-regardless of duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, should be used.

Diagnosis, Treatment, and ComplicationsEspañol Diagnosis Doctors usually diagnose Haemophilus influenzae infection with one or more laboratory tests. The most common testing methods use a sample of blood or spinal fluid. ©Teresa Winslow – US Government has certain rights. Treatment People diagnosed with H. influenzae disease take antibiotics to treat the infection. Depending on how serious the infection is, people with H. influenzae disease may need care in a hospital. Other treatments may include:

- Breathing support
- Medication to treat low blood pressure
- Wound care for parts of the body with damaged skin When H. influenzae cause milder infections, like bronchitis or ear infections, doctors may give antibiotics to prevent complications. Learn more about using antibiotics for these infections. Complications Even with appropriate treatment, some H. influenzae infections can result in long-term problems or death.

For example, bloodstream infections can result in loss of limbs. Meningitis can cause brain damage or hearing loss. Complications are rare and typically not severe for bronchitis and ear infections caused by H. influenzae.
