## Question

How long to observe patient after epinephrine injection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long to observe a patient after epinephrine administration for anaphylaxis, and how to tailor that observation to risk and clinical context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is anaphylaxis versus a non-anaphylactic allergic reaction. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetics of intramuscular epinephrine to anchor the early observation window. Next, I will review the evidence on biphasic anaphylaxis incidence and timing to frame the risk period. After that, I should stratify observation by severity and risk factors, including respiratory or cardiovascular compromise, multiple epinephrine doses, and comorbidities. Finally, I will reconcile guideline differences, consider pediatric nuances, and outline discharge planning and follow-up, including prescriptions and education.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because observation time hinges on whether this is true anaphylaxis with multi-system involvement or a localized allergic reaction. For anaphylaxis, guidelines emphasize risk-stratified observation to detect biphasic reactions, whereas for isolated urticaria or mild angioedema without systemic features, observation can be shorter and focused on symptom evolution rather than biphasic risk [^115NS8aH] [^111v134S].

> I need to check the pharmacokinetics to anchor the early window. Intramuscular epinephrine reaches peak plasma levels around 12–25 minutes, with hemodynamic effects often within minutes, so a 1-hour observation captures the immediate treatment response and many early recurrences, which supports a 1-hour minimum for low-risk, fully resolved cases [^113UvTnK] [^115ZJe2T].

> Next, I should review biphasic anaphylaxis data. Incidence is about 4–5% overall, with median onset around 11 hours and a tail extending to 72 hours, meaning prolonged observation reduces but cannot eliminate risk, and that informs why many guidelines extend observation for higher-risk presentations [^115LteXU] [^115NS8aH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify how observation windows perform: a 1-hour observation captures roughly 95% of biphasic reactions in low-risk cohorts, 4 hours about 96.5%, 6 hours about 97.3%, and 12 hours about 98.2%, which provides a pragmatic scaffold for risk-stratified care [^115ZJe2T] [^114GAYuM].

> For low-risk patients with non-severe anaphylaxis, a prompt and complete response to a single IM dose, and no significant comorbidities, I should confirm that 1 hour of observation is reasonable. WMS and JTFPP-aligned guidance support this, balancing early discharge with counseling and access to additional epinephrine [^111v134S] [^115ZJe2T].

> For moderate-risk patients, including those needing more than one epinephrine dose, with respiratory compromise without hypotension, or with significant comorbidities, I should double-check that 4–6 hours is appropriate. NIAID and European guidance align here, and ED practice data show median observation times around 4 hours, with longer observation in those who ultimately biphase [^1117Xnnp] [^111v134S].

> For high-risk patients with hypotension, cardiovascular collapse, or severe airway compromise, I need to ensure 12–24 hours of observation or admission. WMS and EAACI explicitly recommend extended monitoring in these scenarios given the higher biphasic risk and potential severity of recurrence [^111v134S] [^1171JR9G].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child? I should review pediatric data suggesting that many children can be safely discharged after 2 hours if asymptomatic, with 4 hours sufficient even for those with cardiovascular involvement, which supports a shorter observation window in most children while maintaining readiness to extend for severity or ongoing symptoms [^112ieCAf].

> I will now examine special contexts. For allergen immunotherapy, a 30-minute in-clinic observation is standard, yet delayed systemic reactions can occur after that window, so patients should be counseled and, if high risk, provided epinephrine for late reactions. Similarly, in perioperative or refractory settings, IV epinephrine infusions require continuous monitoring and titration in a critical care environment [^114stDob] [^112vURqw].

> Let me consider the role of corticosteroids. I initially thought steroids prevent biphasic reactions, but wait, I should verify that — evidence does not support routine steroids to prevent biphasic anaphylaxis, so observation duration should not be predicated on steroid administration, and steroids should not delay epinephrine or prolonged observation when indicated by severity [^113sw2WG] [^116gpKqk].

> Next, I should review guideline convergence. WMS, JTFPP, and European statements converge on a risk-stratified approach rather than a fixed observation for all, with 1 hour for low-risk, 4–6 hours for moderate-risk, and 12–24 hours or admission for high-risk presentations, which I should apply while documenting severity, comorbidities, and response to therapy [^111v134S] [^115ZJe2T] [^1171JR9G].

> I need to ensure discharge planning is explicit. All patients should leave with at least two epinephrine autoinjectors, a written action plan, trigger avoidance counseling, and arranged allergy follow-up, and I should confirm that patients understand when to activate EMS, especially if symptoms recur or do not resolve promptly after epinephrine [^111v134S] [^113UvTnK].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical recommendation: for low-risk, fully resolved anaphylaxis after a single IM dose, observe 1 hour. For moderate-risk features or need for repeat dosing, observe 4–6 hours. For hypotension, cardiovascular instability, or severe airway compromise, observe 12–24 hours or admit, adjusting for pediatric nuances and patient-specific factors, and document the risk rationale and counseling provided [^111v134S] [^115ZJe2T] [^112ieCAf].

The recommended observation time after epinephrine administration is **at least 4–6 hours** for all patients with anaphylaxis, as this balances detection of biphasic reactions with resource use [^1117Xnnp] [^115yA4TC]. For low-risk patients with a rapid, complete response to a single dose, **1 hour may suffice** [^111v134S] [^115ZJe2T]. For high-risk patients (severe reaction, hypotension, multiple doses, or comorbidities), **extend to 12–24 hours or admit** [^1171JR9G] [^113wQe1R]. Observation should begin only after complete symptom resolution, and all patients should be discharged with two epinephrine autoinjectors and clear follow-up plans [^115NS8aH] [^116EkKQr].

---

## General principles of observation

- **Biphasic reactions**: Occur in 3–20% of anaphylaxis cases, typically within 1–8 hours, but can occur up to 72 hours after the initial reaction [^115LteXU] [^113sw2WG].

- **Risk factors**: Severe initial reaction, hypotension, multiple epinephrine doses, delayed epinephrine administration, and comorbidities increase biphasic risk [^115ZJe2T] [^113beyxM].

- **Observation start**: Begin only after complete symptom resolution and stabilization [^116EkKQr].

---

## Recommended observation times

| **Patient risk category** | **Recommended observation time** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Low-risk patients (rapid, complete response to single dose, no comorbidities) | 1 hour | 95% negative predictive value for biphasic reaction at 1 hour [^111v134S] [^115ZJe2T] |
| Standard-risk patients (most cases) | 4–6 hours | Balances detection of biphasic reactions with resource use; 4–6 hours captures most early recurrences [^1117Xnnp] [^115ZJe2T] |
| High-risk patients (severe reaction, hypotension, multiple doses, comorbidities) | 12–24 hours or admission | Prolonged observation or admission due to higher biphasic risk and potential severity [^1171JR9G] [^113wQe1R] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting observation times

- **Meta-analysis**: 1-hour observation achieves 95% negative predictive value for biphasic reactions; 6–8 hours achieves 97–98% [^111v134S] [^115ZJe2T].

- **Pediatric data**: 2-hour observation may suffice for most children; 4 hours for those with cardiovascular involvement [^112ieCAf].

- **Cost-effectiveness**: Extended observation beyond 1 hour may not be cost-effective for low-risk patients [^1128nMYj] [^112ZvVLi].

---

## Factors influencing observation duration

- **Severity of initial reaction**: Severe reactions warrant longer observation [^115ZJe2T].

- **Number of epinephrine doses**: Multiple doses indicate higher risk and longer observation [^111v134S].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Comorbidities, age, and delayed epinephrine administration increase risk [^notfound].

- **Response to treatment**: Rapid, complete resolution supports shorter observation [^111v134S].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **WMS 2022**: 1 hour for low-risk; 6–8 hours for standard-risk; 12–24 hours for high-risk [^111v134S] [^113wQe1R].

- **EAACI 2014**: 6–8 hours for respiratory compromise; 12–24 hours for circulatory instability [^1171JR9G].

- **JTFPP 2020**: Individualized, risk-stratified observation based on severity and response [^115ZJe2T].

---

## Potential risks of inadequate observation

Inadequate observation increases **biphasic reactions**, which can be severe or fatal [^111UQWWJ]. It also leads to **delayed complications**, including respiratory compromise, cardiovascular collapse, and neurologic injury [^111v134S]. Shorter observation may result in **missed biphasic reactions**, particularly in high-risk patients [^111v134S].

---

## Patient discharge criteria

Discharge requires complete symptom resolution with stable vital signs and no new symptoms for the observation period. Patients must receive **two epinephrine autoinjectors** with clear use instructions and an emergency action plan, and follow-up with allergy/immunology should be arranged [^115NS8aH] [^114GAYuM].

---

## Special considerations

Pediatric patients may be observed for **2–4 hours** based on severity and response [^112ieCAf], whereas **immunotherapy** requires at least 30 minutes post-injection, with extended observation for high-risk patients [^114stDob].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Low-risk patients**: Observe for 1 hour after complete symptom resolution.

- **Standard-risk patients**: Observe for 4–6 hours after complete symptom resolution.

- **High-risk patients**: Observe for 12–24 hours or admit.

- **All patients**: Discharge with two epinephrine autoinjectors and clear follow-up plans [^111v134S] [^115NS8aH].

---

The recommended observation time after epinephrine administration is **4–6 hours** for most patients, with shorter observation for low-risk patients and longer observation or admission for high-risk patients.

Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening, multisystem allergic reaction that can cause airway, breathing, or circulatory compromise. Intramuscular epinephrine is the immediate treatment of all patients. Intravenous epinephrine should be used in patients in shock, either as a bolus or infusion, along with fluid resuscitation. Airway obstruction must be recognized, and early intubation may be necessary. For shock that is refractory to epinephrine, additional vasopressors may be needed. Disposition depends on patient presentation and response to treatment. Mandatory observation periods are not necessary, because biphasic reactions are difficult to predict and may occur outside of typical observation periods.

Conclusions

The present analysis is consistent with prior evidence suggesting that routine prolonged medical observation of completely resolved episodes of anaphylaxis, to prevent a biphasic reaction, is not cost-effective. As the Joint Taskforce on Allergy Practice Parameters (representative of the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology and the American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology) completes its work on a Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation–based anaphylaxis practice parameter, these findings should support evidence-based guidance for postanaphylaxis observation times. Although all patients with anaphylaxis should be educated regarding risks for biphasic reactions and understand home management and thresholds for further care, those patients with risk factors that indicate a greater likelihood of biphasic anaphylaxis or higher fatality risk may benefit from more extended observation of up to 6 hours (and possibly longer in some circumstances). Conversely, it may be reasonable to discharge low-risk patients after a 1-hour observation period following resolved anaphylaxis.

### Simulation of health and economic benefits of extended observation of resolved anaphylaxis [^1128nMYj]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Because the percentage of individuals who may be at risk for biphasic anaphylaxis could vary widely, there is no clear consensus regarding how long someone presenting to an ED or outpatient allergy clinic should be observed after they are treated, and a 4- to 6-hour observation time is commonly used, although there is no evidence to suggest that this time is appropriate or necessary. The question regarding the length of observation is particularly timely, given that recent evidence suggests that immediate presentation to an ED or activation of emergency medical services (EMS) in the community setting after a food allergic reaction treated with epinephrine (vs epinephrine administration followed by watchful waiting for improvement, activating EMS only for a lack of response to treatment) was a very low-value service. The cost of seeking attention immediately regardless of response is in excess of $1 billion over the time horizon to prevent 1 fatality. Furthermore, it was only marginally cost-effective when simulated over greatly exaggerated fatality risk rates (> 100 fold) attributable to not immediately seeking emergency care. Although many standard community anaphylaxis management plans may stress prompt activation of EMS and observation in an ED after epinephrine administration, irrespective of patient response and degree of stability, it is unclear whether these actions deliver a high-value medical service or they are overly cautious and cost-ineffective. After treatment of the index anaphylaxis event, there is a wide variation in the perceived mandatory or even needed time of observation to ensure complete symptom resolution and to monitor for a potential biphasic response. Therefore, there is a need to understand both the health benefits and the economic burden of an extended observation time compared with a shortened observation time, to determine the most appropriate advisory recommendations for postanaphylaxis management. As such, we undertook a cost-effectiveness analysis to characterize value-based practice of brief vs more prolonged observation times of adult patients with resolved anaphylaxis.

Discussion

Anaphylaxis can be a life-threatening event, and there is a risk of poor response to initial therapy requiring care escalation, as well as the risk of a biphasic reaction occurring hours after an initial event was successfully treated and resolved. For this reason, persons at risk for anaphylaxis are recommended to carry at least 2 units of self-injectable epinephrine at all times, are recommended to seek emergency care after epinephrine is used, and are commonly observed for several hours after an event. However, evidence substantiating the cost-effectiveness of these practices is limited. Indeed, this analysis indicates that extended observation (beyond 1 hour) of resolved anaphylaxis may not be cost-effective (assuming a WTP of $10 000 per biphasic anaphylaxis observed), unless the risk for biphasic anaphylaxis exceeds 17% after a 1-hour symptom-free interval (vs 2.7% after 6 hours), or hourly observation costs are less than $46 for up to 6 hours (with indirect costs excluded). Cost-effectiveness could also be achieved (WTP of $10 million per death prevented) from the HCP with a baseline fatality rate of 0.33% per biphasic anaphylactic event, assuming a 24% relative risk of fatality associated with more prolonged ED observation. Although a threshold of both cost and risk can be determined to justify commonly cited observation times, whether this degree of protection could be obtained with prolonged observation is questionable. In patients with resolved anaphylaxis without high risk factors for a biphasic reaction or anaphylaxis fatality, a 1-hour period of observation may be reasonable.

### Impact of including epinephrine in the submucosal injectate for colorectal EMR on postprocedural pain: a randomized controlled trial [^115BnGnz]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

EMR is first-line therapy for colorectal laterally spreading lesions. Some colonoscopists include epinephrine in the submucosal injectate, which we observed increased postprocedure discomfort. Our aim was to determine whether inclusion of epinephrine in the submucosal injectate increases postprocedure pain after EMR.

Methods

We performed a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial comparing epinephrine in submucosal injectate versus injectate alone for abdominal pain at 30 and 60 minutes after EMR.

Results

Mean polyp diameter in both arms was > 40 mm. There were no differences in procedure times or amounts of fluid injected. Mean pain was higher on a visual analog scale in the epinephrine group at 30 minutes (47 vs 14, P = 0.022) and at 60 minutes (44 vs 13, P = 0.035). Recovery room stay was longer in the epinephrine group (68 vs 53 minutes, P = 0.034).

Conclusions

Epinephrine in the submucosal injectate for EMR increases postprocedural pain, which could cause diagnostic confusion and prolong observation time in the recovery area. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT04065451.).

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^111cNTT7]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Are additional doses of adrenaline effective in the treatment of anaphylaxis reactions refractory to initial treatment with adrenaline?

Updated recommendations

1 Subsequent doses of adrenaline should be given every 5 min, titrated to clinical response, in patients whose symptoms are refractory to initial treatment (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence).
2 Where respiratory and/or cardiovascular features of anaphylaxis persist despite 2 appropriate doses of adrenaline (administered by IM or IV route), seek urgent expert help (e.g. from experienced critical care clinicians) to establish an intravenous adrenaline infusion to treat refractory anaphylaxis (strong recommendation, low certainty evidence).
3 Low dose intravenous adrenaline infusions appear to be effective and safe to treat refractory anaphylaxis (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence).

(adapted from RCUK 2008, EAACI 2014 and ASCIA 2020 guidelines, with greater emphasis on early recognition of refractory reactions and further adrenaline treatment, preferably using a low dose IV adrenaline infusion)

### Anaphylaxis pathogenesis and treatment [^111TYwtq]. Allergy (2011). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and sometimes leads to death. Understanding mechanisms, triggers, and patient-specific risk factors for severe or fatal anaphylaxis is critically important. Diagnosis of anaphylaxis is currently based on established clinical criteria. Epinephrine (adrenaline) is the first-line medication for anaphylaxis treatment and delay in injecting it contributes to biphasic reactions, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and fatality. Here, we focus on four important areas of translational research in anaphylaxis: studies of potential new biomarkers to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis, laboratory tests to distinguish allergen sensitization from clinical risk of anaphylaxis, the primary role of epinephrine (adrenaline) in anaphylaxis treatment, and strengthening the overall evidence base for anaphylaxis treatment.

### Anaphylaxis in children [^116Rj1WX]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening event in children, commonly encountered in the prehospital and emergency department settings. Recently published clinical guidelines emphasize early recognition of anaphylaxis and administration of epinephrine as the mainstay of management. Literature regarding adjuvant therapies, biphasic reactions, observation times, and disposition of patients with anaphylaxis remains controversial. In this article, we will review the background and pathophysiology of anaphylaxis, as well as the diagnostic approach, management, and future directions of anaphylaxis in children.

### Allergen immunotherapy: a practice parameter third update [^114qxdN7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Medium credibility.

World Allergy Organization subcutaneous immunotherapy systemic reaction grading system defines Grade 1 as "Symptom(s)/sign(s) of one organ system present", Grade 2 as "Symptom(s)/sign(s) of more than one organ system present", Grade 3 includes upper airway compromise such as "Laryngeal, uvula or tongue edema with or without stridor", Grade 4 includes "Respiratory failure with or without loss of consciousness" or "Hypotension with or without loss of consciousness", and "death as grade 5" is specified. Patients might also have a feeling of impending doom, especially in grades 2, 3, or 4. Scoring includes a timing suffix for epinephrine administration: "a, 5 minutes or less; b, greater than 5 minutes to 10 minutes or less; c, greater 10 minutes to 20 minutes or less; d, greater than 20 minutes; z, epinephrine not administered". The final grade assignment process states, "The final grade of the reaction will not be determined until the event is over, regardless of the medication administered", and reporting should include timing and first symptoms: "The final report should include the first symptom(s)/sign(s) and the time of onset after the subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy injection… and a suffix reflecting if and when epinephrine was or was not administered". Early-onset symptoms require vigilance because "Symptoms occurring within the first minutes after the injection might be a sign of severe anaphylaxis. Mild symptoms can progress rapidly to severe anaphylaxis and death".

### Who needs epinephrine? Anaphylaxis, autoinjectors, and parachutes [^113ZaEmf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Although delays in using epinephrine to treat anaphylaxis are associated with adverse outcomes (eg, biphasic reactions and hospitalization), there is no evidence to suggest that epinephrine to treat nonanaphylaxis reactions prevents progression to anaphylaxis. Furthermore, there is at least one case report in the literature where early epinephrine use failed to avoid a fatal outcome. More recently, clinical trials evaluating Palforzia reported a higher rate of epinephrine use by clinicians at baseline peanut challenges in North America compared with Europe, despite very similar study protocols. Similarly, Shreffler et alreported a higher likelihood of a systemic allergic reaction in patients on treatment in Europe versus North America (odds ratio: 2.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19–3.77). Whether these observations are linked, that is, a lower threshold to use epinephrine in North America results in a lower rate of systemic allergic reactions, is speculative. However, a recent (as yet unpublished) analysis suggests that these differences may simply reflect regional variations in anaphylaxis definition and epinephrine use; there was no evidence that using epinephrine for nonanaphylaxis reactions in North America was associated with fewer severe reactions at baseline challenge (Aimmune, personal communication).

There may be some individuals for whom a lower threshold for epinephrine is indicated. For example, individuals who have previously experienced near-fatal reactions might be encouraged to use epinephrine early (ie, for significant but nonanaphylaxis symptoms) and then seek medical attention for monitoring and further treatment if needed. However, the lack of evidence to support the majority of proposed risk factors for severe reactions limits the feasibility of a risk-stratified approach. For the vast majority of patients, lowering the threshold for using epinephrine to treat nonanaphylaxis reactions is likely to result in EAI and health care overutilization (EMS activation and ED visits) and may adversely impact HRQL — while providing unclear health benefits. We would argue that it is more important for individuals at risk of anaphylaxis to be prescribed EAI and trained to recognize anaphylaxis and administer epinephrine — measures that are far more likely to reduce health risks posed by anaphylaxis.

### Epinephrine in severe allergic reactions: the European anaphylaxis register [^115xvNFW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend intramuscular administration of epinephrine as the first-line drug for the emergency treatment of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), but no randomized trial evidence supports this consensus.

Objective

We aimed to assess anaphylaxis treatment practices over 10 years, covering several European regions, all allergen sources, and all age groups.

Methods

The European Anaphylaxis Register tracks elicitors, symptoms, emergency treatment, diagnostic workups, and long-term counseling for anaphylaxis incidents through web-based data entry from tertiary allergy specialists, covering information from the emergency respondent, patient, tertiary referral, and laboratory/clinical test results.

Results

We analyzed 10,184 anaphylaxis incidents. In total, 27.1% of patients treated by a health professional received epinephrine and, in total, 10.5% received a second dose. Successful administration was less frequent in German-speaking countries (minimum 19.6%) than in Greece, France, and Spain (maximum 66.7%). Over the last decade, epinephrine administration from a health professional almost doubled to reach 30.6% in 2015–2017, half of which was applied intramuscularly. A total of 14.7% of lay- or self-treated cases were treated with an autoinjector. Of those without treatment, 22.4% carried a device for administration. No change in successful administration by lay emergency respondents was found over the last 10 years. Of the reaction and patient characteristics analyzed, only clinical severity considerably influenced the likelihood of receiving epinephrine, with 66.9% of successful administrations in near-fatal (grade IV) reactions.

Conclusions

Despite clear recommendations, only a small proportion of anaphylaxis incidents are treated with epinephrine. We demonstrated a slight increase in treated patients when handled by professionals, but stagnation in lay- or self-treated anaphylaxis. The reaction circumstances, the respondent's professional background, and patient characteristics did not explain which reactions were treated.

### Improving anaphylaxis care: the impact of a clinical pathway [^116c5ANf]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recommended durations of observation after anaphylaxis have been widely variable, with many ranging from 4 to 24 hours. Prolonged durations often prompt admission for ongoing observation.

Methods

In a multidisciplinary quality improvement initiative, we revised our emergency department (ED) anaphylaxis clinical pathway. Our primary aim was to safely decrease the recommended length of observation from 8 to 4 hours and thereby decrease unnecessary hospitalizations. Secondary aims included provider education on anaphylaxis diagnostic criteria, emphasizing epinephrine as first-line therapy, and implementing a practice of discharging ED patients with an epinephrine autoinjector in hand. The study period consisted of the 18 months before pathway revision (baseline) and the 18 months after revision.

Results

The overall admission rate decreased from 58.2% (106 of 182) in the baseline period to 25.3% (65 of 257) after pathway revision (P < .0001). There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients returning to the ED within 72 hours, and there were no adverse outcomes or deaths throughout the study period. After pathway revision, the median time to first epinephrine administration for the most critical patients was 10 minutes, and 85.4% (164 of 192) of patients were discharged with an epinephrine autoinjector in hand.

Conclusions

By revising an anaphylaxis clinical pathway, we were able to streamline the care of patients with anaphylaxis presenting to a busy pediatric ED, without any compromise in safety. Most notably, decreasing the recommended length of observation from 8 to 4 hours resulted in a near 60% reduction in the average rate of admission.

### Myths, facts and controversies in the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis [^114iYA6G]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute management

Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis according to all guidelines. It has both α-sympathomimetic and β-sympathomimetic actions, causing peripheral vasoconstriction, increased cardiac output and bronchodilation; importantly, it is the only drug that inhibits the further release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells and basophils.

Myth 4: 'Epinephrine is dangerous'

Epinephrine given by intramuscular injection into the outer mid-thigh is very safe and starts to work within minutes. Epinephrine can either be injected using a needle–syringe (using 1:1000 epinephrine, which results in a lower volume, less painful injection than if using 1:10 000) or by autoinjector device (eg, Emerade, EpiPen, Jext). Where an autoinjector is used, note that both EpiPen and Jext are only available in 150 µg and 300 µg doses, which means that the 300 µg is effectively an underdose in someone over 30 kg (this may explain why some patients require a second epinephrine dose). Younger children should be transitioned to a 300 µg dose when their body weight is > 25 kg, and some centres advocate doing so from 20 kg. Around 10%–20% of patients report transient effects including pallor, anxiety, palpitations, dizziness and headache (although these symptoms may also be due to the reaction and/or the patient's own endogenous epinephrine production).

Epinephrine is underused in the treatment of anaphylaxis, both prehospital and in emergency departments. Further intramuscular doses of epinephrine should be administered in the event of persisting respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms. Epinephrine can and should be repeated after 5 min; the administration of other medication such as antihistamines or steroids must not cause delay or distraction, as these are not first-line (or even second-line) treatments for anaphylaxis(figure 2A). An alternative summary of anaphylaxis treatment, consistent with national and international guidelines, is shown in figure 2B.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^1151Em7g]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

The Resuscitation Council UK has updated its Guideline for healthcare providers on the Emergency treatment of anaphylaxis. As part of this process, an evidence review was undertaken by the Guideline Working Group, using an internationally-accepted approach for adoption, adaptation, and de novo guideline development based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) evidence to decision (EtD) framework, referred to as GRADE-ADOLOPMENT. A number of significant changes have been made, which will be reflected in the updated Guideline. These include: emphasis on repeating intramuscular adrenaline doses after 5 min if symptoms of anaphylaxis do not resolve; corticosteroids (e.g. hydrocortisone) no longer being routinely recommended for the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis; interventions for reactions which are refractory to initial treatment with adrenaline; a recommendation against the use of antihistamines for the acute management of anaphylaxis; and guidance relating to the duration of observation following anaphylaxis, and timing of discharge.

Local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) prevention — table 2 recommendations for preventing LAST — states that "Ultrasound guidance significantly reduces the risk of LAST in humans undergoing peripheral nerve block. Nevertheless, individual reports describe LAST despite the use of ultrasound" and to "Use the lowest effective dose of local anesthetic (dose = product of volume × concentration)". It directs clinicians to "Use incremental injection of local anesthetics — administer 3 to 5 mL aliquots, pausing 15–30 seconds between each injection", with fixed-needle approaches spacing injections by "1 circulation time (∼30–45 s)" and recognizing circulation time increases "with lower extremity blocks or in those patients with diminished cardiac output". It advises to "Aspirate the needle or catheter before each injection, recognizing that there is an ∼2% false negative rate for this diagnostic intervention", and when injecting potentially toxic doses, "use of an intravascular marker is recommended", noting adult epinephrine responses ("Intravascular injection of epinephrine 10–15 μg/mL in adults produces a ≥ 10 beat heart rate increase or a ≥ 15 mm Hg systolic blood pressure increase") and pediatric responses ("Intravascular injection of epinephrine 0.5 μg/kg in children produces a ≥ 15 mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure"). Additional intravascular indicators include that "Fentanyl 100 μg produces sedation if injected intravascularly in laboring patients", and the table recommends "observation for at least 30 to 45 minutes after the block" and that "Caregivers should be aware of the additive nature of local anesthetic toxicity and adjust accordingly" across providers.

### Downstream consequences of diagnostic error in pediatric anaphylaxis [^116g6iDK]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Australian guidelines recommend four hours of observation after the last dose of epinephrine. In our cohort of the 31 children given epinephrine in ED and diagnosed with anaphylaxis, 90.3% were observed for four hours after their last epinephrine dose. Conversely, only 6 of the 17 (35.3%) who received epinephrine with an alternative diagnosis were observed for more than four hours. The reasons for shorter observation times after epinephrine administration in these patients is unclear.

Overall only 42.7% of patients were observed for more than four hours in ED. This is less than the 64% reported by Murad et al. in an Australian ED. Being correctly diagnosed with anaphylaxis significantly increased the chance a child was observed for more than four hours (56.2% vs 29.2%, p < 0.001). International recommendations for observation vary from 4 to 24 h, while some suggest admitting any patient with anaphylaxis. Previous studies have reported that only 2–6% of children with biphasic reactions require intervention. However being in a setting that can provide immediate care is potentially lifesaving.

As it is difficult to predict which children with experience biphasic reactions, guidelines continue to recommend at least four hours of observation, and a low threshold for admission. Patients and their parents must also receive appropriate education, action plans and an epinephrine autoinjector before leaving hospital to reduce the frequency and severity of future reactions.

In our cohort only 28% of patients were documented to receive a written anaphylaxis action plan, while 2.4% already had one. Only 21.3% had documentation of being given allergen avoidance advice. This is similar to the 35% reported by Rudders et al. Correct anaphylaxis diagnosis did not impact on the advice given. The importance of such advice is highlighted by the fact that 26.1% of anaphylaxis patients in our cohort had a known allergy to the causative agent. This is consistent with previously reported rates of 14–50%.

What is the optimal timing of adrenaline in the treatment of anaphylaxis?

Recommendation

Adrenaline should be administered early once symptoms of anaphylaxis have been recognized or suspected (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence).

(adopted from RCUK 2008 and EAACI 2014 guidelines)

Rationale

There is a lack of high-certainty evidence to differentiate the effect of early versus delayed administration of adrenaline on clinical outcomes. Case series (including reports of fatal anaphylaxis) suggest that early adrenaline administration for out-of-hospital anaphylaxis is associated with improved outcomes. There is no evidence that pre-emptive use of adrenaline to treat mild, non-anaphylaxis reactions prevents progression to anaphylaxis. However, despite the lack of evidence to inform the optimal timing of administration, it seems reasonable to recommend adrenaline is given as soon as features of anaphylaxis are apparent; this is the consensus reflected in international guidelines.

With respect to biphasic reactions, the 2020 JTFPP identified eight retrospective case series, three of which found that delayed administration was associated with a higher rate of biphasic reaction. A prospective cohort study of 430 anaphylaxis reactions found that delayed administration of adrenaline (more than 30 min after onset of symptoms) was associated with a higher rate of biphasic reaction (OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.13–10.18). The 2020 JTFPP concluded that "there does appear to be a trend to lower rates of biphasic reactions with earlier epinephrine administration following development of anaphylaxis".

What is the optimal route of adrenaline to treat anaphylaxis?

Updated recommendations

1 The intramuscular (IM) route is recommended for initial adrenaline treatment for anaphylaxis (strong recommendation, very low certainty evidence).
2 The intravenous (IV) route is not recommended for initial management of anaphylaxis, except in the perioperative setting (as an alternative to IM adrenaline) by those skilled and experienced in its use (good practice statement).
- In such circumstances, adrenaline should preferably be administered as an IV infusion and not as a bolus dose (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence).
3 Titrate the administration of adrenaline (by any route) against clinical response (strong recommendation, very low certainty evidence).

(adapted from RCUK 2008 and EAACI 2014 guidelines, with greater emphasis on IM route and where needed, use of IV adrenaline infusion rather than IV bolus therapy)

WHO SHOULD BE PRESCRIBED AN EPINEPHRINE AUTOINJECTOR?

Although there is some variation, anaphylaxis guidelines typically recommend EAI prescription to any patient with a history of anaphylaxis who cannot easily avoid re-exposure to the causative allergen (Table I).– Anaphylaxis to medication or radiocontrast media in isolation is not usually an indication for EAI because these allergens are generally easy to avoid outside of health care settings. Patients with latex allergy may find it challenging to avoid accidental exposure, particularly if their exposure is occupational related. Guidelines also encourage EAI prescription to patients without prior anaphylaxis but with risk factors considered to raise their risk of anaphylaxis, such as a diagnosis of asthma or a prior reaction to a "trace" amount of allergen (Table I). However, the evidence supporting many of these factors is very limited, as recently highlighted. For example, data suggest that previous mild reactions to "trace" amounts of allergenor a diagnosis of asthmado not increase the risk of anaphylaxis; although poorly controlled asthma is likely to be a risk factor, supporting evidence is lacking. Data suggest that at least for peanut allergy, "the absence of prior anaphylaxis [is likely to] reflect insufficient allergen exposure rather than an inherently lower risk of anaphylaxis". Guidelines often flag adolescents and young adults as being at higher risk (albeit still very low) of near-fatal and fatal anaphylaxis, whereas epidemiological studies show that this risk remains elevated well into the fourth decade of life.

Rather than use a risk-stratified approach to guide EAI prescription, some health care providers err on the side of caution by universally prescribing EAI to all patients at potential risk of anaphylaxis to food, venom, and/or latex. Our inability to predict future risk of severe reactions remains one of the biggest evidence gaps in allergy, although our understanding of the risk factors and/or cofactors that may exacerbate reaction severity is improving. Severe reactions can occur in allergic individuals with no prior history of anaphylaxis; likewise, many people with prior anaphylaxis do not experience it subsequently. Lack of access to epinephrine may result in treatment delay, which can be substantial, particularly in remote locations or situations where emergency response times are prolonged. Observational studies have linked delays in epinephrine administration to increased risk of a biphasic reaction and hospitalization,– as well as death, although the data are confounded by a lack of agreement as to what constitutes delayed versus timely epinephrine.

### Allergen immunotherapy: a practice parameter third update [^114stDob]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Medium credibility.

Allergen immunotherapy — observation period and delayed systemic reactions: In a prospective study, a total of 20,588 extract injections in 628 patients resulted in 52 systemic reactions in 12 patients, with 38% occurring from 30 minutes to 6 hours after administration; in another prospective study, 8% occurred more than 2 hours after injection. Most package inserts recommend a wait period of either 20 to 30 minutes or 30 minutes, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology recommends 30 minutes, and 30 minutes continues to be the recommended wait period; patients should remain in the physician's office/medical clinic for at least 30 minutes after an injection. Delayed systemic reactions, defined as occurring after the 30-minute wait period, can occur and, in general, are not severe and have been reported to account for 27% to 50% of all systemic reactions; one retrospective study reported 50% of systemic reactions as delayed and noted that almost all serious reactions occurred within 30 minutes. Some physicians might request that patients considered at increased risk carry injectable epinephrine.

Myth 5: 'Antihistamines can be used to treat anaphylaxis initially; epinephrine is only needed if symptoms worsen'

Histamine is only one of many inflammatory mediators released during anaphylaxis. Oral antihistamines take around 30 min for onset of effect; intravenous chlorphenamine has a faster onset, but can cause hypotension. Antihistamines are not effective against anaphylaxis: their prophylactic use during controlled immunotherapy does not prevent anaphylaxis, and any apparent response during acute management of reactions is most likely due to the patient's own endogenous epinephrine. Antihistamines have now been relegated to third-line therapy in international guidelines; their use is limited to the relief of cutaneous symptoms and should never delay the administration of epinephrine or fluid resuscitation during patient stabilisation.

Myth 6: 'Corticosteroids prevent delayed or biphasic reactions in anaphylaxis'

Historically, corticosteroids have been used to prevent protracted and biphasic reactions (the latter defined as a recurrence of symptoms within 72 hours of initial anaphylaxis, without re-exposure to the trigger). However, this has never been tested in a randomised clinical trial; more recent evidence has cast doubt over their efficacy. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis included 27 studies with 4114 anaphylaxis cases, of whom 192 (4.7%) had biphasic reactions. Steroid administration did not affect the likelihood of a late phase reaction (OR 1.52, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.43). In fact, there was a non-significant trend towards increased risk, although this is probably because steroid use was more common with severe reactions. Biphasic reactions were more common where hypotension was present at initial reaction (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.14 to 4.15), but this is unusual in food-induced anaphylaxis. The median time to onset of biphasic symptoms was 11 (range 0.2–72) hours, that is, 50% of reactions occurred > 11 hours after initial reaction. This is relevant because current guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends patients over 16 years are observed for 6–12 hours after anaphylaxis (children under 16 should be admitted). In reality, it is generally accepted that prolonged observation may not be required following a straightforward reaction in someone who already has a comprehensive management plan and rescue medication (including epinephrine autoinjectors) in place.

### Simulation of health and economic benefits of extended observation of resolved anaphylaxis [^111v2Cre]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Anaphylaxis is an acute event that represents a life-threatening emergency. Although estimates vary, the lifetime prevalence of anaphylaxis ranges between 1.6% to 5.1%, with an incidence of 42 cases per 100 000 person-years. Leading causes of anaphylaxis include medications, foods, and stinging insects, although many cases are idiopathic. Fatal anaphylaxis is rare, with an overall estimated prevalence of 0.47 to 0.69 cases per million persons. Although anaphylaxis-associated hospitalizations have increased, case-fatality rates have remained stable at 0.25% to 0.33% of hospitalizations or emergency department (ED) visits for anaphylaxis.

Biphasic anaphylaxis is a potential sequela of resolved anaphylaxis, by definition occurring after anaphylaxis has been treated and completely resolved for at least 1 hour. Biphasic anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and has been reported to occur up to 78 hours after the initial episode of anaphylaxis. It is important to distinguish biphasic anaphylaxis from a protracted (incompletely responsive) initial anaphylactic episode, as well as to differentiate repeated anaphylactic episodes from subsequent reexposure to an unidentified trigger. Biphasic anaphylaxis may occur in less than 1% to 20% of individuals with anaphylaxis, and its occurrence is difficult to predict with any certainty. Specific treatments for biphasic anaphylaxis have not been well studied, but at present, standard practice focuses on management with rapid administration of intramuscular epinephrine — management identical to the treatment of index anaphylaxis. Although antihistamines and glucocorticoids are frequently used in an attempt to prevent biphasic anaphylaxis, clear evidence supporting a benefit associated with this practice is scant. In the community setting, epinephrine autoinjectors in the United States are now administered as a twin-pack (2 devices) only, secondary to the risk of a poorly responsive primary reaction or the risk of a biphasic reaction, and individuals are advised to carry both units on their person at all times.

### Effect of chronic β-blockade on the utility of an epinephrine-containing test dose to detect intravascular injection in nonsedated patients [^115Q2dqL]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

A test dose containing epinephrine is routinely used during epidural blockade to detect accidental intravenous needle or catheter placement before the administration of local anesthetics to avert local anesthetic systemic toxicity. β-Blocker therapy may interfere with the expected hemodynamic response from an intravascular injection. This study describes a cohort of 24 patients and their response to an epinephrine test dose (ie, if expected increased heart rates during test-dose administration are valid in this population.)

Methods

Twenty-four nonsedated, chronically β-blocked patients were enrolled in a prospective, order-randomized, crossover, double-blind study with injections of both placebo and a 15-μg epinephrine test dose in each individual. After injection into a peripheral vein, we observed blood pressure and pulse rate for 5 minutes, injected the other remaining solution (placebo or epinephrine), and observed hemodynamic parameters in the same fashion.

Results

Epinephrine raised the heart rate 17.8 beats per minute (bpm) (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.5–20.1) versus placebo 2.0 bpm (95% CI, -0.3–4.3 P < 0.001) and the systolic blood pressure 23 mm Hg (95% CI, 17.2–28.9) versus placebo 4.4 (95% CI, -1.5–10.3); P < 0.001 in our chronically β-blocked population. A threshold increase of 20 bpm yielded a sensitivity of 37.5% (95% CI, 18.8%-59.4%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI, 85.8%-100%). Revising a threshold to include a change of 10 bpm or increase in systolic blood pressure of 15 mm Hg or greater yielded 100% (95% CI, 85.8%-100%) sensitivity and 87.5% (95% CI, 67.6%-97.3%) specificity.

Conclusions

Epinephrine test-dose administration in nonsedated, chronically β-blocked patients cannot distinguish intravenous injection at the classic threshold increase of 20 bpm. The response in individuals is varied, and thresholds for a positive test need revising for this population of patients on therapeutic β-blockers.

WHAT SYMPTOMS SHOULD PROMPT EPINEPHRINE ADMINISTRATION?

Anaphylaxis lies along a spectrum of allergic symptoms (Figure 1), ranging from mild-moderate respiratory symptoms to circulatory shock ("anaphylactic shock"). IM epinephrine should be used to treat all anaphylaxis reactions, including those with less severe symptoms. Although fatal reactions occur despite epinephrine use, appropriate and timely epinephrine administration may buy time until patients can be resuscitated in a health care setting. This is supported by data showing that fatal reactions progress rapidly, with the median time to respiratory or cardiac arrest of 30 minutes for foods and 15 minutes for venom. The challenges of recognizing anaphylaxis and the inconsistent use of epinephrine are well documented in both health care and community settings. Even in specialist food challenge settings, underuse of epinephrine for anaphylaxis is common. Patients and caregivers also face challenges recognizing anaphylaxis and determining when to administer EAI. They are unlikely to have formal medical training and may be hesitant to use EAI because of needle phobia or reluctance to activate emergency medical services (EMS) or attend the ED afterward. Alarmingly, in a survey of 245 food-allergic teenagers with anaphylaxis, epinephrine was used in only 17% of cases; it was administered in only 50% of patients with loss of consciousness, 23% with breathing difficulties, and 15% with wheeze.

Inconsistencies in anaphylaxis definitions may contribute to variation in epinephrine use. Although guidelines concur that the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis is IM epinephrine, they do not necessarily agree on which signs and symptoms constitute anaphylaxis (Table II).– There is general agreement that patients with cardiovascular and/or respiratory involvement should be treated with epinephrine. However, there are gray areas where the need for epinephrine is less clear — such as vocal hoarseness (signaling laryngeal edema) without respiratory compromise, mild wheeze without obvious respiratory compromise, or subjective respiratory symptoms (eg, chest tightness). In such scenarios, one approach, at least in health care settings, might be to administer epinephrine only if symptoms worsen or do not resolve. However, does this send the wrong message to patients and caregivers — that as health care professionals, we are looking for reasons not to administer epinephrine?

### Epinephrine 0.15 pediatrics [^117DNdKN]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Use your epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector for treatment of anaphylaxis as prescribed by your healthcare provider, regardless of your medical conditions or the medicines you take.

How should I use the epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector?

Use your single-dose epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to use it. You may need to use a second epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector if symptoms continue or come back while you wait for emergency help or if the first auto-injector is activated before the dose can be given. If you need more than 2 doses of epinephrine for a single anaphylaxis episode, more doses must be administered by a healthcare provider.
Epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector should be injected into the middle of your outer thigh (upper leg). It can be injected through your clothing if needed. Do not inject into a vein or into the buttocks, fingers, toes, hands or feet.
Read and make sure you understand the Instructions for Use at the end of this Patient Information leaflet to learn the right way to use the epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector.
Your healthcare provider will show you how to safely use the epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector.
It is very important that you hold the epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector down firmly on the middle of the outer thigh (upper leg) for at least 3 full seconds. If you do not hold it in place long enough, the epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector might not have time to deliver the correct dose of medicine.
Caution: Never put your thumb, fingers or hand over the orange needle end. Never press or push the orange needle end with your thumb, fingers or hand. The needle comes out of the orange needle end. Accidental injection into fingers, hands or feet may cause a loss of blood flow to these areas. If an accidental injection happens, go immediately to the nearest emergency room.
Warning: Do not flip the blue safety top off using a thumb or by pulling it sideways, or by bending and twisting the blue safety top. This may cause the device to activate by accident: a "pop" is heard, the orange needle end is extended and the medicine viewing window is blocked. A device that has been activated by accident cannot be used in an emergency. If this happens, replace it with a new epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector.
When you are ready to inject, pull the blue safety top straight up and away from the auto-injector.
Your epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector may come in a package with a gray trainer and separate Trainer Instructions for Use. The gray trainer contains no medicine and no needle. Keep the trainer and the real epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector away from young children. The real epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector and trainer are not toys. For young children, use of the trainer and the real epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector should be supervised by an adult. Regularly practice with your gray trainer in non-emergency situations to make sure you can safely use the real epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector in an emergency. Always carry your 2 real epinephrine injection, USP auto-injectors with you in case of an allergic emergency. Additional training information is available at www.epipen.com.
Do not drop the protective case or epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector. If the protective case or auto-injector is dropped, check for damage and leakage. If damage or leakage is noticed or suspected, throw away (dispose of) the epinephrine injection, USP auto-injector and protective case and replace it.

### Knowledge gaps in the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis [^112bwVoj]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Knowledge gaps in the diagnosis and treatment of anaphylaxis impede the clinician's ability to effectively manage patients with anaphylaxis. This review will emphasize the lack of a global consensus on defining and determining the severity of anaphylaxis; the need for validating biomarkers used for diagnosing anaphylaxis; and data collection deficiencies. Perioperative anaphylaxis has a wide differential diagnosis, often requires treatment beyond epinephrine, and poses a challenge for the clinician in identifying the responsible trigger(s) and in preventing future reactions. Consensus-derived definitions and determination of risk factors for biphasic, refractory, and persistent anaphylaxis are needed, recognizing that these often affect the emergency department observation time after recovery from initial anaphylaxis. Knowledge gaps exist in the use of epinephrine, including route of administration, dosage, needle length, and ideal timing for administration. Consensus is needed on when and how many epinephrine autoinjectors to prescribe and how to prevent patient underuse and accidental injury. The role of antihistamines and corticosteroids in the prevention and treatment of anaphylaxis requires consensus and additional research. A consensus-derived algorithm for management of idiopathic anaphylaxis is needed. The role of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the incidence, severity, and treatment of anaphylaxis remains unanswered. Rapid recognition and treatment of anaphylaxis in the community needs improvement. The article will conclude with exploring the recommended components of both a patient-specific and generic anaphylaxis emergency plan, including when to activate emergency medical services, all of which are paramount to improving patient outcomes.

### Simulation of health and economic benefits of extended observation of resolved anaphylaxis [^114nPBEh]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

This is the first study, to our knowledge, to explore the health and economic outcomes regarding postanaphylaxis medical observation times for patients receiving treatment in an ED. Coupled with earlier work that questions the value of activating EMS for stable patients (even after having received epinephrine for a severe allergic reaction) who do not worsen under at-home observation, this does represent a potential opportunity to reevaluate anaphylaxis care, recognizing that the specter of costly services (both in terms of time and money spent) for such EMS activation and prolonged ED observation may serve to deter some patients from using epinephrine in cases of severe reactions. For low-risk patients with resolved anaphylaxis, ongoing medical observation could potentially represent an area of preference-sensitive care where shared decision-making could be of value. In instances where either patients or clinicians are less comfortable with at-home management or are less familiar and experienced with anaphylaxis or epinephrine use, or postdischarge access to epinephrine or medical care is questionable, extended observation may still be reasonable for lower risk patients. Likewise, extending the observation time for resolved anaphylaxis from 6 to 24 hours may represent a cost-ineffective strategy for many patients. However, in some circumstances and settings, prolonged observation may be clinically warranted and health and economic outcomes justified, and there could be consideration for preference-sensitive care in certain scenarios regarding shorter vs more prolonged observation time. Specific situations that may be identified in the future that could support more extended observations include patients with risk factors associated with a higher rate of biphasic anaphylaxis after discharge (ie, requiring multiple doses of epinephrine or receiving epinephrine after a considerable time delay, such as > 30–60 minutes), a greater risk for fatality associated with biphasic anaphylaxis (ie, comorbidities such as cardiac or respiratory disease), or low costs of medical observation and job-related opportunity costs.

### Downstream consequences of diagnostic error in pediatric anaphylaxis [^111QTAd3]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

While delays in epinephrine administration result in increased hospitalization and fatalities, anaphylactic reactions can naturally resolve without epinephrine. There are no guidelines recommending that anaphylaxis patients who are no longer symptomatic should receive epinephrine. It may be reasonable to withhold epinephrine in asymptomatic patients as long as they are appropriately observed and followed up due to the risks of biphasic and recurrent reactions.

In our cohort many cases of anaphylaxis were treated with less effective medications. 78 (37.0%) patients received pharmacological treatment without epinephrine administration. This included 44 (20.8%) patients receiving steroids and 75(35.5%) patients receiving an antihistamine without also being given epinephrine. Overall 55.5% of patients received steroids and 81.5% of patients received an H1 antihistamine at some point in their care. These results are similar to those found in the Australian literature with steroid rates reported between 44–77% an antihistamine use reported as between 44–88% in pediatric anaphylaxis. Australian guidelines acknowledge that while steroid use is common, their benefits in anaphylaxis is unproven and that antihistamines have no role in acute management of anaphylaxis.

There were seven biphasic reactions recorded in our study, making up 3% of all reactions. This is at the low end of the 3–14.7% reported in the literature. The biphasic reactions identified in our cohort were clinically significant as five required epinephrine while one patient was admitted to ICU.

Biphasic reactions can occur between 1 to 72 h after the resolution of initial symptoms. In our cohort the median time to biphasic reactions was 1.92 h (IQR 1.14–2.41). There was one outlier with a reaction occurring after 10.2 h. The median time in our small cohort is significantly less than the 4.7 h (IQR 3.3–7) reported by Mehr et al. and 8.8 h (range 3–20.5) reported by Alqurashi et al. although these studies included follow-up of patients after hospital discharge.

Allergen immunotherapy — administration setting and observation requirements state that immunotherapy should be administered in a setting that permits the prompt recognition and management of adverse reactions, with the preferred location being the prescribing physician's office; patients can receive injections at another health care facility if staff are trained and equipped, and patients should wait at the physician's office/medical clinic for at least 30 minutes after the immunotherapy injection or injections. Immunotherapy injections should be withheld if the patient presents with an acute asthma exacerbation, and for patients with asthma, consider measuring the peak expiratory flow rate before administering an immunotherapy injection and withholding an immunotherapy injection if the peak expiratory flow rate is considered low for that patient.

### Myths, facts and controversies in the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis [^1174GY9b]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Delays in treating with epinephrine are a risk factor for fatal outcome: it is this, as well as our inability to predict severe reactions, which drives the provision of epinephrine autoinjectors. A summary of recent guidelines on who should be prescribed autoinjectors is summarised in table 1. Healthcare professionals must consider the patient/family preference: if prescription boosts patient confidence and allows them to lead a less restrictive life, then autoinjectors should be part of the management plan. However, this requires actual carriage: the autoinjectors need to be available at all times, otherwise prescription is pointless.

Factors to be considered as part of the risk assessment on whether to prescribe epinephrine autoinjectors

Controversy exists over the number of autoinjectors to be prescribed. The BSACI and ASCIA in general recommend one device (for school children, one device for home and a second for school, while in the USA, physicians will generally prescribe two devices). In 2014, following an extensive review of epinephrine autoinjectors prompted by a coronial inquest, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued guidance that individuals at risk of anaphylaxis should carry two epinephrine autoinjectors at all times due to 'uncertainties about the site of drug delivery and the speed of epinephrine action within the body', which, together with device misuse or malfunction, might result in a second dose being needed. The BSACI guidance (issued after the 2014 statement) recommends a single device on the basis that one dose is usually effective for most reactions. The MHRA recently reiterated its policy, in line with new Department of Health guidance for school children at risk of anaphylaxisThe MHRA review also addressed a concern that in some individuals (predominantly adolescent and adult women), the needle length in some autoinjectors may be insufficient to deliver an intramuscular (rather than subcutaneous) injection, although data to inform this are limited. At the current time, prescribing practice remains divided among UK healthcare professionals.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^115LteXU]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The recurrence of anaphylaxis symptoms following initial resolution may be a "biphasic" reaction but can also represent (and be difficult to distinguish from) protracted anaphylaxis with a transient response to adrenaline, or in the case of food-induced reactions, further allergen absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Historical guidelines have suggested a rate of up to 20% for biphasic reactions, however a recent meta-analysis reported a pooled rate of 4.6% (95% CI 4.0–5.3). A rate of 4.7% has been reported in the European Anaphylaxis Registry. In a prospective case series of anaphylaxis presenting to Emergency Departments, delayed deteriorations were noted in 17% (55/315) of reactions, of which 29 (9.2%) required treatment with adrenaline.

Contradictory ranges for the onset of biphasic symptoms are reported in the literature. The WAO 2011 guideline states that symptoms can recur within 1–72 h (usually within 8–10 h). Median times reported in the literature range from 1.7 (Interquartile range 0.7–4.3) hoursto 11 h i.e. 50% of biphasic reactions began more than 11 h after initial symptoms. In the European Anaphylaxis Registry, one third of biphasic reactions occurred more than 12 h after initial symptoms.

The optimal duration of observation following anaphylaxis is unknown. The previous RCUK guideline recommended patients should be observed for at least 6 h, on the basis of data from the UK Fatal Anaphylaxis Register which found that in cases reported to 2000, death never occurred more than 6 h after contact with the trigger. However, in an updated analysis in 2014, 2.5% of fatalities happened > 6 h after allergen exposure. In 2011, NICE concluded there was "no evidence on the effectiveness of observing people… or how long people should be observed after a suspected anaphylactic reaction", but in line with RCUK, recommended 6–12 h observation from the onset of symptoms. The published literature clearly indicates that this strategy will miss over 50% of biphasic reactions.NICE recommends that patients under 16 years should be admitted to hospital under a paediatric team to ensure that "children and their parents or carers… receive the appropriate care (for example, paediatric assessment, counselling, education) following emergency treatment". However, NICE acknowledges that "shorter observation periods could be warranted in those who seek and respond quickly to treatment", particularly in those with a prior diagnosis who already have a management plan and appropriate rescue medication including AAIs.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines on anaphylaxis [^111v134S]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Post-treatment observation after anaphylaxis — The length of observation for patients after successful treatment of anaphylaxis is not clearly established, and ideally observation should occur in a hospital or setting able to treat recurrence of symptoms and address respiratory or hemodynamic decompensation. A recent meta-analysis concluded that 1 h of observation post-treatment achieved a 95% negative predictive value for detecting a biphasic reaction, and 6 and 8 h of observation achieved a 97% and 98% negative predictive value, respectively. Based on these findings, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology has proposed that patients with nonsevere presentations, a prompt response to treatment, and low risk for a biphasic reaction be observed in a medical center for 1 h before discharge, while patients with a more severe presentation, significant comorbidities, or requiring multiple doses of epinephrine may benefit from a prolonged observation period up to 6 h or longer. European guidelines have suggested a minimum monitoring period of 6 to 8 h for patients presenting with respiratory compromise and 12 to 24 h for patients with hypotension. After observation and discharge, patients should receive an epinephrine prescription and be advised to follow up for allergy testing and consideration of immunotherapy. Recommendations note that the length of observation after treatment of anaphylaxis depends on the severity of the initial reaction and risk factors for a biphasic reaction (1C).

Stinging insect hypersensitivity — epinephrine prescribing and education: Patients who have experienced a systemic reaction to an insect sting should be referred to an allergist and should be given a prescription for an injectable epinephrine device, be instructed in its proper use, and be advised to carry it with them at all times. Some patients who experience anaphylaxis might require more than one injection of epinephrine, so prescription of more than 1 epinephrine injector should be considered, and patients and advocates who might administer epinephrine should be taught how and when to give it. Although coexisting conditions or concomitant medications might require special attention, there is no contraindication to the use of epinephrine in a life-threatening situation, such as anaphylaxis. In patients with relatively low risk, the decision to carry epinephrine can be determined by discussion, and low-risk patients include those receiving maintenance VIT and those who have discontinued VIT after more than 5 years of treatment.

### Biphasic anaphylactic reactions [^111UQWWJ]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the impact of the second phase of a biphasic response on the required observation time after resolution of symptoms that occurred during the initial phase.

Data Sources

We performed a MEDLINE search of the literature for studies published between January 1970 and January 2005 on biphasic response using the keywords anaphylaxis, biphasic anaphylaxis, late phase reaction, and early phase reaction.

Study Selection

Prospective studies, retrospective studies, and case reports were selected for inclusion in this review.

Results

The incidence of biphasic anaphylactic reactions as described in the literature is highly variable, ranging from a low of 1% to a high of 20% of episodes. There is no clear consensus regarding distinguishing features of the primary response that predicts the occurrence of a secondary response. However, the severity of the reaction, the time of onset after administration of antigen before the occurrence of symptoms of the primary response, the presence of hypotension or laryngeal edema during the primary response, and the history of a previous biphasic reaction have all been mentioned as risk factors in various studies. The severity of the late-phase reaction is highly variable, and events have ranged from mild to severe with rare fatalities. Most late-phase reactions, however, are mild to moderate in severity. A delay in the administration of epinephrine and too small a dose of epinephrine given for the primary response have also been mentioned as risk factors. It is unclear whether corticosteroids given for the primary event can prevent or ameliorate the second reaction.

Conclusions

Biphasic responses occur with significant frequency and therefore should be taken into consideration when one considers the observation period after the initial event. An observation period of 8 hours is sufficient for most reactions, but since reactions can occur as long as 72 hours after resolution of the primary event, some authors have recommended a 24-hour waiting period.

Postincident management and incident reporting

The National Allergy Council recommends standardized data collection at a jurisdictional level to allow for national pooling of deidentified data to facilitate improved risk minimization and to inform policy.

When an allergic reaction occurs in a school, the following information should be collected: child's details (name, age, known allergies); date and time of the reaction; whether the child has an ASCIA Action Plan for anaphylaxis or for allergic reactions; likely cause of the reaction and if it was a known allergen; details of the staff who provided assistance and/or first aid; signs and symptoms observed; whether the ASCIA Action Plan was followed; location of the child when the reaction occurred and where the child was treated; positioning of the child; whether a prescribed and/or general use AI was used, and why (eg, general use injector was closer than the student's own injector); how long after observing signs of anaphylaxis the AI was administered; what medications were provided, including additional doses of adrenaline; whether an ambulance called and whether the child was taken by stretcher to the ambulance; whether the child was transported to a hospital or medical facility; whether the parent or emergency contact was called; and any other additional relevant information. In addition, allergic reactions to packaged food or food served by a food service provider after the allergy had been declared should be reported to the jurisdiction's health department for investigation. This will enable investigation to determine whether a product recall is required or if additional food allergen management measures are required to be put into place by the food service provider.

When an incident occurs, staff should meet after the event to discuss the incident for emotional processing and to discuss any areas of improvement in the management of the anaphylaxis. The child's individualized anaphylaxis care plan should be reviewed and updated, and support, such as counseling, should be offered to staff and children as required.

### Who needs epinephrine? Anaphylaxis, autoinjectors, and parachutes [^114DcQUN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

International guidelines stipulate that intramuscular (IM) epinephrine (adrenaline) is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, with an established good safety profile. The availability of epinephrine autoinjectors (EAI) has greatly facilitated the lay administration of IM epinephrine in community settings. However, key areas of uncertainty remain around epinephrine usage. These include variations in prescribing EAI, what symptoms should prompt epinephrine administration, whether emergency medical services (EMS) need to be contacted after administration, and whether epinephrine administered via EAI reduces mortality from anaphylaxis or improves quality of life measures. We provide a balanced commentary on these issues. There is increasing recognition that a poor response to epinephrine, particularly after 2 doses, is a useful marker of severity and the need for urgent escalation. It is likely that patients who respond to a single epinephrine dose do not require EMS activation or emergency department transfer, but data are needed to demonstrate the safety of this approach. Lastly, patients at risk of anaphylaxis must be counseled against over-reliance on EAI alone.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines on anaphylaxis [^114yXqEr]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society anaphylaxis — epinephrine primary treatment and initial management: Epinephrine is the essential, primary treatment that should be given once anaphylaxis has been diagnosed (1A). Given its effectiveness and rapid administration, intramuscular (IM) epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. The preferred injection site is the anterolateral thigh, followed by the deltoid (1B). Over-the-counter, metered-dose inhalers of epinephrine have not been found to be a practical or effective treatment for anaphylaxis (1B). Delay in epinephrine administration has been repeatedly associated with fatal anaphylaxis. Epinephrine may be given intravenous (IV) as a continuous infusion or intermittent boluses when anaphylactic shock is refractory to repeated IM injections (see "Dosage" and "Refractory Anaphylaxis" sections). If possible, separating the patient from the inciting allergen is prudent, but vomiting should not be induced to eliminate a food-based allergen (1C).

### Anaphylaxis management plans for the acute and long-term management of anaphylaxis: a systematic review [^1133JK91]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Anaphylaxis management plans (AMPs) are increasingly advocated to improve outcomes and reduce the risk of recurrence in persons with anaphylaxis. A recent systematic review investigating their effectiveness failed to identify any randomized controlled trial evidence to guide clinical decision making.

Objectives

We sought to identify and describe available AMPs, assess their acceptability and likely effectiveness, and understand potential facilitators and barriers to their use.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of published, unpublished, and ongoing epidemiologic and qualitative studies, searching 13 international databases and contacting an international panel of anaphylaxis experts. Studies were critically appraised using established international criteria and thematically synthesized.

Results

Nineteen of 789 potentially eligible studies identified satisfied our inclusion criteria. A number of AMPs exist, and other than agreement on the central importance of early administration of self-administered epinephrine, there is a range of perspectives on what should be included. AMPs are acceptable to patients/caregivers and might considerably reduce the risk of recurrence. This latter finding needs to be interpreted with caution given the substantial risk of bias in the limited number of intervention studies conducted. Access to specialists, problems with follow-up, and indemnity considerations relating to emergency administration of epinephrine in schools are important structural barriers to their wider use.

Conclusions

There are currently no universally accepted AMPs. The available evidence to support use of self-management plans is encouraging but is, in comparison with other long-term conditions, such as asthma, extremely weak. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of AMPs need to be formally evaluated.

DOES EPINEPHRINE SAVE LIVES?

On the basis of observational studies in humans and animal models of anaphylaxis, epinephrine is clearly an effective treatment for anaphylaxis. A systematic review and meta-analysis reported that 2.2% (95% CI: 1.1%-4.1%) of allergic reactions fail to respond to 2 epinephrine doses, and 0.3% (95% CI: 0.1%-1.3%) are treated with 4 or more doses. Reports of severe anaphylaxis reactions (typically venom-induced) clearly show that some reactions require much more epinephrine than can be delivered using 1 or 2 EAI devices.– Fatal outcomes can occur despite the timely administration of epinephrine. In a case series of 32 fatal anaphylaxis events, at least 4 patients received epinephrine in a timely manner. In the United Kingdom, at least one-third of fatalities due to food-induced anaphylaxis occurred despite timely epinephrine administration. There are many potential reasons for a suboptimal response to epinephrine (see Table V), and identifying individuals at risk of a suboptimal response has proven challenging. –

Overall, there can be no doubt that epinephrine can save lives, but whether epinephrine administered via EAI reduces mortality is difficult to assess. Fatal anaphylaxis is fortunately very rare, and the rate of fatality has remained stable in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom over the past 2 to 3 decades, despite evidence of a significant increase in EAI prescriptions over the same time period. Irrespectively, there are clear benefits to prescribing EAI. Individuals with EAI report that their allergies are taken more seriously and may feel more confident. It is also possible that patients who have administered EAI have a more rapid EMS response than those without EAI, although formal data are lacking. Thus, EAI prescription may have important "indirect" benefits for reducing morbidity from anaphylaxis, although patient values and preferences are sure to impact these outcomes. We therefore recommend shared decision-making when prescribing EAI to reduce the potential risk of an adverse impact on HRQL – and improve compliance with both EAI carriage and appropriate use.

With the lack of data that EAI reduce mortality, individuals at risk of anaphylaxis must be counseled to administer epinephrine early to treat anaphylaxis and activate EMS for persistent or worsening symptoms. For health care professionals, there is increasing recognition that a suboptimal response to 2 doses of epinephrine can be a useful indicator of anaphylaxis severity – and should prompt urgent escalation and consideration of a low-dose intravenous epinephrine infusion along with intravenous fluid support.

2.1 General Considerations

Inspect visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration; solution should be clear and colorless. Do not use if the solution is colored or cloudy, or if it contains particulate matter.

2.2 Anaphylaxis

Inject Adrenalin intramuscularly or subcutaneously into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh, through clothing if necessary. When administering to a child, to minimize the risk of injection related injury, hold the leg firmly in place and limit movement prior to and during an injection. The injection may be repeated every 5 to 10 minutes as necessary. For intramuscular administration, use a needle long enough (at least 1/2 inch) to ensure the injection is administered into the muscle. Monitor the patient clinically for the severity of the allergic reaction and potential cardiac effects of the drug, and repeat as needed. Do not administer repeated injections at the same site, as the resulting vasoconstriction may cause tissue necrosis.

Adults and Children 30 kg (66 lbs) or more: 0.3 to 0.5 mg (0.3 to 0.5 mL) of undiluted Adrenalin administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh, up to a maximum of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) per injection, repeated every 5 to 10 minutes as necessary. Monitor clinically for reaction severity and cardiac effects.

Children less than 30 kg (66 lbs): 0.01 mg/kg (0.01 mL/kg) of undiluted Adrenalin administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh, up to a maximum of 0.3 mg (0.3 mL) per injection, repeated every 5 to 10 minutes as necessary.

### Prevention of anaphylaxis: the role of the epinephrine auto-injector [^115tCTDo]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition, with at-risk individuals remaining at chronic high risk of recurrence. Anaphylaxis is frequently underrecognized and undertreated by healthcare providers. The first-line pharmacologic intervention for anaphylaxis is epinephrine, and guidelines uniformly agree that its prompt administration is vital to prevent progression, improve patient outcomes, and reduce hospitalizations and fatalities. Healthcare costs potentially associated with failure to provide epinephrine (hospitalizations and emergency department visits) generally exceed those of its provision. At-risk patients are prescribed epinephrine auto-injectors to facilitate timely administration in the event of an anaphylactic episode. Despite guideline recommendations that patients carry 2 auto-injectors at all times, a significant proportion of patients fail to do so, with cost of medicine cited as one reason for this lack of adherence. With the increase of high-deductible healthcare plans, patient adherence to recommendations may be further affected by increased cost sharing. The recognition and classification of epinephrine as a preventive medicine by both the US Preventive Services Task Force and insurers could increase patient access, improve outcomes, and save lives.

### Evaluating practice patterns of observation periods status post epinephrine administration for anaphylaxis [^1117Xnnp]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening emergency requiring use of epinephrine and subsequent observation period. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) suggests that patients with resolved anaphylaxis should be observed for at least 4–6 h to monitor for biphasic reactions.

Study Objectives

The primary objective was to investigate practice patterns in observation time in the emergency department (ED) for anaphylaxis after epinephrine administration. Secondary objectives included the adjunct medical management, allergens, and frequency of biphasic reactions.

Methods

A retrospective chart review from January 2017 to September 2022. Patients ≥ 18 years of age who presented with anaphylaxis requiring epinephrine administration and a documented observation period after, qualified. There were 1751 male and female patients identified; only 488 met criteria. There were 1263 patients excluded for no epinephrine administration.

Results

The median number of minutes observed in the ED after epinephrine administration for all patients was 235 min (95% confidence interval [CI] 251.50–285.16, SD = 187.28); 21 patients (4.29%) experienced a biphasic reaction. Patients with biphasic reactions were observed for a median of 451.38 min (95% CI 320.29–582.47, SD = 297.99). Patients without a biphasic reaction were observed for a median of 262.13 min (95% CI 245.43–278.83, SD = 181.47, p < 0.05). No statistically significant relationship was found between the timing of epinephrine administration after symptom onset and frequency of biphasic reaction (p = 0.57).

Conclusions

Observation time after epinephrine administration on the index ED visit was comparable with the NIAID-suggested 4 to 6 h. Patients with biphasic reactions were observed longer than those without a biphasic reaction.

### Biphasic anaphylaxis: a review of the literature and implications for emergency management [^115yA4TC]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The biphasic reaction is a feared complication of anaphylaxis management in the emergency department (ED). The traditional recommended ED observation time is 4–6 h after complete resolution of symptoms for every anaphylaxis patient. However, there has been great controversy regarding whether this standard of care is evidence-based.

Methods

Articles were selected using a PubMed, MEDLINE search for the keywords "biphasic anaphylaxis", yielding 155 articles. Articles were filtered by English language, and the keyword biphasic in the title. Case reports and case series were excluded, narrowing to 33 articles. Then, articles were filtered by relevance to the ED setting, and studies conducted in outpatient clinic settings were excluded, narrowing the search to 16 articles. All remaining articles were reviewed and findings were discussed.

Results

The reported mean time to onset between the resolution of initial anaphylaxis and biphasic reaction ranges widely by study from 1 to 72 h with the majority of studies reporting the mean time to onset > 8 h. A delay between anaphylaxis symptom onset and administration of epinephrine of 60–190 min was reported to correlate with biphasic anaphylaxis in three studies. Anaphylaxis requiring > 1 dose of epinephrine to achieve symptom resolution was also reported to correlate with biphasic reactions in two studies. No definitive conclusions about the role of corticosteroids in preventing biphasic reactions can be made at this time however; a couple small studies have shown that they may decrease the incidence of biphasic reactions. Additional risk factors correlated with biphasic reaction vary widely between studies and the generalizability of these risk factors is questionable.

Conclusions

There is a need for further research to identify true risk factors associated with biphasic anaphylaxis and to clearly define the role of corticosteroids in biphasic reactions. However, given the low incidence and rare mortality of biphasic reactions, patients who receive epinephrine within one hour of symptom onset and who respond to epinephrine with rapid and complete symptom resolution can probably be discharged from the ED with careful return precautions and education without the need for prolonged observation.

Regarding medical management for anaphylaxis, more specifically with respect to epinephrine, patient-delivered, EAACI 2014 guidelines recommend to consider prescribing a second epinephrine autoinjector in patients with any of the following:

- coexisting unstable or moderate-to-severe, persistent asthma and a food allergy, excluding pollen food syndrome

- coexisting mast cell diseases and/or elevated baseline tryptase concentration

- lack of rapid access to medical assistance to manage an episode of anaphylaxis due to geographical or language barriers

- previous requirement for > 1 dose of epinephrine prior to reaching hospital

- previous near-fatal anaphylaxis.

- available autoinjector dose is much too low for body weight.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^113gQEEE]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Anaphylaxis — Key points of consensus state that anaphylaxis is a serious, systemic hypersensitivity reaction that is usually rapid in onset and may cause death, and severe anaphylaxis is characterized by potentially life-threatening compromise in respiration and/or the circulation, and it may occur without typical skin features, circulatory shock, or compromised breathing being present. There are similarities and differences between the 2006 NIAID and 2020 WAO anaphylaxis criteria and further studies should be conducted to validate the 2020 WAO anaphylaxis criteria, and use of the 2007 Brighton Collaborative Criteria in establishing the diagnosis of anaphylaxis may lead to overdiagnosis of anaphylaxis. Biphasic anaphylaxis is highly likely when the patient develops anaphylaxis after initial signs and symptoms have completely resolved for at least one hour before the onset of repeated anaphylaxis with 48 hours and without re-exposure to an allergen trigger and is unlikely when anaphylaxis is not severe and the patient remains symptom-free for one hour of observation following resolution of initial anaphylaxis; biphasic anaphylaxis is more likely to occur with increasing anaphylaxis severity and in patients who have received more than one dose of epinephrine for anaphylaxis treatment. Persistent anaphylaxis is highly likely when anaphylaxis persists for at least 4 hours, and refractory anaphylaxis is highly likely when anaphylaxis continues despite appropriate epinephrine dosing and symptom-directed medical management; refractory anaphylaxis increases the risk for anaphylaxis fatality. Additional points note that anaphylaxis severity is a continuum that results from a combination of risk factors, including those related to the allergen as well as the patient and other patient specific factors and comorbidities, and that patients with severe anaphylaxis are more likely to demonstrate hypotension and hypoxemia with severe anaphylaxis associated with older age, pre-existing cardio-pulmonary disease, and drug etiology.

### Anaphylaxis in practice: a guide to the 2023 practice parameter update [^112GRPaw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). High credibility.

Recommendation 26 — Post-epinephrine actions and home management: Clinicians should counsel patients always to activate emergency medical services after epinephrine administration when their anaphylaxis is severe, symptoms do not promptly resolve completely or nearly completely, and/or symptoms return or worsen after the first dose of epinephrine. Immediate activation of emergency medical services after epinephrine use may not be necessary if the patient experiences a prompt, complete or nearly complete, and durable response to treatment and has additional doses of epinephrine available; in such cases, home management of anaphylaxis may be considered. There is no evidence that preemptively administering epinephrine to asymptomatic patients prevents anaphylaxis after exposure to a potential trigger. Clinicians should discuss potential barriers to treatment adherence, regularly review the essentials of EAIs (epinephrine autoinjectors), encourage practice with trainer devices, counsel about common side effects and signs of rare serious adverse events, and note that the risk of serious adverse reactions to intramuscular epinephrine is low and should not pose barriers to EAI prescription or use. When developing a management plan, clinicians and patients should engage in SDM that considers risk factors for severe and biphasic anaphylaxis, access to epinephrine and medical services, and capacity to administer EAI effectively and gauge treatment response.

Is adrenaline effective for the treatment of anaphylaxis?

Recommendation

We recommend adrenaline as the first line treatment for anaphylaxis (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence)

(adopted from RCUK 2008 and EAACI 2014 guidelines)

Rationale

International guidelines agree that adrenaline (epinephrine) is first line treatment for anaphylaxis. However, supporting evidence is limited to observational studies (case series and fatality registers) in humans, animal models, epidemiological studies, and pharmacokinetic studies in patients who might be at risk for anaphylaxis but not experiencing allergic symptoms at the time of study. The EAACI 2014 guideline concluded "there is some evidence to support the use of adrenaline for the emergency management of anaphylaxis", while the WAO 2011 Guideline noted that "the evidence base for prompt epinephrine injection in the initial treatment of anaphylaxis is stronger than the evidence base for the use of antihistamines and glucocorticoids in anaphylaxis". A systematic review by EAACI in 2020 only identified observational studies examining the efficacy of adrenaline and noted a high risk of bias; no eligible studies compared adrenaline with no adrenaline for critical outcomes such as mortality, or most other outcomes.

To evaluate anaphylaxis management before and after implementation of an emergency department (ED) anaphylaxis order set and introduction of epinephrine autoinjectors, and to measure the effect on anaphylaxis guideline adherence.

Methods

A cohort study was conducted from April 29, 2008, to August 9, 2012. Adult patients in the ED who were diagnosed with anaphylaxis were included. ED management, disposition, self-injectable epinephrine prescriptions, allergy follow-up, and incidence of biphasic reactions were evaluated.

Results

The study included 202 patients. The median age of the patients was 45.3 years (interquartile range, 31.3–56.4 years); 139 (69%) were women. Patients who presented after order set implementation were more likely to be treated with epinephrine (51% vs 33%; odds ratio [OR] 2.05 [95% CI, 1.04–4.04]) and admitted to the ED observation unit (65% vs 44%; OR 2.38 [95% CI, 1.23–4.60]), and less likely to be dismissed home directly from ED (16% vs 29%, OR 0.47 [95% CI, 0.22–1.00]). Eleven patients (5%) had a biphasic reaction. Of these, 5 (46%) had the biphasic reaction in the ED observation unit; 1 patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Six patients (55%) had reactions within 6 hours of initial symptom resolution, of whom 2 were admitted to the intensive care unit.

Conclusions

Significantly higher proportions of patients with anaphylaxis received epinephrine and were admitted to the ED observation unit after introduction of epinephrine autoinjectors and order set implementation. Slightly more than half of the biphasic reactions occurred within the recommended observation time of 4 to 6 hours. Analysis of these data suggests that the multifaceted approach to changing anaphylaxis management described here improved guideline adherence.

### Is epinephrine truly lifesaving, and can we prove this? [^116pa23r]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Injectable intramuscular epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. Epinephrine is touted as "life-saving", in particular because observational studies have identified lack of prompt epinephrine treatment as a critical risk factor associated with anaphylaxis fatality. Although association is not causal, few would argue that epinephrine is not the optimal treatment for anaphylaxis, and do we have sufficient proof to suggest that epinephrine is actually "life-saving"? Epinephrine indeed works swiftly to reverse such symptoms of an immediate allergic reaction. However, there are abundant observational data that many cases of anaphylaxis are inherently self-limited and may resolve within 1 to 2 hours in most cases with or without treatment. In this perspective, the intent is to address and reframe the reality of the evidence we do have for what epinephrine does and does not accomplish and provide a perspective regarding the common "dogma" regarding the drug. There is a danger in using terms such as "life-threatening" and "life-saving" for anaphylaxis and epinephrine treatment, especially under the caution of frequently cited rhetoric that subsequent reactions are likely to be progressively more severe or potentially fatal. Use of such descriptions risks negatively polarizing our patients and adversely affecting their quality of life, given these terms can potentiate unnecessary fear. Epinephrine is in fact a wonderful drug, but it is important to not lose sight of the evidence for what it actually does in anaphylaxis treatment and why it is important to use this drug in anaphylaxis, as opposed to an emphasis on what it does not do.

What are the possible side effects of epinephrine injection?

Epinephrine injection may cause serious side effects.

Epinephrine injection should only be injected into the middle of your outer thigh (upper leg). Do not inject epinephrine injection into your:
veins
buttocks
fingers, toes, hands or feet.

If you accidentally inject epinephrine injection into any other part of your body, go to the nearest emergency room right away. Tell the healthcare provider where on your body you received the accidental injection.

redness that does not go away
swelling
tenderness
the area feels warm to the touch
Cuts on the skin, bent needles, and needles that remain in the skin after the injection, have happened in young children who do not cooperate and kick or move during an injection. If you inject a young child with epinephrine injection, hold their leg firmly in place before and during the injection to prevent injuries. Ask your healthcare provider to show you how to properly hold the leg of a young child during an injection.
If you have certain medical conditions, or take certain medicines, your condition may get worse or you may have more or longer lasting side effects when you use epinephrine injection. Talk to your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions.

Common side effects of epinephrine injection include:

faster, irregular or "pounding" heartbeat
sweating
headache
weakness
shakiness
paleness
feelings of over excitement, nervousness, or anxiety
dizziness
nausea and vomiting
breathing problems

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^111YLBGZ]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Epinephrine autoinjectors (EAI) — prescribing, training, and emergency medical services (EMS) activation state that the cardinal treatment of anaphylaxis is prompt epinephrine injection, and the optimal prescribing and use of EAI devices require specific counseling and training of patients and caregivers, including when and how to administer the EAI and whether and when to call 911 (emergency medical services [EMS]). Health care professionals should consider a patient's risk factors for severe anaphylaxis, their values and preferences, and the burden of both anaphylaxis and EAI prescription when deciding whether to prescribe EAIs and the number of EAIs to prescribe. If epinephrine is used promptly, immediate activation of the EMS may not be required if the patient experiences prompt, complete, and durable response to treatment, and EMS should be activated if anaphylaxis is severe, fails to resolve promptly, fails to resolve completely or nearly completely, or returns or worsens after the first dose of epinephrine.

### Anaphylaxis [^116gpKqk]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Anaphylaxis is the quintessential critical illness in emergency medicine. Symptoms are rapid in onset and death can occur within minutes. Approximately 1500 patients die annually in the United States from this deadly disorder. It is imperative, therefore, that emergency care providers be able to diagnose and appropriately treat patients with anaphylaxis. Any delays in recognition or initiation of therapy can result in unnecessary increases in patient morbidity and mortality.

Discussion

Recent literature, including updated international anaphylaxis guidelines, has improved our understanding and management of this critical illness. Anaphylaxis is a multisystem disorder that can manifest signs and symptoms related to the cutaneous, respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. Epinephrine remains the drug of choice and should initially be administered intramuscularly, into the anterolateral thigh, as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. For patients unresponsive to repeated intramuscular injections, a continuous infusion of epinephrine should be started. Antihistamines and corticosteroids are second-line medications and should never be given in lieu of, or prior to, epinephrine. Aggressive fluid resuscitation should also be used to treat the intravascular volume depletion characteristic of anaphylaxis. Patient observation and disposition should be individualized, as there is no well-defined period of observation after resolution of signs and symptoms.

Conclusions

For patients with anaphylaxis, rapid and appropriate administration of epinephrine is critical for survival. Additional therapy, such as supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, antihistamines, and corticosteroids should not delay the administration of epinephrine.

After treating the acute anaphylactic reaction, the clinician's next task is to prevent a recurrence. The patient should be observed in the ED. How long this observation period should last depends on their clinical course, risk factors, and social support. All patients should be discharged with a prescription for 2 epinephrine autoinjectors and counseled on appropriate use. The patient should also receive education on the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and avoiding triggers. The patient should follow-up with an allergy specialist who can confirm triggers and provide immunotherapy as indicated.

### Customizing anaphylaxis guidelines for emergency medicine [^1149qyZd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Most episodes of anaphylaxis are managed in emergency medical settings, where the cardinal signs and symptoms often differ from those observed in the allergy clinic. Data suggest that low recognition of anaphylaxis in the emergency setting may relate to inaccurate coding and lack of a standard, practical definition.

Objective

Develop a simple, consistent definition of anaphylaxis for emergency medicine providers, supported by clinically relevant consensus statements.

Discussion

Definitions of anaphylaxis and criteria for diagnosis from current anaphylaxis guidelines were reviewed with regard to their utilization in emergency medical settings. The agreed-upon working definition is: Anaphylaxis is a serious reaction causing a combination of characteristic findings, and which is rapid in onset and may cause death. It is usually due to an allergic reaction but can be non-allergic. The definition is supported by Consensus Statements, each with referenced discussion. For a positive outcome, quick diagnosis and treatment of anaphylaxis are critical. However, even in the emergency setting, the patient may not present with life-threatening symptoms. Because mild initial symptoms can quickly progress to a severe, even fatal, reaction, the first-line treatment for any anaphylaxis episode — regardless of severity — is intramuscular injection of epinephrine into the anterolateral thigh; delaying its administration increases the potential for morbidity and mortality. When a reaction appears as "possible anaphylaxis", it is generally better to err on the side of caution and administer epinephrine.

Conclusion

We believe that this working definition and the supporting Consensus Statements are a first step to better management of anaphylaxis in the emergency medical setting.

### Anaphylaxis: recognition and management [^114GAYuM]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening systemic reaction, normally occurring within one to two hours of exposure to an allergen. The incidence of anaphylaxis in the United States is 2.1 per 1,000 person-years. Most anaphylactic reactions occur outside the hospital setting. Urticaria, difficulty breathing, and mucosal swelling are the most common symptoms of anaphylaxis. The most common triggers are medications, stinging insect venoms, and foods; however, unidentified triggers occur in up to one-fifth of cases. Coexisting asthma, mast cell disorders, older age, underlying cardiovascular disease, peanut and tree nut allergy, and drug-induced reactions are associated with severe or fatal anaphylactic reactions. Clinicians can obtain serum tryptase levels, reflecting mast cell degranulation, when the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis is not clear. Acute management of anaphylaxis involves removal of the trigger; early administration of intramuscular epinephrine; supportive care for the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation; and a period of observation for potential biphasic reactions. Only after epinephrine administration should adjunct medications be considered; these include histamine H1 and H2 antagonists, corticosteroids, beta2 agonists, and glucagon. Patients should be monitored for a biphasic reaction (i.e., recurrence of anaphylaxis without reexposure to the allergen) for four to 12 hours, depending on risk factors for severe anaphylaxis. Following an anaphylactic reaction, management should focus on developing an emergency action plan, referral to an allergist, and patient education on avoidance of triggers and appropriate use of an epinephrine auto-injector.

### Apple [^1117tTM1]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

(1) GENERAL

The presence of asthmatic signs and symptoms may be an indicator of severe reaction following allergen injections. Any evidence of a local or generalized reaction requires a dose reduction during the initial stages of immunotherapy, as well as during maintenance therapy. Patient reactions to previous injections should be reviewed before each new injection and a conservative dosage schedule should be followed until a pattern of local responses is established which can be used to monitor increases in dosage. Patients should be observed in the office for at least 20 to 30 minutes after each treatment injection and instructed to seek medical attention if symptoms of a systemic reaction occur. Most severe reactions will occur within this time period, and rapid treatment measures should be initiated (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). In rare circumstances, a patient may have systemic reactions to minute doses of antigen and does not demonstrate increasing tolerance to injections after several months of treatment. If systemic reactions or excessive local responses occur persistently at very small doses, efforts at immunotherapy should be stopped.

When changing lots of extracts, even though the formulation may be the same, the first dose should not exceed 50% of the previous dose as the extract may have lost potency over time and a fresh extract could have an effective potency that is substantially greater than that of the old extract. Aseptic technique should always be used when injections of allergenic extracts are administered.

(2) INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS

Patients should be instructed to remain in the office for 20 to 30 minutes after each injection to monitor for adverse reactions. Patients should be instructed to describe any active allergic symptoms such as rhinitis, wheezing, dyspnea, etc. prior to injection including any late reactions from previous administration.

(3) DRUG INTERACTIONS

Beta-Blockers: Patients who are taking non-selective beta blockers may be more reactive to allergens given for testing and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions. Patients with cardiovascular diseases and/or pulmonary diseases such as symptomatic unstable, steroid-dependent asthma, and/or those who are receiving cardiovascular drugs such as beta-blockers, may be at higher risk for severe adverse reactions.

Antihistamines can significantly inhibit the immediate skin test reactions. If long acting antihistamines have been taken recently, it is recommended that they should be stopped for the following minimum intervals before skin testing is performed: 1 week for hydroxyzine or cetirizine; 4 to 7 days for loratadine; 3 to 4 days for fexofenadine; and 24 to 48 hours for other sustained release antihistamines.

### Timing of repeat epinephrine to inform paediatric anaphylaxis observation periods: a retrospective cohort study [^112ieCAf]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

Children presenting to the emergency department with anaphylaxis typically receive at least one dose of epinephrine and are observed in the emergency department or monitored for recurrent (biphasic anaphylaxis) or persistent symptoms on hospital wards for variable durations before discharge is considered safe. We aimed to calculate the incidence rate and timing of repeat epinephrine dosing to determine the observation threshold at which the cumulative incidence of repeat epinephrine was less than 2% for every 1 h increase in observation time.

Methods

This multicentre, retrospective cohort study across 30 emergency departments in the USA and one emergency department in Canada included children aged 6 months to 17 years who, according to electronic medical records, presented to one of the participating emergency departments with an acute allergic reaction that was treated with intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous epinephrine before arrival at the emergency department or in the emergency department between Jan 1, 2016, and Dec 31, 2019. We excluded patients who had no documentation of symptoms or examination findings before presenting to the emergency department, were transferred from outside health-care facilities, had reactions secondary to medications administered in the emergency department, or had comorbidities requiring tailored management decisions. Demographics, medical history, and emergency department revisits within 72 h of discharge were extracted from electronic medical records. The primary outcome was the time from first to last administration of epinephrine. For patients on intravenous epinephrine infusions, the relevant time interval was from infusion initiation to discontinuation. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to compare time to last epinephrine dose by initial reaction severity, stratified by respiratory and cardiovascular involvement (no respiratory or cardiovascular involvement, respiratory but no cardiovascular involvement, and cardiovascular involvement).

Findings

Of 7717 patients with ICD-10 Clinical Modification codes for anaphylaxis, 5641 were eligible for inclusion (median age 7.9 years [IQR 3.3–13.1]; 2475 [43.9%] female; 3166 [56.1%] male). Of the 5139 patients who reported ethnicity, 1131 (22.0%) identified as Hispanic and 4008 (78.0%) identified as non-Hispanic. 263 (4.7%) of 5641 patients received a repeat epinephrine after 2 h of the first dose, whereas 109 (1.9%) received repeat epinephrine after 4 h, 64 (1.1%) after 6 h, and 46 (0.8%) after 8 h. The observation period at which the increase in cumulative incidence of repeat epinephrine was less than 2% was 115 min (95% CI 105–122) for all patients, 105 min (54–135) for patients without respiratory or cardiovascular involvement (n = 1070), 109 min (98–118) for patients with respiratory but no cardiovascular involvement (n = 4076), and 161 min (125–249) for patients with cardiovascular involvement (n = 495). These findings suggest that 5378 (95.3%) patients in our cohort would have been safely discharged 2 h after receiving the first epinephrine dose and that 5532 (98.1%) patients would have been safely discharged 4 h after the first epinephrine dose.

Interpretation

A 2-h observation period is probably safe for most children who present to an emergency department with an acute allergic reaction requiring epinephrine. A 4-h observation period might be enough for patients with cardiovascular involvement who appear well.

### Epinephrine injection monotherapy shows similar hemostatic efficacy to epinephrine injection combined therapy in high-risk patients (forrest Ib) with bleeding ulcers [^1161Awi3]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Endoscopic evaluation and medication

All of the emergency endoscopic treatments were performed by experienced deputy directors or chief physicians within 24 h. Endoscopists were familiar with the indications, efficacy, and limitations of the tools and techniques that were currently available for endoscopic hemostasis. For patients with gastrointestinal bleeding who use low-dose antiplatelet drugs as monotherapy for primary cardiovascular prophylaxis, the use of antiplatelet drugs should be temporarily discontinued. For patients with gastrointestinal bleeding who received antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, a single antiplatelet drug should not be interrupted, while in those on dual antiplatelet therapy, one of the agents should be temporarily discontinued and re-administered as soon as possible. These individuals were skilled in applying endoscopic hemostasis therapy, and all of them had more than 5 years of endoscopic experience. In this study, we chose patients who underwent endoscopic epinephrine injections alone or epinephrine injections combined with a second method between March 2014 and June 2022 for enrollment. Diluted epinephrine (1:10,000 dilution, equivalent to 100 mcg/mL) was injected at or near the bleeding site. For cases of difficult endoscopic hemostasis, appropriate hemostatic methods should be used for initial hemostasis, followed by timely interventional or surgical procedures. All of the enrolled patients ultimately achieved technical hemostasis. The bleeding status under endoscopy was classified based on the modified Forrest classification. After endoscopy, patients subsequently received high-dose intravenous PPIs (the HD-IVP group, an 80 mg bolus injection followed by a continuous infusion of 8 mg per hour for 72 h) or standard-dose intravenous PPIs (the SD-IVP group, 40 mg infusion twice daily for 72 h), including esomeprazole or pantoprazole. Afterwards, 40 mg PPI was taken orally once daily for 30 days after short-term (72 h) high-dose intravenous PPI therapy in the hospital. All of the patients were followed up for at least 30 days.

Definition

Rebleeding was defined as recurrent hematemesis, melena, anemia, or vital hemodynamic instability with a decrease in hemoglobin by at least 2 g/dL after a successful initial endoscopic treatment within 30 days, and fresh blood could be observed in the stomach or duodenum during the second-look endoscopic observation. Patients who underwent a second endoscopic therapy for hemostasis within 30 days were also regarded as experiencing rebleeding. Shock was defined as a shock index (pulse rate/systolic blood pressure) > 1.0 or systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg.

Epinephrine autoinjectors: when and how to prescribe — guidance covers prescribing to higher-risk patients, quantity decisions, administration timing, emergency activation, adverse event counseling, cost and device selection factors, and follow-up education. We recommend clinicians routinely prescribe EAIs to patients at higher risk of anaphylaxis, and when deciding whether to prescribe EAIs to lower-risk patients, we suggest that clinicians engage in a shared decision-making process that considers patients' risk factors, values, and preferences. We suggest that in jurisdictions where single-packs of EAIs are available, clinicians consider a patient's risk factors, values, preferences, and contextual factors when deciding whether to prescribe only one vs multiple EAIs, and we suggest they routinely prescribe more than one EAI when patients have previously required multiple doses of epinephrine and/or have a history of biphasic reactions. We suggest that clinicians counsel patients and caregivers to give epinephrine at the first sign of suspected anaphylaxis and, in general, not to give epinephrine preemptively to an asymptomatic patient. We suggest that clinicians counsel patients that immediate activation of emergency medical services may not be required with prompt, complete, durable response when additional epinephrine and care are readily available, and we suggest that patients always activate emergency medical services after epinephrine use if anaphylaxis is severe, fails to resolve promptly or completely or nearly completely, or returns or worsens. Serious adverse reactions to intramuscular epinephrine are rare and should not pose a barrier to prescription or early administration when indicated, and to manage risk we recommend counseling on proper EAI use, common side effects, and the need for immediate evaluation if serious adverse event signs or symptoms develop. We suggest discussing potential financial and psychosocial burdens during shared decision-making, and when selecting an EAI we suggest considering dosage, needle length, affordability, access, and patient treatment preferences. During visits after prescribing EAIs, we recommend routinely reviewing carriage, storage, and use; encouraging regular practice with a trainer device; and discussing strategies to manage barriers to adherence.

### Should epinephrine autoinjectors Be prescribed to all patients on subcutaneous immunotherapy? [^1128oDLQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy (SCIT) clearly benefits appropriately selected patients with allergic rhinitis, asthma and anaphylaxis to stinging insects. Since inception of SCIT, systemic allergic reactions (SRs) and severe anaphylaxis have been risk management challenges facing the practicing allergist. Recently it has estimated that 14% of reported SRs begin at least 30 minutes after injection administration or after the 30 minute recommended clinic observation period. Faced with the possibility that SRs could occur after the patient leaves the clinic, some practicing allergists routinely prescribe epinephrine auto-injectors to all injection patients. This article summarizes the key arguments for and against routine prescription of epinephrine auto-injectors for all allergen injection patients, discussed in a PRO/CON debate at the 2015 AAAAI meeting. Currently, there is insufficient clinical evidence to make a strong recommendation for or against this practice.

### Management of anaphylaxis in children [^116EkKQr]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. The key to successful management of anaphylaxis involves rapid diagnosis, assessment, and early initiation of therapy. Epinephrine is the undisputed initial therapy for anaphylaxis, and its administration should never be delayed. In most cases, additional interventions such as oxygen therapy, fluid resuscitation, beta-agonists, antihistamines, and corticosteroids should be strongly considered. Although hospital course must be individualized to meet each patient's needs, a minimum of 4 to 6 hours of observation period after complete symptom resolution may be reasonable to monitor for recurrence of symptoms and biphasic reaction. Before discharge, every patient should receive patient education about anaphylaxis, a prescription for self-injectable epinephrine, and instructions for follow-up care.

SHOULD EAI BE PRESCRIBED IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OR DEFERRED UNTIL SPECIALIST REVIEW?

EAI are underprescribed in emergency departments (EDs), despite guidelines mandating that patients with anaphylaxis to food or venom be prescribed EAI before discharge. – This may contribute to suboptimal rates of prehospital epinephrine administration. The decision of whether to prescribe EAI in EDs may be confounded by the difficulties prescribers face in determining whether patients have indeed had anaphylaxis. In such cases, it might be preferable for ED prescribers to defer the decision until a formal allergy review; however, data from retrospective studies indicate that only a minority of patients are referred to allergists on ED discharge. This is also of concern when considering patients treated in the ED for nonanaphylaxis reactions who arguably meet guidelines for EAI prescription. Prompt allergist follow-up is not always feasible, especially for patients with low socioeconomic status or in jurisdictions with long wait times for allergy clinics. Barriers to follow-up may also contribute to delays in counseling patients about allergen avoidance. Requiring a formal allergy review to determine whether EAI are needed can also potentially increase the financial burden of treatment.

Compared with ED providers, allergists are better prepared to accurately diagnose allergic diseases and determine which patients are most likely to benefit from epinephrine. Although anaphylaxis is underdiagnosed in the ED, many patients who receive an initial ED diagnosis of a suspected allergic reaction or anaphylaxis are later found not to have had an allergic reaction. This is supported by a 2019 study in which only half of 582 patients treated for an allergic reaction in ED were actually considered to have had an allergic reaction at subsequent allergist follow-up. However, discharging patients from the ED after anaphylaxis without EAI leaves them vulnerable if they experience biphasic reactions after discharge or new reactions before the allergist review. ED providers may have a lower threshold for prescribing EAI, given that they do not have long-term patient relationships and prescribing EAI is seen as a strategy to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes after ED departure if patients have biphasic reactions, are re-exposed to allergens, or cannot secure allergist follow-up.

### Benefits of epinephrine for anaphylaxis outweigh potential harm – A safety review [^116q3NRv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can progress quickly, and although fatal anaphylaxis is very rare, treatment should be given as soon as possible. The recommended first-line treatment for anaphylaxis is intramuscular (IM) epinephrine. Yet epinephrine for anaphylaxis is underused, which can have deleterious, or even tragic, consequences. Although fear of self-injection substantially affects adherence, hesitancy to use epinephrine for anaphylaxis may be linked to the common unsubstantiated perception that epinephrine is dangerous. Therefore, the objective of this narrative review is to describe the safety of epinephrine when administered for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Cardiovascular adverse events (AEs) are the greatest safety concern with epinephrine because of its known effects on cardiac output and vasoconstriction. Cardiovascular events and overdose are significantly more likely to occur with accidental intravenous bolus administration than IM administration. Although serious AEs have been reported with IM epinephrine, and there are potential risk factors for cardiovascular AEs for some patients, there are no absolute contraindications for its use in a life-threatening situation. Appropriately dosed and administered epinephrine should engender no fear of use for anaphylaxis. The potential harm of delaying or withholding epinephrine treatment for anaphylaxis far outweighs the potential risk of AEs.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^115ZJe2T]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

The 2020 JTFPP recommends extended observation for patients with severe initial symptoms of anaphylaxis, based on a meta-analysis which found biphasic anaphylaxis was associated with a more severe initial presentation (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.23–3.61) or administration of > 1 dose of adrenaline (OR 4.82, 95% CI 2.70–8.58). The JTFPP otherwise suggests that 1 h observation may be reasonable for low-risk patients with resolved non-severe anaphylaxis; this is supported by a 2019 meta-analysis which reported that 1 h observation would capture 95.0% (95%CI 99.0–97.3%) of biphasic reactions. Extending this interval would only impact slightly on the rate of biphasic reactions "captured": 96.5% (95%CI 93.4–98.2%) for 4 h, 97.3% (95%CI 95.0–98.5%) for 6 h and 98.2% (95%CI 96.7–99.1%) for 12 h observation. Prolonged observation is inconvenient for many patients (and their carers), and is not cost-effective for patients at low risk of biphasic reactions.

After considering the available evidence, the working group was concerned that the previous RCUK recommendation might offer false reassurance in terms of mitigating against the risk of biphasic reaction. To balance the risks and benefits involved, we instead propose a pragmatic, risk-stratified and individualised approach to determining the length of observation following anaphylaxis (Table 5).

Epinephrine auto-injector (EAI) adverse events and counseling — Recommendation 27 (CBS) states that "Serious adverse reactions to intramuscular epinephrine are very rare and should not pose a barrier to the prescription or early administration of EAIs when indicated", and "we recommend that clinicians counsel patients and caregivers on the proper use of EAIs, the common adverse effects, and the need for immediate evaluation and treatment when signs or symptoms of serious adverse events develop" (Strength of Recommendation: Strong; Certainty of Evidence: Low). Epinephrine is described as "generally safe, and there are no absolute contraindications to its use for anaphylaxis", and, compared with intravenous administration, "intramuscular epinephrine is associated with reduced risk of dosing errors and adverse events". Quantitatively, "the serious adverse event rate for EAI administration was only 0.73%"; in an ED cohort, "adverse cardiovascular events were reported in 4 of 316 (1.3%) intramuscular administrations", and a registry-based study reported "4 of 256 (1.6%) intramuscular or subcutaneous administrations". Risk appears higher in older patients "(age ≥ 50 years)", and "Clinicians should counsel patients with cardiac risk factors to seek immediate evaluation and treatment if chest pain or other signs or symptoms of cardiac adverse events develop after epinephrine use".

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^1166wCiE]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Epinephrine auto-injector (EAI) counseling and use — patients and caregivers: We suggest that clinicians counsel patients and caregivers to give epinephrine at the first sign of suspected anaphylaxis. We suggest that, in general, clinicians counsel patients or caregivers not to give epinephrine preventively to an asymptomatic patient. We suggest that clinicians counsel patients that immediate activation of EMS may not be required if the patient experiences prompt, complete, and durable response to treatment with epinephrine, provided that additional epinephrine and medical care are readily available, if needed. We suggest that clinicians counsel patients to always activate EMS after epinephrine use if anaphylaxis is severe, fails to resolve promptly, fails to resolve completely or nearly completely, or returns or worsens after a first dose of epinephrine. Serious adverse reactions to intramuscular epinephrine are very rare and should not pose a barrier to the prescription or early administration of EAIs when indicated. To manage the risk of adverse events, we recommend that clinicians counsel patients and caregivers on the proper use of EAIs, the common adverse effects, and the need for immediate evaluation and treatment when signs or symptoms of serious adverse events develop. We suggest that clinicians discuss the potential financial and psychosocial burdens of EAIs with patients while engaging in shared decision-making. When deciding which EAI to prescribe, we suggest that clinicians consider dosage, needle length, affordability, access, and patient treatment preferences. During visits with patients who have been prescribed EAIs, we recommend that clinicians routinely review the essentials of EAI carriage, storage, and use; encourage patients to regularly practice EAI administration with a trainer device; and discuss strategies to manage barriers to adherence that patients may have experienced.

Regarding medical management for anaphylaxis, more specifically with respect to epinephrine, patient-delivered, AAAAI 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that serious adverse reactions to IM epinephrine are very rare and should not pose a barrier to the prescription or early administration of epinephrine autoinjectors when indicated. Counsel patients and caregivers on the proper use of epinephrine autoinjectors, the common adverse effects, and the need for immediate evaluation and treatment when signs or symptoms of serious adverse events develop to manage the risk of adverse events.

Anaphylaxis home management considerations and epinephrine timing are outlined with conditional EMS activation, monitoring, and pharmacologic time-course details. For patients with "a prior history of anaphylaxis that required treatment with multiple doses of epinephrine, intubation, and/or ventilation", Casale et al "recommended that EMS should be immediately activated on recognition of anaphylaxis", and for lower-risk patients they "recommended activating EMS when severe signs and symptoms do not promptly resolve with epinephrine treatment". They also "recommended careful monitoring for recurrence, with non-urgent follow-up care if there was prompt and complete resolution of severe symptoms after epinephrine use and if patients had ready access to additional EAIs". Table guidance on "Considerations for and Against Home Management of Anaphylaxis" includes facilitators such as "Immediate access to at least 2 EAIs" and cautions such as "No availability of EAI or only 1 EAI", "Being alone, without immediate access to person(s) who can provide help if needed", and "History of severe/near-fatal anaphylaxis treated with more than 2 doses of epinephrine, hospitalization, intubation". Regarding timing, "Classic epinephrine pharmacokinetic (PK) data suggest that the Tmax is not more rapid than 12 to 15 minutes, and more recent data suggest that this may more reliably occur at 15 to 25 minutes", while "some PD data suggest that mean increases in systolic blood pressure occur less than 5 minutes after intramuscular epinephrine injection".

### Who needs epinephrine? Anaphylaxis, autoinjectors, and parachutes [^112ke1LB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, the effect of delaying EMS activation on outcomes has not yet been assessed, although there may be data from large patient registries to address this knowledge gap. There are barriers to implementing Casale et al's proposed algorithm; many patients do not have multiple epinephrine doses available, with surveys reporting that under half of individuals carry more than 1 EAI device at all times. In addition, some patients and caregivers lack the knowledge, skills, or comfort to effectively administer epinephrine and monitor symptom resolution, persistence, or recurrence. Determining whether patients and caregivers are "capable and adherent" is highly subjective and subject to implicit biases. This highlights the need for reliable strategies to assess the ability of patients and caregivers to recognize and manage reactions and to improve their performance with targeted educational interventions. Until an algorithm for home management can be verified to be safe and effective, it will face barriers to widespread adoption by relevant stakeholders, especially given medicolegal concerns.

Casale et al's proposed algorithm recommends EMS activation if symptoms do not improve after a second dose of epinephrine. However, we are concerned that waiting until 2 doses have been given before activating EMS may delay medical transport for truly life-threatening reactions, particularly in areas with long EMS response times. A reasonable compromise might be to defer contacting EMS while assessing the response to a first dose of epinephrine. If symptoms are initially nonsevere and rapidly abate, then it is probably reasonable to not activate EMS and to seek less-urgent follow-up or advice. However, if there is only access to 1 EAI, symptoms are severe (Figure 1), or symptoms do not abate within 5 minutes of the first epinephrine dose (and therefore require treatment with ≥ 2 doses), then EMS should be activated immediately (Figure 3).

Food allergy — post-reaction actions and safety aids include urgent epinephrine and medical care after severe events, and identification jewelry. In cases in which a previous life-threatening reaction has occurred, self-injectable epinephrine must be given promptly, and the patient should immediately seek emergency medical treatment. Identification jewelry for patients who might have a food-induced reaction and might need injected epinephrine is recommended because this reminds the patient and alerts others of their reactivity.

Regarding medical management for anaphylaxis, more specifically with respect to epinephrine, patient-delivered, AAAAI 2024 guidelines recommend to consider prescribing epinephrine autoinjectors routinely in patients at higher risk of anaphylaxis. Consider engaging lower-risk patients in a shared decision-making process, taking into account the patient's risk factors, values, and preferences, when deciding whether to prescribe epinephrine autoinjectors to these patients.

### Evaluating the time of maximal vasoconstrictive effect of epinephrine in facelift surgery [^115jrV3c]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

It remains unclear how long a plastic surgeon should wait for the optimal vasoconstrictive effect of epinephrine in local anesthetic prior to incision for aesthetic facial surgery.

Objectives

This study investigates the optimal timing for epinephrine-induced vasoconstriction in facelift procedures by measuring cheek skin temperature changes using forward-looking infrared thermography (FLIR).

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted on all patients who underwent facelift surgery by the senior author between July 2023 and June 2024. Skin surface temperature was recorded at baseline and at predetermined time points up to 15 minutes following injection of the standardized epinephrine-containing local anesthetic solution. Additional patient data were obtained from electronic medical record review.

Results

Twenty-seven patients were included in the study. The median time for each patient to reach their lowest recorded cheek temperature was 5 minutes post-injection (mean 5.1 ± 2.9 minutes). Injected cheeks exhibited the largest median temperature decrease of 2.3°C at 7 minutes, followed by gradual rewarming to baseline. Uninjected nasal skin warmed steadily throughout the observation period. Of the 27 patients, 15 (55.6%) reached their minimum cheek temperature by 5 minutes, 23 (85.2%) by 7 minutes, and all 27 (100%) by 11 minutes.

Conclusions

These findings demonstrate that the maximal vasoconstrictive effect of epinephrine in facelift surgery occurs approximately 5–7 minutes after injection. We recommend that facelift surgeons wait 5–7 minutes before initiating incisions and dissection to balance optimal hemostasis with procedural efficiency.
