## Question

How do treat geriatric depression

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat geriatric depression. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and prevalence to frame severity and prognosis. Then, I should verify first-line treatment options and their comparative effectiveness. Next, I will examine pharmacotherapy choices, dosing, and safety in older adults, including frailty considerations. After that, I need to review psychotherapies and exercise, including delivery formats and special populations. I will then consider treatment-resistant strategies and maintenance planning. Finally, I should integrate shared decision-making, monitoring, and practical implementation details, while double-checking where the evidence is strong versus uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and epidemiology so I don't jump to conclusions. Depression in older adults is common, with major depression around 2% in community-dwelling adults over 55 and clinically significant symptoms in 10–15%, rising further in primary care and inpatient settings; importantly, late-life depression tends to be chronic, relapsing, and often treatment-resistant, with high medical comorbidity and cognitive impairment, which shapes both treatment choice and prognosis [^2b90808e] [^35ebee7f] [^e7a3fa42].

> Next, I should review first-line treatment principles and ensure I'm aligning with guidelines. The APA recommends starting with either psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy in shared decision-making, with psychotherapy often preferred by older adults and pharmacotherapy indicated for moderate to severe depression or when psychotherapy is unavailable; combined treatment is reasonable when monotherapy is insufficient or in chronic or severe presentations, though it carries more burden and cost [^7f3d5ee6] [^c87a0788] [^5cb6dafe].

> I will now examine pharmacotherapy, but wait, let me verify the strength of evidence and safety profile. SSRIs and SNRIs are first-line in older adults due to better tolerability than TCAs; however, meta-analyses show modest acute-phase benefits at best, with response around 45% vs 40% on placebo and higher adverse event withdrawals, and even less convincing benefit in adults over 75 or those who are frail, so I need to be cautious and individualize decisions and dosing [^2f128223] [^5fc96f0b] [^1b6ae271]. Hold on, I should verify dosing: many older adults can tolerate standard adult doses, but start low and go slow, monitor for hyponatremia, falls, GI bleeding, and drug–drug interactions, and avoid anticholinergic agents like paroxetine when possible in this population [^2b90808e] [^1240b9f9] [^6620f175].

> Let me consider psychotherapy next, and I should double-check which modalities have the best support. CBT, problem-solving therapy, and life-review therapy have consistent evidence for efficacy in older adults, with group formats often feasible and effective; IPT also shows benefit, particularly when combined with medication for relapse prevention, and older adults may respond as well or better than younger adults in some service settings, though access remains a barrier [^aad98d08] [^884fcfa0] [^cc72f994] [^5cb6dafe]. Wait, I initially thought psychodynamic therapy had robust RCT support in this group, but I should correct that: evidence is limited and mixed, so I should not overstate its role here [^927081fb].

> I need to check exercise and other nonpharmacologic options because many patients prefer them. Exercise — especially resistance training and mind–body practices like tai chi — yields moderate-to-large reductions in depressive symptoms, with a U-shaped dose–response and meaningful benefit around 390 MET-min/week; importantly, effects may wane if discontinued, so adherence and maintenance plans matter [^7e248fb8] [^5b5d8038]. But wait, what if the patient is homebound or has limited mobility? Low-intensity, supported psychosocial interventions and digital or self-guided CBT can be reasonable alternatives, though effect sizes are smaller and long-term durability is uncertain, so I should set expectations and plan follow-up [^0da0723c] [^29465ea4] [^1aa921d1].

> Now, I should review treatment-resistant depression in older adults, and I need to ensure I'm citing the most current evidence. For nonresponders after an adequate SSRI/SNRI trial, switching to another antidepressant class or to psychotherapy are both acceptable; augmentation with aripiprazole or lithium can be considered, and ECT remains highly effective for severe, psychotic, or life-threatening depression, with rTMS and ketamine emerging options though evidence in older adults is still limited and requires careful selection and monitoring [^573e1a85] [^fca63779] [^54b2461b]. Hold on, I should verify ketamine data: pooled analyses suggest higher remission with ketamine vs placebo, but trials are small and short-term, so I should reserve it for carefully selected cases with close follow-up [^54b2461b].

> Next, I should review maintenance and relapse prevention, and I need to be precise about what the evidence actually shows. Continuation antidepressants reduce recurrence at 12 months versus placebo, with an NNT around 5, but the evidence quality is low and heterogeneous; combining IPT with pharmacotherapy may further reduce recurrence, yet the APA notes insufficient evidence to prefer CBT plus pharmacotherapy over pharmacotherapy alone for prevention, so shared decision-making is essential here [^df7f21c1] [^e2b99ef5] [^0bc937a7]. I should confirm that maintenance is generally indicated after three or more episodes or chronic depression, with periodic reassessment of risks and benefits over time [^1240b9f9].

> I will now examine special populations and settings, and I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize. In long-term care, psychological therapies show large symptom reductions but very low certainty evidence and higher dropout, so I should tailor interventions to cognitive and functional status and consider acceptability; in cognitively impaired patients, evidence for combined behavioral activation is limited and mixed, so I should individualize and monitor closely [^62967777] [^f25c6160]. For frail older adults, I should reconsider antidepressant use given questionable benefit and higher adverse event risk, prioritize nonpharmacologic supports, and avoid reflexive prescribing that may worsen polypharmacy without improving outcomes [^1b6ae271] [^701afb48].

> Let me think about implementation and delivery, because access and format can make or break outcomes. Collaborative care models with measurement-based treatment-to-target improve response and remission in primary care and should be used when available; group CBT or IPT, telehealth delivery, and lay counselor models can expand reach, and emerging decision rules that match patients to psychotherapy versus usual care based on severity, cognition, and social support show promise but await prospective validation [^fca63779] [^ed1fb5cb] [^7e04efa7]. I should double-check that these models align with patient preferences, since many older adults prefer psychosocial care when offered [^5cb6dafe].

> I should confirm monitoring and safety protocols so I don't miss iatrogenic harm. Baseline and serial assessments with standardized scales (e.g. PHQ-9, GDS-15) track response, and I should monitor for hyponatremia, falls, bleeding, and QT prolongation with SSRIs/SNRIs, consider STOPP/START to minimize polypharmacy, and reassess the need for ongoing pharmacotherapy every 3–6 months once stable, with a plan to taper if benefits are unclear or adverse effects emerge [^2b90808e] [^1240b9f9] [^579a004d]. Hold on, I should verify that abrupt discontinuation increases relapse risk, so any taper should be gradual with close follow-up and a relapse-prevention plan in place [^2b90808e].

> Finally, I need to ensure shared decision-making is explicit and culturally informed. I should discuss treatment options, likely benefits and harms, costs, and patient values; acknowledge uncertainty where evidence is weak, especially for antidepressants in the oldest old or frail; and incorporate caregiver input when appropriate, while also addressing barriers such as transportation, stigma, and language to improve engagement and outcomes [^c87a0788] [^ed1fb5cb] [^b769c403]. Let me reconsider the bottom line: for many older adults, starting with psychotherapy or exercise is reasonable; for moderate to severe depression or when psychotherapy is not feasible, an SSRI/SNRI trial with careful monitoring is appropriate; combined treatment is sensible for chronic or severe cases; and ECT or emerging neuromodulation should be considered for treatment-resistant or high-risk presentations, all within a collaborative, measurement-based care framework [^7f3d5ee6] [^2b90808e] [^fca63779].

Treat geriatric depression with a **stepwise, individualized approach** that prioritizes psychotherapy (CBT, IPT, problem-solving, or life review) [^aad98d08] and SSRIs/SNRIs for moderate-to-severe symptoms [^2b90808e], while monitoring closely for side effects and drug interactions [^1240b9f9]. Exercise is a **valuable adjunct** [^7e248fb8] with moderate effect sizes and favorable safety [^5b5d8038]. For treatment-resistant cases, consider ECT [^fca63779], rTMS, or ketamine [^54b2461b]; use collaborative care [^fca63779] and shared decision-making to align treatment with patient preferences and comorbidities [^c87a0788].

---

## Clinical assessment and diagnosis

- **Screening tools**: Use validated instruments such as the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) [^ab2eb351] and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to identify depression in older adults.

- **Comprehensive evaluation**: Assess for medical comorbidities, cognitive impairment, functional status, and psychosocial stressors, as these factors influence treatment selection and prognosis [^2b90808e].

- **Differentiation**: Distinguish depression from other conditions common in older adults, such as dementia, delirium, and anxiety disorders [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological treatment

### First-line antidepressants

- **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)**: SSRIs are first-line due to favorable safety and tolerability profiles. Commonly used SSRIs include sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, and fluoxetine [^6620f175].

- **Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)**: Venlafaxine and duloxetine are alternatives, particularly when comorbid pain conditions are present [^notfound].

- **Avoidance of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)**: TCAs are generally avoided due to anticholinergic side effects, orthostatic hypotension, and cardiotoxicity [^6620f175].

---

### Dosing and titration

Start low and go slow — begin at lower doses and titrate slowly to minimize side effects [^notfound]. Monitor for **adverse effects**, including hyponatremia, falls, gastrointestinal bleeding, and drug interactions [^1240b9f9].

---

### Maintenance treatment

Continue pharmacotherapy for at least 6–12 months after remission to prevent relapse; consider longer-term maintenance in patients with recurrent depression or high risk of relapse [^notfound].

---

## Psychotherapeutic interventions

Psychotherapy is recommended for older adults with depression, particularly for mild-to-moderate severity or when pharmacotherapy is contraindicated [^2b90808e]. Evidence-based options include:

| **Psychotherapy modality** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|
| Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) | Effective in reducing depressive symptoms and improving functioning [^927081fb] |
| Interpersonal therapy (IPT) | Effective, particularly in addressing interpersonal issues and grief [^notfound] |
| Problem-solving therapy (PST) | Effective, especially in older adults with executive dysfunction [^722bdbfa] |
| Life review therapy | Beneficial in older adults, particularly in group settings [^notfound] |

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

### Exercise

Exercise is strongly recommended as an adjunctive treatment [^5b5d8038]. Resistance and mind–body exercise (e.g. tai chi, yoga) show **moderate-to-large effect sizes** in reducing depressive symptoms [^7e248fb8]. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, supplemented by resistance training [^notfound].

---

### Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)

ECT is highly effective for severe, treatment-resistant depression, psychotic depression, or when rapid response is needed [^fca63779]. It is generally well tolerated in older adults, but monitor for cognitive side effects and cardiovascular complications [^notfound].

---

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)

TMS is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique with moderate efficacy in treatment-resistant depression [^notfound]. It is generally well tolerated, with minimal cognitive side effects.

---

## Treatment-resistant depression (TRD)

For TRD, consider the following:

- **Pharmacological strategies**: Switching antidepressants, augmentation with lithium, atypical antipsychotics (e.g. aripiprazole), or ketamine [^54b2461b].

- **Non-pharmacological strategies**: ECT, TMS, and psychotherapy (CBT, IPT) [^fca63779].

- **Collaborative care**: Multidisciplinary approaches involving primary care, psychiatry, and social work improve outcomes [^fca63779].

---

## Special considerations

- **Cognitive impairment**: Adapt psychotherapeutic techniques and consider pharmacological options with caution due to increased sensitivity to side effects [^4358b042].

- **Comorbid medical conditions**: Tailor treatment to minimize drug interactions and adverse effects [^2b90808e].

- **Frailty**: Antidepressants may have limited efficacy and increased adverse effects in frail older adults; prioritize non-pharmacological interventions [^1b6ae271].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regularly assess depressive symptoms, side effects, and adherence; adjust treatment as needed [^fca63779]. Use a **measurement-based care** approach with standardized scales (PHQ-9, GDS) to guide treatment decisions [^fca63779]. Engage patients and caregivers in shared decision-making to enhance adherence and satisfaction [^c87a0788].

---

## Conclusion

Effective management of geriatric depression requires a **comprehensive, individualized approach** that integrates pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. Psychotherapy and SSRIs/SNRIs are first-line, with exercise as a valuable adjunct. For treatment-resistant cases, ECT, TMS, and ketamine are options. Regular monitoring, collaborative care, and shared decision-making are essential to optimize outcomes.

Depression in older adults can be difficult to diagnose and a challenge to treat. Clinicians must address treatment issues caused by aging, such as comorbid medical illness, physical limitations, or the presence of cognitive impairments. Proven treatments for depression in older adults include psychotherapy, medications, and electroconvulsive therapy. When choosing therapies for older patients, possible adverse side effects, drug interactions, and patient limitations should guide treatment selection.

### Continuation and maintenance treatments for depression in older people [^df7f21c1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Depressive illness is common in old age. Prevalence in the community of case level depression is around 15% and milder forms of depression are more common. It causes significant distress and disability. The number of people over the age of 60 years is expected to double by 2050 and so interventions for this often long-term and recurrent condition are increasingly important. The causes of late-life depression differ from depression in younger adults and so it is appropriate to study it separately.This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2012.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy of antidepressants and psychological therapies in preventing the relapse and recurrence of depression in older people.

Search Methods

We performed a search of the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's specialised register (the CCMDCTR) to 13 July 2015. The CCMDCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We also conducted a cited reference search on 13 July 2015 of the Web of Science for citations of primary reports of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Both review authors independently selected studies. We included RCTs involving people aged 60 years and over successfully treated for an episode of depression and randomised to receive continuation and maintenance treatment with antidepressants, psychological therapies, or a combination.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data. The primary outcome for benefit was recurrence rate of depression (reaching a cut-off on any depression rating scale) at 12 months and the primary outcome for harm was drop-outs at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included relapse/recurrence rates at other time points, global impression of change, social functioning, and deaths. We performed meta-analysis using risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This update identified no further trials. Seven studies from the previous review met the inclusion criteria (803 participants). Six compared antidepressant medication with placebo; two involved psychological therapies. There was marked heterogeneity between the studies.Comparing antidepressants with placebo on the primary outcome for benefit, there was a statistically significant difference favouring antidepressants in reducing recurrence compared with placebo at 12 months with a GRADE rating of low for quality of evidence (three RCTs, n = 247, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.82; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 5). Comparing antidepressants with placebo on the primary outcome for harms, there was no difference in drop-out rates at 12 months' follow-up, with a GRADE rating of low.There was no significant difference between psychological treatment and antidepressant in recurrence rates at 12 months (one RCT, n = 53) or between combination treatment and antidepressant alone at 12 months.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated Cochrane review supports the findings of the original 2012 review. The long-term benefits and harm of continuing antidepressant medication in the prevention of recurrence of depression in older people are not clear and no firm treatment recommendations can be made on the basis of this review. Continuing antidepressant medication for 12 months appears to be helpful with no increased harms; however, this was based on only three small studies, relatively few participants, use of a range of antidepressant classes, and clinically heterogeneous populations. Comparisons at other time points did not reach statistical significance.Data on psychological therapies and combined treatments were too limited to draw any conclusions on benefits and harms.The quality of the evidence used in reaching these conclusions was low and the review does not, therefore, offer clear guidance to clinicians and patients on best practice and matching interventions to particular patient characteristics.Of note, we identified no new studies that evaluated pharmacological or psychological interventions in the continuation and maintenance treatment of depression in older people. We are aware of studies conducted since the previous review that included both older people and adults under the age of 65 years, but these fall outside of the remit of this review. We believe that there remains a need for studies solely recruiting older people, particularly the 'older old' with comorbid medical problems. However, these studies are likely to be challenging to conduct and may not, so far, have been prioritised by funders.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^bf97963d]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Executive summary—scope of guideline for depressive disorders outlines the populations, evidence base, included intervention domains, and exclusions: It is intended to provide recommendations for the treatment of depressive disorders based on systematic reviews of the evidence and addresses three developmental cohorts—children and adolescents, general adults, and older adults (ages 60 and over). Ten systematic reviews and meta-analyses served as the basis for this guideline. It addresses the efficacy of psychological and complementary and alternative medicine treatments and the comparative effectiveness of psychotherapy in combination with pharmacotherapy as well as compared to pharmacotherapy and complementary and alternative treatments, and also addresses harms and burdens of treatment and patient values and preferences. The reviews on which this guideline is based did not specifically address screening for depression, assessment of associated comorbid conditions, monitoring response to treatment, locus of care, prevention of depressive episodes, timing or duration of treatments for depression, costs of treatment, long-term benefits of treatment, mechanisms of change, bipolar disorder, or efficacy of treatments for disorders other than depression, and psychotic depression is not covered by this guideline.

### Treatment of depression in older adults [^1cf2b342]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Depression is the most frequent mental disorder in older people, often causing emotional distress and reduced quality of life. Despite its clinical significance, depression remains underdiagnosed and inadequately treated in older patients. Regarding prognosis, data suggest that almost 70% of patients, treated long enough and with appropriate doses, recover from an index episode of depression. Antidepressants are efficient for treating depressed outpatients with several comorbid physical diseases as well as hospitalized patients, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors being the antidepressants of choice for older patients. Available data can guide pharmacological treatment in both the acute and maintenance stages, but further research is required to guide clinical strategies when remission is not achieved. Approaches for the management of resistance to treatment are summarized, including optimization strategies, drug changes, algorithms, and combined and augmentation pharmacological treatments. Finally, additional therapeutic choices such as electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and integrated psychotherapy are presented.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^c06e55ed]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

APA Guideline for the Treatment of Depression—recommendation framework and key definitions across children and adolescents, the general adult population, and older adults are described as follows: No treatment is defined as “No active treatment was provided (i.e., waitlist).” Efficacy is “The impact of an intervention compared to an inactive control,” and comparative effectiveness “compares at least two different active treatments to each other to assess for the benefits of one (or combination) versus the other (or combination).” Recommendations pertaining to efficacy “do not imply that these treatments are superior to other active treatments.” Decision-making criteria were that the panel “recommended treatments that were consistently superior to nonactive control conditions or for which there was evidence of equivalency or superiority to other treatments,” “conditionally recommended treatments that were consistently superior to nonactive control conditions” when either “Other active treatments … were superior,” there was “Insufficient evidence that the treatment was equivalent to other effective treatments,” or there were “Greater harms/burdens than with other treatments,” and the panel “did not recommend treatments or recommended against treatments if there was insufficient evidence of efficacy or if the harms were considered to outweigh any benefits.” The ultimate decision “should be based on shared decision-making with the patient” and, for youth, “the parents/guardians or family members actively involved in their care.”

### FPIN's clinical inquiries-AAFP (...) [^5b5d8038]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Does regular exercise improve clinical depression symptoms in adults older than 60 years. Evidence-Based Answer Exercise is beneficial for treating depression in adults older than 60 years. Exercise training is recommended for healthy older adults because it significantly decreases depressive symptoms. Exercise improves depression in older patients with normal or impaired cognition. High-intensity resistance exercise also improves depression in older patients. . Evidence Summary A 2022 meta-analysis of 18 studies explored the effect of exercise training on depressive symptoms in healthy older adults. 1 Study participants were 60 years and older and did not exercise regularly.

Exercise interventions were aerobic, resistance, or a combination of the two, and the study included a nonexercise control group. Preand postdepression scores were measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale, Goldberg Depression Scale, Mental Health Functioning Index, and Beck Depression Inventory-II. The review used standardized mean difference because the studies used different depression scales. There was moderate heterogeneity between trials. Exercise significantly decreased depressive symptoms in participants with a moderate effect size. Interventions lasting more than 24 weeks had a greater effect than interventions lasting less than 24 weeks. SubscribeFrom $180

### Comparative efficacy of various exercise types and doses for depression in older adults: a systematic review of paired, network and dose-response meta-analyses [^7e248fb8]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We assessed the effects of different exercise modalities and doses on depression levels in older adults.

Methods

Systematic searches of the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Scopus databases were conducted from the start of database construction until December 2023. Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise interventions in older adults. Pairwise, network and dose-network meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models for the outcome of depression in older adults.

Results

A total of 80 RCTs with 5536 participants were included in this study. Network meta-analyses showed that resistance exercise [standardized mean difference (SMD)=- 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): - 0.90, - 0.46] and mind-body exercise (MBE; SMD=- 0.54, 95% CI: - 0.72, - 0.37) were the most effective forms of exercise for improving depression in older adults, followed by aerobic exercise (SMD=- 0.31, 95% CI: - 0.50, - 0.13) and mixed exercise (SMD=- 0.23, 95% CI: - 44, - 0.01). In addition, a U-shaped dose-response relationship was found between overall exercise dose and depression levels in older adults, and a significant response was seen after 390 metabolic equivalent (MET)-min/week.

Conclusions

Our study determined the effectiveness of different exercises in improving levels of older adults and found that resistance exercise and MBE were more effective adjunctive treatments. By providing the most effective treatments, older adults can reap the benefits of improving depression in older adults at doses lower than the World Health Organization guidelines.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^d023ba8f]. The American Psychologist (2022). Medium credibility.

The American Psychological Association (APA) developed this clinical practice guideline to provide recommendations for the treatment of depressive disorders, including major depression, subsyndromal depression, and persistent depressive disorder. It addresses three developmental cohorts: adolescents, general adults, and older adults (ages 60 and over). Ten systematic reviews and meta-analyses, along with other literature and observations from practitioners and patients, served as the basis for the guideline. The guideline development panel consisted of health professionals from psychology, psychiatry, and family medicine as well as community members who self-identified as having had depression. The panel examined the efficacy of psychological treatments and of complementary and alternative medicine treatments. It also examined comparative effectiveness among psychological treatments, by themselves and in combination with pharmacotherapy, and comparative effectiveness of psychological treatments in relation to pharmacotherapy and to complementary and alternative treatments. The panel made recommendations for treatment of depression in adolescents, adults, and older adults but did not make treatment recommendations specific to children. These recommendations, presented in detail in the guideline, are summarized here. The target audience for the guideline includes clinicians, researchers, patients, family members, and policymakers.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^ee55d2fd]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Overall treatment impact—Treatments for depression have a modest impact on alleviating symptoms, with numbers-needed-to-treat of about six to eight, reflecting high rates of spontaneous recovery, placebo effects, and modest treatment effects, and there is an important group of patients who do not recover through spontaneous recovery or treatment.

### Why we need to evaluate long-term antidepressant use in older patients with depression [^579a004d]. Age and Ageing (2021). Medium credibility.

In this commentary, we address current clinical practice of long-term antidepressant use in older adults with depression, and recommend improvements. Compared with younger adults, older adults more frequently use antidepressants in the long term, although they may not always benefit from them, and in spite of an increased risk for adverse events. Unfortunately, evaluations of long-term antidepressant use are sparse, especially in older age groups. To prevent and reduce inappropriate long-term use and adverse events, antidepressant use in older age groups should be regularly evaluated.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of second-generation antidepressants for the treatment of older adults with depression: questionable benefit and considerations for frailty [^db53a055]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Frailty is associated with an increased risk of being diagnosed with depression. Further, in long-term care settings, where many frail older adults reside, antidepressants are amongst the most commonly prescribed medications. Thus, it is important to consider how frail patients with depression respond to treatment. Nevertheless, there is little written about the efficacy and safety of antidepressants for the treatment of frail older adults with depression. To address this knowledge gap, we employed standardized methodology to review and critique the evidence for older adults, followed by theoretical consideration of its applicability to frailty.

### Psychological therapies for depression in older adults residing in long-term care settings [^62967777]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Depression is common amongst older people residing in long-term care (LTC) facilities. Currently, most residents treated for depression are prescribed antidepressant medications, despite the potential availability of psychological therapies that are suitable for older people and a preference amongst many older people for non-pharmacological treatment approaches.

Objectives

To assess the effect of psychological therapies for depression in older people living in LTC settings, in comparison with treatment as usual, waiting list control, and non-specific attentional control; and to compare the effectiveness of different types of psychological therapies in this setting.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, five grey literature sources, and two trial registers. We performed reference checking and citation searching, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. The latest search was 31 October 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs of any type of psychological therapy for the treatment of depression in adults aged 65 years and over residing in a LTC facility.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles/abstracts and full-text manuscripts for inclusion. Two review authors independently performed data extraction and risk of bias assessments using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. We contacted study authors for additional information where required. Primary outcomes were level of depressive symptomatology and treatment non-acceptability; secondary outcomes included depression remission, quality of life or psychological well-being, and level of anxious symptomatology. We used Review Manager 5 to conduct meta-analyses, using pairwise random-effects models. For continuous data, we calculated standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using endpoint data, and for dichotomous data, we used odds ratios and 95% CIs. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 19 RCTs with 873 participants; 16 parallel group RCTs and three cluster-RCTs. Most studies compared psychological therapy (typically including elements of cognitive behavioural therapy, behavioural therapy, reminiscence therapy, or a combination of these) to treatment as usual or to a condition controlling for the effects of attention. We found very low-certainty evidence that psychological therapies were more effective than non-therapy control conditions in reducing symptoms of depression, with a large effect size at end-of-intervention (SMD -1.04, 95% CI -1.49 to -0.58; 18 RCTs, 644 participants) and at short-term (up to three months) follow-up (SMD -1.03, 95% CI -1.49 to -0.56; 16 RCTs, 512 participants). In addition, very low-certainty evidence from a single study with 82 participants indicated that psychological therapy was associated with a greater reduction in the number of participants presenting with major depressive disorder compared to treatment as usual control, at end-of-intervention and short-term follow-up. However, given the limited data on the effect of psychological therapies on remission of major depressive disorder, caution is advised in interpreting this result. Participants receiving psychological therapy were more likely to drop out of the trial than participants receiving a non-therapy control (odds ratio 3.44, 95% CI 1.19 to 9.93), which may indicate higher treatment non-acceptability. However, analyses were restricted due to limited dropout case data and imprecise reporting, and the finding should be interpreted with caution. There was very low-certainty evidence that psychological therapy was more effective than non-therapy control conditions in improving quality of life and psychological well-being at short-term follow-up, with a medium effect size (SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.82; 5 RCTs, 170 participants), but the effect size was small at postintervention (SMD 0.40, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.82; 6 RCTs, 195 participants). There was very low-certainty evidence of no effect of psychological therapy on anxiety symptoms postintervention (SMD -0.68, 95% CI -2.50 to 1.14; 2 RCTs, 115 participants), although results lacked precision, and there was insufficient data to determine short-term outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review suggests that cognitive behavioural therapy, behavioural therapy, and reminiscence therapy may reduce depressive symptoms compared with usual care for LTC residents, but the evidence is very uncertain. Psychological therapies may also improve quality of life and psychological well-being amongst depressed LTC residents in the short term, but may have no effect on symptoms of anxiety in depressed LTC residents, compared to control conditions. However, the evidence for these effects is very uncertain, limiting our confidence in the findings. The evidence could be strengthened by better reporting and higher-quality RCTs of psychological therapies in LTC, including trials with larger samples, reporting results separately for those with and without cognitive impairment and dementia, and longer-term outcomes to determine when effects wane.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^267d01d5]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Guideline for the Treatment of Depression—conclusion notes that limitations require caution and conservative recommendations given gaps in the depression intervention literature; the panel makes recommendations based on following the IOM (2011a) criteria and is aware of the limits of its assessment and scope. The field is strongly urged to address significant issues related to study design and standardization of methodology, including consistent inclusion of racially diverse populations and consistency in defining treatments and measurement of outcomes, and is encouraged to generate additional research and reviews on humanistic therapies, emotion-focused therapy, and different treatment modalities. The guideline makes an important contribution by addressing treatment of depression from childhood through older adulthood, including an examination of psychotherapeutic interventions, was developed following the IOM (2011a) standards for trustworthy guideline development, and is an outgrowth of APA's evidence-based practice policy predicated on integrating the best available research; practitioner expertise; and patient culture, values and preferences.

### Management of depression in older adults: a review [^2b90808e]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Depression in older adults is a common psychiatric disorder affecting their health-related quality of life. Major depression occurs in 2% of adults aged 55 years or older, and its prevalence rises with increasing age. In addition, 10% to 15% of older adults have clinically significant depressive symptoms, even in the absence of major depression.

Observations

Depression presents with the same symptoms in older adults as it does in younger populations. In contrast to younger patients, older adults with depression more commonly have several concurrent medical disorders and cognitive impairment. Depression occurring in older patients is often undetected or inadequately treated. Antidepressants are the best-studied treatment option, but psychotherapy, exercise therapy, and electroconvulsive therapy may also be effective. Psychotherapy is recommended for patients with mild to moderate severity depression. Many older patients need the same doses of antidepressant medication that are used for younger adult patients. Although antidepressants may effectively treat depression in older adults, they tend to pose greater risk for adverse events because of multiple medical comorbidities and drug-drug interactions in case of polypharmacy. High-quality evidence does not support the use of pharmacologic treatment of depression in patients with dementia. Polypharmacy in older patients can be minimized by using the Screening Tool of Older Persons Prescriptions and Screening Tool to Alert doctors to Right Treatment (STOPP/START) criteria, a valid and reliable screening tool that enables physicians to avoid potentially inappropriate medications, undertreatment, or errors of omissions in older people. Antidepressants can be gradually tapered over a period of several weeks, but discontinuation of antidepressants may be associated with relapse or recurrence of depression, so the patient should be closely observed.

Conclusions and Relevance

Major depression in older adults is common and can be effectively treated with antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy. Psychological therapies and exercise may also be effective for mild-moderate depression, for patients who prefer nonpharmacological treatment, or for patients who are too frail for drug treatments.

APA Guideline for the Treatment of Depression—limitations in older adults highlight three salient issues in late-life treatment and prevention: underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minority participants, a relative dearth of participants among the “oldest old” (i.e., those older than 75 or 80), and a paucity of information on treatment response modifiers.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^781c2dd1]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

APA guideline—initial treatment for major depressive disorder in older adult patients: The panel recommends, in the context of shared decision-making, either group life review treatment or Group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (either alone or added to usual care) over no treatment, and combined pharmacotherapy and IPT over IPT alone; although the study used nortriptyline, the panel recommends a second-generation antidepressant due to the reduced risk of side effects. Strength of recommendation: Recommendation for use. Justification notes that cognitive-behavioural therapy (group) and life review (group) were the only interventions with adequate efficacy evidence; comparative effectiveness research either finds sufficient evidence to recommend between some treatment comparisons or finds similar effects between treatments; and nortriptyline is now viewed as a second- or third-line pharmacotherapy strategy, generally reserved for patients who have not done well with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, which are generally considered to be safer for older adults than nortriptyline; there is some efficacy data from systematic reviews/meta-analyses showing efficacy of second-generation antidepressants over placebo. Older adults were defined as ages 60 and over, with at least one study including some individuals as young as 50; however, the majority were ages 60 and over.

### Older adults with severe, treatment-resistant depression [^fca63779]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Depression is a common, disabling, and costly condition encountered in older patients. Effective strategies for detection and treatment of late-life depression are summarized based on a case of a 69-year-old woman who struggled with prolonged depression. Clinicians should screen older patients for depression using a standard rating scale, initiate treatment such as antidepressant medications or evidence-based psychotherapy, and monitor depression symptoms. Patients who are not improving should be considered for psychiatric consultation and treatment changes including electroconvulsive therapy. Several changes in treatment approaches are usually needed before patients achieve complete remission. Maintenance treatment and relapse-prevention planning (summarization of early warning signs for depression, maintenance treatments such as medications, and other strategies to reduce the risk of relapse [eg, regular physical activity or pleasant activities]) can reduce the risk of relapse. Collaborative programs, in which primary care clinicians work closely with mental health specialists following a measurement-based treatment-to-target approach, are significantly more effective than typical primary care treatment.

### Depression in later life: an overview with treatment recommendations [^cbe2c4ca]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

We have already entered a new, more exciting, and hopeful era in the treatment of late-life depression. The increasing numbers of older adults who are surviving to more advanced ages and the greater recognition of late-life depression’s prevalence and impact on quality of life emphasize how important it is to detect and treat this disorder. Our increasing repertoire of evidence-based psychotherapeutic, pharmacologic, and neurotherapeutic treatment interventions offers many treatment alternatives, allowing substantial individualization of treatment approach. Demonstration of the effectiveness of depression treatment in primary care suggests the feasibility of increasing our patients’ access to care. Growing appreciation of the pathophysiology of depression and its interrelationships with cognitive impairment may increase our ability to limit or delay certain aspects of cognitive impairment through more aggressive treatment of depression. Improved recognition and treatment of late-life depression holds great potential for improving physical and mental health in later life, reducing disability in later years, and improving quality of life.

Methods

This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.The protocol was prospectively registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO CRD42023494513). No ethics approval was required. We followed the published protocol, with the following changes: we substituted the Cochrane risk of bias-2 tool as the validity rating method, included the RCTs identified in the previous review (these changes on the advice of journal reviewers) and did not include global change as an outcome because few studies used it, while all measured depressive symptoms.

Search strategy

We searched three databases (PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Web of Science) from 8 January 2010 to 10 December 2023 using the keywords: (resist* OR refractory OR inadequate response OR partial response) AND (depress*) AND (elderly OR old* OR geriatric) AND (treatment OR trial). We repeated the searches of all databases on 14 July 2024 and found no further eligible studies. We imported results to ‘Covidence’ software. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, identifying all studies of potential relevance for full-text review. Any conflicts were resolved by discussion with a third author. We screened reference lists of studies identified for full-text review and relevant reviews. Full strategies for each database are in online supplemental material appendix 1.

Selection criteria

We drew on the 2011 systematic review methods,additionally restricting evidence to RCTs. We included primary research studies describing RCTs that compared an intervention intended as a treatment for depression against placebo or another active treatment; where all participants, or a separately analysed subgroup were, on average, aged >55 years, had a clinical diagnosis of depressive disorder and were classified as treatment resistant at baseline. For this, the same, inclusive definition as the 2011 review: failure to respond to at least one adequate treatment (pharmacological or psychological; acceptable treatment trial and adherence) was used.

### Evaluating the effects of physical activity and antidepressive agents on depressive symptoms in older adults: a meta-analysis of existing evidence [^9184af50]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In older adults, Firstly, pharmacological treatment can significantly improve depressive symptoms in a short period. For older adults with severe conditions or in urgent need of rapid relief from emotional distress, pharmacological intervention may be more attractive. Secondly, antidepressive agents have been clinically validated to have robust efficacy in treating depression, allowing physicians to choose the most suitable type and dosage of medication based on individual patient circumstances to achieve the optimal therapeutic outcome.

Overall, physical activity and antidepressive agents both play crucial roles in alleviating depression symptoms in older adults. When selecting treatment modalities, physicians should consider the individual’s health status, medical history, preferences, and treatment goals to develop the most appropriate personalized treatment plan. Future research should further explore the long-term effects, safety, and applicability of these two interventions in different populations to provide more comprehensive and effective guidance for the treatment of depression in older adults.

When discussing the treatment options for depression symptoms in older adults, it is important to consider individual differences and the importance of comprehensive therapy. While physical activity and antidepressive agents are two main intervention methods, they are not mutually exclusive choices. In fact, many studies have shown that combining physical activity with medication therapy may lead to better treatment outcomes. Some older adults may be more sensitive to medication therapy, while others may prefer non-pharmacological interventions such as physical activity or psychotherapy. Therefore, when formulating treatment plans, factors such as the older adult’s physical health status, cognitive level, social support network, as well as personal preferences and interests should be fully considered. Additionally, for those older adults who are unable or unwilling to engage in physical activity, exploring other forms of non-pharmacological interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, social support, and psychological education, can also help alleviate depression to some extent, thereby improving their quality of life and psychological well-being.

Prevention of recurrence–MDD in older adult patients with a history of depression—insufficient evidence guidance: For older adult patients with a history of depression there is insufficient evidence to recommend between clinicians offering cognitive-behavioral therapy (group) plus pharmacotherapy and pharmacotherapy alone for preventing recurrence, thus the panel makes no recommendations of one treatment over the other, and decision should be based on shared decision-making with the patient.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^1240b9f9]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Older adult depression—antidepressant pharmacotherapy shows duration-dependent benefits and safety considerations: in randomized, placebo-controlled trials it appears more effective for long-term or maintenance treatment (over 2–3 years) at preventing recurrence than short-term use (up to 12 weeks) for response or remission, and a meta-analysis estimated a number needed to treat of 3.4; however, there is no strong evidence-based consensus on which patients need maintenance pharmacotherapy apart from those with three or more episodes of major depression. Potential safety concerns in older adults treated with antidepressants include drug–drug interactions, hyponatremia, falls and fractures, gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular effects, and bone metabolism/osteoporosis. Evidence-based management in primary care that offers both pharmacotherapy and learning-based psychotherapies (interpersonal psychotherapy and problem-solving therapy) has demonstrated moderately higher levels of treatment response and remission versus usual care and has further demonstrated reduction in long-term rates of mortality from co-occurring medical conditions; thus, both the short- and long-term risks and benefits of antidepressant pharmacotherapy in older adults, together with patient preferences, need to be carefully weighed in shared decision-making with patients and families.

Adult depression—American Psychiatric Association guideline states that certain treatment approaches might be considered as applied first (psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy for adults) and then suggests other options (complementary and alternative treatments for adults) if first options are not available or acceptable. Both APA and Kaiser guidelines recommend consideration of patient culture, values and preferences, and medication side effects. The APA guideline was frequently unable to recommend a specific antidepressant medication over another due to insufficient evidence, though it recommended a combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy versus antidepressant medication alone in some cases.

Recommendation strength ranges from strong (“the panel recommends”) to conditional (“the panel suggests”), and applicability was organized using the PICOTS framework. For information on patient values and preferences, the strength of evidence was very low.

### The effects of delivery format on the effectiveness and acceptability of self-guided interventions for depression in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^29465ea4]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Self-guided interventions could improve the availability of evidence-based psychotherapies for late-life depressive symptoms. However, their treatment outcomes and acceptability across delivery formats remain uncertain. This review aimed to examine the effectiveness and acceptability of self-guided intervention for older adults with depressive symptoms and the impact of different intervention features. Randomised controlled trials included older adults (mean age ≥ 60 years) with elevated depressive symptoms who received self-guided interventions for depression were eligible. Trials were extracted from an existing database and updated systematic literature searches in PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase, and Cochrane Library (last update: 20th Mar 2025). Data were synthesised with random-effects meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and meta-regressions. Outcomes included depressive symptoms, quality of life, and dropout rates. Seven studies with 1170 participants were identified. Compared to controls, self-guided interventions had small-to-moderate effect in reducing depressive symptoms at post-treatment (g = 0.46, 95 % CI 0.20 to 0.73), but the effect was not sustained at 3-to-12-month follow-up (g = 0.15, 95 % CI -0.45 to 0.74). Effects on quality of life remains inconclusive. Acceptability was comparable between self-guided interventions and control conditions (RR = 1.52, p = .294). No differences in treatment effects and acceptability were observed across delivery formats, support levels, or initial human screening. Most studies showed a moderate-to-high risk of bias (n = 6). Self-guided interventions for depression were associated with reductions in depressive symptoms and were acceptable to older adults, regardless of delivery format and level of human support. They may be considered a brief intervention option in resource-limited setting.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of second-generation antidepressants for the treatment of older adults with depression: questionable benefit and considerations for frailty [^1b6ae271]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Recommendations

Considering the possibility that a frail patient may have limited response to antidepressants and is more at risk for adverse events, we recommend the following:
Use antidepressants judiciously, with awareness of the limited evidence for efficacy in adults age ≥ 65 years and, by association, older adults with frailty.
Attentively consider the potential for adverse effects with frailty.
Reflect on patient circumstances and carefully assess whether changes in mood could be situational and/or related to frailty; make a concerted effort to provide the kind of support that can benefit frail older adults, such as home and situational supports.
Consider that, due to varied populations and heterogeneous response, antidepressants may be beneficial for some older adults who are frail.
If antidepressants are trialed, adequate dose and treatment time should be assured before judging efficacy. On the other hand, continuing antidepressants when they are not effective contributes to polypharmacy. Therefore, when treatment is initiated, attentively assess treatment response with the aim of stopping medications when no benefit is observed. When making treatment decisions, consider the high placebo response.
Routinely re-evaluate whether antidepressants should be continued when they are used for prolonged periods of time.
Reconsider guidelines that recommend screening for depression in frail populations (such as in nursing homes), as this approach likely contributes to the over-diagnosis of depression and polypharmacy.

To conclude, many authors conjecture that “late-life depression remains underdiagnosed and inadequately treated.” In contrast, based on the evidence reviewed and its hypothesized applicability to frailty, we are concerned that frail older adults might be over treated with second-generation antidepressants with little to no benefit.

Our findings contribute to the growing discourse of uncertain clinical benefit from antidepressants and high risk of bias in antidepressant trials. Some experts may not agree with our interpretation of the evidence. They may focus more on the potential for benefit and highlight the relative safety of antidepressants. In contrast, in the face of uncertainty, we maintain that ‘less is more’ in management of the frail elderly.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^5cb6dafe]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Treatment issues in older adults—preferences, setting, and primary care prevalence indicate a preference for psychosocial care amid provider shortages and substantial primary care burden. Many older adults prefer psychosocial treatments to pharmacotherapy for depression. It is often difficult to provide psychosocial treatment given the paucity of specially-trained providers, especially in primary care where late-life depression is principally treated. At any one point in time, it is estimated that 6%-10% of older patients in primary care settings qualify for current major depressive episode and another 10%-20% have subsyndromal symptoms that are disabling and pose risk for conversion to major depression.

### Late-life depression: evidence-based treatment and promising new directions for research and clinical practice [^aba2499d]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

As the population ages, successive cohorts of older adults will experience depressive disorders. Late-life depression (LLD) carries additional risk for suicide, medical comorbidity, disability, and family caregiving burden. Although response and remission rates to pharmacotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy are comparable with those in midlife depression, relapse rates are higher, underscoring the challenge to achieve and maintain wellness. This article reviews the evidence base for LLD treatment options and provides an analysis of treatment options for difficult-to-treat LLD variants (eg, psychotic depression, vascular depression). Treatment algorithms are also reviewed based on predictors of response and promising novel treatment options.

### Efficacy of low intensity interventions for geriatric depression and anxiety – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^0da0723c]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the efficacy of low intensity psychological interventions for older adults (60+ years) with clinical anxiety and/or depressive disorders.

Method

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised control trials of low-intensity psychological interventions for anxiety and/or depression with an active or passive control condition (e.g., waitlist, treatment-as-usual or active control) in any setting. Low intensity psychological interventions (e.g., cognitive behaviour therapy [CBT]) targeted anxiety and/or depression as primary outcomes, were primarily self-help, and included support from trained practitioners/facilitators with <6 h total contact time (typically <30 min p/contact).

Results

Seven studies consisting of 304 older adults (65-78 years, M age = 70, SD = 4) were identified and six included in the meta-analysis of depression outcomes and three for anxiety. A random effects meta-analysis of group differences in symptom change from pre-post treatment found evidence favouring low intensity psychological interventions over passive control groups for the treatment of depressive and anxiety symptoms, with moderate effect sizes for depression (Cohen's d = -0.62) and large effect sizes for anxiety (Cohen's d = -0.84) at post-treatment.

Limitations

Results are limited by study design of included studies such that the efficacy of interventions compared to treatment-as-usual, non-CBT approaches, in adults >80 years and long-term effects are unknown.

Conclusions

There is some evidence supporting the clinical benefits of low intensity psychological interventions for depressive and anxiety symptoms in older adults compared to passive controls. More research is needed to examine efficacy compared to active control conditions, and among those over 80 years.

Older adults with MDD or minor depression plus cognitive impairment/dementia—there is insufficient evidence for a recommendation regarding the combination of behavioral activation therapy (individual) and treatment as usual over treatment as usual for depressive symptoms.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^35ebee7f]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Older adult depression—prevalence and course is marked by high inpatient rates, frequent relapse, and treatment resistance. Prevalence is reported as higher still (10%-42%) among older patients in inpatient settings, including long-term care. Subthreshold depression is 2-3 times more common than major depression in older adults, and 8%-10% of those with subthreshold symptoms develop major depression each year. The clinical presentation in older adults differs from earlier life by following a relapsing and recurrent course, and depression is often treatment resistant, with partial response linked to continuing disability, caregiver burden, and elevated risk for early relapse and recurrence.

### Risk factors for suicide (...) [^ab2eb351]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

The Geriatric Depression Scale is a useful screening tool that has been validated for use in patients with dementia who have Mini-Mental State Examination scores as low as 15. Based on their adverse effect profiles, SSRIs are the preferred medications for treating depression in older adults. Based on expert opinion, citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline may be preferred because of fewer drug interactions or cognitive risks.
11. 21, 22 Medications more likely to be lethal in overdose should be avoided. Persisting suicidal ideation is one of the indications for electroconvulsive therapy, which may be safely administered to older patients. Other indications for electroconvulsive therapy are lack of response to medication, psychosis, and previous good response to this modality.
23.

The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend screening for and treating depression for secondary prevention in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Assessment is recommended during hospitalization, one month after discharge, and annually thereafter. 28 Cognitive behavior therapy or antidepressant medication is recommended for treatment. SSRIs are generally well tolerated by patients with cardiac conditions. Whether treatment of depression prevents future cardiovascular events is uncertain. A study of patients with acute coronary syndrome showed treatment of depression to be associated with greater patient satisfaction and a reduction of depressive symptoms, with a trend toward improved cardiac prognosis.
29. Structured psychotherapy yields depression remission rates similar to medication, and may be preferred in patients at higher risk of adverse drug reactions.

36 CBT is the most widely studied form of psychotherapy and has been shown to be effective in geriatric depression, particularly in mild to moderately severe cases. CBT involves replacing negative distortions of events and situations with more positive and rational cognitive responses. 37, 38 There is some evidence that the effects of CBT may be longer lasting than drug therapy following discontinuation of treatment. Older persons do well with CBT, but need special attention because of memory impairment and sensory deficits, primarily hearing loss.
39. There is some evidence that aerobic and anaerobic exercise programs are helpful for treating depression. A meta-analysis specific to older patients found evidence of benefit for major depression but the effects were not sustained unless the exercise program continued. 40 A Cochrane review on exercise for adult depression found evidence of benefit comparable to cognitive therapy.

41 Both reviews noted inconsistencies in the quality of the studies and the need for further research.

### Antidepressant versus placebo for depressed elderly [^16194499]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Depression warranting intervention is found in ten percent of people over the age of 60. Older depressed people are more likely to die than non-depressed. Relatively few receive therapeutic interventions, and those that do, tend to receive low dose antidepressant therapy. Depression in older people is thought to differ in terms of aetiology, presentation, treatment and outcome than in younger people. Concomitant physical illness and increasing social, physical and neurophysiological diversity are associated with the ageing process. Consequently drug treatment of older patients is often carried out in institutions and on patients suffering from multiple physical problems.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of antidepressant medication compared with placebo in the treatment of depression in older patients.

Search Strategy

The search strategy incorporated: electronic literature searches of databases held by the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group (CCDAN) (see Collaborative Review Group Search Strategy). Reference lists of related reviews and references of located studies. Contact was made with authors working in the field.

Selection Criteria

All randomised, placebo controlled trials using antidepressants in the treatment of the presenting episode of depression in patients described as elderly, geriatric senile or older adult.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two types of data were extracted (if available) from each study. The first type of data was dichotomous data, this consisted of recovered/not recovered. The second, continuous data,included: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Montgomery-Asberg Rating Scale (MADRS) and other depression rating scale scores. An analysis using Peto Odds ratios for the dichotomous data and weighted mean difference for continuous data was performed using RevMan 3.1. The presence of heterogeneity of treatment effect was assessed.

Main Results

Seventeen trials contributed data to the analyses comparing the efficacy of antidepressant treatment and placebo. Analyses of efficacy was based on 245 patients treated with TCAs (223 with placebo), 365 patients treated with SSRIs (372 with placebo) and 58 patients treated with MAOIs (63 with placebo). The standardised effect size for the three groups respectively were: TCAs; OR: 0.32 (0.21,0.47), SSRIs; OR; 0.51 (0.36,0.72), MAOIs: 0.17 (0.07,0.39).

Reviewer's Conclusions

TCAs, SSRIs and MAOIs are effective in the treatment of older community patients and inpatients likely to have severe physical illness. At least six weeks of antidepressant treatment is recommended to achieve optimal therapeutic effect. There is little evidence concerning the efficacy of low dose TCA treatment. Further trials are required before low dose TCA treatment is routinely recommended.

### Tailored internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy for depression in older adults: a randomized controlled trial [^1aa921d1]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and objectives

Depression and subsyndromal depression in older adults are common and associated with poor quality of life, poor physical health, impaired activities in daily life, and a higher mortality. Among the different treatment alternatives, it has been argued that psychological treatment should be prioritized for older people because pharmacological treatments often involve side effects and interactions with other drugs and somatic diseases. Among different psychological treatments, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and especially the specific subtype Problem Solving Therapy, have good evidence for efficacy. Older people often prefer psychological treatment before pharmacological depression treatment, but even if psychological treatment is recommended as a first-line treatment, few older adults are offered such treatments. Reasons behind the low availability of psychological treatments for older people can include stigmatization when seeking help for mental illness, lack of transport facilities to be able to see a psychotherapist, and lack of confidence in treatment effect in therapist and client.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^02a21683]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Evaluating the evidence (APA Depression Guideline)—Evidence profiles were created by the RTI-UNC Evidence-based Practice Center team from systematic reviews and include, for each outcome, the number of studies, absolute effect sizes, confidence intervals (when available), and strength of evidence ratings. Decision tables and grids were used to summarize and evaluate evidence, with four main domains documented: (1) strength of evidence; (2) treatment outcomes and the balance of benefits vs. harms and burdens of interventions; (3) patient values and preferences; and (4) applicability of the evidence to various treatment populations. Strength of evidence was rated as either insufficient/very low, low, moderate, or high, and only interventions that had at least low strength of evidence for one of the outcomes were decision tables or grids completed. The panel generated evidence that met the criteria for the completion of 38 decision tables and three grids on which to base the APA Depression Guideline. To improve efficiency while maintaining consistency and transparency, a revised “grid” process was created with distinct columns for separate questions and outcomes and individual decision-making regarding efficacy but shared consideration of the same data for harms and burdens across columns. Although some questioned applicability of randomized trials, the panel decided not to supplement the randomized trials with observational or other treatment studies due to potential confounding bias, but made two significant exceptions when randomized trial data were lacking on two outcomes—(1) harms and burdens of psychological treatments and (2) patient values and preferences regarding particular treatments—and authorized APA staff to compile additional information from the literature on these topics.

### Depression epidemiology and its treatment evolution [^0b905d0a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Approximately 1 in 5 US adults have at least one episode of major depression in their lifetime. Of those who do, the majority will relapse over the long term and many will have psychosocial disabilities and reduced functioning. Over the past century, a range of medications have been developed to treat depression, although some effective medications have been superseded by newer treatments with an improved safety and tolerability profile. A reconsideration of some older medications is warranted until agents with truly novel mechanisms of action and good safety and tolerability profiles are available.

### Anti-inflammatory interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression among older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^df205cff]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Depression is a common mental disorder that severely affects health-related quality of life and even results in death by suicide in extreme cases. In older adults, the prevalence of depression is estimated to be about 10–20% and rises with age. With the aging of the world’s population, depression in older adults will bring an ever-greater disease burden, making it a leading public health concern.

When treating a depressive episode, both antidepressants and psychological therapeutic strategies are recommended for the remission of depressive symptoms. In clinical practice, pharmacotherapy is used more frequently than non-pharmacological therapy due to inadequate resources. However, the current antidepressants are unsatisfactory because of their significant adverse effects, lower response, and moderate efficacy, which take weeks to produce a measurable benefit. Even after several sequential treatments with different conventional antidepressants, about one-third of the patients still fail to respond. For geriatric patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), the benefits of traditional antidepressants can be more limited. A meta-analysis revealed that the response rates of antidepressants were 53.9% in younger adult patients, but significantly decreased to 45.2 and 42.2% in older adult patients aged ≥ 55 years old and ≥ 65 years old, respectively. Given that the response rates of placebo reached up to 39.2% in these older patients, the efficacy of antidepressants leaves much to be desired. Similarly, another meta-analysis found that second-generation antidepressants seem effective for older MDD patients but the magnitude of the effect is small, and the response rates are numerically lower than those reported for adult MDD patients. Mechanistically, some pioneer studies have discussed that brain-based structural and functional mechanisms, including white matter integrity and hyperintensity, may disturb the treatment of late-life depression.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of second-generation antidepressants for the treatment of older adults with depression: questionable benefit and considerations for frailty [^2f128223]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Frail older adults are commonly prescribed antidepressants. Yet, there is little evidence to determine the efficacy and safety of antidepressants to treat depression with concomitant frailty. To better understand this issue, we examined the efficacy and safety of second-generation antidepressants for the treatment of older adults with depression and then considered implications for frailty.

Methods

Due to the absence of therapeutic studies of frail older adults with depression, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of double-blind, randomized controlled trials that compared antidepressants versus placebo for adults with depression, age 65years or older. We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, reference lists from meta-analyses/studies, hand searches of publication lists, and related articles on PubMed. Outcomes included rates of response, remission, and adverse events. After evaluating the data, we applied a frailty-informed framework to consider how the evidence could be applied to frailty.

Results

Nine trials were included in the meta-analysis (n=2704). Subjects had moderate to severe depression. For older adults with depression, there was no statistically significant difference in response or remission to second-generation antidepressants compared to placebo. Response occurred in 45.3% of subjects receiving an antidepressant compared to 40.5% receiving placebo (RR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.96 - 1.37, p = 0.12, I2 = 71%). Remission occurred in 33.1% with antidepressant versus 31.3% with placebo (RR 1.10, 95% CI: 0.92 - 1.31, p = 0.30, I2 = 56%) (Figure 2 and 3). There were more withdrawals due to adverse events with antidepressants, 13% versus 5.8% (RR 2.30, 95% CI: 1.45-3.63; p <0.001; I 2 =61%; NNH 14, 95% CI:10-28).

Implications For Frailty

Subjects in the meta-analysis did not have obvious characteristics of frailty. Using framework questions to consider the implications of frailty, we hypothesize that, like older adults, frail individuals with depression may not respond to antidepressants. Further, observational studies suggest that those who are frail may be less responsive to antidepressants compared to the non-frail. Given the vulnerability of frailty, adverse events may be more burdensome.

Conclusions

Second-generation antidepressants have uncertain benefit for older adults with depression and cause more adverse events compared to placebo. Until further research clarifies benefit, careful consideration of antidepressant prescribing with frailty is warranted.

### Treatments for later-life depressive conditions: a meta-analytic comparison of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy [^676a60a4]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To improve interventions for depressed older adults, data are needed on the comparative effects of pharmacotherapy versus psychotherapy. Given that most older adults with clinically significant depressive symptoms do not have major depression, data on treatments for minor depression and dysthymia are especially needed.

Method

Meta-analysis was used to integrate the results of 89 controlled studies of treatments focused on acute major depression (37 studies) and other depressive disorders (52 studies conducted with mixed diagnostic groups, including patients with major depression, minor depression, and dysthymia). A total of 5,328 older adults received pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy in these studies.

Results

Clinician-rated depression scores improved, on average, by 0.80 standard deviation (SD) units; self-rated depression scores improved by 0.76 SD units. Clinician-rated depression improved by 0.69 SD units in pharmacotherapeutic studies and by 1.09 SD units in psychotherapeutic studies. Self-rated depression improved by 0.62 SD units and 0.83 SD units, respectively. An interesting finding was the stronger improvements in clinician-rated depression among control subjects participating in medication studies, compared to those in psychotherapeutic studies.

Conclusions

Available treatments for depression work, with effect sizes that are moderate to large. Comparisons of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy must be interpreted with caution, in part because medication studies are more likely to use a credible active placebo, which may lead to smaller adjusted effect sizes in medication studies. Given that psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy did not show strong differences in effect sizes, treatment choice should be based on other criteria, such as contraindications, treatment access, or patient preferences.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^884fcfa0]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Older adult patients with depression—conditional recommendation for use: If a recommended treatment is not acceptable or available, the panel suggests that clinicians offer one of the following psychotherapies/interventions that demonstrated efficacy when compared with no treatment or treatment as usual. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (individual) (either standalone or in combination with usual care) was found to be superior to no treatment, a nonspecific talk therapy control, usual care, and desipramine. Combination cognitive-behavioral therapy and nonspecific therapeutic techniques (individual) with pharmacotherapy was superior to pharmacotherapy alone, and the panel recommends a second-generation antidepressant due to the reduced risk of side effects. Interpersonal psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy was conditionally superior for preventing recurrence to supportive care or to IPT and supportive care, and the panel recommends a second-generation antidepressant due to the reduced risk of side effects. Problem-solving therapy (group) was superior to reminiscence therapy (group), and interpersonal psychotherapy (individual) was superior to supportive care. The rationale states that the panel suggests the use of interventions that demonstrated efficacy when compared with no treatment (i.e., waitlist) or treatment as usual, notes that nortriptyline is now viewed as a second- or third-line pharmacotherapy strategy for major depression, is generally reserved for patients who have not done well with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor which are generally considered to be safer for older adults than nortriptyline, and that there is some efficacy data from systematic reviews/meta-analyses showing efficacy of second-generation antidepressants over placebo.

### Community-based treatment of late life depression an expert panel-informed literature review [^4cd6b7d7]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To present findings from an expert panel-informed literature review on community-based treatment of late-life depression.

Methods

A systematic literature review was conducted to appraise publications on community-based interventions for depression in older adults. The search was conducted between March and October 2005. An expert panel of mental health, aging, health services, and epidemiology researchers guided the review and voted on quality and effectiveness of these interventions.

Results

A total of 3,543 articles were found with publication dates from 1967 to October 2005; of these, 116 were eligible for inclusion. Adequate data existed to determine effectiveness for the following interventions: depression care management, group and individual psychotherapy for depression, psychotherapy targeting mental health, psychotherapy for caregivers, education and skills training (to manage health problems besides depression; and for caregivers), geriatric health evaluation and management, exercise, and physical rehabilitation and occupational therapy. After reviewing the data, panelists rated the depression care management interventions as effective. Education and skills training, geriatric health evaluation and management, and physical rehabilitation and occupational therapy received ineffective ratings. Other interventions received mixed effectiveness ratings. Insufficient data availability and poor study quality prevented the panelists from rating several reviewed interventions.

Conclusions

While several well-described interventions were found to treat depression effectively in community-dwelling older adults, significant gaps still exist. Interventions that did not target depression specifically may be of benefit to older adults, but they should not be presumed to treat depression by themselves. Treating depressed elders may require a multifaceted approach to ensure effectiveness. More research in this area is needed.

- combined pharmacotherapy and interpersonal psychotherapy; use a second-generation antidepressant due to the reduced risk of side effects.

Depression guideline—generalizing aggregate research to individual patients: The document advises readers to consider limits of generalization because evidence is based on group data and can only provide general types of information, so greater mismatch between study populations and a given patient requires more informed clinical judgment to select treatment. As an illustration of demographic limits in samples, it notes that if evidence comes primarily from White males “between the ages of 25 to 50 years,” extrapolating automatic effectiveness to others is less scientifically rigorous.

### Are old-old patients with major depression more likely to relapse than young-old patients during continuation treatment with escitalopram? [^967d06e0]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Older adults with depression often have several chronic disorders and are more treatment-resistant. These patients also have a higher risk of medication side effects, due to co-morbid medical conditions and age-associated changes in organ function. Moreover, a higher risk for drug-drug interactions may cause them to terminate treatment prematurely.

Second generation antidepressants [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)] are recommended as first-line treatments in clinical practice guidelines and are most commonly prescribed for depressive disorders in older patients. Nevertheless, until 2003, only one large placebo-controlled trial of a non-tricyclic antidepressant, marketed in the US, in outpatients 60 years of age or older with major depressive disorder had been published. The first trials of second-generation antidepressants, including a large study of patients aged 75 years and above treated with citalopram, reported no advantage over placebo [-] or small drug-placebo differences, hence the clinical value of these agents in treating older depressed adults was uncertain.

A later meta-analysis of 10 randomised placebo-controlled trials in depressed patients aged 60 years and older concluded that antidepressants are more effective than placebo, although effects were modest and variable. A major limitation was that the average age of patients in these trials ranged from 60 to 72 years, with only a small number over 75. Late-life spans a broad age range and can be divided into young-old (60-74 years), and old-old (≥75 years). Among the old-old, antidepressant treatment may be especially complicated because of the high frequency and severity of co-morbid conditions, such as cognitive impairment or heart disease.

In addition to being well tolerated as an antidepressant in older persons [,,-], escitalopram is effective in preventing relapse of MDD in patients ≥65 years. The latter study, as well as open-label data, suggests that escitalopram is safe and well tolerated in the long-term treatment of older patients with MDD.

In order to compare the efficacy and safety of escitalopram in the old-old with the young-old, we undertook a secondary analysis of a published clinical trial. The primary aim was to compare the effect of escitalopram in preventing relapse of MDD among young-old and old-old patients. A secondary objective was to compare the initial response to open-label escitalopram in these two age groups. We hypothesized that old-old and young-old patients on escitalopram would have comparable benefits with regard to prevention of relapse and initial remission.

Relapse prevention in older adults states that for prevention of recurrence the panel recommends combination interpersonal psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy or combination supportive care and pharmacotherapy; if those options are not available, the panel conditionally suggests interpersonal psychotherapy for prevention of recurrence; the panel notes that the evidence is insufficient to be able to recommend between cognitive-behavioral therapy (group) plus pharmacotherapy and pharmacotherapy alone for preventing recurrence.

### Psychotherapeutic treatments for older depressed people [^927081fb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Despite a number of reviews advocating psychotherapy for the treatment of depression, there is relatively little evidence based on randomised controlled trials that specifically examines its efficacy in older people.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy of psychotherapeutic treatments for depression in older people.

Search Strategy

CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References were searched on 11/9/2006. The International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Irish Journal of Psychiatry were handsearched. Reference lists of previous published systematic reviews, included/excluded trial articles and bibliographies were scrutinised. Experts in the field were contacted..

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials that included older adults diagnosed as suffering from depression (ICD or DSM criteria) were included. All types of psychotherapeutic treatments were included, categorised into cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, interpersonal therapy and supportive therapies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Meta-analysis was performed, using odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals. Primary outcomes were a reduction in severity of depression, usually measured by clinician rated rating scales. Secondary outcomes, including dropout and life satisfaction, were also analysed.

Main Results

The search identified nine trials of cognitive behavioural and psychodynamic therapy approaches, together with a small group of 'active control' interventions. No trials relating to other psychotherapeutic approaches and techniques were found. A total of seven trials provided sufficient data for inclusion in the comparison between CBT and controls. No trials compared psychodynamic psychotherapy with controls. Based on five trials (153 participants), cognitive behavioural therapy was more effective than waiting list controls (WMD -9.85, 95% CI -11.97 to -7.73). Only three small trials compared psychodynamic therapy with CBT, with no significant difference in treatment effect indicated between the two types of psychotherapeutic treatment. Based on three trials with usable data, CBT was superior to active control interventions when using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (WMD -5.69, 95% CI -11.04 to -0.35), but equivalent when using the Geriatric Depression Scale (WMD -2.00, 95% CI -5.31 to 1.32).

Authors' Conclusions

Only a small number of studies and patients were included in the meta-analysis. If taken on their own merit, the findings do not provide strong support for psychotherapeutic treatments in the management of depression in older people. However, the findings do reflect those of a larger meta-analysis that included patients with broader age ranges, suggesting that CBT may be of potential benefit.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of second-generation antidepressants for the treatment of older adults with depression: questionable benefit and considerations for frailty [^20d322ee]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Search strategy

We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and reference lists from meta-analyses/studies, hand searches of publication lists, and related articles featured on PubMed. We used the search terms (antidepressants AND depression) with specified limits of meta-analysis; systematic review; randomized controlled trial; humans; English language; and aged: 65+ years that were published between January 1, 1996 and March 1, 2016. Studies were downloaded and screened using Covidence online software. Two investigators (LM, TM) independently conducted study selection. When there were divergent views, the reviewers presented their opinions to the team for consensus decision.

Data collection process

Three members of the review team extracted and/or verified data from each study (MA, EB, TM). Data was double checked by LM and discrepancies resolved through discussion. We used a Microsoft Excel™ extraction sheet to catalog information including: study purpose; design/year/setting; drug/comparator mean dose; participant numbers; trial duration; study withdrawals; inclusion/exclusion criteria; assessment procedures/rating scales; baseline demographics; statistical adjustments; study results for primary/secondary outcomes; adverse events; withdrawals; mortality; subgroup analyses; reviewer conclusions; and risk of bias criteria.

Risk of bias assessment and study quality

Two authors (MA, EB) assessed study quality and risk of bias in individual studies using GRADE criteria and Cochrane risk of bias criteria. There was extensive discussion on study design and interpretation of results by all authors in regularly scheduled meetings.

Synthesis of results

We used RevMan™ 5.3 to calculate pooled effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic.

We used an alpha level for statistical significance of p ≤ 0.05 and calculated number needed to treat/number needed to harm (NNT/NNH) by applying the pooled estimate of relative risk (RR) to the pooled event rate in the placebo group.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for treatment-resistant depression in older patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c5a15bad]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

In 2011, the Old Age Task Force of the World Federation of Biological Psychiatry systematically reviewed studies investigating the efficacy of treatment for TRD in older adults, defining TRD as failure to respond to at least one course of treatment for depression during the current illness episode. This definition, more inclusive than those described above, was selected to ensure all relevant evidence was considered. Of the 14 studies included, 3 were RCTs and 1 was placebo-controlled.This 2011 review informed national guidelines in the UK,Japanand Canada.

A decade later, with the advent of new treatments for depression, including rTMS and ketamine, our objective was to update this systematic review, to identify the best current evidence for the effectiveness of pharmacological or psychological treatments for TRD in older people.

### Screening for depression in adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^8bc088d5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for depression in adults.

Methods

The USPSTF examined evidence on the benefits and harms of screening primary care patients for depression, including direct evidence that depression screening programs improve health outcomes. The USPSTF did not reexamine evidence for those key questions that had strong, consistent evidence in the 2002 review, including questions about the accuracy of screening instruments in identifying depressed adult patients in primary care settings, and the efficacy of treatment of depressed adults with antidepressants or psychotherapy. New areas of evidence considered for this review (and not reviewed in 2002) include efficacy of treatment of depression in older adult patients, harms of screening for depression in primary care settings, and adverse events from treatment of depression in adults.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends screening adults for depression when staff-assisted depression care supports are in place to assure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and follow-up. (Grade B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against routinely screening adults for depression when staff-assisted depression care supports are not in place. There may be considerations that support screening for depression in an individual patient. (Grade C recommendation).

### Effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for treatment-resistant depression in older patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^54b2461b]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Background

Depression in older adults is often undertreated. A 2011 systematic review of treatments for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in older adults identified one placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial (RCT). We aimed to update this review, synthesising evidence for the effectiveness of treatments for TRD in older people.

Methods

We systematically searched electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science) from 9 January 2011 through 10 December 2023 (updating our search on 7 January 2024 for RCTs investigating TRD therapies in adults aged ≥55 years, defining treatment resistance as ≥1 unsuccessful treatment. We assessed bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) 2 tool, meta-analysed remission rates and evaluated evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) criteria.

Results

14 studies (11 newly identified, 3 from previous review) involving 1196 participants (mean age 65.0, male/female 548/648) met the inclusion criteria; 10 were placebo controlled and 4 were rated as low RoB. The pooled proportion of participants in intervention arms remitting was 0.35 (17 arms; 95% CI=0.26; 0.45). Relative to placebo, intervention participants were more likely to remit (9 studies; OR 2.42 (95% CI=1.49; 3.92)). Relative to controls, remission rates favoured ketamine (n=3; OR 2.91 (1.11; 7.65)), with a trend towards transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (n=3; 1.99 (0.71; 5.61)), and in single placebo-controlled studies, selegiline, aripiprazole augmentation, pharmacogenetic-guided prescribing (PGP) and cognitive remediation favoured interventions.

Conclusions

We identified weak evidence that ketamine therapy and aripiprazole augmentation, and very weak evidence that TMS, PGP and cognitive remediation increased remission. Lack of evidence regarding routinely prescribed antidepressants and psychosocial treatments is problematic, requiring clinicians to extend evidence from younger populations.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^ddb76d71]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

APA Guideline for the Treatment of Depression—secondary outcomes emphasize that while symptomatic change has been widely considered the gold standard for improvement, it is important to consider improvement beyond symptom change, and very few studies have examined functional, patient-centered outcomes such as quality of life, employment, community integration, social engagement, and satisfaction in interpersonal relationships.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of second-generation antidepressants for the treatment of older adults with depression: questionable benefit and considerations for frailty [^6c36146a]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Consideration of results

In our meta-analysis of older adults with depression, there was no statistically significant response or remission for second-generation antidepressants compared to placebo. Our results are similar to a meta-analysis by Tedeschini, who also reported no significant treatment effect with antidepressants versus placebo in those over 65 years of age, although the authors cautioned that this finding was limited by a small number of trials (n = 5). In contrast, when the Tedeschini meta-analysis employed an age threshold of > 55 years, a statistically significant benefit for antidepressants was found, which raised the possibility that there may be less response to antidepressants in later life, according to the authors. With the addition of four trials, our review builds on this earlier meta-analysis.

Our review highlights the absence of clinical trials for frail older adults with depression. Subjects enrolled in our meta-analysis of older adults did not have obvious characteristics of frailty. Yet, treatment with antidepressants appears to be common in the frail population, as evidenced by the high rate of antidepressant use among long-term care residents, where there is a high prevalence of frailty.

So, what can be theorized about the expected response to antidepressants for frail older adults with depression? If non-frail older adults with depression do not exhibit response or remission to antidepressants, frail adults would, likewise, not be expected to respond. In fact, preliminary data from longitudinal cohort studies imply that frail individuals respond less favorably to antidepressants compared to older adults who are not frail, which could be related to several factors. First, although major depression can co-exist with frailty, there is overlap between symptoms of depression and the characteristics of frailty, as described above. An erroneous diagnosis of depression with frailty may result in an antidepressant prescription for the wrong indication. Another concern is that depression scales used in trials may not be clinically relevant to those who are frail as they measure characteristics common to frailty. Finally, in clinical settings, it may be difficult to differentiate medication from placebo response, as roughly 40% of subjects in the meta-analysis demonstrated response to placebo.

Prevention of recurrence–MDD in older adult patients with a history of depression—recommended and conditional options: For older adult patients with a history of depression, the panel recommends clinicians offer either combination interpersonal psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy or combination supportive care and pharmacotherapy, and while the study on which this is based used nortriptyline, the panel recommends a second-generation antidepressant due to the reduced risk of side effects; if the prior options are not acceptable or available, the panel suggests considering interpersonal psychotherapy (individual) alone. Based on the literature reviewed that met the IOM or AMSTAR requirements, comparative effectiveness research demonstrated sufficient evidence for the panel to recommend some combinations of treatments over others due to differences in treatment effect for prevention of recurrence, other treatment/combinations of treatments were equally recommended by the panel based on comparative effectiveness research evidence demonstrating no difference in effect for prevention of recurrence, and nortriptyline is now viewed as a second- or third-line pharmacotherapy strategy for major depression and is generally reserved for patients who have not done well with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, which are generally considered to be safer for older adults than nortriptyline.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^91ec7099]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

General adult population—systematic reviews and meta-analyses underpin the evidence base and define populations: The panel used data from several reviews and meta-analyses that met quality criteria, including two Evidence-Based Practice Center reviews; the first focused on comparisons of pharmacological treatments with nonpharmacological treatments, and the second covered a broad range of treatment comparisons. Gartlehner and colleagues (2015) defined depression in adults ages 18 and older who received diagnoses of major depressive disorder from a standardized diagnostic manual or from elevated scores on validated instruments. The VA/DoD guideline developers defined depression in adults age 18 or older having received a first diagnosis of major depression, currently receiving treatment for depression, and adults with chronic depression in a VA/DoD setting. The panel then used four additional AMSTAR evaluated meta-analyses: nondirective supportive psychotherapy (depression defined as adults who received a diagnosis of major depressive disorder from either a diagnostic interview or a validated self-report measure), subclinical depression (defined as either having scores above thresholds on a validated questionnaire or meeting the standardized diagnostic criteria for minor depression), short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (included studies that either met the diagnostic criteria for a mood disorder, specifically major depressive disorder, or had elevated scores on a valid instrument), and interpersonal psychotherapy (defined depression as elevated scores on a validated instrument at the posttreatment).

### Advances in psychotherapy for depressed older adults [^4358b042]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We review recent advances in psychotherapies for depressed older adults, in particular those developed for special populations characterized by chronic medical illness, acute medical illness, cognitive impairment, and suicide risk factors. We review adaptations for psychotherapy to overcome barriers to its accessibility in non-specialty settings such as primary care, homebound or hard-to-reach older adults, and social service settings.

Recent Findings

Recent evidence supports the effectiveness of psychotherapies that target late-life depression in the context of specific comorbid conditions including COPD, heart failure, Parkinson's disease, stroke and other acute conditions, cognitive impairment, and suicide risk. Growing evidence supports the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of psychotherapy modified for a variety of health care and social service settings. Research supports the benefits of selecting the type of psychotherapy based on a comprehensive assessment of the older adult's psychiatric, medical, functional, and cognitive status, and tailoring psychotherapy to the settings in which older depressed adults are most likely to present.

### Efficacy and tolerability of antidepressants in people aged 65 years or older with major depressive disorder – A systematic review and a meta-analysis [^5fc96f0b]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There has been a steady increase in the prescription of antidepressants for the elderly. This study comprises a systematic review of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants for treatment of depressive disorder in people aged 65 years or more.

Methods

PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAL, and PsycINFO were searched until May 2016. Where appropriate, the results were synthesized in meta-analyses.

Results

Twelve trials met the inclusion criteria. For patients with major depressive disorder, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI) were not superior to placebo in achieving remission (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.61-1.03) or response (OR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.51-1.10) after 8 weeks of treatment (three trials). However, maintenance treatment with SSRIs was superior to placebo in preventing relapse (OR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.13-0.36; NNT=5, 95% CI: 3-6; two trials). Duloxetine was superior to placebo in achieving remission (OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.20-2.65; NNT=9, 95% CI: 6-20; three trials) and response (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.96-4.08; two trials) in recurrent major depression after 8 weeks, but increased the risk of adverse events that can be problematic in the elderly.

Limitations

The quality of evidence was generally low or moderate, emphasizing the uncertainty of the results. Study populations only partly covered the heterogeneous population of elderly with depressed mood, limiting the generalizability.

Conclusion

The results underscore the importance of close monitoring of the effects of antidepressants in treatment of elderly patients with a depressive disorder. Methods for early detection of non-responders and effective treatment options for this group are needed.

### Evaluating the effects of physical activity and antidepressive agents on depressive symptoms in older adults: a meta-analysis of existing evidence [^4fdd04f9]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

However, the physical condition and depressive symptoms of each older patient vary significantly, making personalized treatment essential. For instance, Mallery et al. (2019) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of second-generation antidepressants in adults aged 65 and older. They reported that frail individuals or those with multiple comorbidities did not experience significant improvements from antidepressant treatment compared to placebo, and were more prone to adverse effects. In contrast, healthier individuals within the same age group showed relatively better treatment responses, suggesting that physical health status plays a critical role in modulating both the efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring antidepressant strategies to the individual needs of older patients, based on comprehensive assessments of physical health, comorbidity profiles, and symptom severity.

In summary, antidepressive agents can help alleviate depressive symptoms in older adults, but close collaboration with a doctor is necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the treatment plan. Medication therapy is typically combined with other treatment methods such as psychotherapy and lifestyle changes to achieve the best treatment outcomes. Although depression has not yet been fully treated, the use of exercise to treat depression has received increasing attention recently, and exercise has been shown to yield beneficial effects in alleviating depressive symptoms, potentially comparable or superior to antidepressive agents in some contexts.

Although significant progress has been made in the research on depression, there are still many mysteries surrounding its etiology and intervention methods. Some studies suggest that engaging in physical activity can reduce the risk of depression and improve mental health, while others have not found a clear correlation. This divergence indicates that there is still controversy surrounding the understanding of the relationship between depression and physical activity, necessitating further exploration and clarification. In this context, it becomes increasingly important to consider whether such inconsistencies may stem from differences in individual characteristics, particularly age. Compared to younger adults, older adults exhibit distinct physiological, psychological, and social profiles that may influence how they respond to various interventions. As such, understanding age-related variation in treatment effects is critical to interpreting heterogeneous findings in the literature and to refining intervention strategies for older adults. Moreover, tailoring interventions to the specific needs and characteristics of older adults may enhance both their efficacy and long-term adherence.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^6620f175]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Older adults’ treatment preference and medication considerations emphasize that pharmacotherapy is usually not indicated for subsyndromal depressive symptom cases, so psychological treatments are prioritized and CBT, problem-solving therapy, life-review and possibly other interventions can be recommended; older adults and younger adults appear to demonstrate similar improvements in response to psychotherapy. Nortriptyline is now viewed as a second- or third-line pharmacotherapy approach for major depression and is generally reserved for patients who have not completed or have not responded adequately to either an SSRI or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, which are generally considered to be safer for older adults than nortriptyline; some argue that paroxetine is contraindicated in older adults due to its anticholinergic side effects and many geriatric psychiatrists would prefer another SSRI (i.e., escitalopram or sertraline). The panel encourages shared decision-making between patients and clinicians.

### Older adults respond better to psychological therapy than working-age adults: evidence from a large sample of mental health service attendees [^cc72f994]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Meta-analytic reviews suggest that interventions for depression are equally effective for older and working-age adults (;), but that older adults may be less likely to benefit from psychological treatments for anxiety disorders. However, past reviews have typically compared effect sizes of trials of older adults with the effect sizes of trials of working-age adults, without being able to assess the impact of age on outcomes or make adjustments for pre-treatment differences in the presentations of older and working-age patients, using individual patient data (;). Reviews that have used individual patient data have been restricted by the number of older adults in their samples, and the lack of data on outcomes from psychological therapies. As such, the evidence base on the effectiveness of routine psychological treatments for older adults is limited, and due to the small sample size of most psychological treatment trials and limited power in study-level meta-analyses, estimates of such effects have been imprecise. Further, as the setting in which treatment was conducted has been unclear or allowed to vary in past studies and reviews in order to maximise sample size (;), the generalizability of reported associations to settings in which the majority of depressed or anxious adults might be treated with psychological therapies is dubitable. If there are differences in the outcomes of psychological therapies for older and working-age adults, one potential reason for this could be the prevalence of long-term health conditions (LTCs) among older adults and the impact of such conditions on therapy outcomes (;;). LTCs such as arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, cardiac problems, and pulmonary diseases are more common among older adults, and are all associated with functional impairments. LTCs and common mental disorders are highly comorbid and this comorbidity is associated with poorer prognoses both for the LTC and the mental health condition (;). In particular, LTCs and associated impairments may negatively affect engagement with, and the outcome of, psychological therapies for depression and anxiety disorders (;). Symptoms of anxiety or depression may pre-date the onset of comorbid LTCs or arise after the onset of a LTC, but there is some evidence that psychological therapies can be effective irrespective of the chronological order of mental and physical disorders (;).

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^ed1fb5cb]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Older adult depression and race/ethnicity—care models and disparities underscore culturally appropriate interventions and barriers to access. The growth in the nation’s older population is characterized by increasing racial and ethnic diversity and the need for culturally appropriate preventive and treatment interventions, and models employing lay health counselors of similar ethnic and racial backgrounds increasingly seem to be a rational and cost-effective way to reach underserved and disadvantaged older adults. Treatment accessibility and use can vary among older adults of differing ethnic backgrounds, with disparities attributed to financial hardship, unique presentations of depressive symptoms, culturally based mistrust of providers, negative attitudes about seeking mental health care, anticipated or previously experienced racism or discrimination, language barriers, and limited accessibility of ethnically diverse mental health professionals; more research is needed to understand other groups of people of color and people of color across socioeconomic strata.

### Evaluating the effects of physical activity and antidepressive agents on depressive symptoms in older adults: a meta-analysis of existing evidence [^16ad8dc5]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

To more comprehensively explore the implications of the present findings and to investigate potential age-related differences in the effects of physical activity and antidepressive agents, it is necessary to contextualize the current results within existing evidence from studies involving younger populations. Previous meta-analyses involving younger adults have demonstrated the effectiveness of both interventions. For instance, Cooney et al. (2013) conducted a Cochrane review of 39 randomized controlled trials and reported that physical activity yielded a moderate antidepressant effect (SMD ≈ −0.62) in adults aged 18–65, with supervised aerobic and group-based exercises showing the most pronounced benefits. Similarly, Kvam et al. (2016) found that physical exercise yielded a large effect size when compared with no-treatment control groups (Hedges’ g ≈ −0.68) and demonstrated a moderate effect size when directly compared with antidepressant medication. These findings from younger adult populations support the broader applicability of both interventions, while also highlighting the potential of exercise as a viable alternative or complement to pharmacological treatment.

Building upon these findings from younger adult populations, the present meta-analysis further demonstrates that both physical activity and antidepressive agents significantly alleviate depressive symptoms among older adults. Notably, the standardized mean difference for physical activity in this study, estimated under a random-effects model to account for moderate heterogeneity, was comparatively greater than that for antidepressive agents, suggesting that exercise may yield enhanced therapeutic benefits in older populations. This age-related difference may be attributed to several factors. Compared to younger adults, older individuals often face increased sensitivity to medication side effects, reduced metabolic capacity, and higher rates of polypharmacy, all of which can limit the practicality and effectiveness of pharmacological interventions. In contrast, physical activity offers not only psychological benefits but also substantial improvements in physical health and functional independence, which are particularly relevant for aging populations. Therefore, the present findings support a growing body of evidence that underscores the unique advantages of exercise-based interventions for late-life depression and advocate for its broader integration into geriatric mental health strategies.

### Group therapy in older adults [^c351528f]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Group therapy is a well-established therapeutic modality for older individuals often conducted in combination with individual psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. Group leaders must be aware of age-specific factors when working with older cohorts, including the presence of cognitive impairment, physical disability, and loss of independence. A limited number of outcome studies have found that various forms of group therapy in late life are generally efficacious for depression and other symptoms and compare favorably with individual psychotherapy.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of second-generation antidepressants for the treatment of older adults with depression: questionable benefit and considerations for frailty [^701afb48]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Frailty and clinical trial evidence

Due to age and/or comorbidity-related exclusion criteria, almost all drug trials exclude individuals who are frail. As such, there is rarely specific data to inform the treatment of frail older adults, who may not respond in the same way as healthier populations. Frail individuals are at increased risk of medication interactions and medication-related adverse events, which alters the risk-to-benefit ratio. Frailty also presents competing risks for morbidity and mortality, whereby the improvement of one health issue may be camouflaged by decline in another. Finally, characteristics of frailty—such as shortened life expectancy, cognitive impairment, and functional decline—may minimize the impact of intended therapeutic benefit.

Rationale for a focus on antidepressants

Frail older adults have high rates of depression. Two reviews show that those who are frail are at increased risk of having depression, even after adjusting for potential confounders. In a landmark study, Fried reported that 31% of frail older adults had a “suggestive diagnosis of depression” compared to only 3% of non-frail elders. As well, medical conditions that are commonly associated with frailty have high rates of depression—approximately 31% with stroke, 22% with heart failure, 23% with Parkinson’s disease, and 32% with mild cognitive impairment.

In the case of late-life depression, the prevailing opinion is that older adults are underdiagnosed and undertreated for depression. Yet, among frail older adults, the opposite may be true. In Canadian long-term care, where the majority of older adults are typically severely frail, roughly 44% have a diagnosis and/or symptoms of depression and nearly 60% use an antidepressant, although possibly for diverse indications. In U.S. nursing homes, 54% of residents were diagnosed with depression—33% at admission and a further 21% during the first year. The authors of that study conclude that “the high antidepressant use in nursing homes may reflect a spiraling trend of over-diagnosing [and treating] depression.”

### Precision assignment to psychosocial interventions for late-life depression: an automated treatment decision rule [^7e04efa7]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Most older adults with depression lack access to efficacious psychotherapies due to a critical clinician shortage. Even when treated, response rates are limited to approximately 50%. A treatment decision rule (TDR) may maximize treatment efficacy and resources by assigning patients to their optimal intervention. This is the first study to propose a TDR for late-life depression designed for community settings.

Objective

To develop a scalable TDR for assignment to a psychotherapy or usual care intervention for late-life depression that can be delivered easily in community settings.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this prognostic study, adults 60 years or older with major depression participated in randomized controlled trials comparing psychotherapy with usual care. Participants were recruited from outpatient and community settings of Weill Cornell Medicine and the University of California San Francisco between 2002 and 2011. Data were analyzed from May 2023 to May 2025.

Interventions

Participants received either psychotherapy (problem-solving therapy, psychotherapy for late-life depression and medical burden) or usual care (supportive therapy, treatment as usual, or case management).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was mean reduction in depression severity (measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HAM-D]). A generated effect modifier TDR was applied to identify the optimal intervention for each patient based on baseline characteristics (demographics, depression severity, social support, cognition, and disability). The TDR maximized depression severity reduction and the proportion of patients treated with the usual care intervention.

Results

In 427 older adults with late-life depression (mean [SD] age, 72.7 [8.7] years; 70% female), the predicted HAM-D score reduction with TDR-based intervention was a mean of 49.1% (95% CI, 47.4%-51.0%). The TDR improved expected depression severity reduction by 34% compared with usual care (HAM-D reduction, 36.6% [95% CI, 34.5%-38.7%]) and the TDR was somewhat superior to assigning all patients to receive psychotherapy (HAM-D reduction, 46.7% [95% CI, 44.2%-48.8%]). Older adults with higher depression severity, stronger social support, and lower cognitive functioning should receive psychotherapy; those with lower depression severity, higher cognitive functioning, and low social support would benefit from usual care.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study of older adults with depression, pending prospective testing, the automatic TDR may be used in community settings to inform treatment assignment. The TDR has the potential to increase precision, cost-effectiveness, and response rates among older adults with depression.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^900a636a]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Directions for future research in the literature—extensive evidence exists yet key gaps remain, as depression is one of the disorders most widely studied in psychotherapy research, with over 400 randomized clinical trials for depression across the last 3 decades. However, fewer studies have examined other widely utilized treatments including psychodynamic therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, behavioral activation, problem-solving therapy, and emotion-focused therapy, among others, and most of these treatments have demonstrated preliminary efficacy necessitating the need for further study. In addition, while the largest body of literature is for CBT, the definition of CBT is not the same across all CBT studies, and this heterogeneity limits the ability to make conclusions about the CBT model. It is imperative that the field generate more evidence to support different psychotherapies with preliminary efficacy as this is crucial for the advancement of the scientific field, diversification of education, and training opportunities for and adherence to scientific calls for personalized approaches to treatment. There is also interest and awareness of growing areas in complementary and alternative medicine such as those included in this review and others that were not included (such as emotional support animals).

### Evaluating the effects of physical activity and antidepressive agents on depressive symptoms in older adults: a meta-analysis of existing evidence [^776e6403]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

This meta-analysis indicates that both physical activity and antidepressant pharmacotherapy significantly alleviate depressive symptoms in older adults. In the random effects model, the standardized mean difference for physical activity was numerically larger than that for antidepressant agents; however, because the two evidence bases differ systematically in inclusion criteria and baseline symptom severity, with most antidepressant trials enrolling clinically depressed samples while a substantial proportion of physical activity trials included mixed samples, this numerical difference represents an indirect comparison and should not be interpreted as evidence of superior comparative efficacy. Accordingly, the current evidence supports the clinical significance of both interventions within their respective target populations. Physical activity may additionally yield benefits by concurrently enhancing physical fitness, psychological functioning, and social participation, thereby supporting overall well-being in later life.

Although meta-analysis has become a widely adopted approach in psychological and clinical research, its application remains methodologically justified when synthesizing fragmented evidence and evaluating the relative efficacy of distinct intervention modalities. In the context of late-life depression, where considerable variability exists in intervention design, outcome measurement, and sample characteristics, meta-analytic techniques offer a statistically coherent framework for comparison.

The alleviation of depression symptoms in older adults presents an important challenge in both medical and psychological fields, with physical activity and antidepressive agents playing crucial roles as two main intervention strategies. Physical activity, as a non-pharmacological intervention for alleviating depression symptoms in older adults, has unique advantages. Firstly, it is a natural, economical, and easily implementable method, suitable for almost all age groups. Older adults can choose various forms of exercise, such as walking, dancing, swimming, or simple gymnastics, to meet their personal preferences and physical conditions. Secondly, compared to pharmacological interventions, physical activity has almost no side effects and helps improve overall physical health. By enhancing muscles and bones, improving cardiovascular function, controlling weight and blood pressure, physical activity has a positive impact on the health status of older adults, further promoting the improvement of mental health.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of second-generation antidepressants for the treatment of older adults with depression: questionable benefit and considerations for frailty [^c5d06a4c]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

In our meta-analysis, primary and secondary outcomes were response and remission based on Depression Rating Scales. However, it is not clear whether these rating scales can differentiate symptoms of depression from characteristics of frailty and whether measured change represents meaningful benefit. In particular, DSM-5 criteria for major depression and depressive symptoms overlap with common manifestations of both frailty and chronic health conditions (Table 3). When individuals are frail, conditions such as functional disability, cognitive decline, impaired mobility, and/or physical symptoms may give rise to features commonly attributed to depression, such as fatigue, limited activity, decreased interest, trouble sleeping, feelings of sadness, and/or thoughts of death. Medications, such as those used to treat pain, may impair concentration. In addition, old age commonly brings challenging circumstances, such as the loss of a spouse or financial insecurity, which can lead to despondency. Indeed, Lohman postulated that the strong correlation between frailty and depression could be related to the criteria used in their measurement and concluded that that available measures of frailty and depression are either poor at discriminating between the two constructs or identify the same underlying condition.

Table 3 
Overlapping symptoms of depression and frailty

a Five or more of the symptoms are present during the same two-week time frame and represent a change from previous functioning. At least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. Additionally, symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impaired function and are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to another medical condition

DSM Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders

3 Is the timeframe relevant for those who are frail?

Given the shortened life expectancy associated with frailty and the expected progression of frailty over time, treatment benefits that accrue over many years may not be applicable to the frail, while studies of short duration may underestimate risk.

In this meta-analysis, study duration ranged from 8 to 12 weeks, a reasonable timeframe to achieve benefit. However, none of the studies addressed the sustainability of response nor the likelihood of developing adverse effects as frailty increases over time. In one 12-week study that had a 12-week extension, falls were more frequent with duloxetine compared to placebo over 24-weeks that included the acute plus continuation phase (24% vs 14%, p = 0.04) but not in the first 12 weeks (16% vs 10%, p = 0.15).

### Antidepressants in elderly: metaregression of double-blind, randomized clinical trials [^000dd6ca]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is common in the elderly and in the last few years this led to a significant increase in antidepressant prescription rates. However, little is known about antidepressant efficacy profile in relation with socio-demographic and clinical features in this population. The aim of the present study was to define the most suitable socio-demographic and clinical profile for the use of antidepressant treatments in late-life depression.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focused on efficacy of antidepressants of all classes in major depressed elderly subjects (>60 years old). Reviews and meta-analyses focusing on this topic have been considered as well. Thirty-four RCTs were included and socio-demographic and clinical features were investigated via meta-regression analysis as moderators of efficacy measures (standardized mean difference based on Hamilton Depressive Rating Scale and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale).

Results

A lower rate of response to antidepressants of all classes was found in patients of male gender, of older age, and with a longer mean duration of the current episode. On the contrary, a higher rate of response was found in patients with a higher baseline severity and at their first episode of illness. Subsamples treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors alone yielded similar results.

Limitations

RCTs only have been included.

Conclusions

A number of socio-demographic and clinical features have been found to moderate antidepressant efficacy in elderly population. Those variables could help clinicians for a more individualized treatment.

### Anti-inflammatory interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression among older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^19d6b9cc]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This meta-analysis represents the most comprehensive summary of currently available data for the treatment and prevention of anti-inflammatory interventions for depression among older adults. Our review of 31 RCTs demonstrated that anti-inflammatory interventions could be more beneficial than placebo control conditions for older adults with or without depressive disorders, and the corresponding SMDs of −0.57 and −0.07 were medium and trivial effect sizes. Compared with active control regimens (sertraline, tocopherol and tramadol), anti-inflammatory treatments were not significantly more effective in reducing depression symptoms for depressed patients, although the limited number of studies available suggests the need for further research. It should be noted that, the evidence of quality in the above outcome of antidepressant effect were low or very low, which may limit the application of this evidence in clinical practice and guideline development. Overall, our results among older adults are consistent with those of previous meta-analyses, which also report small to medium effects of anti-inflammatory treatments for patients with depressive symptoms. Intriguingly, we find beneficial effects of omega-3 FA and botanical drug or dietary intervention, but not NSAIDs and statins, among old population. However, young adult MDD patients may benefit from a broader spectrum of anti-inflammatory agents, including NSAIDs, statins, cytokine inhibitors, etc. This distinction might be partially attributed to the severity of depression. The inflammatory activity may be particularly elevated in these severe MDD patients, making them benefits more from the classic anti-inflammatory agents.

### Prevention of incident and recurrent major depression in older adults with insomnia: a randomized clinical trial [^9567a772]. JAMA Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Late-life depression (major depressive disorder in adults ≥60 years) has a 12-month prevalence that exceeds 10% in community-dwelling, older adultsand is a significant risk factor for cognitive decline, disability, medical comorbidity, and all-cause mortality,, with suicide rates highest for older men.However, older adults with depression often do not receive diagnosis and treatment,and even with treatment, only approximately one-third achieve remission,with an estimated remaining disease burden of 60%.Effective depression prevention is urgently needed.However, such efforts have been neglected for community-dwelling, older adults, which is striking given that older adults account for nearly 20% of the population in the US, are most vulnerable to depression burden, and report the lowest use of mental health services.

Insomnia, occurring in nearly 50% of persons 60 years or older,contributes to a 2-fold greater risk of major depression. Pharmacotherapy is often used to treat insomnia, although medication provides only temporary remediation and poses risk for daytime effects and dependency. Among the nonpharmacologic treatments for insomnia, a universal behavioral program is sleep education therapy (SET), which targets day-to-day behavioral and environmental factors that contribute to poor sleep. Another nonpharmacologic treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), combines cognitive therapy, stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, and relaxation; CBT-I is recommended as the first-line treatment for insomnia disorder.

In patients with residual or concurrent depression, CBT-I can improve insomnia symptoms but has only mixed results for depression outcomes.,, In adults, not older adults, with subsyndromal depressive symptoms and insomnia, 2 prevention trials, found that digitally based insomnia treatment programs reduced depressive symptoms in the short term, although this outcome might be viewed as treatment of subthreshold symptoms.Neither study, demonstrated prevention of major depression. A key uncertainty is whether depression can be selectively prevented,,, using evidence-informed, psychobehavioral treatments that target insomnia, and whether this benefit can be achieved in older adults without depression but with insomnia disorder.

In this selective prevention trial,we present primary end point results during 36 months of follow-up in which we examined whether CBT-I compared with SET, an active comparator condition, would prevent incident or recurrent major depressive disorder, as defined by DSM-5 criteriain community-dwelling, older adults with insomnia disorder and minimal depressive symptoms. Secondary analysis accounted for sustained remission of insomnia disorder before depression event or throughout follow-up.

APA guideline—general adult population prevalence: According to national survey data, an estimated 15.7 million adults aged 18 and older had at least one major depressive episode during the past year, representing 6.7% of all U.S. adults; in addition, 4.3% of adults (10.2 million individuals) reported a major depressive episode with “severe impairment.” The highest percentage with a previous-year major depressive episode occurred in those aged 18 to 25 (9.3%), followed by ages 26 to 49 (7.2%) and older than 50 (5.2%); for severe impairment, the highest percentage occurred in those aged 18 to 25 (6.0%), followed by ages 26 to 49 (4.6%) and older than 50 (3.5%).

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^bbc1d28c]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline—applicability of the evidence notes that included studies assessing initial treatment enrolled adults (the majority of whom were female) with an initial or subsequent episode of moderate to severe MDD who were between the ages of 18 and 85 years and were undergoing 6 to 26 weeks of treatment, and evidence is inconclusive to determine how selection of treatment strategies might differ based on a patient’s severity of depression, common accompanying psychiatric symptoms, or demographic characteristics.

### Evaluating the effects of physical activity and antidepressive agents on depressive symptoms in older adults: a meta-analysis of existing evidence [^e361e64e]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Depression symptoms are widely used indicators in clinical practice, considered essential measures for assessing the effectiveness of depression treatment and can be quantified and evaluated through standardized assessment tools. By measuring depression symptoms, it is possible to determine the effectiveness of depression treatment and consequently understand whether the mental health status of older adults has improved. Given the fragmented nature of existing studies, which differ in sample characteristics, intervention types, and outcome measures, a meta-analytic approach is particularly suited to synthesize heterogeneous evidence and evaluate the comparative efficacy of these two intervention strategies in late-life populations. Therefore, this study adopts depressive symptoms (DS) as the primary outcome indicator and aims to systematically review and analyze existing empirical research through meta-analysis to examine the effects of physical activity and antidepressive agents on alleviating depressive symptoms in older adults.

To enhance conceptual clarity, this study was designed in accordance with the PICO framework. The Population (P) consisted of older adults aged 65 years and older who exhibited depressive symptoms or had been clinically diagnosed with depression. The Intervention (I) included physical activity programs such as aerobic exercise, resistance training, Tai Chi, and yoga, as well as other socially engaging, community-based exercise activities. The Comparison (C) comprised standard pharmacological treatments using commonly prescribed antidepressive agents, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants. The Outcome (O) was the reduction in depressive symptoms, assessed using validated depression rating scales employed across the included studies.

Specifically, this study evaluates the overall intervention effects of both strategies by extracting and comparing the standardized mean differences (SMDs) reported across studies. This approach aims to identify the magnitude and generalizability of treatment effects for each intervention, thereby providing an evidence-based foundation to guide decision-making in late-life depression management across both theoretical and clinical domains. By synthesizing heterogeneous findings, this meta-analysis offers a more precise and statistically grounded estimate of the comparative effectiveness of physical activity and antidepressive agents in alleviating depressive symptoms among older adults.

### Barriers to diagnosis and... [^cbf05b84]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment Depression is treatable in 65 to 75 percent of elderly patients. 5 Effective management requires a biopsychosocial approach, combining pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. 16, 17 Therapy generally results in improved quality of life, enhanced functional capacity, possible improvement in medical health status, increased longevity, and lower health care costs. Improvement should be evident as early as two weeks after the start of therapy, but full therapeutic effects may require several months of treatment. PHARMACOTHERAPY Pharmacotherapy for acute episodes of depression usually is effective and free of complications. Underuse or misuse of antidepressants and prescribing inadequate dosages are the most common mistakes physicians make when treating elderly patients for depression. Only 10 to 40 percent of depressed elderly patients are given medication.

Tricyclic Antidepressants Most tricyclic antidepressants are thought to be equally effective in elderly and younger patients. ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY Electroconvulsive therapy is a first-line option in patients with depression and psychotic features who have not responded to antipsychotic and antidepressant medications, and patients with severe nonpsychotic depression who have not responded to adequate trials of two antidepressants. ECT is used most often in patients older than age 60. Patients with delusions, psychomotor retardation, early morning awakening, and a family history of depression are most likely to benefit from ECT. PSYCHOSOCIAL TREATMENTS Psychologic therapies are recommended for elderly patients with depression because of this group’s vulnerability to adverse effects and high rates of medical problems and medication use.

23 Stressful life events, family conflicts, and the reduction or absence of social support likely will not be affected by medication and other somatic treatment approaches, but patients with these problems are responsive to psychologic intervention. The psychotherapist and patient should set aside committed and uninterrupted time, focus on increasing the patient’s self-esteem, accept feelings at face value, hold out the prospect of hope, and accept anger and irritability. Physical activity should be encouraged, as should social activity. Security and self-confidence can be restored through a protective figure such as a physician. Appropriate psychosocial interventions include education, family counseling, participation in bereavement groups, involvement with a senior citizen center, and use of visiting nurse services to help with medication.

### Psychotherapy and medication in the treatment of adult and geriatric depression: which monotherapy or combined treatment? [^ae45dba7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors reviewed the literature with respect to the relative efficacy of medications and psychotherapy alone and in combination in the treatment of depression.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Findings from empirical studies comparing medications and psychotherapy alone and in combination were synthesized and prognostic and prescriptive indices identified. We searched both MEDLINE and PsychINFO for items published from January 1980 to October 2004 using the following terms: treatment of depression, psychotherapy and depression, and pharmacotherapy and depression. Studies were selected that randomly assigned depressed patients to combined treatment versus monotherapy.

Data Synthesis

Medication typically has a rapid and robust effect and can prevent symptom return so long as it is continued or maintained, but does little to reduce risk once its use is terminated. Both interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be as effective as medications in the acute treatment of depressed outpatients. Interpersonal psychotherapy may improve interpersonal functioning, whereas CBT appears to have an enduring effect that reduces subsequent risk following treatment termination. Ongoing treatment with either IPT or CBT appears to further reduce risk. Treatment with the combination of medication and IPT or CBT retains the specific benefits of each and may enhance the probability of response over either monotherapy, especially in chronic depressions.

Conclusion

Both medication and certain targeted psychotherapies appear to be effective in the treatment of depression. Although several prognostic indices have been identified that predict need for longer or more intensive treatment, few prescriptive indices have yet been established to select among the different treatments. Combined treatment can improve response with selected patients and enhance its breadth (IPT) or stability (CBT).
