## Question

CA 19–9 levels

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about CA 19–9 interpretation, including when to order it, how to interpret it, and how to act on it across scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological basis and assay limitations. Then, I should verify the diagnostic performance and why it fails as a screening test. Next, I will review confounders that falsely elevate CA 19–9. After that, I should examine its validated roles in pancreatic cancer, including baseline prognostication, perioperative use, and treatment monitoring. I will then consider its role in biliary tract cancers and colorectal cancer. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise approach to an elevated CA 19–9 and close with key takeaways and caveats anchored in guidelines and pivotal studies [^115YrivT] [^1154jiYc].

> Let me first confirm the biological foundation and assay issues. CA 19–9 is a sialylated Lewis a antigen synthesized by epithelial cells and requires functional FUT3; about 5–10% of individuals are Lewis antigen–negative and will have undetectable CA 19–9 even with advanced disease, so a normal value does not exclude cancer, and I should consider CEA and CA-125 in such patients or when CA 19–9 is unexpectedly normal in a high-suspicion scenario [^114apKKw] [^114zFbS4] [^111mDg2u]. Wait, let me verify assay comparability before I interpret serial values; results are not interchangeable across platforms, so I should trend only within the same method and laboratory to avoid misclassification of change [^112aLsYo].

> Next, I should review diagnostic performance and screening utility. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — despite sensitivity around 70–80% and specificity around 80–90% in symptomatic cohorts, CA 19–9 has a poor positive predictive value in low-prevalence settings, making it unsuitable for screening asymptomatic individuals; indeed, prospective data show only 2.8% malignancy among asymptomatic people with elevated CA 19–9, reinforcing that it should not be used as a screening tool [^1143Zq6h] [^115Fujqp]. I need to ensure I anchor this point in guidelines that explicitly caution against screening use and emphasize its adjunctive, not diagnostic, role [^115YrivT] [^1143Zq6h].

> I will now examine confounders that can falsely elevate CA 19–9. Biliary obstruction, cholangitis, and inflammatory hepatobiliary disease can markedly increase levels, sometimes into the thousands, so I should confirm bilirubin and consider CA 19–9 only after biliary decompression when feasible; if bilirubin is elevated, I should interpret values cautiously or adjust for cholestasis when possible [^115YrivT] [^111rkrtj]. But wait, what if the patient has diabetes with poor glycemic control? Recent data suggest CA 19–9 may be elevated in poorly controlled diabetes, so I should recheck after glucose optimization before escalating workup for malignancy [^1141rQQE]. I should also remember that persistent, marked elevations can occur in benign conditions such as pulmonary fibrosis or even Hashimoto's thyroiditis, so clinical context and imaging are essential before labeling an elevation as malignant [^113kR74o].

> Now, let me consider its role in pancreatic cancer. Baseline CA 19–9 is prognostic: higher pretreatment levels correlate with worse survival, and in early-stage disease, thresholds such as < 98 U/mL have been associated with improved outcomes; however, I should double-check bilirubin before interpreting baseline values to avoid cholestasis-driven inflation [^112e2RLM] [^115YrivT]. For perioperative use, normalization after resection and after neoadjuvant therapy portends better survival; failure to normalize increases mortality risk, and postoperative levels > 90–180 U/mL identify patients unlikely to benefit from adjuvant therapy, so I should time measurements before adjuvant therapy and during surveillance to leverage this prognostic information [^113sASkm] [^117FujUd]. Hold on, I should verify the monitoring cadence — guidelines support serial CA 19–9 every 1–3 months during active therapy, interpreted alongside imaging rather than in isolation [^114ZaXS5] [^115YrivT].

> Next, I should review treatment response monitoring. Let me think about magnitude and timing of change. A ≥ 50% decline from baseline is commonly used and has been associated with improved outcomes in several series, though not all studies validate CA 19–9 decline as a surrogate for survival; in fact, a randomized trial found baseline CA 19–9 to be prognostic but did not confirm early ≥ 50% decline as a survival surrogate, so I should avoid overinterpreting a single early drop without corroborating imaging and clinical status [^116T1jYd] [^113g4Ypt]. Hmm, wait a minute — some analyses suggest deeper declines, such as ≥ 75%, may better stratify benefit, particularly in patients starting with very high levels; I should integrate both the proportional decline and the trajectory to nadir with radiographic response before making treatment decisions [^113vcNsR].

> I will now examine its role in biliary tract cancers. Elevated CA 19–9 is associated with worse prognosis in cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer, but it lacks specificity for diagnosis; thus, guidelines recommend obtaining baseline CA 19–9 for prognostication and follow-up rather than for diagnosis, and in PSC-related suspicion, very low thresholds (e.g., 20 U/mL) increase sensitivity at the cost of specificity, so I should pair CA 19–9 with MRCP/ERCP rather than rely on it alone [^1154XkKQ] [^115L4yf8] [^116iuwm5]. Hold on, I should verify that post-resection non-normalization predicts worse survival in BTC as well — yes, failure to normalize after curative resection is independently associated with inferior outcomes, supporting its use as a postoperative prognostic marker [^112G3BVs].

> Let me consider colorectal cancer. CA 19–9 is not recommended for routine staging or surveillance; CEA remains the marker of choice, but CA 19–9 can add prognostic information, particularly in BRAF-mutant mCRC where elevated levels correlate with markedly worse survival, so I should interpret an incidental CA 19–9 elevation in CRC as adverse prognostic information rather than a surveillance tool [^114ZaXS5] [^114HnPMW]. I should double-check that isolated CA 19–9 elevation without CEA elevation occurs in a minority and may still carry prognostic weight, but it should not replace CEA-based monitoring algorithms [^115wLMnK].

> Next, I should review other GI and non-GI contexts. In ampullary adenocarcinoma, baseline CA 19–9 and CEA are recommended for prognostication even though normal levels occur in a substantial fraction, so I should not be reassured by a normal value in this setting [^116ZWR15]. In appendiceal neoplasms considered for CRS/HIPEC, elevated preoperative CA 19–9 has been associated with worse progression-free survival, so I should incorporate it into preoperative risk stratification alongside CEA and clinical factors [^111LcHgu]. But wait, what if CA 19–9 is elevated in lung cancer or thyroiditis? Yes, benign inflammatory and some malignant non-pancreatobiliary conditions can raise CA 19–9, so I must interpret any isolated elevation within the full clinical and radiographic context before pursuing invasive testing [^1176AgSk] [^111eKC2h].

> I should now outline a practical approach to an elevated CA 19–9. First, I need to check for analytical and biological confounders: confirm the assay consistency, review Lewis antigen status if results and suspicion diverge, and assess bilirubin, hepatobiliary disease, infection, and glycemic control; if cholestasis is present, I should repeat CA 19–9 after decompression when feasible [^112aLsYo] [^115YrivT] [^1141rQQE]. Next, I should review symptoms, risk factors, and exam to estimate pretest probability; in low-risk, asymptomatic patients, I should avoid overtesting because malignancy is rare, whereas in high-risk or symptomatic patients, I should proceed with contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging of the pancreas and biliary tree and consider EUS if imaging is indeterminate [^115Fujqp] [^115YrivT]. If imaging is negative and clinical suspicion remains low, I should repeat CA 19–9 in 1–3 months to assess trajectory before escalating; persistent or rising values warrant renewed imaging and tissue diagnosis when appropriate [^115Fujqp] [^115YrivT].

> Key takeaways: I need to ensure I never use CA 19–9 as a screening test in asymptomatic people; I must interpret values in the right clinical context and after addressing confounders like cholestasis and Lewis negativity; baseline CA 19–9 is prognostic in pancreatic and biliary cancers; normalization after therapy is a strong favorable signal; and serial trends should complement, not replace, imaging and clinical judgment in treatment decisions [^115Fujqp] [^115YrivT] [^113sASkm] [^114ZaXS5]. Hold on, I should verify one more thing — assay comparability matters for serial interpretation, so I should document the platform and avoid mixing methods when trending over time [^112aLsYo].

CA 19–9 is a **tumor marker** most often elevated in pancreatic and biliary cancers, but it is **not specific to malignancy** and can be elevated in benign hepatobiliary disease, inflammation, or obstruction [^114apKKw] [^1143Zq6h]. It is **not recommended for screening** asymptomatic individuals because of false positives and false negatives, including in Lewis antigen–negative individuals (5–10%) who do not produce CA 19–9 [^115Fujqp] [^1139qoyc]. In confirmed pancreatic or biliary cancer, CA 19–9 is useful for prognosis, treatment response monitoring, and surveillance, but results must be interpreted in clinical context and with imaging [^115YrivT] [^117W9osZ]. For colorectal cancer, CA 19–9 has limited utility and is not a substitute for CEA [^111mEt6h].

---

## Clinical significance of CA 19–9

CA 19–9 is a **glycoprotein antigen** normally present at low levels in the epithelium of the pancreas, biliary tract, stomach, colon, and salivary glands. Elevated levels are most commonly associated with **pancreatic cancer**, particularly pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and with biliary tract cancers, including cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer [^1143Zq6h] [^1154XkKQ] [^116vu8mt]. It is also elevated in some gastrointestinal malignancies, such as colorectal, gastric, and esophageal cancers, though with lower sensitivity and specificity [^115wLMnK] [^115KKsEz] [^111ZCoQS] [^111mEt6h].

---

## Normal reference range

The **upper limit of normal** for CA 19–9 is typically 37 U/mL. Levels above this threshold are considered elevated and may indicate underlying pathology, though the degree of elevation and clinical context are critical for interpretation [^1134ThYy].

---

## Clinical utility in pancreatic cancer

### Diagnostic utility

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: CA 19–9 has a sensitivity of approximately 70–80% and specificity of 80–90% for pancreatic cancer, particularly in advanced disease. However, it is not suitable for early detection due to limited sensitivity in early-stage disease and potential false positives [^1143Zq6h].

- **False negatives**: Approximately 5–10% of the population are Lewis antigen-negative (Le(a-b-)) and do not produce CA 19–9, resulting in false negatives even in the presence of pancreatic cancer [^114apKKw] [^111mDg2u].

- **False positives**: Elevated CA 19–9 levels can occur in benign conditions such as biliary obstruction, cholangitis, pancreatitis, and other inflammatory diseases, limiting its diagnostic specificity [^114apKKw] [^111mDg2u].

---

### Prognostic utility

Higher baseline CA 19–9 levels correlate with **advanced tumor stage, reduced resectability, and poorer overall survival** [^115YrivT] [^116y4fE3]. Post-treatment normalization or significant decline in CA 19–9 levels is associated with improved prognosis and longer survival, whereas persistently elevated levels indicate poor prognosis and potential recurrence [^113sASkm] [^117FujUd].

---

### Monitoring treatment response

Serial CA 19–9 measurements are commonly used to monitor treatment response in pancreatic cancer. A **≥ 50% reduction** in CA 19–9 levels correlates with improved survival and is often used as a surrogate marker for treatment efficacy, although it should be interpreted alongside imaging and clinical assessment [^114qoYvU] [^116y4fE3].

---

## Clinical utility in biliary tract cancers

In biliary tract cancers, CA 19–9 is often elevated and may serve as a **prognostic marker**; higher levels are associated with advanced disease and poorer outcomes [^1154XkKQ]. However, it is **not specific** and can be elevated in benign biliary conditions, necessitating careful interpretation [^115L4yf8].

---

## Clinical utility in colorectal cancer

CA 19–9 has **limited utility** in colorectal cancer compared to CEA. It may be elevated in advanced disease, particularly in metastatic settings, but it is not recommended for routine monitoring or surveillance due to low sensitivity and specificity [^114ZaXS5].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Several factors can confound CA 19–9 interpretation:

- **Lewis antigen status**: Individuals with Lewis antigen-negative phenotype (5–10% of the population) do not produce CA 19–9, leading to false negatives [^114apKKw] [^111mDg2u].

- **Benign conditions**: Biliary obstruction, cholangitis, pancreatitis, and other inflammatory conditions can cause elevated CA 19–9 levels, leading to false positives [^114apKKw] [^111mDg2u].

- **Assay variability**: Different laboratories use varying assay methods, leading to potential variability in results. Standardization and consistent methodology are essential for accurate interpretation [^112aLsYo].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from organizations such as the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provide the following recommendations:

- **Not for screening**: CA 19–9 is not recommended for routine screening of asymptomatic individuals due to low sensitivity and specificity [^113hLNER].

- **Confirmed malignancy**: In patients with confirmed pancreatic or biliary cancers, CA 19–9 is useful for prognosis assessment, treatment monitoring, and surveillance [^115YrivT] [^117W9osZ].

- **Interpret with caution**: Results should always be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings, imaging studies, and other diagnostic tests [^115YrivT].

## Clinical utility of CA 19–9

| **Clinical context** | **Utility** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Pancreatic cancer | - Diagnostic adjunct <br/> - Prognostic marker <br/> - Treatment monitoring | - False negatives in Lewis antigen-negative individuals <br/> - False positives in benign hepatobiliary diseases |
| Biliary tract cancers | - Prognostic marker <br/> - Treatment monitoring | - Non-specific <br/> - Elevated in benign biliary conditions |
| Colorectal cancer | Limited utility | Low sensitivity and specificity |
| Screening | Not recommended | Low sensitivity and specificity |

---

CA 19–9 is a valuable tumor marker for pancreatic and biliary cancers, particularly for prognosis and treatment monitoring. However, it is **not specific** and can be elevated in benign conditions; therefore, results must be interpreted in clinical context and alongside other diagnostic tests. It is **not recommended for routine screening** of asymptomatic individuals.

Aim

This prospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the etiology of elevated CA 19–9 levels and to present appropriate guidelines for the asymptomatic patients.

Methods

Between January 2004 and March 2007, we enrolled consecutive asymptomatic patients who had elevated CA 19–9 levels > 37 U/mL. To evaluate the etiology, the CA 19–9 level was rechecked and further studies were carried out. If the CA 19–9 level decreased to the normal range, or if it showed a decreasing trend, then it was monitored annually. Yet, if the CA 19–9 level showed an increasing trend, then the level was monitored at intervals of 1, 3, and 6 months until no evidence of malignancy was proven.

Results

Of the 62,976 patients, 501 (0.8%) subjects showed an elevated CA 19–9 level. This prospective analysis was conducted on 353 subjects (70.5%) who were followed up for at least 6 months. Ten patients (2.8%) were diagnosed with malignancies. There were 97 patients (27.5%) with benign diseases and 246 patients (69.7%) were deemed non-specific.

Conclusions

CA 19–9 should not be used as a screening tool. In the case of a persistently elevated CA 19–9 level, further work-up for determining the etiology should be done.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — CA 19–9 measurement and interpretation: CA 19–9 levels correlate with both AJCC staging and resectability and can provide additional information for staging and determining resectability along with information from imaging, laparoscopy, and biopsy. CA 19–9 may be undetectable in Lewis antigen-negative individuals and may be falsely elevated in cases of biliary infection (cholangitis), inflammation, or biliary obstruction and does not necessarily indicate cancer or advanced disease. Measurement of CA 19–9 levels (category 3) is best performed after biliary decompression is complete and bilirubin is normal; if biliary decompression is not performed in a patient with jaundice, CA 19–9 levels can be assessed (category 3), but they do not represent an accurate baseline. The Panel recommends measuring serum CA 19–9 levels after neoadjuvant treatment, prior to surgery, following surgery immediately prior to administration of adjuvant therapy, and for surveillance (category 2B), and emphasizes obtaining a CA 19–9 measurement immediately before therapeutic intervention to get an accurate baseline from which to follow response.

Carbohydrate Antigen 19–9

Although carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9) has also been investigated in CRC, pancreatic adenocarcinoma is perhaps the tumor type in which CA 19–9 has been most extensively studied. Decreasing CA 19–9 levels through treatment and persistence of sustainably low levels have both been used in assessing treatment response in both resectable and metastatic disease states. However, notable confounding factors have been described, including its relatedness to Lewis blood group antigens and elevation in the setting of obstructive jaundice.

Clinical Considerations

Overall, circulating tumor markers are a diverse set of molecules that provide insights into underlying cancer biology. In some cases, these markers have already been established into clinical practice. Presently, CA 125 and PSA are robust predictors in aiding decisions on clinical intervention, as evident by their incorporation into globally accepted disease response criteria for both early and advanced stages of ovarian and prostate cancer, respectively. In contrast, CEA and CA 19–9 have inferior sensitivity and specificity and although they play a significant prognostic and monitoring role in CRC and pancreatic cancer, their impact in clinical decisions is not as strong. Hence, with variable sensitivity and specificity for assessing therapeutic response, only certain tumor markers offer improved performance over non-specific markers of disease burden and are recommended for routine use.

### Serum CA 19–9 as a marker of resectability and survival in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation [^112uZZaF]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

This study has two potential limitations. The first is our inability to differentiate between patients with low but detectable level of CA 19–9 and patients with Lewis a-b- blood type who do not secrete CA 19–9. The extent to which our results have been influenced by this is difficult to determine as few studies have examined the prognosis of Lewis antigen-negative patients. Available data suggest that Lewis a-b- patients have a prognosis similar to, but perhaps even more favorable than, patients with CA 19–9 levels that are detectable but within the normal range or slightly elevated. Future trials are necessary to clearly define the cancer biology of this group of patients.

A second potential limitation of this study is the exclusion of significant numbers of patients from analysis due to elevation in serum bilirubin. This is particularly true in the pretreatment setting: 67 of 174 patients with an available pretreatment CA 19–9 level were excluded from analysis due to concomitant obstructive jaundice. Hyperbilirubinemia, however, can confound measurements of CA 19–9 levels and can introduce significant error into analyses in which CA 19–9 levels associated with both normal and elevated bilirubin levels are considered. Indeed, as we have argued, this represents a major limitation of other studies. Importantly, we found that the demographics, clinical factors, and outcomes of patients with and without an evaluable CA 19–9 at each time point were comparable, suggesting that the exclusion criteria used in this study actually strengthen our conclusions (as opposed to weaken them).

In summary, based upon these data, we offer the following conclusions with regard to use of CA 19–9 in the evaluation of patients with resectable PC treated with neoadjuvant therapy. Serum CA 19–9 levels within the normal range at diagnosis will most often remain normal after induction therapy, and patients with a normal pretreatment CA 19–9 level can be expected to have favorable prognosis compared with those with an elevated level. Nonetheless, the presence of an elevated pretreatment serum CA 19–9 level may not preclude completion of all therapy to include PD. Similarly, both a low restaging CA 19–9 level and a decline over the course of induction therapy are associated with undergoing successful PD; however, a persistently elevated CA 19–9 level at restaging does not reliably signify disease progression and may not preclude successful PD. Based upon these findings, we recommend that therapeutic decision-making with regard to use of neoadjuvant therapy and PD for patients with potentially resectable PC remain largely based on expert clinical assessment and high-quality radiographic staging.

Relationship between CA 19–9 and clinical efficacy

In the overall population (i.e. both treatment groups combined), median OS was significantly longer in patients with a baseline CA 19–9 level equal to or below the median value than in patients with baseline CA 19–9 above the median value (median OS, 12.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 8.6–16.6 months] vs 5.0 months [95% CI, 3.9–5.7 months]; P < 0.0001; Figure 1A). Similarly, in the Gem+A arm, patients with a baseline CA 19–9 level equal to or below the median value for that arm lived significantly longer than patients with baseline CA 19–9 above the median value (median OS, 12.5 months [95% CI, 8.6–16.6 months] vs 4.9 months [95% CI, 3.6–5.6 months]; P < 0.0001; Figure 1B). In patients treated with Gem, OS seemed longer among those with a baseline CA 19–9 level equal to or below the median value; however, the difference did not reach significance probably because of the limited sample size (median OS, 11.6 months [95% CI, 3.8–14.7 months] vs 5.4 months [95% CI, 3.9–7.7 months]; P = 0.1109; Figure 1C).

For the population as a whole, a non-significant trend to longer OS was observed in patients achieving a reduction of ⩾25% in CA 19–9 levels during treatment than in those patients with CA 19–9 reductions below this threshold (median OS, 8.8 months vs 5.2 months; P = 0.1779), as well as longer PFS (median PFS, 6.7 vs 2.5 months; P = 0.1002). In the Gem+A arm, OS and PFS again showed a non-significant trend, but in the Gem arm, the differences were significant despite the smaller numbers of patients (Table 2; Figures 2 and 3). Five patients receiving Gem+A achieved a confirmed PR per RECIST; four of these patients had a ⩾85% reduction in CA 19–9 levels during treatment and one a 54% reduction. One patient receiving Gem experienced a PR and had a 52% reduction in CA 19–9 levels during treatment.

An analysis of 260 patients reported that those with CA 19–9 levels of < 90 U/mL who received adjuvant therapy had longer disease-free survival (DFS) (26.0 months vs. 16.7 months; p = 0.011), whereas patients with > 90 U/mL did not appear to significantly benefit, with DFS of 16.2 months and 9.0 months for those receiving versus not receiving adjuvant therapy, respectively (P = 0.719). In the same study, post-adjuvant therapy CA 19–9 levels ≤ 37 U/mL were associated with the best outcome, while patients with > 37 U/mL had a median DFS of 19.6 months.

### Tumor markers in pancreatic cancer: a European group on tumor markers (EGTM) status report [^116y4fE3]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the most difficult malignancies to diagnose and treat. The aim of this article is to review how tumor markers can aid the diagnosis and management of patients with this malignancy. The most widely used and best validated marker for pancreatic cancer is CA 19–9. Inadequate sensitivity and specificity limit the use of CA 19–9 in the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. In non-jaundiced patients, however, CA 19–9 may complement other diagnostic procedures. In patients with resectable pancreatic cancer, presurgical and postresection CA 19–9 levels correlate with overall survival. In advanced disease, elevated pretreatment levels of CA 19–9 are associated with adverse patient outcome and thus may be combined with other factors for risk stratification. Most, but not all, reports indicate that serial levels of CA 19–9 correlate with response to systemic therapy. Use of CA 19–9 kinetics in conjunction with imaging is therefore recommended in monitoring therapy. Although several potential serum and tissue markers for pancreatic cancer are currently undergoing evaluation, none are sufficiently validated for routine clinical use. CA 19–9 thus remains the serum pancreatic cancer marker against which new markers for this malignancy should be judged.

### CA 19–9 as a marker in addition to CEA to monitor colorectal cancer [^115wLMnK]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Carcinoembryonic antigen is the commonly used tumor marker in patients with colorectal cancer, and CA 19–9 might be an additional marker. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate whether CA 19–9 levels can be used to monitor the disease process in patients with colorectal cancer who had no elevated CEA levels. The secondary aim was to determine if preoperative increased levels of CEA and CA 19–9 were associated with mortality.

Materials and Methods

Two sets of data from patients with histologically confirmed colorectal cancer, were included in a single-center study. First, patients with a minimum of 3 serial measurements of CA 19–9 and CEA tumor markers were related to the clinical course of their disease. Second, patients with preoperative levels of CEA and CA 19–9 were related to survival.

Results

In patients with colorectal cancer and 3 serial measurements of tumor markers, 7.3% had only increased CA 19–9 levels without increased CEA levels, and 55.4% of the patients had an increase of CA 19–9 and CEA levels. In the patients with available preoperative markers, patients with only an increase of CA 19–9 had a significantly decreased 5-year survival compared with patients with an increase of only CEA (P = 0.013).

Conclusion

CA 19–9 can be used as additional marker to follow the disease process in patients with colorectal cancer without an increase in CEA level. Patients with preoperative increased CA 19–9 level had a poorer 5-year survival than patients with preoperative increased CEA levels.

### CA 19–9 tumour-marker response to chemotherapy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer enrolled in a randomised controlled trial [^116T1jYd]. The Lancet: Oncology (2008). Medium credibility.

Background

Several studies in patients undergoing chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic carcinoma have linked a decrease in the concentration of the tumour marker carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19–9 to lengthened survival. The aim of this study was to test the hypotheses that an early decrease in baseline serum CA 19–9 concentration (on day 42, after two cycles of chemotherapy) by at least 50% is associated with lengthened survival, and that a decrease in CA 19–9 concentration of at least 50% from the baseline concentration to the lowest value measured at any time during treatment (nadir) is of prognostic significance, enabling its use as a surrogate endpoint for survival.

Methods

CA 19–9 serum concentration was measured at baseline and every 3 weeks thereafter in patients with histologically proven advanced pancreatic carcinoma enrolled in a randomised trial of gemcitabine versus gemcitabine plus capecitabine. Patients were excluded if baseline serum CA 19–9 concentration was below the upper limit of normal (ULN) in the laboratory or if this measurement was missing. Comparisons of survival between patients with and without a CA 19–9 response were corrected for the guarantee-time bias by the landmark method. The trial on which this study is based is registered on the clinical trials site of the US National Cancer Institute website http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00030732.

Findings

247 of 319 randomised patients were assessable for analysis of baseline serum CA 19–9 concentration, and, of these, 175 patients were assessable for tumour-marker response to treatment. Median overall survival for patients with a baseline CA 19–9 concentration equal to or above the median value (ie, 59xULN) was 5.8 months (95% CI 5.1–7.0), which was significantly shorter than that for patients with baseline concentrations below the median value (10.3 months [95% CI 8.6–12.8], p < 0.0001). An early decrease in CA 19–9 concentration of at least 50% after two cycles of chemotherapy was not associated with a longer overall survival compared with patients who did not have a decrease of at least 50% (median 10.1 months [9.2–12.7] vs 8.6 months [6.9–11.2], p = 0.53; hazard ratio for death 1.11 [0.81–1.52]). Furthermore, a decrease in CA 19–9 concentration of at least 50% reached at the CA 19–9 nadir concentration was not associated with a longer overall survival compared with those patients who did not have a decrease of at least 50% (median 7.8 months [6.5.10.1] vs 6.7 months [5.5–9.8], p = 0.74; 0.95 [0.69–1.31]) after adjusting for the guarantee-time bias.

Interpretation

Pretreatment serum CA 19–9 concentration is an independent prognostic factor for survival, but a decrease in concentration during chemotherapy is not significantly associated with lengthened survival compared with those who did not have a corresponding decrease. Our data suggest that CA 19–9 response during chemotherapy is not a valid surrogate endpoint for survival in clinical trials.

### CA 19–9 as a biomarker in advanced pancreatic cancer patients randomised to gemcitabine plus axitinib or gemcitabine alone [^114kKvPq]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Another possibility is that cytostatic agents have a different effect on pancreatic cancer cells. Supporting this hypothesis, patients achieving objective tumour responses, whether treated with Gem+A or Gem, all experienced a decline in CA 19–9 of at least 50% when on treatment. A similar association between tumour response and CA 19–9 decline has been reported elsewhere. Our data concur with those of others that suggest that CA 19–9 decline in the presence of objective radiological responses is potentially a predictive indicator of clinical benefit.

CA 19–9 levels tend to increase with stage of pancreatic cancer, but vary widely, both inter- and intra-patient. Our study seems to support this, showing an inverse relationship between CA 19–9 and a more advanced phase of disease. Researchers have commonly used the median baseline CA 19–9 level of the study population as a threshold for dividing patients with APC into groups for survival comparisons. The wide variation in baseline CA 19–9 levels makes selection of an absolute threshold for this type of analysis somewhat arbitrary. However, as the data regarding the importance of baseline CA 19–9 as an independent prognostic factor for survival is increasing for a range of treatments, an absolute threshold value would be valuable to enable separation of different prognostic subgroups, which in turn will allow prospective determination of prognosis for an individual patient. As discussed by), this absolute threshold value could be selected only by conducting a prospective clinical trial that prospectively defines it (e.g. selecting an absolute CA 19–9 threshold of 1000 U mL –1 for patients with metastatic disease).

### Prognostic significance of preoperative serum carbohydrate antigen 19–9 in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer [^112rN9FD]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19–9 is a widely used tumor marker in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, its prognostic impact in patients with stage IV CRC who have undergone curative resection is not clear. We evaluated the prognostic power of preoperative serum CA 19–9 in these patients.

Patients and Methods

We performed a retrospective review of 173 patients with stage IV CRC who had undergone curative resection at our institution. Patients were categorized into normal and high CA 19–9 groups, and relapse-free survival and overall survival were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves. Multivariate analyses were performed using a Cox proportional hazard model.

Results

The preoperative serum CA 19–9 level was elevated in 80 patients (46%). The 3-year relapse-free survival of the high CA 19–9 group was significantly worse than that of the normal CA 19–9 group (18% vs. 28%, respectively; p = 0.026). The 3-year overall survival of the high CA 19–9 group was significantly lower than that of the normal CA 19–9 group (75% vs. 82%; p = 0.047). Multivariate analyses indicated that elevated preoperative serum CA 19–9 level was an independent prognostic factor for poor relapse-free survival and overall survival, with a hazard ratio of 1.46 (95% confidence interval, 1.03–2.06; p = 0.035) and 1.90 (95% confidence interval, 1.10–3.29; p = 0.023), respectively.

Conclusion

The preoperative serum CA 19–9 level is a good predictive marker of tumor recurrence and prognosis in patients with stage IV CRC who have undergone curative resection.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — imaging and biomarker notes during neoadjuvant therapy: Imaging with contrast is appropriate for disease management unless contraindicated. For neoadjuvant therapy, consider PET/CT or PET/MRI scan before and after initiation to assess response to systemic therapy and for restaging. Elevated CA 19–9 does not necessarily indicate cancer or advanced disease; CA 19–9 may be elevated as a result of biliary obstruction, infection (cholangitis), or inflammation, benign or malignant, and CA 19–9 will be undetectable in Lewis antigen-negative individuals; consider obtaining CEA and CA-125 in patients who are nonsecretors or those with normal CA 19–9 levels. Subsequent chemoradiation is sometimes included, and most NCCN Member Institutions prefer neoadjuvant therapy at or coordinated through a high-volume center. There is limited evidence to recommend specific neoadjuvant regimens off-study, and practices vary with regard to the use of chemotherapy and chemoradiation.

### Diagnostic performance of a tumor marker gene test to personalize serum CA19–9 reference ranges [^111LkvhB]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

With the CA19–9 tumor marker gene test available for clinical investigation, the next step is a study evaluating its diagnostic performance as an early detection test, and ultimately its diagnostic yield when added to existing pancreatic surveillance imaging tests. Patients enrolled into pancreas surveillance programs need long-term surveillance; for patients who might undergo regular CA19–9 tests over many years, adding a one-time tumor marker gene test would involve little additional cost. Until its diagnostic performance is better understood, the CA19–9 tumor marker gene test is best applied to patients who are undergoing surveillance pancreatic imaging, as abdominal imaging can identify many of the sources of benign elevations of CA19–9 (such as large hepatic, renal, or splenic cysts, biliary or pancreatic duct dilation associated with inflammation, etc.). Some of these diseases that cause elevated CA19–9 are uncommon in the CAPS surveillance setting, and they often cause symptoms (e.g. cholangitis, acute pancreatitis; ref.), and require diagnostic evaluation anyway. The clinical scenarios surrounding these diseases are very different to the scenario of an asymptomatic HRI undergoing tumor marker surveillance who presents with a positive tumor marker test, though it is important to evaluate the impact of false-positive tests in this setting in future studies

The goal of pancreatic surveillance is to detect early-stage pancreatic cancer, preferably when it is a small asymptomatic Stage I PDAC, or when there is high-grade dysplasia without invasive cancer, as intervening at these points in the natural history offers the best opportunities for cure. CA19–9 has also been evaluated in cohort study biorepositories, where evidence reveals elevations beginning mainly in the year prior to diagnosis, consistent with preclinical cancer progression. Perhaps the best criterion of a blood test for early detection is its diagnostic performance for Stage I PDAC. In our study, the CA19–9 tumor marker gene test had an overall diagnostic sensitivity for Stage I PDAC of 46.4%, at 98.9% specificity. Pancreatic imaging with EUS and/or MRI/CT detects many Stage I PDACs when the CA19–9 level is below even the tumor marker gene test defined cutoffs, so until more sensitive blood-based tests are available, pancreatic imaging will need to be the primary modality of pancreatic surveillance for CAPS subjects. How best to incorporate blood-based testing for patients undergoing pancreatic imaging surveillance remains to be determined, but one option would be to time the test in between annual pancreatic imaging tests.

### Prognostic value of CA 19–9 levels in patients with inoperable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with gemcitabine [^115TC6Zx]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

A decrease of > 15% of CA 19–9 concentrations during chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cisplatin has also been shown to correlate with a better survival and no objective progression as assessed by CT than a primary rise or a plateau of the CA 19–9 concentration. The kinetics of CA 19–9 serum concentrations was prospectively evaluated in a selected group of patients treated with gemcitabine and cisplatin. The high remission rate (OR = 38%) observed in this subgroup of patients certainly needs to be viewed critically. All patients received an objective complete response that demonstrated a significant decrease of CA 19–9 to normal values to the combined chemotherapy regimen. Also, similar to our study, patients with objective partial response or stable disease had significant tumour marker decrease. These results confirm that measurements of CA 19–9 help to assess prognosis during chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer.

Considering the limited number of patients in this study, data certainly need validation. However, the present results indicate that in patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer and increased baseline CA 19–9 concentrations, measurements of CA 19–9 and clinical benefit response should be performed after 8 weeks of treatment to assess prognosis together with other clinical parameters. Determination of CA 19–9 provides faster evidence of response than conventional imaging procedures. With decreasing CA 19–9 values, objective progress of tumour is improbable, and treatment may be continued. In patients with an increase of CA 19–9 or with a decrease ≤ 20%, prognosis is extremely poor and with the exception of cases with significant improvement of clinical benefit response, further chemotherapy with gemcitabine seems to be of questionable value. In the setting of clinical decision-making, CA 19–9 kinetics may help to reduce the continuation of ineffective chemotherapy and the number of costly imaging procedures. Thus, rational implementation of CA 19–9 determination during chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer may induce a substantial reduction in treatment-related costs.

### Prognostic role of carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 in metastatic colorectal cancer: a BRAF-mutant subset with high CA 19–9 level and poor outcome [^116HnyKG]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

We are aware of some limitations for CA 19–9 as a biomarker, since several benign diseases may also give rise to elevated levels, and CA 19–9 is not expressed in subjects with Le (a-b-) genotype in the Lewis blood group system. In this study, the Lewis blood-type status of the patient cohort was unknown. Nine percent of the patients in our cohort had no detectable CA 19–9 as judged by the lower reference value, and in a clinical routine setting, these patients will be reckoned as having a very low serum level of CA 19–9 below a detection limit, but it will not be possible to distinguish between patients with very low CA 19–9 levels from those who do not express CA 19–9 due to their Lewis blood type. This subgroup of patients had clinical characteristics and outcome that did not differ significantly from the total population with detectable levels of CA 19–9, suggesting that it included patients across the total population and not specifically those with a low CA 19–9 level.

Serum CA 19–9, alone or in combination with markers of systemic inflammation, can be useful in the management of patients with BRAF -mutant, primary unresectable mCRC. We believe that the findings are of general relevance, although the underlying chemotherapy regimen in the present study is not commonly used outside the Nordic countries. Elevated serum CA 19–9 level may help to identify patients with a highly aggressive disease, like those who should be considered for intensive first-line therapy, such as the triple combination FOLFOXIRI. In conclusion, integrated prognostic data, including the CEA and CA 19–9 biomarkers, may give more accurate information about the disease and can be useful in shared decision-making, enabling patient and clinician to establish an optimal treatment plan.

### The prognostic and predictive value of serum CA19.9 in pancreatic cancer [^111Lj5Un]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Serum CA19.9 possesses many features of a robust or clinically useful biomarker and has been well studied to define its limitations outlined above. Despite this, there are no clear applications for CA19.9 in the management of PC as there are for other similar serum biomarkers such as PSA for prostate cancer, CEA for colorectal cancer and CA 125 in ovarian cancer, which are although sometimes controversial, used in routine practice and form integral components of clinical trials to further advance clinical management. We focused on defining potential roles for serum CA19.9 at key clinical decision-making time points in patients who have demonstrable CA19.9 production. If an individual is identified to have the capacity to produce CA19.9, either through Lewis antigen testing or through a level over 5 U/ml at diagnosis as a surrogate, postoperative CA19.9 measurements have potential prognostic and predictive value. First, normalization of CA19.9 postoperatively is associated with a good prognosis. Second, postoperative CA19.9 levels > 90 U/ml may be associated with a lack of response to adjuvant gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, and third, although numbers are small, a normal CA19.9 after completion of adjuvant therapy is potentially associated with an excellent prognosis. These potential applications are summarized in Figure 3, which also proposes how CA19.9 levels could be incorporated in to trials to inform clinical decision making.

### CA 19–9 as a predictor for response and survival in advanced pancreatic cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy [^114e4n3g]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the significance of carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9) levels for predicting response and survival in pancreatic cancer (PC) treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

Methods and Materials

We retrospectively reviewed data from 69 patients with PC between 1999 and 2005. All patients had elevated CA 19–9 levels before treatment. CA 19–9 levels (pre- and posttreatment CA 19–9) and their decline were analyzed for radiologic response and overall survival.

Results

Seventeen patients (25%) had a 50% or greater reduction in tumor size within 3 months of chemoradiotherapy (1 complete response, 16 partial responses). CA 19–9 decline was significantly correlated with radiologic response (p = 0.03). The median survival time (MST) was 12 months (range, 4–48 months), and 1-year survival rate was 44%. Pretreatment CA 19–9 > 1,200 U/mL (MST, 13 vs. 8 months; p = 0.002), posttreatment CA 19–9 > 100 U/mL (MST, 17 vs. 10 months; p = 0.0003), and CA 19–9 decline ≤ 40% (MST, 13 vs. 10 months; p = 0.005) were the strongest and most unfavorable prognostic factors. In addition, patients with multiple unfavorable CA 19–9 levels had significantly worse outcomes than those without.

Conclusions

CA 19–9 decline shows a correlation with radiologic response. The combination of pretreatment CA 19–9 > 1,200 U/mL, posttreatment CA 19–9 > 100 U/mL, and CA 19–9 decline ≤ 40% may possibly serve as a surrogate marker for poor survival in advanced PC receiving chemoradiotherapy.

### Serum CA 19–9 as a marker of resectability and survival in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation [^1156H1UJ]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Data from the 82 patients in our study in whom both pretreatment and restaging CA 19–9 levels were evaluable affirm that both the restaging CA 19–9 level and the change in CA 19–9 over the course of neoadjuvant therapy are clinically relevant prognostic markers; in general, low restaging values are better than high values, and a decline in CA 19–9 following induction therapy is more favorable than a rise. However, four important caveats must be noted with regard to these observations. First, the PPV of the restaging CA 19–9 (86%) and the change in CA 19–9 (77%) for completing all therapy including PD were similar to that of the standard restaging evaluation (radiography and physical examination) alone (86%). Second, restaging CA 19–9 and its change from the pretreatment level were both associated with low NPV for competing PD; therefore, neither test effectively excluded radiographically occult metastatic disease at time of restaging. Third, although the number of patients analyzed was relatively small, the median survival of patients who underwent PD in the setting of restaging CA 19–9 higher than all cutoff values, or with stable or increased restaging CA 19–9, was similar to the median survival of patients who underwent PD in whom CA 19–9 levels were below each cutoff value or fell. Finally, we were unable to demonstrate any correlation between change in CA 19–9 level and response to treatment as assessed histopathologically.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — neoadjuvant and advanced disease CA 19–9 dynamics: In the neoadjuvant/borderline resectable setting, a study of 141 patients found that reduction of CA 19–9 to < 40 U/mL was associated with overall survival (OS) improvements in non-resected (15 months vs. 11 months; p = 0.02) and resected (37.9 months vs. 26 months; p = 0.02) disease. For advanced pancreatic cancer, pretreatment CA 19–9 serum levels were shown to be an independent prognostic factor for survival, and change in CA 19–9 levels during chemotherapy can be useful for evaluating the benefit of treatment, although the data are not entirely consistent. In pooled individual patient data from 6 prospective trials, increases of < 5% in CA 19–9 were associated with improved OS compared to a ≥ 5% increase (10.3 months vs. 5.1 months; p = 0.002).

### Aspects and outcomes of surveillance for individuals at high-risk of pancreatic cancer [^112qciXB]. Familial Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Biomarkers

As of today, carbohydrate 19–9 (CA19–9) is the only FDA-approved biomarker for diagnostics of PDAC. However, it is crucial to underscore that CA19–9 is employed exclusively when PDAC is suspected in a clinical setting and is not utilized in surveillance settings, where the a priori likelihood of PDAC varies and influences both positive and negative predictive values. Studies have evaluated the added value of CA19.9 in cancer screening trials and pancreatic cyst surveillance, demonstrating high specificities of up to 99% for PDAC. Nevertheless, these studies also detected significantly low sensitivities, reaching as low as 17%. The ability of CA19–9 to reliably identify PDAC is influenced by several conditions, including liver diseases, pancreatitis, cholangitis, as well as pulmonary and gynecologic diseases, which may lead to potential false-positive results for PDAC. Moreover, studies suggests that certain individuals lack the Lewis antigen and produce minimal to no CA19–9. Consequently, these individuals may not exhibit a sufficiently elevated CA19–9 level to meet the standardized threshold of > 37–40 U/mL for effective PDAC detection. The variability in CA19–9 levels is, therefore, also dependent on the genetic variations present in individuals. In a related development, Dbouk et al. personalized the CA19–9 cut-off threshold for PDAC based on these genetic variations. This adjustment led to an improvement in AUROC from 0.84 without the personalized cut-off to 0.92 with the personalized cut-off. While these results are promising, further validation is needed before CA19–9 with personalized cut-offs will be implemented in the clinical setting. Lastly, several studies are being conducted on biomarkers that could improve the early detection of PDAC and potentially complement the surveillance programs in the future, but these are beyond the scope of this review.

### Undetectable preoperative levels of serum CA 19–9 correlate with improved survival for patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^111aGhkY]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Serum levels of CA19–9 have been shown to correlate with both recurrence and survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. However, little is known about the prognosis for patients with undetectable levels of serum CA19–9.

Methods

One hundred twenty-nine patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent preoperative assessment of serum CA19–9 followed by resection with curative intent between 1990 and 2002 were retrospectively analyzed. Data collected included preoperative serum CA19–9 level (U/mL), age, pathologic staging, and survival. Data were analyzed with the SAS system according to four distinct preoperative serum CA19–9 levels: undetectable, normal (< 37), 38–200, and > 200 U/mL.

Results

Serum CA19–9 levels ranged from undetectable to 16,300 U/mL. Stage III/IV disease accounted for 86%, 67%, 59%, and 53% of patients in the four CA19–9 groups. The overall median and 5-year survivals were 19 months and 11%, respectively. Survival was similar between nonsecretors and those with normal CA 19–9 levels. However, both groups had statistically significant prolonged survival compared with the two groups with elevated CA 19–9 levels (P = 0.003). The only factors that were significant on univariate and multivariate analysis for overall survival were lymph node positivity (P = 0.015 and.002) and CA 19–9 grouping (P = 0.003 and P < .0001). Although this group of patients presented with predominately advanced-stage disease, their overall survival was superior.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that patients who present with undetectable preoperative CA19–9 levels and potentially resectable pancreatic cancer, regardless of advanced stage, should be considered candidates for aggressive therapy.

### Serum CA 19–9 as a marker of resectability and survival in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation [^1163fVgR]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Enthusiasm for the use of neoadjuvant therapy for patients with potentially resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) has grown as clinicians have increasingly recognized "resectable" PC as a systemic disease. Neoadjuvant treatment sequencing allows for early treatment of the extrapancreatic micrometastases present in the majority of patients with localized PC and improves the selection of patients for surgery by limiting resection to those with stable or responding disease — an important consideration for an operation with a defined mortality and significant morbidity. Although no randomized trial has demonstrated the superiority of preoperative over postoperative adjuvant therapy, results from single-institution series, multi-institutional trials, and population-based analyses encourage further study of novel treatment sequencing in patients with stage I and II PC.–

In addition to neoadjuvant treatment sequencing, another tool to more accurately select patients for surgery might be a serum tumor marker. Carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9) has long been accepted as a measure of PC tumor burden, and as such it has been utilized as a prognostic marker for patients with all stages of disease. Among patients with resectable PC, preoperative levels correlate with tumor resectability and postoperative survival, and postoperative levels predict survival duration in patients treated with adjuvant therapies.–For patients with advanced PC, pretreatment CA 19–9 has been reported to be prognostic and the change in serum levels over the course of treatment has been used as an index of treatment response.

Serum CA 19–9 is a useful tumor marker in certain clinical scenarios, but its added prognostic value beyond radiographic and clinical staging for patients with resectable PC is unclear. Moreover, although a few studies have examined CA 19–9 levels of patients who had been treated with chemotherapy or chemoradiation prior to surgery, only one small study has evaluated serial CA 19–9 levels of patients with resectable PC treated with a multidisciplinary program of neoadjuvant therapy and planned resection.–To clearly define the role of CA 19–9 in this context, we analyzed patients with potentially resectable PC of the pancreatic head or uncinate process treated on two recently reported phase II trials of neoadjuvant chemoradiation.

### AASLD practice guidance on primary sclerosing cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma [^116iuwm5]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Surveillance biomarkers — CA 19–9 performance and combinations: A cutoff value of 129 U/ml demonstrated sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 98%, whereas a cutoff of 20 U/ml demonstrated sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 67%. Importantly, up to one third of patients with PSC with an elevated CA 19–9 may not have CCA, and up to 10% of the population do not express CA 19–9. The combination of MRI/MRCP plus CA 19–9 with a cutoff of 20 U/ml increases sensitivity to 100% but has low specificity (38%), and ERCP plus CA 19–9 at a 20-U/ml cutoff reaches 100% sensitivity for diagnosing CCA but with a low specificity of 43%.

### The prognostic and predictive value of serum CA19.9 in pancreatic cancer [^112GAYan]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Current staging methods for pancreatic cancer (PC) are inadequate, and biomarkers to aid clinical decision making are lacking. Despite the availability of the serum marker carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA19.9) for over two decades, its precise role in the management of PC is yet to be defined, and as a consequence, it is not widely used.

Methods

We assessed the relationship between perioperative serum CA19.9 levels, survival and adjuvant chemotherapeutic responsiveness in a cohort of 260 patients who underwent operative resection for PC.

Results

By specifically assessing the subgroup of patients with detectable CA19.9, we identified potential utility at key clinical decision points. Low postoperative CA19.9 at 3 months (median survival 25.6 vs 14.8 months, P = 0.0052) and before adjuvant chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors. Patients with postoperative CA 19.9 levels > 90 U/ml did not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.7194) compared with those with a CA19.9 of ≤ 90 U/ml (median 26.0 vs 16.7 months, P = 0.0108). Normalization of CA19.9 within 6 months of resection was also an independent favorable prognostic factor (median 29.9 vs 14.8 months, P = 0.0004) and normal perioperative CA19.9 levels identified a good prognostic group, which was associated with a 5-year survival of 42%.

Conclusions

Perioperative serum CA19.9 measurements are informative in patients with detectable CA19.9 (defined by serum levels of > 5 U/ml) and have potential clinical utility in predicting outcome and response to adjuvant chemotherapy. Future clinical trials should prioritize incorporation of CA19.9 measurement at key decision points to prospectively validate these findings and facilitate implementation.

### Prognostic role of carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 in metastatic colorectal cancer: a BRAF-mutant subset with high CA 19–9 level and poor outcome [^1139qoyc]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

For 51 patients (9%), CA 19–9 was not detectable in the serum samples as judged by the lower reference value. However, in this subgroup 33 of the patients (6% of the analysed population) had no analytic signal or very low values classified as analytic noise, whereas 18 patients had CA 19–9 values between 3 and 5 kU/L, below the lower analytical reference value. These data suggest that at least 2/3 of the patients with no detectable CA 19–9 had Le (a-b-) genotype in the Lewis blood group system, consistent with the reported frequency of 5% to 10% of individuals lacking expression of Lewis antigens in Caucasian populations. The subgroup of patients for whom CA 19–9 could not be detected showed clinical features that were essentially similar to the total population (Table 1) and there was no statistically significant difference between the subcategories and clinical outcome (Supplementary Figure 1A). Sensitivity analyses including these patients with CA 19–9 assigned the value 0 did not significantly alter the results of the study (not shown).

Serum levels of CA 19–9 and tumour BRAF mutation status

The data showed that the prognostic information from elevated levels of CA 19–9 differed depending on the RAS and BRAF mutation status of the tumour, with a statistically significant interaction in adjusted analyses (P = 0.003). In contrast, there was no statistically significant interaction between serum CEA level and RAS / BRAF mutation status (P = 0.27).

Elevated levels of CA 19–9 were associated with a particularly impaired OS in BRAF -mutant cancers. The patients with BRAF -mutant tumours had an estimated median OS of 17 and 9 months in unadjusted analyses stratified on low and elevated serum levels of CA 19–9, respectively, and the two groups differed significantly in the tail of the Kaplan–Meier curves (Fig. 3d). In an adjusted proportional hazards model including WHO performance status and levels of ALP, CEA and CRP, an elevated level of serum CA 19–9 was associated with a significant relative reduction in survival (adjusted HR = 4.35 (95% CI 2.89–8.28) in patients with tumours harbouring BRAF mutation (Table 2).

### Prognostic role of carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 in metastatic colorectal cancer: a BRAF-mutant subset with high CA 19–9 level and poor outcome [^114HnPMW]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Mutation status of RAS and BRAF, as well as serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9), are biomarkers used in clinical management of patients with gastrointestinal cancers. This study aimed to examine the prognostic role of these biomarkers in a patient population that started first-line chemotherapy for unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in the NORDIC-VII study.

Methods

CEA and CA 19–9 were measured in serum samples from 545 patients obtained before the start of chemotherapy. Four hundred and ninety-four patients had detectable levels of carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9). RAS (exons 2–4) and BRAF (V600E) mutation status were available from 440 patients. Overall survival (OS) was estimated in patient groups defined by serum CEA or CA 19–9 levels using cut-off values of 5 µg/L and 35 kU/L, respectively, in the total population and in subgroups according to RAS and BRAF mutation status.

Results

For both CEA and CA 19–9, elevated serum levels were associated with reduced OS in adjusted analyses which included RAS and BRAF mutation status, baseline World Health Organization performance status, and levels of alkaline phosphatase and C-reactive protein. The negative prognostic information provided by an elevated CA 19–9 level was particularly marked in patients with BRAF mutation (hazard ratio = 4.35, interaction P = 0.003, in an adjusted model for OS).

Conclusions

High baseline serum concentrations of CEA and CA 19–9 provide independent information of impaired prognosis in mCRC. In patients with BRAF -mutant tumours, elevated serum CA 19–9 may identify a subgroup with highly aggressive disease and could contribute to improving therapeutic decisions.

### Persistent elevation of serum CA 19–9 with no evidence of malignant disease [^113kR74o]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Serum CA 19–9 is the mainstay marker for the diagnosis of biliopancreatic malignancies, though a persistent elevation can also be observed in various benign diseases.

Aims

In this study, a marked increase of serum CA 19–9 was seen in 10 patients who had no evidence of malignant disease. The possible causes of this finding are discussed.

Patients

Nine women and one man were studied, whose admitting diagnoses were as follows: pulmonary fibrosis in two, diabetes in two, non-ulcer dyspepsia in two, obesity in one, acute diarrhoea in one, colon diverticula in one and gastric ulcer in one.

Methods

Routine blood tests, tumour marker determinations, imaging studies and endoscopy were carried out at admission.

Results

Serum CA 19–9 levels ranged from 112 to 1338 IU/ml (mean 517 IU/ml). Abdominal ultrasonography, CT-scan, upper gastrointestinal X-ray series and gastrointestinal endoscopies were negative for malignancy. During the follow-up period (range 2–7 years) serum CA 19–9 values were persistently elevated in all patients.

Conclusions

Our study shows that persistent and significant elevation of serum CA 19–9 can be found in non-malignant and non-cholestatic disease.

### Prognostic value of CA 19–9 levels in patients with inoperable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with gemcitabine [^113auMDQ]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas have a particularly poor survival with less than 1% alive 5 years from diagnosis. Recently, chemotherapy with gemcitabine has been shown for the first time to improve both survival and quality of life significantly in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, although overall survival was still poor and the majority of patients treated did not respond. For the assessment of the objective response CT scan, ultrasound, or MRI are inaccurate. It has been proposed to be more appropriate to assess tumour response by clinical parameters and quality of life than assessment of tumour diameters. Tumour markers as biochemical response markers represent a potentially more simple and inexpensive method of monitoring response. The primary goal of this study was, therefore, to proof an early and reliable prognostic factor for remission evaluation.

In accordance with previous studies, the overall survival in our study was poor with none of the patients surviving longer than 29 months. We show that a significant correlation between objective treatment response and CA 19–9 serum concentrations at the start of treatment and, therefore, a decrease of CA 19–9 > 20% after 8 weeks of chemotherapy is able to separate patients into groups with significantly different survival times. CA 19–9 changes not only at the beginning of the therapy but also a recurrent increase of CA 19–9 after an initial biochemical response was associated with a short median survival time of the patients. Unfavourable prognostic factors are the presence of metastatic disease, high preoperative concentrations of CA 19–9, and a poor performance status correlate with poor survival. In our study, the alteration of CA 19–9 was the strongest independent prognostic factor, whereas clinical benefit response failed to be a prognostic factor. The time to measure a decrease of CA 19–9 ≤ 20%, a rise during the first treatment courses of chemotherapy, or a recurrent rise after initial response is very short with 8 weeks; the measurement of CA 19–9 as a biochemical response marker after 8 weeks of chemotherapy may, together with clinical benefit response, help to decide whether further chemotherapy should be continued or stopped.

### CA 19–9 as a biomarker in advanced pancreatic cancer patients randomised to gemcitabine plus axitinib or gemcitabine alone [^112CjwCT]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

The prognostic value of peri-operative CA 19–9 levels and its role as an indicator of asymptomatic recurrence have been investigated in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer, and a recent phase III trial confirmed the prognostic value of post-resection CA 19–9 levels in patients undergoing surgery with curative intent. However, the greatest potential lies in exploiting CA 19–9 as a biomarker in patients with advanced inoperable pancreatic cancer, who comprise at least 80% of those diagnosed. Several studies have found baseline CA 19–9 levels to be an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with APC. An association between reduction in CA 19–9 levels during treatment and prolonged survival has also been reported. However, none of the large randomised studies has reported on the specific impact of targeted cytostatic therapies on CA 19–9 levels as a predictive biomarker.

This retrospective analysis describes the kinetics and the prognostic value of CA 19–9 and investigates the association with clinical outcome and diastolic blood pressure (dBP) in patients with APC receiving gemcitabine plus axitinib (an oral, potent inhibitor of VEGF receptors [VEGFR] 1, 2, 3; Gem+A) or gemcitabine alone (Gem) in a randomised phase II trial. We have already shown that dBP may be a predictive biomarker in those benefiting from axitinib; in the present analysis, we also explore further the correlation between changes in CA 19–9 levels and dBP.

### CA 19–9 nonproduction is associated with poor survival after resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^111Ra1r2]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19–9 is the most common serum biomarker used in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC). Elevated preoperative levels have been shown to correlate with more advanced stage, greater risk of unresectability, and overall worse survival. The prognostic value of CA 19–9 nonproduction, which is present in an estimated 5% to 15% of the population, is unclear. We sought to determine whether CA 19–9 nonproduction was associated with worse survival after PC resection.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed our institution's prospective pancreatic database for all PC patients with documented preoperative CA 19–9 values who underwent resection with curative intent from March 1992 to August 2009. After excluding 10 perioperative deaths, 200 patients remained for analysis.

Results

Mean and median follow-up was 23.3 and 16.1 months, respectively. Median survival in months for patients with preoperative CA 19–9 levels in U/mL by category was as follows: normal (5.1 to 36.9): 32, nonproduction (≤ 5): 21, mildly elevated (37 to 99.9): 35, highly elevated (100+): 16. Factors significantly associated with worse overall survival were: nonwhite race, nonproduction or highly elevated preoperative CA 19–9 (≥ 100 U/mL), estimated blood loss ≥ 1 L, tumor size (≥ 2 cm), lymph node-positivity, and advanced (3/4) histologic grade. On multivariate analysis, only CA 19–9 nonproduction or highly elevated production, estimated blood loss ≥ 1 L, advanced histologic grade, and node positivity remained significant in the final model.

Conclusions

CA 19–9 nonproduction is not associated with improved survival after pancreatic cancer resection, as has previously been asserted, when compared with patients with normal and elevated levels.

### Serum CA 19–9 as a marker of resectability and survival in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation [^116oXMrF]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Association of Pretreatment CA 19–9 with PD, Postoperative Recurrence, and Survival

Of 99 patients with an evaluable pretreatment serum CA 19–9 level, 70 (71%) completed all therapy including PD (median 129 U/ml, mean 581 ± 1,364 U/ml, range 2–8,614 U/ml) and 29 patients did not (median 173 U/ml, mean 629 ± 856 U/ml, range 12–3,365 U/ml, P = 0.9). The area under the ROC curve for pretreatment CA 19–9 as a marker of completing all therapy including surgical resection was 0.59 (95% CI 0.47–0.71); the optimal cutoff which simultaneously maximized both the sensitivity (54%) and specificity (55%) of the test was 149 U/ml (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curves for pretreatment and restaging serum CA 19–9 levels as predictors of completing all therapy including pancreaticoduodenectomy. The area under the curve (AUC) and optimal cutoff values for pretreatment and restaging CA 19–9 were 0.59 (95% CI 0.47–0.71), 149 U/ml and 0.74 (95% CI 0.64–0.84), 61 U/ml, respectively

Pretreatment CA 19–9 was associated with a low negative predictive value (NPV) for completing all therapy including PD at all cutoff values (Table 2). Among 15 patients without documented recurrence following PD, the highest pretreatment CA 19–9 level was 1,125 U/ml (Fig. 2). In contrast, the positive predictive value (PPV) of pretreatment CA 19–9 for undergoing PD was considerably higher. Patients with a pretreatment CA 19–9 level within the normal range had more favorable survival than those with an elevated pretreatment CA 19–9 (P = 0.02), although significance was not maintained when evaluating only those patients who underwent PD (P = 0.08).

### Defining the optimal duration of neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: time for a personalized approach? [^114qoYvU]. Pancreas (2022). Medium credibility.

With imaging being inconclusive in PDAC, there is great need for alternative methods to assess an individual patient's therapeutic response and make clinical decisions. This knowledge could not only aid in surgical planning but also help predict if a drug treatment and its duration are adequate. The most common biomarker associated with pancreatic cancer is carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9). Because of its high false-positive rate, CA 19–9 is not labeled a diagnostic marker. Rather, it is typically used as a prognostic tool in early stages of the disease and has been tracked as a marker of prognosis and treatment response. While not all clinical trials focused on NAT of PDAC report the fluctuation in this biomarker, those who do most often report a decrease throughout therapy. A decrease in CA 19–9 greater than 50% correlates to an improved OS rate, an improvement in resection rates, and histopathologic responses. Other studies have indicated that a normalization of CA 19–9 is the strongest prognostic marker for long-term survival and can be a reliable correlate of response to NAT. In an effort to combine information gained via imaging and biomarkers, Akita et alexamined the relationship between CA 19–9, fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and patients' responses to therapy. A statistically significant improvement in OS was found if the patient had a favorable response in both CA 19–9 and FDG-PET. Elevations in CA 19–9 were associated with a metastatic recurrence, whereas lack of a response seen via FDG-PET was associated with local recurrence. An unfavorable response to either method resulted in a poor OS rate. A recent study by Thalji et alexamined the association between NAT duration, CA 19–9 response, and OS. A positive response, and especially a normalization, of this biomarker has been statistically associated with improved OS. Furthermore, patients receiving NAT greater than 4 months were statistically more likely to have a greater than 50% response in CA 19–9 compared with patients treated for a shorter period. Although further confirmatory studies are required, this information could prove key in determining optimal preoperative treatment durations for PDAC. Unfortunately, prognostic significance of CA 19–9 in PDAC has its limitations. While it has been shown to have strong prognostic value and association with OS, CA 19–9 is not elevated in up to 20% of patients and thus cannot be used to guide treatment decisions for all patients.

### ASCO 2006 update of recommendations for the use of tumor markers in gastrointestinal cancer [^114ZaXS5]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To update the recommendations for the use of tumor marker tests in the prevention, screening, treatment, and surveillance of gastrointestinal cancers.

Methods

For the 2006 update, an update committee composed of members from the full Panel was formed to complete the review and analysis of data published since 1999. Computerized literature searches of Medline and the Cochrane Collaboration Library were performed. The Update Committee's literature review focused attention on available systematic reviews and meta-analyses of published tumor marker studies.

Recommendations and Conclusion

For colorectal cancer, it is recommended that carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) be ordered preoperatively, if it would assist in staging and surgical planning. Postoperative CEA levels should be performed every 3 months for stage II and III disease for at least 3 years if the patient is a potential candidate for surgery or chemotherapy of metastatic disease. CEA is the marker of choice for monitoring the response of metastatic disease to systemic therapy. Data are insufficient to recommend the routine use of p53, ras, thymidine synthase, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, thymidine phosphorylase, microsatellite instability, 18q loss of heterozygosity, or deleted in colon cancer (DCC) protein in the management of patients with colorectal cancer. For pancreatic cancer, CA 19–9 can be measured every 1 to 3 months for patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease receiving active therapy. Elevations in serial CA 19–9 determinations suggest progressive disease but confirmation with other studies should be sought. New markers and new evidence to support the use of the currently reviewed markers will be evaluated in future updates of these guidelines.

### Metastatic medullary thyroid cancer presenting with elevated levels of CA 19–9 and CA 125 [^1174uRrv]. Thyroid (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are established markers of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), used in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease and its progression. In clinical practice, various other tumor markers are utilized in the follow-up of different malignancies, although their utility has not been well described in MTC. CA 19–9 antigen, routinely used in the monitoring of pancreatic cancer, also has been detected in the tissue of approximately 6% of MTCs. However, its presence has never been reported in the serum of these patients. Elevation of CA 125 antigen, utilized as a tumor marker for ovarian cancer, has never been reported in MTC. We report a novel finding of metastatic MTC presenting with elevated CA 19–9 and CA 125 serum levels, with concurrent tissue staining for these antigens.

Summary

A 56-year-old woman with multiple endocrine neoplasia 2B syndrome, post subtotal thyroidectomy for MTC in childhood, presented with extensive metastatic spread of MTC to the lungs and liver, 47 years after the original diagnosis. The patient's calcitonin level decreased from 2950 to 261 pg/mL (reference range: < 20 pg/mL) over a 20-year period. The serum CEA level was elevated at 6800 ng/mL (reference range: < 5.1 ng/mL). Because of a concern for an alternate malignancy, serum CA 19–9 and CA 125 tumor markers were measured and found to be significantly elevated, at 39,334 U/mL (reference range: < 35.1 U/mL) and 96.2 U/mL (reference range: 7–41 U/mL), respectively. Immunostaining of the metastatic MTC tissue showed patchy staining for calcitonin, strongly positive staining for CEA and CA 19–9, and weakly positive staining for CA 125.

Conclusion

Drawing from experience with CA 19–9 and CA 125 tumor markers in other malignancies, we propose that they may be associated with aggressive forms of MTC with significant metastatic potential.

### Serum CA 19–9 as a marker of resectability and survival in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation [^111fw5nf]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Change in CA 19–9 and Correlation with PD, Survival, and Treatment Effect

Of 82 patients in whom both pretreatment and restaging CA 19–9 levels were evaluable, pretreatment CA 19–9 was < 37 U/ml in 18 (22%) patients. CA 19–9 remained within the normal range upon restaging in 16 (89%) of these 18 patients; in the remaining 2 patients, CA 19–9 increased only marginally (to 44 and 74 U/ml). Therefore, we analyzed the significance of change in serum CA 19–9 between pretreatment and restaging by examining only the 64 patients with pretreatment CA 19–9 above the upper limit of normal. Overall, the 52 patients in whom CA 19–9 levels decreased had more favorable survival than the 12 patients in whom levels remained stable or increased [25.7 months (95% CI 18.5–32.9 months) versus 10.4 months (95% CI 0–21.4 months), P = 0.01], and were more likely to undergo PD (77% versus 42%, P = 0.02). However, the median survival of the five patients in whom CA 19–9 did not change or increased over the course of treatment but who underwent PD was similar to that of the 40 patients who underwent PD after a decline in CA 19–9 [20.9 months (95% CI 10.7–31.1 months) versus 28.3 months (95% CI 23.8–32.9 months), P = 0.41]. The PPV and NPV of a drop in CA 19–9 to predict PD was 77% and 58%, respectively; when evaluated at restaging only in 54 patients taken to surgery, the PPV and NPV were 89% and 44%, respectively.

In the 59 patients with both evaluable pretreatment and restaging CA 19–9 levels and a treatment effect score from the PD specimen, no association was observed between the change in serum CA 19–9 over the course of induction therapy and the grade of treatment effect observed in the surgical specimen (P = 0.74). Similarly, no association was observed when we analyzed only the 44 patients who underwent PD and in whom pretreatment CA 19–9 was above the upper limit of normal (P = 0.43).

Results

Clinical characteristics and serum levels of CEA and CA 19–9

The frequency distribution of the levels of CEA and CA 19–9 is shown in Fig. 2a, b, respectively. From 545 analysed patients, 96 (18%) had serum levels of CEA below 5 µg/L and 449 (82%) had elevated CEA levels (≥ 5 µg/L). Furthermore, 494 patients had detectable serum levels of CA 19–9 in their serum samples. Of these patients, 188 (38%) had a serum level of CA 19–9 below 35 kU/L and 306 (62%) had elevated CA 19–9 (≥ 35 kU/L). From 51 patients (9%), CA 19–9 was below the detection limit.

Fig. 2
Histograms. Distribution of serum level of (a) CEA (median: 36 µg/L; range: 0.5–32,916 µg/L) and (b) CA 19–9 (median 50 kU/L; range 5–185,991 kU/L). Fifty-one patients had undetectable levels of CA 19–9 in the serum

For both CEA and CA 19–9, elevated serum levels were associated with impaired baseline clinical patient characteristics, such as inferior WHO performance status, intact primary tumour, synchronous metastases, elevated ALP level, elevated platelet (> 400/nL) and white blood cell (> 10/nL) counts and elevated CRP (> 10 mg/L) (Supplementary Table 1). Elevated CA 19–9 was somewhat more frequent in patients with colon cancer as compared to rectal cancer, while there was no association between CEA level and origin of primary tumour. Furthermore, 33% and 71% of the patients with lung-only metastases had levels of CEA below 5 µg/L and CA 19–9 below 35 kU/L, respectively. No relationship between other metastatic sites and serum levels of CEA or CA 19–9 was observed.

In patients with elevated serum CA 19–9 (≥ 35 kU/L), the median was numerically higher in those with with BRAF -mutant tumours (853 kU/L) compared to those with RAS -mutant or RAS/BRAF wild-type tumours (336 and 254 kU/L, respectively). Furthermore, 8 of the 16 patients with an isolated elevated CA 19–9 (i.e. CEA not increased) had BRAF -mutant tumours. There was no difference in median CEA value between subgroups based on RAS or BRAF mutation status.

### Prognostic value of CA 19–9 levels in patients with inoperable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with gemcitabine [^117JzrEH]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Serum carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9) has been identified as a useful tumour marker for diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic carcinoma, but its value for evaluating the response to chemotherapy with gemcitabine is not clear. Tumour regression in pancreatic carcinoma is hard to determine due to massive desmoplastic tissue. Furthermore, objective tumour response does not automatically transcribe into better survival. Therefore, clinical benefit response, a composed parameter consisting of factors like performance status, pain, and body weight was integrated in evaluating tumour response. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the usefulness of serial CA 19–9 measurements as a biochemical response marker and an outcome prognostic parameter in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer receiving gemcitabine treatment. A total of 46 consecutive patients (median age 66 years) suffering from histologically proven locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the exocrine pancreas were analysed. Gemcitabine was applied for a median of 23 courses (range 6–76). Two patients achieved an objective complete remission, five an objective partial remission (overall response, OR = 15.2%), while objective stable disease was documented in 19 and objective progressive disease in 20 patients. Patients with a decrease of > 20% of the baseline CA 19–9 level after 8 weeks of chemotherapy had a significantly better median survival than patients with a rise or a decline < 20%. The response of CA 19–9 > 20% during chemotherapy was the only independent predictor of survival in a multivariate analyses. In contrast, neither objective tumour response nor clinical benefit response showed this level of significance. In conclusion, kinetics of CA19–9 serum concentration serves as an early indicator of response to gemcitabine chemotherapy in advanced pancreatic cancer.

### Prognostic role of carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 in metastatic colorectal cancer: a BRAF-mutant subset with high CA 19–9 level and poor outcome [^1151kzY7]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and 40–50% of patients with CRC will develop distant metastases. Systemic therapy is the main treatment option for metastatic CRC (mCRC), and better treatment during the past decades has resulted in improved survival. However, mCRC is a heterogeneous disease, and selecting patients for optimal treatment is a challenge. Many factors determine the outcome. Development of robust and easily available biomarkers may help to individualise treatment.

Mutations in RAS (exons 2–4) and particularly BRAF (V600E) in the tumour cells are associated with impaired prognosis, – and mutation status is routinely used in the clinical management of patients with mCRC. About 50% of the patients have RAS mutations which predict lack of effect from systemic treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies. The activating BRAF (V600E) mutation is found in 5–20% of the tumours in mCRC patient cohorts.,

Assays of certain glycoproteins and carbohydrates expressed by cancer cells are used in the clinical management of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a glycoprotein belonging to a group of adhesion molecules, is produced in the epithelium of the large intestine and may be involved in malignancy.CEA has an established role as a biomarker in diagnosis, treatment and surveillance in CRC, and elevated serum levels of CEA are associated with inferior prognosis. Carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9), a tetrasaccharide carbohydrate also termed sialyl Lewis a, synthesised by gastrointestinal epithelium, is an established serum biomarker for monitoring treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer. While there is some evidence of a relationship between elevated CA 19–9 levels and outcome in CRC, – its role in the management of patients with mCRC is so far unclear. Little is also known about the prognostic information that can be obtained from the serum levels of these two biomarkers when analysed in relation to tumour RAS and BRAF mutation status.

### The impact of carbohydrate antigen 19–9 on survival in patients with clinical stage I and II pancreatic cancer [^112e2RLM]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19–9 is a biomarker to monitor treatment effect. A threshold to predict prognostic significance remains undefined. We evaluated the impact of CA19–9 on overall survival (OS) in patients with early-stage pancreatic cancer (PC) utilizing the National Cancer Database (NCDB).

Methods

The NCDB was queried from 2010 to 2014 to identify patients with clinical stage I-II PC. Patients who had undocumented pretreatment CA19–9 were excluded. Patients were stratified into two cohorts: CA19–9 < 98 U/mL and CA19–9 ≥ 98 U/mL, and further categorized into surgery versus no surgery. Twelve- and 24-month OS rates are reported.

Results

Overall, 32,382 patients (stage I: 12,173; stage II: 20,209) were included. The majority of stage I (52.1%) and II (60%) patients had CA19–9 ≥ 98 U/mL. Stage I-II patients with CA19–9 < 98 U/mL had improved OS rates (stage I: 67.5%, 42.6%; stage II: 59.8%, 32.8%) compared with stage I and II patients with CA19–9 ≥ 98 U/mL (stage I: 50.7%, 26.9%; stage II: 48.1%, 22%). Among resected stage I patients, CA19–9 < 98 U/mL was associated with improved OS (< 98: 80.5%, 56%; ≥ 98: 70.2%, 42.8%), and a similar trend was seen in resected stage II patients (< 98: 77.6%, 49.9%; ≥ 98: 71%, 39.2%). Unresected stage I patients with lower CA19–9 had improved OS (< 98: 42.1%, 17.5; ≥ 98: 29.9%, 10%), with similar findings in unresected stage II patients (< 98: 41.1%, 15.3%; ≥ 98: 33.4%, 10.6%).

Conclusions

Our study demonstrated the prognostic value of CA19–9 in patients with clinical stage I-II PC, with a value < 98 U/mL demonstrating improved survival. Surgery significantly improved survival at 12 and 24 months irrespective of CA19–9.

### Measurement of serum CA 19–9 may be more valuable than CEA in prediction of recurrence in patients with gastric cancer [^115KKsEz]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

In 35 patients with recurrent gastric cancer who had undergone curative gastrectomy, serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19–9 (carbohydrate antigen) tumor marker levels were investigated. At least one tumor marker was elevated in 24 (68.6%) patients. The levels of serum CA 19–9 and CEA markers were increased in 20 (57.1%) and 12 (34.3%) patients, respectively. This difference was not statistically significant. However, it may be important in terms of clinical practice.

### The prognostic and predictive value of serum CA19.9 in pancreatic cancer [^117MsQu9]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

introduction

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal solid organ malignancies. Pancreatectomy offers the only potential for cure but is only possible in a minority of patients. Even in those patients who undergo resection, most die because occult extrapancreatic metastatic disease was likely present at the time of diagnosis. Systemic therapies are only modestly effective in advanced disease but have a significant impact in the adjuvant setting, with 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine both having efficacy in a subgroup of patients and increasing 5-year survival from 10%–15% with surgery alone to 20%–25%. As a consequence, there is an urgent need to develop biomarkers to better stratify patients for current treatment modalities and for the testing of novel therapeutic strategies. Carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA19.9), first isolated in 1979, is the only available serum biomarker for PC and has shown some utility as a diagnostic adjunct and a prognostic marker but is not widely used in routine clinical practice. Serum biomarkers such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in prostate cancer, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in colorectal cancer and CA 125 in ovarian cancer, which have similar limitations and although sometimes controversial are routinely used and are an integral component of clinical trials in those diseases.

Defining the subgroup of individuals where CA19.9 measurement is robust in predicting prognosis and chemotherapeutic responsiveness for PC would improve current management and overall outcomes. Here, we show that serum CA19.9 has distinct potential clinical utility in PC patients when assessed at distinct clinical decision points along the patient journey.

### A decade's experience of managing suspected pancreatic adenocarcinoma at a tertiary cancer center [^115yhxGs]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

It is not clear why this tumor marker trend was observed. As previously mentioned, a limitation of CA 19–9 is its propensity to be elevated in both benign and malignant diseases. Although many studies have shown a positive correlation between CA 19–9 and advanced disease, an 11-year retrospective study showed no significant correlation between margin status and preoperative CA 19–9 levels, where positive margins are highly associated with larger, higher stage tumors and worse outcomes. Further studies, therefore, are necessary to fully investigate the diagnostic utility of CA 19–9 as a serum tumor marker in pancreatic cancer.

In conclusion, when a patient with a suspected pancreatic neoplasm presents at our tertiary care center, the patient is managed in a multidisciplinary approach involving medical oncologists, surgical oncologists, radiologists, cytologists and interventional gastroenterologists, who meet weekly. A combination of a cross-sectional imaging study and EUS with FNA serves as a highly effective duo in establishing tissue diagnosis and staging in patients who have a suspected pancreatic neoplasm with a low AE rate. The invaluable support from our cytology specialists, available to read pancreatic specimens at all hours of the day, minimizes the number of FNA passes required to confirm the diagnosis, thus reducing the risk of unwanted AEs. Counterintuitively, CA 19–9 is not necessarily higher with resectable lesions than with unresectable lesions, highlighting the limitation of CA 19–9 as a pancreatic tumor marker.

### Does serum CA19–9 play a practical role in the management of patients with colorectal cancer? [^111mEt6h]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

CA19–9 is often used in combination with carcinoembryonic antigen to manage patients with colorectal cancer, even though there is insufficient evidence to support this use of CA19–9. Carcinoembryonic antigen, by contrast, has been regarded as a better indicator of poor prognosis and recurrence. The purpose of this study is to clarify whether CA19–9 is, in fact, a useful marker in the management of colorectal cancer patients by comparing it with carcinoembryonic antigen.

Methods

A retrospective investigation was done for a consecutive series of 155 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma who underwent potentially curative surgery between 1995 and 1999. Excluded were patients with postoperative assays performed less than three times for either carcinoembryonic antigen or CA19–9 and those who had developed secondary cancers. Data from 118 patients were analyzed in terms of prediction of prognosis and detection of recurrences.

Results

The sensitivities of preoperative CA19–9 and carcinoembryonic antigen were 29.8 percent and 45.3 percent, respectively. In the univariate analysis of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen and CA19–9 assays in 114 patients, high carcinoembryonic antigen level was significantly associated with poor prognosis (P = 0.0090) by log-rank test). We could not find a significant association between preoperative CA19–9 abnormality and survival (P = 0.12). Multivariate analysis of preoperative factors indicated significance in TNM stage (P = 0.0094) and tumor location (P = 0.036) but in neither carcinoembryonic antigen (P = 0.061) nor CA19–9 (P = 0.22). Among 40 patients with recurrences, postoperative elevations of tumor markers were seen in 19 cases for CA19–9 and in 37 for carcinoembryonic antigen throughout the follow-up periods. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.48, 0.88, 0.68, and 0.77, respectively, for CA19–9, and 0.93, 0.88, 0.80, and 0.96, respectively, for carcinoembryonic antigen. In patients with recurrences, the initial postoperative elevation of tumor markers was seen earlier than the detection of recurrence in 68.4 percent of those with CA19–9 elevation and in 67.6 percent of those with carcinoembryonic antigen elevation. There was only one patient with recurrence who had CA19–9 elevation without carcinoembryonic antigen elevation, while 19 recurrent patients had carcinoembryonic antigen elevation without CA19–9 elevation. Multivariate analysis showed a significant risk of carcinoembryonic antigen elevation against recurrence with an odds ratio of 32.0 (P < 0.0001), in contrast to an insignificant association of CA19–9 elevation (P = 0.23).

Conclusion

We could not find clinical significance to support the use of CA19–9 to predict the prognosis and detect recurrence of colorectal cancer. Because of this, we do not recommend routine use of CA19–9 in staging and surveillance of colorectal cancer patients.

### Serum CA 19–9 as a marker of resectability and survival in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation [^116ov7Ra]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Patients with resectable PC who undergo PD benefit from adjuvant therapy; current trials for resectable disease no longer have a control arm which receives surgery alone. Unfortunately, up to 56% of patients do not receive postoperative therapy when planned, due largely to delayed surgical recovery or early tumor recurrence.–Neoadjuvant treatment sequencing ensures that all patients with resectable PC who undergo PD receive multimodality treatment. Neoadjuvant strategies also lead to lower than expected rates of lymphatic metastasis and positive surgical margins, enrich the population of patients who undergo PD with those most likely to benefit from surgery, and contribute to actual 5-year survival rates as high as 27%.–Successful neoadjuvant treatment approaches require sequential staging evaluations to select those patients who will benefit from surgery — perhaps best considered as one of the earliest forms of personalized cancer care. We performed this analysis to determine whether CA 19–9 could prospectively identify those patients in whom radiographically occult advanced disease will preclude completion of a multidisciplinary strategy employing neoadjuvant therapy and PD.

### CA 19–9 as a biomarker in advanced pancreatic cancer patients randomised to gemcitabine plus axitinib or gemcitabine alone [^113hLNER]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Monitoring objective responses to systemic therapy using conventional imaging can be difficult in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (APC) whose disease is located predominantly at the primary site. These techniques may underestimate the response to systemic therapy, as the image incorporates tumour desmoplasia, which is prevalent in pancreatic tumour growth and is unlikely to be affected by systemic therapy. In addition, favourable objective response rates in early studies of new targeted agents or combinations have not been predictive of benefit in phase III studies. Alternative predictive methods for monitoring therapy benefit and predicting prognosis in early phase studies are urgently needed especially as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted strategies do not seem to contribute significantly to classical objective assessments in terms of complete response+partial response (PR).

As its initial characterisation in 1979, the role of the tumour-associated carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9) as a serum marker for tumours has been widely studied, particularly in patients with pancreatic cancer. CA 19–9 is the sialylated Lewis (Le) a blood group antigen, and cannot be synthesised in individuals with a Le a–b– phenotype (5% of the population). Serum CA 19–9 seems to show greatest specificity for pancreatic cancer, being elevated in approximately 70–80% of patients. Despite these findings, CA 19–9 is not currently recommended as a routine diagnostic or screening test for pancreatic cancer, as its specificity and sensitivity are inadequate for accurate diagnosis. Serum CA 19–9 may also be increased in a number of benign conditions, including benign hepatobiliary diseases, and in biliary obstruction.

### Prognostic value of CA 19–9 levels in patients with inoperable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with gemcitabine [^114VgAqM]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is predominantly diagnosed in advanced stages of the disease. In all, 80–95% of patients are inoperable at diagnosis and only about 1% of patients are still alive 5 years from the time of diagnosis. Gemcitabine (2′,2′di-fluorodeoxycytidine), a nucleoside analogue with a mild toxicity profile, has been shown to improve both clinical benefit and survival in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer compared to treatment with 5-fluorouracil, although overall survival was poor with a median survival of less than 6 months. Especially, in pancreatic cancer a common problem with chemotherapeutic approaches consists in the difficulty in determining objective treatment response. This is partly due to the retroperitoneal localisation of the pancreas, and also due to the limited possibilities of differentiating the tumour from the normal surrounding tissue. Moreover, inclusion of desmoplastic tissue into the baseline tumour volume may cause an underestimation of tumour reduction during chemotherapy, while inclusion of surrounding inflammatory tissue may result in an overestimation of response. Therefore, great efforts have been undertaken to determine the impact of chemotherapy by methods other than imaging of tumour volume. One approach has been the measurement of clinical benefit that is a composed parameter consisting of factors like performance status, pain, and body weight. While an evaluation of clinical benefit response reflects on the quality of life, this approach is time consuming, in many aspects subjective, and certainly controversial in its validity. In patients undergoing radiation or resection of pancreatic cancer, the prognostic value of serum carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9) has already been accepted. In search for a parameter reflecting the chemotherapeutic efficacy faster, on a more objective level, and to identify any subgroups of patients in whom chemotherapy with gemcitabine improves survival, prognostic parameters (tumour grading, tumour stage, prior palliative operation, baseline CA 19–9 and CA 19–9 decrease) during the first treatment courses, CA 19–9 was evaluated in patients undergoing chemotherapy with gemcitabine alone or in combination with cisplatin.andfound that kinetics of CA 19–9 concentration may serve as an early indicator of response to gemcitabine/gemcitabine–cisplatin therapy. Serum carbohydrate antigen 19–9, the sialylated Lewis blood group antigen defined by the monoclonal antibody 1116 NS 19–9, is a tumour-associated antigen synthesised by normal pancreatic and ductular cells occurring in large quantities in normal pancreatic juice. It is the most sensitive and specific serum marker for pancreatic cancer. The prognostic value of CA 19–9 for patients with pancreatic cancer treated by resection or radiotherapy is well established, but only few data regarding the prognostic value of CA 19–9 during chemotherapy with gemcitabine have been published so far. No prospective studies comparing clinical benefit response and CA 19–9 response were performed. Although CA 19–9 is not pathognomonic of pancreatic cancer, most patients show elevated serum concentrations of this marker. This study analyses the kinetics and the prognostic value of the tumour marker CA 19–9 as a biochemical response marker before and during chemotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine with special emphasis on objective tumour and clinical benefit response.

### Effect of glycotoxicity and lipotoxicity on carbohydrate antigen 19–9 in the patients with diabetes [^1141rQQE]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical perspectives

Hospitalized patients with diabetes are routinely screened for tumor markers including CA 19 − 9. Our study revealed that the presence of percentage of patients exhibiting elevated CA 19 − 9 level was unexpectedly high in hospitalized diabetic patients with poor hyperglycemia controlled (HbA1c ≥ 9%). A large number of patients with diabetes are found to have abnormal CA19–9 levels. CA19–9 is a tumor marker. Clinicians and patients will worry whether there is a tumor if this indicator is abnormal. They often arrange further examination, including invasive gastroscopy and colonoscopy to exclude cancers. Our findings provide a new interpretation of the abnormal CA19–9 level in diabetic patients with HbA1c ≥ 9%. For the diabetic patients with HbA1c ≥ 9%, abnormal CA19–9 cannot indicate cancer. We suggest reexamine within a few days after normal blood glucose control. It will avoid meaningless examination and unnecessary panic of patients. For the diabetic patients with HbA1c < 9%, further examinations are suggested to exclude cancer soon.

### CA 19–9 as a biomarker in advanced pancreatic cancer patients randomised to gemcitabine plus axitinib or gemcitabine alone [^111siZhm]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Response assessment in advanced pancreatic cancer (APC) is difficult and predictive markers are needed. There are insufficient data on the value of carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9) and cytostatic-targeted therapies. Axitinib, a selective vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1, 2, 3 inhibitor, may increase overall survival (OS) in APC.

Methods

We assessed serum CA 19–9, clinical outcomes and diastolic blood pressure (dBP) in APC patients receiving gemcitabine plus axitinib (Gem+A) or gemcitabine alone.

Results

In the total population (N = 95), median OS was significantly longer in patients with baseline CA 19–9 values at or below the median than in those with values above it (12.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 8.6–16.6%] vs 5.0 months [95% CI, 3.9–5.7%]; P < 0.0001). This also reached significance in the Gem+A arm (median OS, 12.5 months [95% CI, 8.6–16.6%] vs 4.9 months [95% CI, 3.6–5.6%]; P < 0.0001). Patients with any dBP > 90 mmHg had significantly longer OS than those who did not. However, there was no predictive significance of CA 19–9.

Conclusion

Baseline CA 19–9 levels had prognostic value for OS, but caution is advised in interpreting CA 19–9 as a predictive biomarker for novel cytostatic agents such as VEGF-targeted therapies in phase II studies.

### Prognostic value of CA 19–9 levels in patients with inoperable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with gemcitabine [^113JBZFX]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

In all, 22 patients experienced a decrease of pain, in nine patients the analgesic use was reduced, KPS was improved in 19 patients, and weight gain was observed in 12 patients. Response according to the response criteria of clinical benefit was seen in 12 patients. Two patients with objective complete response, three with objective partial response, and seven patients with objective stable disease experienced a clinical benefit response, whereas no patient with objective progressive disease had a clinical response according to the criteria. Two of three patients with objective partial response and clinical benefit response had a CA 19–9 decrease > 20%, and of the 12 patients with objective stable disease and CA 19–9 decrease > 20%, seven had a clinical benefit response.

Survival curves comparing survival of patients treated with gemcitabine stratified according to CA 19–9 decrease < 20% and > 20% during 8 weeks of chemotherapy with gemcitabine. Linerepresents all patients.). Patients responding with CA 19–9 > 20% had a significantly longer median time to progression (199 days; 95% Cl 157–241 days) than patients who did not respond (61 days; 95% CI 33–89 days; P = 0.002). Both the patients who achieved an objective complete response after 8 weeks of chemotherapy, had a CA 19–9 decrease > 20%. Using a cutoff level of 20 U mL −1, none of the complete remission (CR) patients reached normal values in the course of treatment. In patients responding to chemotherapy with CR or partial remission (PR), imaging procedures like ultrasound, CT-scan, or MRT provided evidence of remission only after a median of 3.3 treatment courses (range = 1–5 courses). All patients achieving PR showed a decrease of CA 19–9 > 20% after 8 weeks, but none reached normal values.

Among patients with stable disease, 12 of the 19 patients and two of 20 with progressive disease after 8 weeks of treatment had decreasing CA 19–9 concentrations > 20% and in the remaining 18 patients with progressive disease, CA 19–9 increased initially. This persisted > 2 months in two. Trough levels of CA 19–9 were consistently above the cutoff level of 20 U mL −1. However, values increased later in all the 30 patients initially responding with the tumour marker CA 19–9 > 20% and all of them experienced a recurrent increase. The median survival time from the beginning of recurrent rise to death was 220 days (95% Cl 177–262 days). Age and gender did not show significant differences or a trend for significant differences regarding survival by univariate analysis (Table 2

Table 2
Cox univariate and multivariate analyses of the prognostic factors and their impact on survival, P > 0.05). Patients showing a clinical benefit response had a median survival of 506 days (95% CI 436–576 days), which was significantly longer than the median survival of the patients who did not respond (227 days, 95% CI 211–244 days; P = 0.03). For the first CA 19–9 measurement after 3 weeks, we could not find such a relation.

Serum level of CEA as an independent prognostic biomarker

As expected, there was a relationship between increasing serum levels of CEA (grouped in quartiles) and impaired survival (log-rank test for trend, P < 0.001). Patients with elevated CEA (≥ 5 µg/L) and low CEA (< 5 µg/L) had a median OS of 19 and 29 months, respectively (hazard ratio (HR), 1.85 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45–2.38); P < 0.001). Furthermore, 24% of the patients with serum CEA below 5 µg/L survived at least 5 years compared to 8% of those with an elevated CEA level (Fig. 3a), although there was no difference in frequency of secondary metastasectomy in the two subgroups (9% and 8%, respectively). The prognostic information of baseline CEA was further confirmed in an adjusted model including other prognostic markers and clinical characteristics believed to be potential confounders, including WHO performance status, ALP and CRP levels and RAS/BRAF mutation status (adjusted HR, 1.78 (95% CI 1.34–2.37); P < 0.001), as shown in Supplementary Table 2.

### Importance of normalization of CA19–9 levels following neoadjuvant therapy in patients with localized pancreatic cancer [^113sASkm]. Annals of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) is a prognostic marker for patients with pancreatic cancer (PC), but its value as a treatment biomarker is unclear.

Summary Background Data

Although CA19–9 is an established prognostic marker for patients with PC, it is unclear how CA19–9 monitoring should be used to guide multimodality treatment and what level of change in CA19–9 constitutes a meaningful treatment response.

Methods

CA19–9 measurements at diagnosis (pretx), after completion of all planned neoadjuvant therapy (preop), and after surgery (postop) were analyzed in patients with localized PC who had an elevated CA19–9 (≥ 35U/dL) at diagnosis. Patients were classified by: 1) quartiles of pretx CA19–9 (Q1–4); 2) proportional changes in CA19–9 (ΔCA19–9) after the completion of neoadjuvant therapy; 3) normalization (CA19–9 < 35U/dL) of preop CA19–9; and 4) normalization of postop CA19–9.

Results

Among 131 patients, the median overall survival (OS) was 30 months; 68 months for the 33 patients in Q1 of pretx CA19–9 (< 80U/dL) compared with 25 months for the 98 patients in Q2–4 (P = 0.03). For the 98 patients in Q2–4, preop CA19–9 declined (from pretx) in 86 (88%), but there was no association between the magnitude of ΔCA19–9 and OS (P = 0.77). Median OS of the 98 patients who did (n = 29) or did not (n = 69) normalize their preop CA19–9 were 46 and 23 months, respectively (P = 0.02). Of the 69 patients with an elevated preop CA19–9, 32 (46%) normalized their postop CA19–9. Failure to normalize preop or postop CA19–9 was associated with a 2.77-fold and 4.03-fold increased risk of death, respectively (P < 0.003) as compared with patients with normal preop CA19–9.

Conclusions

Following neoadjuvant therapy, normalization of CA19–9, rather than the magnitude of change, is the strongest prognostic marker for long-term survival.

### Early detection of pancreatic carcinoma [^1134ThYy]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The poor prognosis and late presentation of pancreatic cancer patients emphasize the importance of an effective early detection strategy for patients at risk of developing pancreatic cancer. In current practice, the use of CA 19–9 levels and imaging techniques is not optimal for detecting small pancreatic lesions. It is hoped that the understanding of genetic alterations in combination with the development of high-throughput sensitive techniques will lead to the rapid discovery of a panel of biomarkers that will save lives by enabling aggressive therapy at the time when tumors are curable.

### Serum CA19–9 response as a surrogate for clinical outcome in patients receiving fixed-dose rate gemcitabine for advanced pancreatic cancer [^115JYvu7]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer represents the fourth leading cause of cancer-associated mortality in the United States, with the annual mortality rate approximating the incidence rate. Clinical trials of novel therapeutic agents in this disease often report response rate as a study end point, but the usefulness and accuracy of this outcome variable are debatable. First of all, the ability to monitor objective responses to systemic therapy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, particularly at the primary pancreatic site, can be difficult using conventional methods such as computerised tomography. Measurement of objective response by formal RECIST criteria does not allow one to gauge accurately the true burden of disease due to the extensive desmoplasia and surrounding inflammation associated with pancreatic tumours and the inability to trace clearly defined tumour margins of the primary pancreatic lesion. Furthermore, promising response rates in early trials do not uniformly translate into significant improvement in patient outcomes when investigated in phase III studies. Hence, alternative methods for monitoring patients on therapy are critical for guiding early treatment decisions, offering prognostic information, and implementing into clinical trial design as new surrogate end points for the selection of therapeutic agents.

Carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) is the sialylated Lewis blood group antigen originally defined by the monoclonal antibody 1116 NS 19–9. A radioimmunoassay was developed for this marker in 1983, and since that time, measurement of CA19–9 levels in serum has been commonly used as an adjunct in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Approximately three-quarters of all patients with pancreatic cancer have an elevated serum CA19–9 level at baseline. Patients who are genotypically negative for the Lewis blood group antigen, however, will not express CA19–9 even in the presence of active pancreatic cancer. Using as a cutoff point of 37 U mL −1 as the upper limit of normal, overall sensitivity of the assay is approximately 80% and its specificity is 90% for detecting pancreatic cancer. Additionally, serial measurements of CA19–9 are frequently performed for prognostic purposes, for gauging disease relapse and activity, and for monitoring patients undergoing therapy as an approximate surrogate for response.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1143Zq6h]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma biomarkers — S100P and CA 19–9 performance and use indicate that a meta-analysis of eight studies found that S100 calcium-binding protein P (S100P) shows high sensitivity (0.87; 95% CI, 0.83–0.90) and specificity (0.88; 95% CI, 0.82–0.93) for pancreatic cancer diagnosis, and that a panel of TIMP1 and LRG1 immunoassays with CA 19–9 improved the detection of early-stage pancreatic cancer relative to CA 19–9 alone. The best-validated and most clinically useful biomarker for early detection and surveillance is CA 19–9, which is commonly expressed and shed in pancreatic and hepatobiliary disease and other malignancies and thus is not tumor-specific; however, the degree of increase in CA 19–9 levels may be useful in differentiating adenocarcinoma from inflammatory conditions of the pancreas. CA 19–9 has potential uses in diagnosis, screening, staging, determining resectability, as a prognostic marker after resection, and as a predictive marker for response to chemotherapy, and is a good diagnostic marker with sensitivity of 79% to 81% and specificity of 80% to 90% in symptomatic patients, though its low positive predictive value makes it a poor biomarker for screening.

### Serum CA 19–9 and CA 72–4 levels in Hashimoto's thyroiditis: a prospective case-control study [^115Exvny]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a common autoimmune thyroid disorder and a leading cause of subclinical hypothyroidism. Tumor markers such as CA 19 − 9 and CA 72 − 4 may also be elevated in certain benign inflammatory conditions. This study aimed to investigate the levels of CA 19 − 9 and CA 72 − 4 in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis and to evaluate the effects of levothyroxine treatment.

Methods

This prospective case-control study included 30 patients with subclinical hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis and 30 healthy controls matched by age and sex. Serum levels of CA 19 − 9, CA 72 − 4, TSH, free T4, TPOAb, and TgAb were measured at baseline and after 6 weeks of levothyroxine therapy. Additionally, correlations between tumor markers and thyroid function parameters were analyzed.

Results

Initially, there were no significant differences in CA 19 − 9 and CA 72 − 4 levels between the patient and control groups. Following treatment, a significant decrease in CA 19 − 9 levels was observed in patients who achieved euthyroidism (p = 0.020), whereas no significant change was detected in CA 72 − 4 levels.

Conclusions

CA 19 − 9 and CA 72 − 4 levels do not appear to differ significantly between patients with subclinical hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis and healthy individuals. However, CA 19 − 9 levels may decrease upon restoration of euthyroidism, potentially reflecting a reduction in thyroid-related inflammation. Further studies with larger cohorts and longer follow-up periods are warranted to confirm and clarify these observations.

### Clinical significance of serum carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19–9, and squamous cell carcinoma antigen levels in esophageal cancer patients [^111ZCoQS]. World Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19–9, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) antigen levels were assessed to determine if their levels are useful for staging esophageal cancer preoperatively and for predicting patient survival after esophagectomy. Hence their seropositivity was investigated for a correlation with resectability, clinicopathologic parameters of tumor progression, and treatment outcomes in patients with unresectable esophageal cancer (n = 63) and those undergoing esophagectomy for resectable disease (n = 267). Abnormal elevation of serum SCC antigen levels showed a significant correlation with resectability (p < 0.0001), depth of tumor invasion (p < 0.0001), lymph node status (p = 0.0015), TNM stage (p < 0.0001), lymphatic invasion (p = 0.0019), blood vessel invasion (p = 0.0079), and poor survival after esophagectomy (p = 0.0061). A significant relation (p = 0.0145) was found between elevated serum CEA levels and distant metastasis, whereas the seropositivity of CA 19–9 showed no association with resectability, tumor progression, or patient survival. These results indicate that abnormal elevation of serum SCC antigen is a useful predictor of advanced esophageal cancer associated with poor survival after esophagectomy.

### Elevated serum CA 19–9 at screening tests: underlying conditions and role of abdominopelvic CT [^115pAhZ8]. European Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate underlying conditions of patients with elevated CA 19–9 at screening tests and to evaluate diagnostic performance of abdominopelvic CT.

Methods

One hundred and thirteen patients with elevated CA 19–9 (> 37 U/ml) who underwent abdominopelvic CT in a screening program were selected. Underlying conditions were determined by reviewing all available data and follow-up records. Patients were categorized into malignancy, benign, and normal/non-related disease groups. Their mean CA 19–9 and percent of patients with CA 19–9 ≥ 100 U/ml were compared. Diagnostic sensitivity of CT for detecting underlying conditions of elevated CA 19–9 was analysed.

Results

Seventeen patients (17/113, 15%) had 17 elevated CA 19–9-related malignancies, and 55 patients (55/113, 48.7%) had 70 benign diseases. Mean CA 19–9 and percent of patients with CA 19–9 ≥ 100 U/ml in the malignancy group were significantly higher than in the two other groups. CT detected all except one malignant lesion with a detection sensitivity of 94.1% (16/17). Of 70 CA 19–9-related benign diseases, CT detected 34 benign diseases (48.6%) providing an alternative diagnosis for elevated CA 19–9.

Conclusion

Abdominopelvic CT is not only useful in detecting malignancies, but can also diagnose alternative benign causes of elevated CA 19–9 in asymptomatic screening tests.

Key Points

- Fifteen percent of asymptomatic patients with elevated CA19–9 may have intra-abdominal malignancies.
- Mean value of CA19–9 is different among malignant, benign, and non-related groups.
- CT shows excellent sensitivity for intra-abdominal malignancies as causatives of elevated CA19–9.
- CT provides alternative benign diagnoses as causatives of elevated CA19–9.
- Detection of causatives of elevated CA19–9 using CT alleviates concerns and uncertainty.

### Prognostic value of CA 19–9 levels in patients with inoperable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with gemcitabine [^114Yz1Gq]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

In 82% of the gemcitabine administrations, doses were given on schedule. Dose reduction, mostly related due to haematological toxicity grade 3 during treatment courses, was performed according to the manufacturer's proposals.

Two patients achieved an objective complete remission, and five achieved an objective partial remission (OR = 15.2%). Objective stable disease (⩾2 months) was documented in 19 patients and objective progressive disease in 20 patients. Serum carbohydrate antigen 19–9 serum concentrations were found elevated in 41 (89%) patients. Initial serum concentrations amounted to a median of 384 U l −1 (range 19–9578 U l −1).

The median survival of all patients was 392 days. The median survival of patients with normal CA 19–9 concentrations at baseline was 579 days (95% CI 442–734). Of the 41 patients, 13 (66%) had a biochemical response of CA 19–9 > 20% after 8 weeks of chemotherapy to treatment with gemcitabine and 16 (34%) a progressive rise or a decrease of < 20% (n = 2) of the CA 19–9 concentration. The median overall survival of the 41 patients with increased baseline CA 19–9 concentrations was 281 days (95% CI 223–339 days). However, patients responding with CA 19–9 decrease > 20% had a median survival of 383 days (95% CI 304–462 days), which was significantly longer than the median survival of the patients who did not respond (242 days, 95% CI 214–270 days; P = 0.006, Table 1, Figure 1

results

Clinically relevant time points were examined to specifically assess a potential role in clinical decision making (ie at 3 months post-resection, within 6 months; before adjuvant therapy, and after adjuvant therapy). We initially assessed the value of post-resection CA19.9 in patients who produced CA19.9 (> 5 U/ml) in relation to DSS and subsequently their response to adjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, we examined the potential value of preoperative CA19.9 and the change in level with surgery, with and without adjustment for hyperbilirubinamia.

prognostic value of CA19.9

post-resection CA19.9 and survival

Of the 122 patients with CA19.9 values at or within 3 months of surgery, the majority (114; 93%) had bilirubin levels < 2 mg/dl and did not require CA19.9 adjustment. The post-resection CA19.9 cosegregated with DSS on univariate analysis into three prognostic groups: (i) those with < 37 U/ml had the best outcome, (ii) 37–120 U/ml, an intermediate outcome, and (iii) > 120 U/ml, the worst outcome (median 25.6 versus 20.7 versus 14.8 months, P = 0.0052; Figure 1 A). In the 37–120 U/ml group, the CA19.9 decreased in five patients, normalized in three and increased in five patients at 6 months, suggesting that the intermediate group (37–120 U/ml) consisted of those that had elevated CA19.9 due to other causes as well as residual disease. Those within the normal range (< 37 U/ml) within 6 months of resection had a better outcome (median 29.9 versus 14.8 months; P = 0.0004; Figure 1 B).

### The prognostic and predictive value of serum CA19.9 in pancreatic cancer [^113khfFm]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

prognostic value of CA19.9

Postoperative CA19.9 measurements at 3 months (when hyperbilirubinamia is uncommon) co-segregate into three prognostic groups. The intermediate prognostic group of 37–120 U/ml at that time likely includes a mix of those with progressive disease and other causes of increased CA19.9 levels (biliary dysfunction and pancreatitis). This group declares itself by the 6-month stage to segregate into two prognostic groups dichotomized by the normal reference value (37 U/ml). In addition, a normal level both pre- and postoperatively identifies a group with the best prognosis, which has a 5-year survival of 42%.

The key element of the present study is that potential clinical utility was directly examined by assessing CA19.9 at specific decision-making time points. Overall, although not directly comparable, our findings with regard to the prognostic value of CA19.9 are supported by evidence from retrospective cohorts and in clinical trials. In patients undergoing pancreatic resection for PC, the preoperative CA19.9 value is associated with tumor stage, resectability, risk of recurrence and survival. Even with intercurrent biliary obstruction, which is present in ∼50% of patients, adjustment of CA19.9 levels relative to the degree of hyperbilirubinamia may still have potential prognostic value and further evaluation is encouraged. The postoperative level and the change in CA19.9 have also been correlated with survival and risk of recurrence. Evidence is emerging that post-resection CA19.9 velocity, akin to PSA doubling time in prostate cancer, may be a better predictor of recurrence and survival. In addition, for nonresectable patients, the CA19.9 at the time of diagnosis is also a prognostic factor.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111dx386]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — resectable disease treatment algorithm presents three initial paths: "Surgery in absence of high-risk features (without neoadjuvant therapy)", "Neoadjuvant therapy with or without high-risk features (followed by surgery)", or "Medically inoperable". For the surgery pathway, perform "Surgery (laparotomy or minimally invasive surgery)" and "Consider staging laparoscopy as clinically indicated", with "Adjuvant treatment and Surveillance (PANC-8)" after successful resection and "Unresectable disease at surgery (PANC-7)" if resection is not possible. For the neoadjuvant pathway, obtain "EUS-guided biopsy if not previously done" and "Stent placement if clinically indicated", and imaging may include PET per "For neoadjuvant therapy, consider PET/CT or PET/MRI scan before and after initiation to assess response to systemic therapy and for restaging"; CA 19–9 interpretation is cautioned by "Elevated CA 19–9 does not necessarily indicate cancer or advanced disease". Patients who are "Medically inoperable" are directed to "Locally advanced disease (PANC-5)".

### CA 19–9 response: a surrogate to predict survival in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^113vcNsR]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine the features of carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19–9 decline that correlates best with survival benefit in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

Methods

This is a retrospective study of 225 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving first-line therapy. Analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox-proportional hazards ratios. CA 19–9 decline was grouped into quartiles within different CA 19–9 baseline groups. Time to nadir and CA 19–9 decline at month-2 (M2) of therapy were evaluated for patients with a baseline level ≥ 1000U/mL.

Results

No significant trend in survival was observed across baseline CA 19–9 levels. The greatest survival benefit was seen with a ≥ 75% decline to nadir. Among those with a ≥ 75% decline and baseline ≥ 1000U/mL, 43 of 57 patients had a > 50% decline at M2 of therapy and additional survival benefit was observed with a slower decline to nadir. Small sample sizes limited analysis of other baseline groups. CA 19–9 decline at M2 was not predictive.

Conclusions

In patients with a CA 19–9 ≥ 1000U/mL, serial CA 19–9 levels may be considered as a surrogate for serial imaging to evaluate treatment response, with a ≥ 75% decline indicating the greatest survival benefit. Survival was improved further in the setting of a slower decline to nadir with the highest benefit seen in patients with a nadir occurring at 4 months or longer.

### Clinical utility of the combined use of CA19–9 and DUPAN-2 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^112vLQCu]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

CA19–9 is a monoclonal antibody to the Lewis (a) antigen associated with tumor progression; it is the most commonly used biomarker for PDAC, with a sensitivity of approximately 80%. NCC guidelines recommend CA19–9 in screening, diagnosis, staging, determining resectability, and monitoring therapeutic response. However, CA19–9 is not always useful in patients with PDAC. Approximately 5–10% of patients have a Lewis antigen-negative phenotype and secrete little to no CA19–9. – Regarding the CA19–9 value in Lewis-negative patients with PDAC, it has recently been reported that CA19–9 levels are not always undetectable. Luo et al. reported that 72.6% of Lewis-negative patients had normal CA19–9 levels (< 37 U/mL). However, only 41.9% of the patients had undetectable CA19–9 levels (< 2 U/mL). Therefore, it is difficult to detect Lewis-negative patients among patients with normal CA19–9 levels using only CA19–9 levels; estimating the malignant potential in patients with normal CA19–9 levels also is challenging.

To address this issue, we investigated the clinical utility of the combined use of CA 19–9 and DUPAN-2. DUPAN-2 is a monoclonal antibody to Lewis (c); it is converted to Lewis (a) by α -1–3/4 fucosyltransferase, the Lewis enzyme. This marker has an advantage, which can be used irrespective of the Lewis antigen phenotype. In Lewis-negative patients, CA19–9 levels are typically not elevated; however, DUPAN-2 accumulates in the serum due to the absence of α -1–3/4 fucosyltransferase. Conversely, DUPAN-2 has disadvantages of lower sensitivity and prognostic value compared to CA19–9, leading to the concept of combining both markers in this study.

The investigation of CA19–9 and DUPAN-2 revealed the proportion of patients in each group, the CA19–9 levels in each group, the correlation between CA19–9 and DUPAN-2, and the clinical characteristics and survival period of patients in each group.

### Markedly elevated serum CA 19–9 levels in association with a benign biliary stricture due to primary sclerosing cholangitis [^115KDTEm]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

We report on the case of a 55-year-old man with long-standing ulcerative colitis who developed jaundice. This led to a diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis being made, with a dominant stricture in the common bile duct. Serum CA 19–9 was initially markedly raised at 26,321 U/mL but fell promptly into the normal range after stenting of the stricture. Long-term follow up of this patient has failed to show evidence of cholangiocarcinoma. We conclude that serum CA 19–9 levels need to be assessed in the clinical context of biliary obstruction and should ideally be measured after relief of that obstruction, as it may be falsely elevated due to benign biliary strictures.

### Prognostic value of carbohydrate antigen 19–9 in patients undergoing resection of biliary tract cancer [^112G3BVs]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical significance of abnormally high levels of carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19–9 after resection of biliary tract cancer (BTC) is not well established. The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of CA19–9 normalization in patients undergoing resection of BTC with curative intent.

Methods

Patients with BTC undergoing resection with curative intent (1996–2015) were divided into those with normal preoperative CA19–9 level (normal CA19–9 group), those with an abnormally high preoperative CA19–9 level (over 37units/ml) and normal postoperative CA19–9 level (normalization group), and those with an abnormally high preoperative CA19–9 level and abnormally high postoperative CA19–9 level (non-normalization group). Overall survival (OS) was analysed and predictors of OS were determined.

Results

The normal CA19–9 group (180 patients) and normalization group (74) had better OS than the non-normalization group (58) (3-year OS rate 70·4, 73 and 31 per cent respectively; both P < 0·001). The normal CA19–9 and normalization groups had equivalent OS (P = 0·880). On multivariable analysis, factors associated with worse OS were lymph node metastases (hazard ratio (HR) 1·78; P = 0·014) and abnormally high postoperative CA19–9 level (HR 3·16; P < 0·001). In the normalization group, OS did not differ after R0 versus R1 resection (3-year OS rate 69 versus 62 per cent respectively; P = 0·372); in the non-normalization group, patients with R1 resection had worse OS (3-year OS rate 36 and 20 per cent for R0 and R1 respectively; P = 0·032).

Conclusion

Non-normalization of CA19–9 level after resection of BTC with curative intent was associated with worse OS. R1 resection was associated with a particularly poor prognosis when CA19–9 levels did not normalize.

### Serum CA 19–9 as a marker of resectability and survival in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation [^114wLJrA]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

The AUC for restaging CA 19–9 as a marker of completing all therapy including PD was 0.74 (95% CI 0.64–0.84); the cutoff that maximized both sensitivity (72%) and specificity (69%) of this test was 61 U/ml (Table 3, Fig. 1). Independently, the optimal cutoff of 61 U/ml was associated with an NPV of 49%. The NPV of this cutoff was even lower (28%) when the test was applied only to patients who were considered resectable upon restaging; the test therefore had little power to identify patients with radiographically occult disease progression. The highest restaging CA 19–9 level in patients who underwent potentially curative PD was 934 U/ml (Fig. 3). In contrast, the PPV of the test for completing all therapy including PD was 86% at a cutoff of 61 U/ml; when evaluated only in the 108 patients with evaluable restaging levels and a performance status suitable for surgery and no evidence of disease progression, the PPV was 93%.

Although restaging CA 19–9 at all cutoff levels was a useful prognostic indicator with regard to overall survival, significance was not maintained when only patients who underwent PD were considered.

### CA19–9 as a prognostic factor in inoperable pancreatic cancer: the implication for clinical trials [^114mNceg]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Ensuring an equal balance of prognostic factors between treatment arms in randomised controlled trials is vital. This may be particularly relevant when the clinical benefit of an intervention is likely to be small, as is the case for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. A number of both patient- and disease-related factors have been identified as independent prognostic markers, including PS, sex and the presence of metastases, and are routinely quoted in clinical studies as baseline characteristics. There have also been several reports of various biological markers that may carry some prognostic significance. These include growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor, microsatellite instability, tumour suppression gene expression such as SMAD4 and the expression of mutated genes controlling response to DNA damage, such as GADD45a and p53.

The serum carbohydrate antigen CA19–9 is a tumour-associated antigen that has been shown to be a highly specific and sensitive serum marker for pancreatic cancer. CA19–9 is a sialylated Lewis blood group antigen targeted by the monoclonal antibody 1116 NS 19–9. Previous studies have demonstrated a prognostic role for pretreatment CA19–9 in patients receiving radiotherapy or undergoing pancreatic resection. Although a small number of papers have described a fall in CA19–9 to be an independent prognostic variable for survival, there have been surprisingly few studies investigating the use of baseline CA19–9 in predicting survival for patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer who undergo systemic chemotherapy.reported the survival of 43 consecutive patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with single-agent gemcitabine. In a multivariate analysis, baseline CA19–9 was reported to be an independent prognostic predictor of survival with a relative risk of death 1.4 (95% CI: 1.0–2.0, P = 0.04).published their results in a similar cohort of patients (n = 46). Although they did not report baseline CA19–9 level as a prognostic variable, they did find that a fall of at least 20% in CA19–9 level following the start of chemotherapy was the only independent prognostic marker for OS in their Cox multivariate analysis. An important caveat in the interpretation of CA19–9 levels in pancreatic cancer is the presence of biliary obstruction, which results in the elevation of the marker level. In the current series, however, entry criteria mandated that serum bilirubin should be 30 μ mol l −1 or less, and therefore this potential pitfall was avoided in the interpretation of baseline CA19–9 levels.

### Colon cancer, version 3.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111LcHgu]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Appendiceal neoplasm — clinical presentation and initial evaluation emphasize heightened suspicion when a patient is > 50 years of age with a family history of inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, and/or unexplained anemia; if appendicitis is treated nonoperatively, repeat interval imaging is crucial and lack of resolution may suggest malignancy. Initial diagnostic tests include CT/MRI, endoscopy, tumor biopsy, and in some cases surgery; an appendix > 15 mm on CT or MRI with an irregular or thickened wall is suggestive of appendiceal carcinoma. Colonoscopy is recommended if mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix is diagnosed due to increased risk of colonic polyps and neoplasia. Tumor biomarkers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9) can be used as prognostic indicators for patients receiving cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC); elevated preoperative CA 19–9 was associated with unfavorable progression-free survival (PFS) and elevated CEA with unfavorable overall survival (OS). CA-125 was inconclusive in one study, though other studies suggest normal serum levels of CA-125 and CA 19–9 correspond to increased survival and decreased recurrence; tumor differentiation and classification were the strongest predictors of both PFS and OS.

### The use of adjusted preoperative CA 19–9 to predict the recurrence of resectable pancreatic cancer [^111rkrtj]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the usefulness of CA 19–9 in the diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer, cholestasis can falsely elevate CA 19–9 levels, which contributes to limited clinical utility in patients with biliary obstruction. This study was designed to evaluate the usefulness of adjusted preoperative CA 19–9 levels in predicting a prognosis of pancreatic cancer.

Methods

The available medical records of patients with resected pancreatic cancer from January 1990 to June 2005 were retrospectively viewed at Yonsei Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. The adjusted CA 19–9 value was obtained by dividing the serum CA 19–9 level by the values of serum bilirubin in case of bilirubin greater, similar 2 mg/dL. Disease-free survival was evaluated according to the adjusted preoperative CA 19–9 value.

Results

Sixty-one patients were investigated. Their adjusted preoperative CA 19–9 values were significantly different from the actual baseline CA 19–9 value (129.4 ± 225.2 U/mL, versus 442.1 ± 645.5 U/mL, P < 0.0001). On univariate analysis, peripancreatic microscopic invasion (P = 0.0142), lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.0038), and adjusted preoperative CA 19–9 ≥ 50 U/mL (P = 0.0049) were predictive factors for cancer recurrence after curative resection. Adjusted preoperative CA 19–9 ≥ 50 U/mL (Exp (B) = 2.097, P = 0.027) was an independent predictive factor in multivariate analysis.

Conclusions

The adjusted preoperative CA 19–9 value can predict the risk of recurrence after curative resection of pancreatic cancer. Interpreting the preoperative CA 19–9 value adjusted to the serum bilirubin values seems to be more reasonable in evaluating prognosis of pancreatic cancer.

### Analysis of clinical prognostic factors for survival and time to progression in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy [^111rgvDS]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in adults. Twenty-five percent of patients are not amenable to surgical resection because they have locally advanced or metastatic disease. For these patients, median survival time is between 4 and 13 months, and chemotherapy is used mainly with palliative intent. We conducted this study to evaluate potential prognostic factors for time to progression and survival. A retrospective review of 91 patients with metastatic CRC treated with bolus 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (Mayo Clinic schedule) was performed. Univariate and multivariate analyses of clinical prognostic factors were carried out. Median follow-up time was 53 months (range, 17–107 months). Median time to disease progression was 9.6 months, and median survival time was 15.4 months. Actuarial 5-year survival was 17%. In the univariate analyses, factors predictive of time to progression were visceral metastases, elevated alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels, performance status (PS), and elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19–9 levels. Multivariate analyses confirmed the independent prognostic value of PS and AP levels. In the univariate analyses for survival, significant prognostic factors were visceral metastases, hypoalbuminemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, elevated AP levels, PS, and elevated CEA and CA 19–9 levels. In the multivariate analyses, only PS, elevated CEA and CA 19–9 levels, and liver involvement retained prognostic significance. This study confirms the prognostic value of PS for both time to progression and survival. AP levels are significantly related to time to progression. Additional factors influencing survival time are elevated tumor marker levels and the existence of liver metastases.

### Serum CA 19–9 and CA 72–4 levels in Hashimoto's thyroiditis: a prospective case-control study [^111eKC2h]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease and the leading cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient regions. Both cellular and humoral immune responses play a role in the pathogenesis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Nearly all patients with this condition exhibit elevated serum levels of antibodies to thyroglobulin (TgAb) and thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb). The onset of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is typically attributed to a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. In patients with mild (subclinical) hypothyroidism — characterized by slightly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, normal free thyroxine (T4) concentrations, and the presence of antithyroid antibodies — overt hypothyroidism progresses at a rate of approximately 5% per year.

Tumor markers are commonly used in clinical practice to monitor cancer recurrence and metastasis. Carbohydrate Antigen 19 − 9 (CA 19 − 9) and Carbohydrate Antigen 72 − 4 (CA 72 − 4) are glycoproteins involved in tissue adhesion, and their levels may be elevated in conditions characterized by increased cell turnover and inflammation. CA 19 − 9 is present in the normal epithelial lining of the biliary tract, gastric mucosa, pancreatic duct, and bronchial glands. CA 19 − 9 and CA 72 − 4 are used in the follow-up of various malignancies, including cholangiocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, hepatoma, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and gynecological cancers. They can also be elevated in less common malignancies such as lung cancer, mediastinal teratoma, ovarian cystic teratoma, prostate cancer, transitional cell carcinoma, and thyroid cancer. Additionally, CA 19 − 9 and CA 72 − 4 may be elevated in benign conditions like cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, inflammatory bowel diseases, splenic cysts, pyelonephritis, urethral strictures, hydronephrosis, subacute thyroiditis, thyroid nodules, collagen vascular diseases, and bronchiectasis.

In this study, we aimed to compare the levels of CA 19 − 9 and CA 72 − 4 in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis to those of healthy volunteers, as well as to investigate the impact of oral levothyroxine treatment on these marker levels.

Despite its acceptance as a measure of PC tumor burden, caveats in the interpretation of CA 19.9 values limit application across the full spectrum of PC. First, CA19.9 is a sialylated Lewis a (Le a) antigen. Lewis antigens are normal components of exocrine epithelial secretions present on erythrocyte membranes formed from type I oligosaccharide precursors that undergo sequential addition of monosaccharides by a set of glycosyltransferases and fucosyltransferases. Two independent genes determine the Lewis phenotype: the Lewis gene or α1–4 fucosyltransferase (also known as FUT3) and the secretor gene or α1–2 fucosyltransferase (FUT2). Individuals who lack a functional FUT3 allele are termed Lewis negative (Le a−b−) and are unable to synthesize CA19.9. They comprise 7%–10% of Caucasians, but their incidence is higher in other populations such as Africans (22%). Individuals with at least one functional FUT3 allele are characterized by the red cell phenotype Le a+b− or Le a− b + (rarely Le a+b+). Lack of a functional FUT2 allele leads to the non-secretor phenotype (se/se), which is characterized by the absence of ABH determinants in saliva and on some epithelial cell types. Non-secretors in general have higher serum and urine CA19.9 levels than secretors. Second, CA 19.9 can also be elevated in benign pancreatic diseases such as pancreatitis, which often coexist with PC. Third, CA19.9 undergoes some degree of biliary excretion and is produced by biliary epithelial cells. Therefore, in the setting of cholestasis, CA19.9 levels are frequently elevated even in benign conditions.

### The role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of patients with solid pancreatic neoplasia [^111UTvti]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — clinical presentation and biomarkers: "Most patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head present with obstructive jaundice". Laboratory abnormalities may signal obstruction as "Elevations in routine or diagnostic liver enzyme testing, especially increased levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, may lead to a diagnosis of cholestasis due to biliary obstruction localized to the head of the pancreas". In contrast, "patients with pancreatic malignancy in the body and tail typically present with more advanced-stage disease and normal liver biochemistry results because of the absence of biliary obstruction", and "Symptoms generally do not occur until advanced disease is present among patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma involving the body or tail". For serum markers, "CA19–9 levels are elevated in the peripheral blood of the majority of patients with pancreatic cancer, but this finding does not achieve the performance required for either early detection or diagnosis, because of the potential for both false positive and false negative results". Nonetheless, "CA 19–9 is the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved biomarker recommended for use in the routine management of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma" and "It has been used for prognosis and as a marker of disease burden (ie, recurrence or disease progression)".

### Cancer antigens 19–9 and 125 in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic mass lesions… [^116CExsS]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of serum CA 19–9 and CA 125 measurements in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic tumors. In patients with confirmed pancreatic carcinoma, the CA 19–9 level exceeded the cutoff level of 37 U/mL in the majority of 73 cases. However, in the remaining 14 patients with pancreatic carcinoma, the CA 19–9 level was lower than or approximately 37 U/mL. A CA 19–9 level higher than 500 U/mL was found in 29 of 73 patients with confirmed pancreatic carcinoma, and in 23 of those 29 patients, advanced neoplastic disease with distant metastases, extensive lymph node involvement, or massive local infiltration was demonstrated. In this group of patients, no false-positive results were found. In patients with benign pancreatic tumors, the CA 19–9 level ranged between 0 and 150 U/mL. In the majority of these 37 patients, the CA 19–9 values were low and ranged between 0 and 37 U/mL.

The marker level exceeded the cutoff value in 4 patients with benign pancreatic tumors. The CA 125 levels ranged between 3 and 540 U/mL. The cutoff level was established as 35 U/mL. A level of CA 125 exceeding the cutoff level was found in 45 patients with malignant pancreatic tumors. The higher number of results indicating a malignant nature of the tumor demonstrated in the CA 19–9 evaluation suggests its higher reliability. The detailed distribution of the CA 125 level is shown in Figure 2. However, a CA 19–9 level lower than 370 U/mL indicated a higher probability of operability of the lesion and survival longer than 10 months. The CA 19–9 level tends to increase from stage I to stage IV of a tumor and is higher in patients with resectable tumors than in patients with unresectable tumors. In all of them, the CA 19–9 level was higher than 100 U/mL.

Pancreatic carcinoma was regarded to be resectable in all of the patients with a CA 19–9 level between 3 and 98 U/mL.

### Definition of CA 19–9 assay-NCI dictionary of cancer terms… [^113r2CvK]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

CA 19–9 assayListen to pronunciationA laboratory test that measures the level of CA 19–9 in the blood. CA 19–9 is a substance released into the blood by both cancer cells and normal cells. Higher than normal amounts of CA 19–9 in the blood can be a sign of pancreatic or other types of cancer or other conditions. The amount of CA 19–9 in the blood can be used to help keep track of how well cancer treatments are working or if cancer has come back. CA 19–9 is a type of tumor marker.

### The serum tumour marker Ca19–9 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [^1176AgSk]. ASCO (2015). Low credibility.

Abstract e18535 Background: Ca 19–9 is present in the glands of bronchi & bronchioles, so it is plausible that this serum tumor marker may increase in NSCLC. Aim: To evaluate the incidence & significance of high serum Ca19–9 values and to correlate with 6 other well-known STMs in NSCLC pts. Results: Ca 19–9 > 70 U/ml was recorded in 41pts, median age 63ys, ECOG 1, stages I-IIIA, IIIb & IV, 10, 5 & 26 pts respectively. Ca19. 9 > 1000U/ml found in 8 pts. The median serum values of Ca 19–9 were 343 for the total group & 130, 424 & 520 U/ml for pts with stages I-IIIA, IIIB and IV, respectively. All the pts were reevaluated after at least three courses of chemotherapy with Carbo + Taxol ± Bev ± locoregional RT. CR, PR & SD was documented in 4/10, PR & SD 13/31 & PD 18/31.

In the pts with CR & PR a significant reduction of Ca19. 9 was documented. No response or disease stability was observed in the 8 pts with initial value of Ca 19–9 > 1000 U/ml. Patients with early disease progression had CA 19–9 ≥ 343U/mL. Conclusions: 1) A strong association of high serum Ca19. 9 & disease extension was stated. 2) Patients with Ca 19–9 > 1000 U/ml had a bad outcome after chemotherapy. 3) A powerful association in high serum Ca 19–9 with known STMs in NSCLC was documented. 4) Tissue Ca19–9 staining should be checked in NSCLC pts with high Ca19–9 serum values. 5) A significant correlation of increased serum Ca 19–9 values & outcome was recorded.

### Can CA 19–9 predict inferior surgical and pathological outcomes for resectable pancreatic cancer? [^111ja2gu]. ASCO (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract e16228 Background: Previous data have established that patients with pancreatic surgical specimens showing lymphovascular invasion and positive surgical resection margins are associated with poor survival outcomes. However, there are no biomarkers to identify these high-risk patients preoperatively. In this study, we hypothesized that increased carbohydrate antigen 19–9 levels could be used to predict high-risk resectable pancreatic cancer features, including LVI and positive residual margins, thereby guiding the surgical decision-making process. Methods: We sampled the National Cancer Database for patients undergoing pancreatic cancer resection between 2004–2018. Logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze sociodemographic and disease characteristics associated with elevated CA 19–9 levels versus low CA 19–9 levels.

Additionally, Cox regression analyses were used to compare hazard ratios for demographic and disease characteristics. A p < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: 12208 patients with pancreatic cancer were sampled. Pathological findings of LVI, microscopic residual tumor margins, and residual margins, not otherwise specified had a stronger association with high preoperative CA 19–9 levels when compared to those. Macroscopic residual margins were also associated with high CA 19–9 but statistically not significant probably due to the low sample size for this subpopulation. Furthermore, all the factors listed below were independently associated with poor prognosis: Elevated CA 19–9 levels: HR 1. 411, 95% CI

1. 350–1. 475, p <
0. **001, LVI**: HR 1. 333,
95.

Conclusions: Elevated CA 19–9 can be used as a biomarker to identify a subset of pancreatic cancer patients with high-risk surgical pathological features such as LVI or residual tumor margins. In these patients, perhaps neoadjuvant chemotherapy can facilitate downstaging and provide superior surgical and oncological outcomes.
