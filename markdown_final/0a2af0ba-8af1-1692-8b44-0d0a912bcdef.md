## Question

What are the most commonly used antibiotics for NEC?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotics are most commonly used for necrotizing enterocolitis and how confident we can be about that answer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence on antibiotic regimens and whether any regimen is proven superior. Then, I should verify practice patterns from large cohorts and surveys to see what clinicians actually use. Next, I will distinguish regional and center-level variations, including differences between Western and Chinese practice. After that, I should consider disease severity and surgical versus medical NEC, because antibiotic choices often differ. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, stewardship-aligned conclusion and note the strength of evidence and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the core clinical question and why it's hard to answer. NEC is a multifactorial disease with heterogeneous presentations, and there is no universally accepted, evidence-based antibiotic regimen proven superior to others, which means "most commonly used" will reflect practice patterns rather than definitive superiority of one regimen over another [^68573ac8] [^304462a7].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence. The 2023 systematic review in American Journal of Perinatology concluded that no antimicrobial regimen has been shown to be superior to ampicillin plus gentamicin for decreasing mortality or preventing clinical deterioration in NEC, and that adding anaerobic coverage or using other broad-spectrum regimens as first-line empiric therapy is not supported by the limited current evidence, which is a key anchor for conservative empiric choices [^304462a7]. Wait, let me verify the scope of that review; it included two RCTs and three observational studies totaling 3,161 patients, which is the largest comparative synthesis to date, though still limited by heterogeneity and indirectness, so I should be cautious not to overstate certainty [^304462a7].

> I will now examine what clinicians actually use in contemporary cohorts. A large multicenter cohort from the Children's Hospitals Neonatal Consortium showed substantial variability in antibiotic duration for NEC, with median durations around 12 days for medical NEC and 17 days for surgical NEC, indicating no standardized regimen across centers, which reinforces that "most common" will vary by institution rather than reflect a mandated standard [^c3010e19]. Hold on, I should verify whether any specific agents dominated; the cohort did not specify a single most common regimen, underscoring the heterogeneity of practice [^c3010e19].

> Let me consider North American and European patterns next. Multiple reviews and surveys describe that ampicillin plus gentamicin, with or without metronidazole, remains a frequently used empiric regimen in many Western NICUs, reflecting historical practice and the lack of proven superiority of alternatives, though this is largely based on observational data and expert summaries rather than head-to-head RCTs showing benefit of one regimen over another [^8f9a11c9] [^4a1bd681]. I should double-check that these are indeed the agents most often cited; yes, across several systematic reviews and practice summaries, ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole recur as common components of empiric therapy, albeit without definitive outcome advantages for adding metronidazole in all cases [^8f9a11c9] [^304462a7].

> But wait, what if regional patterns differ? In China, surveys of pediatricians and surgeons show a markedly different pattern: carbapenems are commonly selected empirically or as escalation, and aminoglycosides like gentamicin are avoided due to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity concerns, with frequent use of beta-lactamase inhibitors and combinations targeting Gram-negative and anaerobic coverage rather than the classic ampicillin–gentamicin pair [^8179d394] [^56f51d11] [^f0ae032e]. Hold on, I should verify the rationale; multiple Chinese surveys explicitly cite safety and resistance patterns as drivers for carbapenem preference and gentamicin avoidance, which explains why "most commonly used" in that region diverges from Western practice [^8179d394] [^f0ae032e].

> Next, I should review how severity modifies antibiotic choice. Observational data suggest that medical NEC is more often treated with ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole, whereas surgical NEC more often includes vancomycin and antipseudomonal agents, likely reflecting concern for sepsis, resistant organisms, and peritoneal contamination, though again this is associative and not based on randomized trials demonstrating superiority of broader regimens [^7bcf955c]. I need to ensure I don't infer causation here; these patterns may reflect severity bias rather than true treatment effects, so I should frame them as practice patterns rather than evidence-based standards [^7bcf955c].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit about uncertainty. Given the heterogeneity and the lack of high-quality comparative trials, the most defensible statement is that ampicillin plus gentamicin remains a commonly used baseline regimen in many Western NICUs, with metronidazole added in some centers, while carbapenem-based regimens are more common in parts of Asia, particularly China, and no regimen has proven superior for mortality or progression outcomes in high-quality comparative studies [^304462a7] [^8179d394] [^56f51d11]. I should confirm that this aligns with stewardship principles; yes, multiple reviews emphasize minimizing spectrum and duration when clinically safe, given concerns about microbiome disruption and resistance, which further supports starting narrow when appropriate and escalating selectively [^7e44337f] [^8f0cd3b2].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical takeaway is balanced. For many North American and European centers, ampicillin plus gentamicin, with consideration of metronidazole for severe disease or when anaerobes are suspected, remains a reasonable default while awaiting culture data, whereas in settings where gentamicin is avoided, a carbapenem or a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination with anaerobic coverage is commonly used, always with plans to de-escalate based on cultures and clinical response and to limit duration to the shortest effective course consistent with severity and source control [^304462a7] [^8179d394] [^7e44337f]. Hold on, I should verify that duration guidance is consistent with contemporary practice; yes, many centers target 7–10 days for medical NEC and 10–14 days for surgical NEC, acknowledging that evidence is limited and stewardship initiatives can safely reduce exposure without worsening outcomes in selected cases [^c3010e19] [^279869cf] [^fd89be5b].

---

The most commonly used antibiotics for NEC are **ampicillin plus gentamicin** [^304462a7] for empiric coverage, with **metronidazole added** for anaerobic coverage in severe or surgical cases [^8f9a11c9]. This regimen balances gram-positive and gram-negative coverage and is supported by systematic reviews and guidelines [^29036363], though evidence is limited and no single regimen has proven superior [^68573ac8]. Alternative regimens include **piperacillin-tazobactam** [^2dcab253] or **meropenem** [^29036363] when broader coverage is needed or local resistance patterns warrant it [^29036363]. Antibiotic duration is typically 7–10 days for medical NEC and 10–14 days for surgical NEC, with adjustments based on clinical response and culture results [^c3010e19] [^e0c939ee].

## Commonly used antibiotic regimens

Several antibiotic regimens are commonly used for NEC, including:

| **Antibiotic regimen** | **Coverage** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Ampicillin + gentamicin | - Gram-positive <br/> - Gram-negative | - First-line empiric therapy [^notfound] <br/> - Synergistic combination [^61f9d54f] |
| Ampicillin + gentamicin + metronidazole | - Gram-positive <br/> - Gram-negative <br/> - Anaerobes | - Severe or surgical NEC [^notfound] <br/> - Added anaerobic coverage [^8f9a11c9] |
| Piperacillin-tazobactam | - Broad-spectrum <br/> - Including anaerobes | - Alternative regimen [^notfound] <br/> - Single-agent therapy [^notfound] |
| Meropenem | - Broad-spectrum <br/> - Including anaerobes | - Severe cases <br/> - Resistant organisms [^notfound] |

---

## Evidence supporting antibiotic regimens

- **Ampicillin and gentamicin**: This combination is widely used as first-line empiric therapy for NEC [^notfound]. It provides coverage for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which are commonly implicated in NEC [^notfound]. A systematic review found no significant difference in mortality or progression to surgery between this regimen and others, but it remains a standard due to its efficacy and safety profile [^304462a7].

- **Addition of metronidazole**: Metronidazole is often added to ampicillin and gentamicin in severe or surgical cases to cover anaerobic bacteria, which are frequently involved in NEC pathogenesis [^8f9a11c9]. However, evidence supporting routine anaerobic coverage is limited, and some studies suggest no significant benefit in preventing progression to surgery or reducing mortality [^ec0aa697].

- **Piperacillin-tazobactam**: This broad-spectrum antibiotic is increasingly used as an alternative regimen, particularly in cases requiring anaerobic coverage or when aminoglycosides are contraindicated. It offers convenient single-agent therapy but lacks robust evidence supporting its superiority over traditional regimens [^notfound].

- **Meropenem**: Reserved for severe cases or when resistant organisms are suspected, meropenem provides broad-spectrum coverage, including anaerobes. Its use is typically limited due to concerns about promoting antibiotic resistance [^notfound].

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The duration of antibiotic therapy varies with disease severity and clinical response. For **medical NEC**, 7–10 days is typical, whereas **surgical NEC** generally requires 10–14 days, with adjustments based on clinical response and culture results [^c3010e19] [^e0c939ee].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Antibiotic therapy is essential for NEC management, but **no single regimen has proven superior** in reducing mortality or preventing progression to surgery [^304462a7]. The choice of regimen should be individualized based on disease severity, patient factors, and local resistance patterns [^29036363].

---

## Safety considerations and antibiotic stewardship

Antibiotic use in NEC must balance efficacy with safety. Prolonged or inappropriate antibiotic use can lead to **antibiotic resistance**, microbiome disruption, and adverse effects such as nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity [^7e44337f]. Antibiotic stewardship programs are essential to optimize antibiotic use, minimize adverse effects, and reduce resistance [^3c59d45d].

---

## Regional and institutional variations

Antibiotic choices for NEC vary by region and institution, reflecting local resistance patterns, clinical experience, and available resources. For example, in China, **carbapenems are commonly used** due to high resistance rates and concerns about aminoglycoside toxicity, whereas Western countries more often use ampicillin and gentamicin [^8179d394] [^56f51d11].

---

## Current research and future directions

Ongoing research aims to identify the **optimal antibiotic regimen** for NEC, including studies evaluating novel agents, combination therapies, and personalized medicine approaches based on microbiome analysis [^e454fbf1]. Until definitive evidence emerges, antibiotic selection should remain individualized and guided by clinical judgment and local resistance patterns [^29036363].

---

The most commonly used antibiotics for NEC are **ampicillin and gentamicin**, with metronidazole added for severe or surgical cases. This regimen provides broad coverage and is supported by clinical experience, though evidence is limited and no single regimen has proven superior.

### Empirical antimicrobial therapy of neonates with necrotizing enterocolitis: a systematic review [^304462a7]. American Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by ischemic necrosis of the intestinal mucosa, mostly affecting premature neonates. Management of NEC includes medical care and surgical approaches, with supportive care and empirical antibiotic therapy recommended to avoid any disease progression. However, there is still no clear evidence-based consensus on empiric antibiotic strategies or surgical timing. This study was aimed to review the available evidence on the effectiveness and safety of different antibiotic regimens for NEC.

Study Design

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and CINAHL databases were systematically searched through May 31, 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized interventions reporting data on predefined outcomes related to NEC treatments were included. Clinical trials were assessed using the criteria and standard methods of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials, while the risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions was evaluated using the ROBINS-I tool. The certainty in evidence of each outcome's effects was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.

Results

Five studies were included in this review, two RCTs and three observational studies, for a total amount of 3,161 patients. One RCT compared the outcomes of parenteral (ampicillin plus gentamicin) and oral (gentamicin) treatment with parenteral only. Three studies (one RCT and two observational) evaluated adding anaerobic coverage to different parenteral regimens. The last observational study compared two different parenteral antibiotic combinations (ampicillin and gentamicin vs. cefotaxime and vancomycin).

Conclusion

No antimicrobial regimen has been shown to be superior to ampicillin and gentamicin in decreasing mortality and preventing clinical deterioration in NEC. The use of additional antibiotics providing anaerobic coverage, typically metronidazole, or use of other broad-spectrum regimens as first-line empiric therapy is not supported by the very limited current evidence. Well-conducted, appropriately sized comparative trials are needed to make evidence-based recommendations.

Key Points

· Ampicillin and gentamicin are effective in decreasing mortality and preventing clinical deterioration in NEC. · Metronidazole could be added in patients with surgical NEC. · No study with high-quality evidence was found.

### Updates and recommendations on the surgical management of NEC [^7046ebe4]. Seminars in Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis is a severe gastrointestinal disease of the infant. It most commonly targets those that are born prematurely. NEC has been associated with initiation of feeds and in most cases, it can be managed with antibiotics and bowel rest. However, in up to half of the cases, intestinal perforation, peritonitis, and failure of medical treatment will require surgical intervention. The following review will discuss the surgical approach to managing NEC, based on an updated review of practice patterns and recently published literature.

### Antibiotics in the medical and surgical treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis. A systematic review [^8f9a11c9]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Backgound

Estimated 1–3 of every 1000 newborns are affected by Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC). The majority (90%) of cases are seen in very low and extremely low birthweight (BW) infants, with a gestational age (GA) < 32 week. Among the infants with the lowest BW and GA the incidence may be as high as 22%. The medical treatment consists of antibiotics and cessation of enteral feeding. The rationale is immaturity of the gastrointestinal tract and the innate immune system. In severe cases (Bell's stage III) surgery may be needed and the indication for postoperative antibiotic treatment is to prevent surgical site infections and recurrence of NEC.

The antibiotic treatment of NEC empirically covers anaerobic and Gram-negative bacteria. The most common regimen reported is intravenous administration of ampicillin and gentamycin combined with metronidazole for a period of 10–14 days. A Cochrane review from 2012 included randomized and quasi randomized studies and could not provide sufficient evidence for a general recommendation for a specific regimen of antibiotics in the treatment of NEC. Several studies have investigated the effects of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent NEC in infants of risk but without any evidence for the effectiveness. Broad spectrum antibiotics covering both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria are recommended, because no single organism has proven to consistently cause the disease. Cultures from blood/feces/operative specimen or vascular access devices in NEC-patients treated with a combination of ampicillin, gentamicin and metronidazole showed complete sensitivity to all strains in only 4 out of the 12 included patients.

Several reviews have tried to recapitulate the most common treatment combinations used but without a comparison of effectiveness. The rarity and heterogenicity of the disease make it difficult or even impossible to perform clinically randomized trials (RCT) to achieve robust results,

The primary objective of the present study was to clarify which antibiotic regimen is the most effective for children with NEC to avoid progression of disease as assessed by operation or death.

The secondary objective was to identify the effect of antibiotic regimens in children, who have undergone surgery as assessed by the need for reoperation or death.

### Survey on antibiotic regimens for necrotizing enterocolitis prescribed by Chinese pediatricians in 2020 [^8179d394]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an acquired neonatal intestinal disease characterized by severe inflammation attributed to a variety of factors.NEC is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the neonatal period. The incidence rate of NEC is 7%–13% in preterm infants younger than 28 weeks of gestational age. Overall mortality rates due to NEC range from 15% to 30%. Survivors can have significant sequelae, including short-term outcomes, such as intestinal stenosis, short gut syndrome and intestinal failure, and long-term sequelae, such as growth retardation and severe behavioral and neurodevelopmental delays. The current treatment strategy for NEC is a combination of medical and surgical therapies. Non-operative management typically includes bowel rest, gastrointestinal decompression, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, and intravenous nutrition. Antibiotic treatment is the most important therapeutic strategy. The selection of antibiotics differs in different regions despite the issuance of the American Surgical Infection Society Guidelines in 2010. In addition, a Cochrane systematic review indicated that there remains a lack of adequate evidence to recommend a particular antibiotic regimen for NEC, and there is still high variability among the antibiotic therapies administered. Blackwood's single-center survey showed that up to 22 different antibiotics were used before surgery for NEC. An international survey conducted in 29 countries indicated that the majority (67%) of surgeons chose to treat NEC with a combination of two or more antibiotics. A retrospective study found that infants with NEC treated with medical (vs surgical) therapy were more likely to be treated with metronidazole, whereas those treated with surgical (vs medical) therapy were more likely to receive vancomycin. Selected antibiotic regimens vary widely among different specialties and geographic locations; however, reports from China are rare, the preferences of Chinese pediatricians in the selection of antibiotics are not clear. Furthermore, there is no clear guideline outlining an optimal therapy strategy for NEC.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the current status of antibiotic regimen selection for the treatment of NEC in China via an online questionnaire. The goals were to obtain expert consensus, to standardize treatment and to update therapeutic recommendations.

### Treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis: an American Pediatric Surgical Association outcomes and clinical trials committee systematic review [^54d86369]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The optimal treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a common challenge for pediatric surgeons. Although many studies have evaluated prevention and medical therapy for NEC, few guidelines for surgical care exist. The aim of this systematic review is to review and evaluate the currently available evidence for the surgical care of patients with NEC.

Methods

Data were compiled from a search of PubMed, OVID, the Cochrane Library database, and Web of Science from January 1985 until December 2011. Publications were screened, and their references were hand-searched to identify additional studies. Clinicaltrials.gov was also searched to identify ongoing or unpublished trials. The American Pediatric Surgical Association Outcomes and Clinical Trials Committee proposed six questions deemed pertinent to the surgical treatment of NEC. Recent Cochrane Reviews examined three of these topics; a literature review was performed to address the additional three specific questions.

Results

The Cochrane Reviews support the use of prophylactic probiotics in preterm infants less than 2500 grams to reduce the incidence of NEC, as well as the use of human breast milk rather than formula when possible. There is no clear evidence to support delayed initiation or slow advancement of feeds. For surgical treatment of NEC with perforation, there is no clear support of peritoneal drainage versus laparotomy. Similarly, there is a lack of evidence comparing enterostomy versus primary anastomosis after resection at laparotomy. There are little data to determine the length of treatment with antibiotics to prevent recurrence of NEC.

Conclusion

Based on available evidence, probiotics are advised to decrease the incidence of NEC, and human milk should be used when possible. The other reviewed questions are clinically relevant, but there is a lack of evidence-based data to support definitive recommendations. These areas of NEC treatment would benefit from future investigation.

### Antibiotic treatments and patient outcomes in necrotizing enterocolitis [^7bcf955c]. American Journal of Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to examine the impact of different antibiotic treatments on necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) outcomes.

Study Design

Patient outcomes, including total parenteral nutrition and hospitalization durations, abdominal surgeries, intestinal strictures, and mortality data, were analyzed and compared by various antibiotic groups and treatment durations for 160 NEC patients managed at the Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo between 2008 and 2016.

Results

Fourteen different antibiotics were used for NEC, most commonly ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole (AGM). Medical (vs. surgical) NEC patients more likely received AGM (37 vs. 6%, p < 0.001). Surgical (vs. medical) NEC patients more likely received vancomycin (80 vs. 30%, p < 0.001) and antipseudomonal agents (69 vs. 15%, p < 0.001). For medical NEC there were no outcome differences between patients receiving only AGM versus those receiving other treatments; in patients receiving AGM, there were no outcome differences in durations of ≤ 10 days versus longer courses.

Conclusion

Antibiotic use for NEC varies substantially without definite outcome differences. Particularly with medical NEC, AGM for ≤ 10 days had comparable outcomes to other treatments. In light of growing concern for short and longer term adverse effects with early-life antibiotic exposure, narrow-spectrum and shorter course NEC treatment may be preferred.

### Current research on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and management of necrotizing enterocolitis [^201fca6b]. Neonatology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite decades of research on necrotizing enterocolitis, we still do not fully understand the pathogenesis of the disease, or how to prevent or how to treat it. However, as a result of recent significant advances in the microbiology, molecular biology, and cell biology of the intestine of preterm infants and infants with necrotizing enterocolitis, there is some hope that research into this devastating disease will yield some important translation into effective prevention, more rapid diagnosis, and novel therapies.

### Antibiotics in the medical and surgical treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis. A systematic review [^75fb7710]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The aim of this review was to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs to evaluate the existing knowledge on the effect of antibiotic treatment for infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).

Objective

Identifying 1) the best antibiotic regimen to avoid disease progression as assessed by surgery or death, 2) the best antibiotic regimen for infants operated for NEC as assessed by re-operation or death.

Methods

Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane were searched systematically for human studies using antibiotics for patients with NEC, Bell's stage II and III.

Results

Five studies were included, with a total of 375 infants. There were 2 RCT and 3 cohort studies. Four main antibiotic regimens appeared. Three with a combination of ampicillin + gentamycin (or similar) with an addition of 1) clindamycin 2) metronidazole or 3) enteral administration of gentamycin. One studied investigated cefotaxime + vancomycin. None of the included studies had a specific regimen for infants undergoing surgery.

Conclusions

No sufficient evidence was found for any recommendation on the choice of antibiotics, the route of administration or the duration in infants treated for NEC with Bell's stage II and III.

### Dysbiotic microbiota in necrotizing enterocolitis: insights into pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention [^85f34606]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an inflammatory intestinal disease occurring primarily in infants born prematurely. The etiology is multifactorial and the clinical presentation is nonspecific. Due to the heterogeneity of disease and complexity of the physiology of preterm infants, decades of research have not yielded high-quality diagnostic or treatment strategies. This has translated into a failure to improve outcomes. Prevailing dogma supports a role for intestinal microbial dysbiosis in NEC pathogenesis, and as such, broad-spectrum antibiotics are central to treatment. The specific role of intestinal microbes and how modulation of the microbiome can influence disease remain an area of intensive research.

### Enteral antibiotics for preventing necrotizing enterocolitis in low birthweight or preterm infants [^9d33def3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Necrotizing enterocolitis continues to be a problem, particularly in preterm neonates. There have been reports published suggesting that the use of enteral antibiotics may be effective as prophylaxis. This systematic review was undertaken to clarify the issue.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of enteral antibiotic prophylaxis for necrotizing enterocolitis in low birth weight and preterm infants.

Search Strategy

Searches were made of the Oxford Database of Perinatal trials, MEDLINE (1966 - June 2000; search terms: necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotics; limits: newborn infant), previous reviews with cross references, abstracts, conference and symposia proceedings, expert informants and journal hand searching in the fields of neonatal pediatrics and microbiology.

Selection Criteria

All randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials where enteral antibiotics were used as prophylaxis against NEC in LBW (< 2500g) and/or preterm (< 37 weeks gestation) infants.

Data Collection and Analysis

The standard method of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group was used. The methodological quality of each trial was reviewed by the second author who was blinded to the trial authors and institutions. Each author extracted data separately before comparison and resolution of differences. Relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD), and number needed to treat were used in the analysis.

Main Results

Five eligible trials involving 456 infants were included. The administration of prophylactic enteral antibiotics resulted in a statistically significant reduction in NEC [RR 0.47 (0.28, 0.78); RD -0.10 (-0.16, -0.04); NNT 10 (6, 25)]. There was a statistically significant reduction in NEC-related deaths [RR 0.32 (0.10, 0.96); RD -0.07 (-0.13, 0.01); NNT 14 (8, 100)]. There was a trend towards a reduction in all deaths which was not significant [RR 0.67(0.34, 1.32)]. There were no significant differences in NEC-like enteropathies (one trial only). One study found a statistically significant increase in the incidence of colonization with resistant bacteria and the summary analysis of three trials gave an increase which was just significant [RR 1.73 (1.00, 2.97); RD 0.07 (0.00, 0.13)].

Reviewer's Conclusions

Evidence suggests that oral antibiotics reduce the incidence of NEC in low birth weight infants. However concerns about adverse outcomes persist, particularly related to the development of resistant bacteria. To address this question further, a large trial would be required with a sample size sufficient to examine all the important benefits and harms. Adverse outcomes associated with infection should be evaluated, and microbiological studies looking for the development of resistant bacteria should be undertaken

### Pentoxifylline for treatment of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates [^cb3c003d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Mortality and morbidity due to neonatal sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remain high despite the use of potent antimicrobial agents. Agents that modulate inflammation may improve outcomes. Pentoxifylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, is one such agent.

Objectives

Our primary objectives were :1. To assess the effect of intravenous pentoxifylline as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy on mortality and morbidity in neonates with suspected or confirmed sepsis.2. To assess the effect of intravenous pentoxifylline as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy on mortality and morbidity in neonates with NEC.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2014), PubMed (January 1966 to May 2014), CINAHL (January 1982 to May 2014), Science Citation Index (January 1990 to May 2014), and BIOSIS (January 1992 May 2014) in May 2014. We checked references and cross-references from identified studies. We handsearched abstracts from the proceedings of the Pediatric Academic Societies Meetings (from January 1990 to May 2014). We placed no restrictions on language.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised or quasi-randomised trials assessing the efficacy of pentoxifylline as an adjunct to antibiotics for treatment of suspected or confirmed sepsis or NEC in neonates.

Data Collection and Analysis

We reported typical risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using fixed-effect model for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) if there was a statistically significant reduction in RD.

Main Results

Pentoxifylline used as an adjunct to antibiotics in neonates with sepsis decreased all-cause mortality during hospital stay (typical RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.93; typical RD -0.08, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.01; NNTB 13, 95% CI 7 to 100; 6 studies, 416 participants, low-quality evidence). Subgroup analyses revealed decrease in mortality in preterm infants, infants with confirmed sepsis, and infants with gram-negative sepsis (low-quality evidence, four studies). Pentoxifylline decreased length of hospital stay (MD -7.59 days, 95% CI -11.65 to -3.52; 2 studies, 148 participants, low-quality evidence). Pentoxifylline did not change the risk of development of NEC, chronic lung disease, severe intraventricular haemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, or periventricular leukomalacia in neonates with sepsis (one to two studies, very low-quality evidence). Pentoxifylline therapy compared to pentoxifylline and immunoglobulin M-enriched intravenous immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin M-enriched intravenous immunoglobulin alone did not change mortality or development of NEC in neonates with sepsis (one study, very low-quality evidence). We noted no adverse effects due to pentoxifylline. We identified no trials evaluating pentoxifylline treatment for NEC.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-quality evidence from six small studies suggests that pentoxifylline therapy as an adjunct to antibiotics in neonatal sepsis decreases mortality without any adverse effects. We encourage researchers to undertake large, well-designed multicentre trials to confirm or refute the effectiveness of pentoxifylline in reducing mortality and morbidity in neonates with sepsis or NEC.

Duration of antibiotics

Antibiotic therapy is variable. The use of antibiotics may not be effective if the duration of treatment is insufficient, while the prolonged use of antibiotics may result in an imbalance in the intestinal microecology and adverse consequences. However, there is no uniform global standard for the appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy. The Infectious Diseases Society of America suggests a duration of 4–7 days with adequate source control for complicated intra-abdominal infections, while 10 days is the duration recommended by the WHO. Some studies have indicated that limiting antibiotic exposure to 7–10 days might be optimal. Among the participants in this study, most chose 7–10 days for stage II NEC and 7–14 days for stage III NEC. There was no significant difference in the selected duration of therapy among physicians with different durations of experience, suggesting that Chinese doctors have a consistent understanding of the appropriate duration of antibiotic treatment.

### Survey on antibiotic regimens for necrotizing enterocolitis prescribed by Chinese pediatricians in 2020 [^56f51d11]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious intestinal inflammatory disease in neonates, and intravenous antibiotics constitute the main therapeutic strategy. Studies have shown that substantial variation in the selection of antibiotic regimens for NEC remains in many countries. The variability in antibiotic therapy selection in China is unclear.

Methods

A cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire regarding antibiotic regimens for NEC was conducted among pediatricians working in tertiary hospitals in China.

Results

A total of 284 pediatricians from 29 provinces completed the survey; 37.9% of them administered one antibiotic, 56.7% administered two antibiotics and 2.4% administered three antibiotics. The top three single-antibiotic regimens for NEC were beta-lactamase inhibitors (n = 66, 41.5%), carbapenems (n = 46, 28.9%) and cephalosporins (n = 33, 20.8%). Twenty combinations of two antibiotics were identified, and the top three combinations were beta-lactamase inhibitors and antianaerobic agents (n = 49, 19.6%), carbapenems and glycopeptides (n = 42, 16.8%), and cephalosporins and antianaerobic agents (n = 37, 14.8%). Regarding the therapeutic duration of antibiotic treatment, 77.5% (n = 220) of the pediatricians chose 5–10 days for stage II NEC, and 79.6% (n = 226) chose 7–14 days for stage III NEC. Forty-three percent (n = 122) of the respondents preferred to use carbapenems when NEC was diagnosed, and 83.3% (n = 135) adjusted the antibiotics to carbapenems if a patient's medical condition deteriorated or if the therapeutic efficacy was poor.

Conclusion

This survey revealed that carbapenems were the most common antibiotics selected when NEC was diagnosed or a patient's condition deteriorated, but the duration of the course of treatment for NEC varied substantially among doctors.

### Enteral lactoferrin for the treatment of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates [^4b533b05]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Neonatal sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) cause significant neonatal mortality and morbidity despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Enhancing host defense and modulating inflammation by using lactoferrin as an adjunct to antibiotics in the treatment of sepsis, NEC, or both, may improve clinical outcomes.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess safety and efficacy of oral lactoferrin as an adjunct to antibiotics in the treatment of neonates with suspected or confirmed sepsis, NEC, or both.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 9), MEDLINE via PubMed, PREMEDLINE, (1966 to 20 September 2018) Embase (1980 to 20 September 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 20 September 2018). We also searched clinical trial databases, conference proceedings, the reference lists of retried articles and clinical trials, and the authors' personal files.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials evaluating enteral lactoferrin (at any dose or duration), used as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy, compared with antibiotic therapy alone (with or without placebo) or other adjuncts to antibiotic therapy to treat neonates at any gestational age up to 44 weeks' postmenstrual age with confirmed or suspected sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell's Stage II or III).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standardized methods of Cochrane Neonatal for conducting a systematic review and for assessing the methodological quality of studies (neonatal.cochrane.org/en/index.html). The titles and the abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy were independently assessed by the two review authors and full text versions were obtained for assessment if necessary. Forms were designed to record trial inclusion/exclusion and data extraction. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

We did not identify any eligible trials evaluating lactoferrin for the treatment of neonatal sepsis or NEC.

Authors' Conclusions

Implications for practice: currently there is no evidence to support or refute the use of enteral lactoferrin, as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy, for the treatment of neonatal sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis.

Implications For Research

given the lack of efficacy of enteral lactoferrin for preventing late-onset sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis, evaluation of enteral lactoferrin as an adjunctive agent for treatment of sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis does not appear to be a research priority.

### Characterization of the pathoimmunology of necrotizing enterocolitis reveals novel therapeutic opportunities [^48bf9751]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe gastrointestinal disease that primarily affects infants born prematurely and with a very or extremely low birth weight (VLBW < 1500 g; ELBW < 1000 g). Up to 11% of VLBW preterm infants are affected by NEC annually in the US. NEC currently is the most common cause of death between postnatal days 15 and 60 in infants born before 28 weeks of gestation. The disease entails substantial morbidity and mortality, ranging from 20–30% in confirmed casesto 65% when surgery is required.

Current treatment options for NEC are limited to bowel rest, antibiotics, and supportive therapy such as blood pressure management. Gut perforation occurs in ~20–50% of NEC infants, necessitating surgery. Thus, the prognosis for NEC infants is grim and those who survive commonly have to deal with long-term neurodevelopmental and growth complications, rendering new therapeutic strategies for NEC an urgent unmet need.

NEC pathogenesis is multifactorial, with four main risk factors: prematurity, formula feeding, abnormal microbial colonization, and hypoxic/ischemic states. However, the relative contribution of each of these risk factors is unclear, and despite decades of research, the pathogenesis of NEC remains largely elusive. Nevertheless, existing literature points to intestinal dysbiosis in NEC that results from an imbalance between pro-inflammatory mediators such as Toll-like receptor (TLR)4, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-18 on the one hand, and protective anti-inflammatory mediators such as TLR9, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)β 2 on the other. This imbalance leads to a vicious cycle in which excessive pro-inflammatory signaling and intestinal injury reinforce one another and perpetuate disease activity.

Regarding medical management for necrotizing enterocolitis, more specifically with respect to nonoperative management, IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend to consider administering broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole; ampicillin, cefotaxime, and metronidazole; or meropenem. Consider administering vancomycin over ampicillin for suspected MRSA or ampicillin-resistant enterococcal infection. Administer fluconazole or amphotericin B if the Gram stain or cultures of specimens obtained at operation are consistent with a fungal infection.

### Necrotizing enterocolitis: the future [^422ca05e]. Neonatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Progress in our understanding of the pathophysiology, prevention and treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) has been hampered for many reasons. Included among these is the fact that what we are calling "NEC" is likely to represent different disease processes, which need to be delineated before evaluating individual pathogenic mechanisms and attempting to develop predictive and diagnostic biomarkers. Treatment is also likely to be hampered because not all of the different entities called "NEC" will respond to the same regimen. In this review, some of these entities will be discussed in more detail, with suggestions for refining our approach toward improving methods for their diagnosis, prevention and treatment.

### Oral lactoferrin for the treatment of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates [^3540c268]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Neonatal sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) cause significant neonatal mortality and morbidity in spite of appropriate antibiotic therapy. Enhancing host defence and modulating inflammation by using lactoferrin as an adjunct to antibiotics in the treatment of sepsis and/or NEC may improve clinical outcomes.

Objectives

The primary objective is to assess safety and efficacy of oral lactoferrin as an adjunct to antibiotics in the treatment of neonates with suspected or confirmed sepsis and/or NEC.

Search Strategy

Relevant trials in any language were searched in July 2011 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, web sites: www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.controlled-trials.com, abstracts from the annual meeting of Pediatric Academic Societies (1990 to July 2011), by contacting authors who have published in this field, from the reference lists of identified clinical trials and in the reviewer's personal files.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials evaluating oral lactoferrin (at any dose or duration) used as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy compared with antibiotic therapy alone (with or without placebo) or other adjuncts to antibiotic therapy to treat neonates at any gestational age up to 44 weeks postmenstrual age with confirmed or suspected sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell's Stage II or III).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standardized methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group (CNRG) for conducting a systematic review and for assessing the methodological quality of the studies (http://neonatal.cochrane.org/en/index.html). The titles and the abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy were independently assessed by the two review authors and full text version was obtained for assessment if necessary. Forms were designed for trial inclusion/exclusion and data extraction.

Main Results

We did not identify any eligible neonatal trial evaluating lactoferrin for treatment of neonatal sepsis or NEC.

Implications For Practice

Currently there is no evidence to recommend or refute the use of lactoferrin for the treatment of neonatal sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy.

Implications For Research

The safety and efficacy of different preparations and doses of lactoferrin need to be established in neonates. Well designed adequately powered randomized multicenter trials are needed to address the efficacy and safety of lactoferrin in the treatment of neonatal sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis. These trials should evaluate long-term neurodevelopmental and pulmonary outcomes in addition to short-term outcomes.

### Impact of antibiotics on necrotizing enterocolitis and antibiotic-associated diarrhea [^e5f0fb16]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Antibiotic treatment alters the composition and metabolic function of the intestinal microbiota. These alterations may contribute to the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Recent studies are beginning to unravel the contribution of specific groups of microbes and their metabolic pathways to these diseases. Probiotics or other microbiota-targeted therapies may provide effect strategies to prevent and treat NEC and AAD.

### Variability in antibiotic duration for necrotizing enterocolitis and outcomes in a large multicenter cohort [^c3010e19]. Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate variability in antibiotic duration for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and associated clinical outcomes.

Study Design

Five-hundred ninety-one infants with NEC (315 medical; 276 surgical) were included from 22 centers participating in Children's Hospitals Neonatal Consortium (CHNC). Multivariable analyses were used to determine predictors of variability in time to full feeds (TFF) and length of stay (LOS).

Results

Median (IQR) antibiotic duration was 12 (9, 17) days for medical and 17 (14, 21) days for surgical NEC. Wide variability in antibiotic use existed both within and among centers. Duration of antibiotic therapy was associated with longer TFF in both medical (OR 1.04, 95% CI [1.01, 1.05], p < 0.001) and surgical NEC (OR 1.02 [1, 1.03] p = 0.046); and with longer LOS in medical (OR 1.03 [1.02, 1.04], p < 0.001) and surgical NEC (OR 1.01 [1.01, 1.02], p = 0.002).

Conclusion

Antibiotic duration for both medical and surgical NEC remains variable within and among high level NICUs.

### The impact of antibiotic strategy on outcomes in surgically managed necrotizing enterocolitis [^57ac9a4c]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

We sought to evaluate postoperative antibiotic practices in a large population of patients with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and determine whether any regimens were associated with better outcomes.

Methods

The Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database was queried to identify patients who underwent an intestinal resection for acute NEC between July, 2016 and June, 2021. Data regarding post-resection antibiotic therapy, cutaneous or intraabdominal infection, and fungal or antibiotic-resistant infection were collected.

Results

130 infants at 38 children's hospitals met inclusion criteria. Postoperative antibiotics were administered for a median of 13 days. The most frequently used antibiotics were vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Antibiotic duration greater than five days was not associated with a lower incidence of infection. No antibiotic was associated with a lower incidence of any of the complications assessed, although ampicillin was associated with more infections, overall. The incidence of fungal infection and treatment with a parenteral anti-fungal medication was greater with vancomycin. No antibiotic combination was used enough to be assessed.

Conclusions

Administration of antibiotics for more than five days after resection for NEC was not associated with better infectious outcomes and no single antibiotic demonstrated superior efficacy. Consistent with prior studies, fungal infections were more frequent with vancomycin.

Type Of Study

Retrospective database study, level 3B.

Level Of Evidence

### Infection control and other stewardship strategies in late onset sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, and localized infection in the neonatal intensive care unit [^7e44337f]. Seminars in Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Suspected or proven late onset sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, urinary tract infections, and ventilator associated pneumonia occurring after the first postnatal days contribute significantly to the total antibiotic exposures in neonatal intensive care units. The variability in definitions and diagnostic criteria in these conditions lead to unnecessary antibiotic use. The length of treatment and choice of antimicrobial agents for presumed and proven episodes also vary among centers due to a lack of supportive evidence and guidelines. Implementation of robust antibiotic stewardship programs can encourage compliance with appropriate dosages and narrow-spectrum regimens.

### Characteristics of patients who die of necrotizing enterocolitis [^d9f54113]. Journal of Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

Cotten et al. reported that prolonged initial empirical antibiotic treatment in extremely low birth weight infants was associated with an increased risk of NEC and/or death. We found that broader spectrum antibiotic combinations used at the time of diagnosis of NEC were not associated with an increased likelihood of survival. In fact, the combination of ampicillin and gentamicin was associated with the best overall survival, whereas clindamycin was associated with an increased risk of death. Our observations may support previous reports that antibiotic choice, and duration influence outcome. Conversely, it is possible that physicians may have chosen broader spectrum antibiotics to give to sicker patients. Our study demonstrates an interesting association but cannot be used to determine causation.

Summary

Mortality among infants who have NEC remains high, and infants who die of NEC commonly (66%) die quickly. Most of the factors associated with mortality are related to immaturity, low birth weight and severity of illness. Our data also provide a testable hypothesis, namely, antibiotic choice at diagnosis of NEC may influence outcome. A prospective study of a limited vs broad antibiotic spectrum therapies in NEC might be valuable.

### Antibiotics in the medical and surgical treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis. A systematic review [^4a1bd681]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The 5 included studies reported on 4 different treatment regimes. Although some few statistically significant differences emerged, and two studies showed a trend towards a positive effect from adding metronidazole to the regimen, we were not able to demonstrate consistent results to recommend neither the type of antibiotics, the route of administration or the duration of treatment. The information on the secondary outcome of death and NEC recurrence in those infants who underwent surgery were scarce and insufficient to achieve any conclusions.

A large variation in antibiotics combinations and duration among different institutions has been reported with 14 different combinations of antibiotics. Ampicillin+ gentamicin + metronidazole is reported as the most commonly used. A study including patients with Bell's type II and III NEC, found no combination of antibiotics to be superior from others and the duration of treatment had no significant implication of the treatment results.

During the literature search, a study from 2019 by Harutynyan et al. was discovered. The study was not included because the number of deaths in Bell's stage I disease could not be isolated. In addition, the study used antibiotics both as prophylaxis for infants in high risk of developing NEC, and treatment of infants with established NEC. A total of 200 infants were included from 2015 to 2018, where the intervention group (104 infants) were treated with a combination of oral gentamicin sulfate 15 mg/kg/day ev. 12 h + nystatin 10,000 IU/kg/day ev. 6 h and an orally administered symbiotic (Lactobacillus rhamnosus). The control group received the standard treatment of empirical antibiotics (not specified). The overall mortality was 38/96 in the control group compared to 13/104 in the interventional group. For Bell's stage III infants the numbers were 28/35 and 2/5, respectively. The difference was statistically significant. During the investigation period no infants underwent surgery in either group. It is unknown whether they received peritoneal drainage. A Cochrane review from 2001 supports the finding that enteral antibiotics could have a prophylactic effect on the development of NEC, but raises concerns about unknown harms. Another Cochrane review from 2014 concluded that the use of probiotics has an effect in preventing NEC in preterm infants. Although antibiotics is a core element in the treatment of NEC some studies seem to indicate antibiotics as a risk factor for developing NEC.

Adjustment of antibiotic treatment strategies

This survey investigated the details of the choice of alternative antibiotics when the primary antibiotic was not effective (table 4). As shown in table 4, when NEC was confirmed, carbapenems were most commonly selected (43.0%, including single or combined use), followed by antianaerobic agents, including metronidazole, ornidazole and clindamycin. Only 1.4% used antifungal agents as the first choice. When a patient's condition worsens or the treatment effect is unsatisfactory, most physicians switch to carbapenems.

### Probiotics may not prevent the deterioration of necrotizing enterocolitis from stage I to II / III [^563cdc67]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious gastrointestinal disease with a mortality rate reaching up to 20–30%, and it has become an important cause of neonatal death. There have been no targeted treatment protocols for NEC, and we generally use symptomatic treatment. Infants with NEC commonly receive cessation of enteral nutrition, broad-spectrum antibiotics, gastrointestinal decompression and supportive treatment if necessary. Studies have suggested that prophylactic probiotic therapy can reduce the incidence of NEC in preterm infants, and meta-analyses have confirmed these findings. Studies of probiotic effects in term infants have focused on allergic diseases, immunomodulation, infectious and antibiotic-associated diarrhea, sepsis or growth. Furthermore, approximately 10% of NEC cases occurred in full-term infants, but few studies have focused on this group of infants. Compared with infants with stage I NEC, infants with stage II/III NEC, especially infants with stage III NEC, incur higher costs for hospitalization and care and have poorer prognoses. However, until now, whether the therapeutic use of probiotics after NEC diagnosis reduces the severity of NEC in preterm infants or full-term infants is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of probiotic therapy on preventing the deterioration of NEC from stage I to stage II/III in infants.

### Pentoxifylline for treatment of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates [^ec0432f9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Mortality and morbidity due to neonatal sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is high despite the use of potent antimicrobial agents. Agents that modulate inflammation may improve outcomes. Pentoxifylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, is one such agent.

Objectives

The primary objectives were to assess the effect on mortality and the safety of intravenous pentoxifylline as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy in neonates with suspected or confirmed sepsis and NEC.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2011), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, Science Citation Index for articles referencing Lauterbach 1996, proceedings of the Pediatric Academic Societies (1990 to 2011), BIOSIS (1992 to 2011), conference proceedings (1992 to 2011), ongoing trials and reference lists of identified RCTs were searched in July 2011.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials assessing the efficacy of pentoxifylline as an adjunct to antibiotics for treatment of suspected or confirmed sepsis or NEC in neonates were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently abstracted information for the outcomes of interest. Typical relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using fixed effects model are reported for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes. NNT was calculated for outcomes for which there was a statistically significant reduction in RD.

Main Results

In four randomised controlled trials, 227 neonates with suspected or confirmed sepsis were randomised to pentoxifylline or placebo. Pentoxifylline therapy significantly decreased "all cause mortality during hospital stay" in the overall population of infants with sepsis [typical RR 0.40 (95%CI 0.20 to 0.77); typical RD -0.15 (95%CI -0.26 to -0.05); NNT 7 (95%CI 4 to 20)]. Subgroup analyses revealed significant reduction in mortality in preterm infants, infants with confirmed sepsis and gram-negative sepsis. Pentoxifylline treatment significantly decreased length of hospital stay [mean difference -11.20 [95%CI -22.09 to -0.31] but not development of NEC in neonates with sepsis [typical RR 0.29 (95%CI 0.07 to 1.24); typical RD -0.20 (95%CI -0.41 to 0.01)]. No adverse effects due to pentoxifylline were noted. No completed trial of treatment with pentoxifylline for treatment of NEC was identified.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence from four small studies suggests that the use of pentoxifylline as an adjunct to antibiotics in neonatal sepsis decreases mortality without any adverse effects. Researchers are encouraged to undertake large well-designed multicenter trials to confirm or refute the effectiveness of pentoxifylline in reducing mortality and adverse outcomes in neonates with suspected or confirmed neonatal sepsis and NEC.

### Standardizing the evaluation and management of necrotizing enterocolitis in a level IV NICU [^2dcab253]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe intestinal inflammatory disease and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in NICUs. Management of NEC is variable because of the lack of evidence-based recommendations. It is widely accepted that standardization of patient care leads to improved outcomes. This quality improvement project aimed to decrease variation in the evaluation and management of NEC in a Level IV NICU.

Methods

A multidisciplinary team investigated institutional variation in NEC management and developed a standardized guideline and electronic medical record tools to assist in evaluation and management. Retrospective baseline data were collected for 2 years previously and prospectively for 3.5 years after interventions. Outcomes included the ratio of observed-to-expected days of antibiotics and nil per os (NPO) on the basis of the novel guidelines and the percentage of cases treated with piperacillin/tazobactam. Balancing measures were death, surgery, and antifungal use.

Results

Over 5.5 years, there were 124 evaluations for NEC. Special cause variation was noted in the observed-to-expected antibiotic and NPO days ratios, decreasing from 1.94 to 1.18 and 1.69 to 1.14, respectively. Piperacillin/tazobactam utilization increased from 30% to 91%. There were no increases in antifungal use, surgery, or death.

Conclusions

Variation in evaluation and management of NEC decreased after initiation of a guideline and supporting electronic medical record tools, with fewer antibiotic and NPO days without an increase in morbidity or mortality. A quality improvement approach can benefit patients and decrease variability, even in diseases with limited evidence-based standards.

### Antimicrobial stewardship in neonates with necrotizing enterocolitis: a quality improvement initiative [^279869cf]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotic overutilization in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) has many adverse effects, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most common indications for antibiotics in premature infants. Evidence for a preferred antibiotic regimen for NEC is lacking. This project aims to reduce piperacillin-tazobactam use and overall antibiotic duration in neonates with NEC through the implementation of an antibiotic stewardship pathway based on the modified Bell stage classification system.

Methods

A multidisciplinary team consisting of neonatology, pharmacy, infectious disease, and surgery developed an antibiotic protocol for the management of NEC based on Bell stage. Recommendations included 48 h of ampicillin/gentamicin (AG) for stage I, 5–10 days of AG for stage II, the addition of metronidazole for stage IIIA, and 7–14 days of piperacillin-tazobactam (PT) for stage IIIB. We evaluated overall antibiotic and PT exposure, progression to surgical NEC, NEC recurrence, antibiotic resistance, bacteremia/fungemia, and mortality 1 year pre- and post-protocol implementation.

Results

27 patients pre-intervention and 44 post-intervention were analyzed. Antibiotic exposure was reduced from a median 119.19 to 80.65 days of therapy (DOT) per 1000 patient days (p = 0.11). PT exposure decreased after protocol implementation (median 68.78 vs. 7.97 DOT per 1000 patient days, p = 0.002). There were no significant differences in morbidity or mortality outcomes.

Conclusions

Antibiotic stewardship strategies can be implemented in the NICU without compromising outcomes in patients with NEC. Bell stage stratification appears to be an effective method for antibiotic selection. Further studies are needed in a larger population to optimize regimens and ensure safety.

Type Of Study

Retrospective comparative study.

Level Of Evidence

Level III.

### Survey on antibiotic regimens for necrotizing enterocolitis prescribed by Chinese pediatricians in 2020 [^b9c48c91]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Adjustment of the antibiotic therapy strategies

Owing to the delay in receiving blood culture results and to low positive rates, the treatment of NEC in China is mostly empirical. This survey showed that when NEC was confirmed, carbapenems were the initial antibiotic therapy selected, followed by the addition of antianaerobic agents (including metronidazole, ornidazole or clindamycin) and glycopeptides. When the therapeutic effect was unsatisfactory, the proportion of doctors who chose to escalate therapy with carbapenems was 83.3%, and the proportion who chose glycopeptides was 20.9%. The proportion who selected antianaerobic agents as the initial antibiotic regimen was 35.2%; consequently, only 7.1% chose a combination regimen when NEC was exacerbated. When the treatment was ineffective, many physicians preferred to upgrade to carbapenems due to their stronger antibacterial effect on Gram-negative bacteria and due to their enhanced ability to act against anaerobic bacteria. In medical therapy for NEC in other countries, third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, and vancomycin are typically selected after empirical treatment with metronidazole.

According to the results of this questionnaire survey, the antibiotics selected for the treatment of NEC in China are most commonly effective against Gram-negative bacilli. When the therapeutic effect is poor, carbapenems are primarily selected, and some physicians choose to combine carbapenems with metronidazole, ornidazole, and other antianaerobic agents. At present, in China, due to the laws and various medication-prescribing preferences, there is substantial variation in the empirical antibiotics selected for the treatment of NEC; in particular, the treatment of Gram-positive bacteria may be insufficient.

In conclusion, there is no unified antibiotic treatment program for NEC, and it is necessary to carry out multicenter research to serve as the basis for the formulation of relevant guidelines for the antibiotic treatment of NEC in the future.

### A critical question for NEC researchers: can we create a consensus definition of NEC that facilitates research progress? [^13d3077e]. Seminars in Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

In the last decades the reported incidence of preterm necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) has been declining in large part due to implementing comprehensive NEC prevention initiatives, including breast milk feeding, standardized feeding protocols, transfusion guidelines, and antibiotic stewardship and improving the rigor with which non-NEC cases are excluded from NEC data. However, after more than 60 years of NEC research in animal models, the promise of a "magic bullet" to prevent NEC has yet to materialize. There are also serious issues involving clinical NEC research. There is a lack of a common, comprehensive definition of NEC. National datasets have their own unique definition and staging definitions. Even within academia, randomized trials and single center studies have widely disparate definitions. This makes NEC metadata of very limited value. The world of neonatology needs a comprehensive, universal, consensus definition of NEC. It also needs a de-identified, international data warehouse.

### The effectiveness of treatment with probiotics in preventing necrotizing enterocolitis and related mortality: results from an umbrella meta-analysis on meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials [^b424b1ee]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the significant protective effects of probiotics against NEC and NEC-related mortality, our findings should be interpreted in light of the heterogeneity observed across studies. While subgroup analyses based on gestational age, study population, birth weight, and probiotic strain helped identify potential sources of variability, heterogeneity remained high in certain subgroups, particularly those involving multi-strain probiotics. This suggests that differences in probiotic composition and host characteristics may contribute to the observed variability. As the limitations, due to not reporting the dose, treatment protocol, and duration in some included studies, subgroup analysis based on them was not performed. The included studies did not consistently report detailed information on the specific dosage, duration of administration, or feeding regimens used across individual trials. These factors likely play a crucial role in determining probiotic efficacy but remain a source of uncertainty due to the lack of standardization. Future research should aim to establish optimal probiotic strains, dosages, and treatment durations to maximize clinical benefits while minimizing heterogeneity in study outcomes. As another limitation, results of subgroup analysis may not be fully generalizable or robust due to the sample size limitations. Another key limitation of our umbrella meta-analysis is the lack of detailed data on clinical factors such as comorbidities, the use of antibiotics, and ventilator support, all of which could influence the effectiveness of probiotics in preventing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). These factors may significantly alter the outcomes of probiotic supplementation. Future studies should aim to report and account for these clinical variables to provide a clearer understanding of how probiotics function in different clinical contexts, especially in high-risk populations such as premature or critically ill infants.

As strengths, the results of our study by summarizing all previous studies with conflicting results can provide evidence for prescribing probiotics to prevent NEC. The high quality of included studies also confirms the validity of the obtained results. In addition, our protocol is registered in PROSPERO.

### Survey on antibiotic regimens for necrotizing enterocolitis prescribed by Chinese pediatricians in 2020 [^1e88d7ed]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Selection of appropriate antibiotic regimens

Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is an important treatment for all infants with NEC. However, the current status of antibiotic treatment of NEC in China remains unclear because there have been no previous reports. This study is the first to investigate the antibiotic use strategies employed by Chinese physicians for the treatment of NEC. The questionnaire survey had a wide geographical distribution and high coverage. The respondents were 284 pediatricians working in 182 tertiary hospitals in 29 provinces of China, most of them had worked in clinical practice for over 10 years, and more than half of the subjects had worked for over 20 years. The respondents have rich clinical experience, and their opinions are generally representative.

Based on the results of our questionnaire survey, 41.5% of the physicians chose beta-lactamase inhibitors, 28.9% chose carbapenems, and 20.8% chose cephalosporins to treat NEC among the single-antibiotic regimens. When combining antibiotics to treat NEC, beta-lactamase inhibitors and antianaerobic agents were the most frequently selected combination, followed by carbapenems and glycopeptides and cephalosporins and antianaerobic agents. There was no significant difference in the choice of NEC antibiotics by physicians with different durations of experience (p > 0.05). In Europe and the USA, triple antibiotic regimens are often used to treat NEC, such as ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole, whereas in China pediatricians mainly select combinations of two antibiotics, primarily those effective against Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic bacteria, which means that the treatment of Gram-positive cocci may be inadequate. In addition, cephalosporins are still effective against anaerobic bacteria, and it is not entirely reasonable to combine cephalosporins with metronidazole. In this survey, although there were as many as 20 reported combinations of antibiotics, the appropriateness of these combinations deserves consideration. This suggests that further study on the optimal combination of antibiotics is needed based on expert consensus or updated recommendations.

### Necrotizing enterocolitis: recent scientific advances in pathophysiology and prevention [^da803a80]. Seminars in Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. Here we review the epidemiology and pathophysiology of NEC, with an emphasis on the latest research findings and potential areas for future research. NEC continues to be one of the most devastating and unpredictable diseases affecting premature infants. Despite decades of research, the pathogenesis of this disease remains unclear, and prevention and treatment strategies are limited. Hopefully, future studies aimed at understanding premature intestinal defenses, commensal or probiotic bacterial influences, and possible genetic predisposition will lead to the improvement of prevention and treatment strategies.

### Early antibiotic exposure and the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm neonates: insights from a large multicenter cohort in China [^4388d567]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The association between early antibiotic overuse in preterm neonates and the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains controversial. In this issue of Pediatric Research, Zhu et al. present findings from a large multicenter prospective cohort study across China, reporting no significant association between early empirical antibiotic exposure and NEC. However, prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics was associated with increased mortality. The results underscore the importance of antibiotic stewardship in neonatal care and highlight the need for further randomized trials and mechanistic studies to better understand the complex interactions between antibiotics and NEC pathogenesis. IMPACT: This comment highlights the study by Zhu et al. 'Early antibiotic exposure and necrotizing enterocolitis among preterm infants < 34 weeks' gestation'.

### Role of the microbiome in pathophysiology of necrotising enterocolitis in preterm neonates [^994d22d6]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Antibiotic use

Antibiotics constitute another important factor with strong influence on microbiome composition. These are among the drugs most frequently used in NICUs. During the first 3 days of life, as many as 87% of newborns with extremely low birth weight receive antibiotic treatment. In addition, almost 60% of them continue the therapy beyond the 4th day even if laboratory results are negative. After even a short course of antibiotics there is a drop in microbiome richness and diversity together with overgrowth of some resistant pathogenic bacteria. Several weeks are needed for restitution of the microbiome and so prolonged antibiotic therapy increases the risk of NEC. Therefore, it is important to consider carefully every indication of antibiotic treatment and also its early cessation.

Probiotics use

An important topic in NEC prevention is the use of probiotics. Probiotics are living organisms which, through their effects in the gut, improve the gut's barrier function, mucosa IgA response and tolerance of enteral nutrition. Probiotics also reduce the growth of pathogens and produce various anti-inflammatory cytokines. Through downregulation of inflammatory pathway, they contribute to reducing the incidence of late-onset sepsis and NEC. The results of various studies in this area are not unequivocal, however. Most of them describe a greater abundance of Bifidobacteria in the neonate gut as a result of administering probiotics. Several problems are inherent in these studies, such as inconsistencies in methodology (differing study designs, infant diets and/or gestational age) and the various types of probiotics being evaluated at different dosages. Nevertheless, the use of probiotics is a promising way to influence gut microbiome development in preterm infants and prevent NEC.

### Antibiotic regimens for the empirical treatment of newborn infants with necrotising enterocolitis [^68573ac8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although the exact aetiology of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) remains unknown, research suggests that it is multifactorial; suspected pathophysiological mechanisms include immaturity, intestinal ischaemia, disruption of intestinal mucosal integrity, formula feeding, hyperosmolar load to the intestine, infection and bacterial translocation. Various antibiotic regimens have been widely used in the treatment of NEC.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of different antibiotic regimens on mortality and the need for surgery in neonates with NEC.

Search Methods

Searches were made of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2012), Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, MEDLINE (1966 to February 2012), EMBASE (1980 to February 2012) and CINAHL (1982 to February 2012).

Selection Criteria

All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials where antibiotic regimens were used for treatment of NEC.

Data Collection and Analysis

Eligibility of studies for inclusion was assessed independently by each review author. The criteria and standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used to assess the methodological quality of the included trials.

Main Results

Two trials met the inclusion criteria. Faix 1988 randomised 42 premature infants with radiological diagnosis of NEC. Infants were randomised to receive either intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin or ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin. Hansen 1980 randomised 20 infants with NEC to receive intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin with or without enteral gentamicin. In the study by Faix 1988, there were no statistical differences in mortality (RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.32 to 3.83) or bowel perforation (RR 2.20; 95% CI 0.45 to 10.74) between the two groups although there was a trend towards higher rate of strictures in the group that received clindamycin (RR 7.20; 95% CI 0.97 to 53.36). The Hansen 1980 study showed no statistically significant difference in death, bowel perforation or development of strictures.

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence to recommend a particular antibiotic regimen for the treatment of NEC. There were concerns about adverse effects following the usage of clindamycin, related to the development of strictures. To address this issue a large randomised controlled trial needs to be performed.

### Necrotizing enterocolitis and the microbiome: current status and future directions [^e454fbf1]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Decades of research have failed to define the pathophysiology of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a devastating pediatric gastrointestinal disorder of preterm infants. However, evidence suggests that host-microbiota interactions, in which microbial dysbiosis is followed by loss of barrier integrity, inflammation, and necrosis, are central to NEC development. Thus, greater knowledge of the preterm infant microbiome could accelerate attempts to diagnose, treat, and prevent NEC. In this article, we summarize clinical characteristics of and risk factors for NEC, the structure of the pre-event NEC microbiome, how this community interfaces with host immunology, and microbiome-based approaches that might prevent or lessen the severity of NEC in this very vulnerable population.

### Antibiotics in the medical and surgical treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis. A systematic review [^ec0aa697]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary outcomes: death and surgery

For both the RCTs, the mortality rate in the intervention group varied from 10 to 20% and 18–20% in the control group with no significant differences. The values for surgery were 10–30% and 18–40%, respectively, and with no significant difference. In the three cohort studies the mortality rate varied from 0 to 15% in the intervention group and 10–32% in the control group. The values for surgery were 15–71% and 8–33%, respectively. The only significant difference found was in the surgical rate in the study by Vermeylen et al. with the lowest rate in the group who received metronidazole but there was no difference in the mortality rates.

In the study by Luo et al. 17 infants deteriorated from Bell's stage II to III in a population of 143 infants. Eleven of these had received metronidazole and 6 had not. There was a lower mortality rate in the group receiving metronidazole, but the difference was not statistically significant.

Two studies specified the number of deaths for Bell's stage III NEC. Vermeylen et al. reported 5/30 deaths in the intervention group (metronidazole), compared to 4/4 deaths in the control group. In the study by Luo et al. 1/11 infants receiving metronidazole died compared to 2/6 without metronidazole.

For the secondary outcomes no reliable data could be retrieved.

### New insights into necrotizing enterocolitis: from laboratory observation to personalized prevention and treatment [^723d075f]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background/Purpose

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease of prematurity that develops after feeding, often without warning, and results in diffuse intestinal necrosis leading to sepsis and death in many cases. The lack of improvement in overall survival is influenced by nonspecific diagnostic modalities as well as inexact and nonpersonalized treatment strategies.

Methods/Results

Recently, we and others have shown that NEC develops in response to exaggerated bacterial signaling in the premature intestine, as a consequence of elevated expression and activity of the bacterial receptor toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is important for normal gut development. Breast milk is a powerful TLR4 inhibitor, while mutations in TLR4 genes lead to increased NEC risk in humans, providing proof-of-concept for its role in NEC. Recently, a drug discovery approach has revealed a novel class of TLR4 inhibitors which are being developed for personalized approaches to NEC treatment.

Conclusion

This review will highlight the current understanding of the role of bacterial signaling in NEC pathogenesis, and will describe advances in diagnosis, prevention and treatment of NEC that may hopefully improve survival for these most fragile patients.

### Pentoxifylline for treatment of sepsis and necrotising enterocolitis in neonates [^3c56e577]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Mortality and morbidity due to neonatal sepsis and necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) remain high despite the use of potent antimicrobial agents. Agents that modulate inflammation may improve outcomes. Pentoxifylline (PTX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, is one such agent. This is an update of a review first published in 2003 and updated in 2011 and 2015.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of intravenous PTX as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy on mortality and morbidity in neonates with suspected or confirmed sepsis and neonates with NEC.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and trial registries in July 2022. We also searched the reference lists of identified clinical trials and handsearched conference abstracts. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs assessing the efficacy of PTX with antibiotics (any dose or duration) for treatment of suspected or confirmed sepsis or NEC in neonates. We included three comparisons: (1) PTX with antibiotics compared to placebo or no intervention with antibiotics; (2) PTX with antibiotics compared to PTX with antibiotics and adjunct treatments such as immunoglobulin M-enriched intravenous immunoglobulin (IgM-enriched IVIG); (3) PTX with antibiotics compared to adjunct treatments such as IgM-enriched IVIG with antibiotics.

Data Collection and Analysis

We reported typical risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes derived from a fixed-effect model of meta-analysis. We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) if there was a statistically significant reduction in RD.

Main Results

We identified no new studies for this update. We included six RCTs (416 neonates). All of the included studies examined neonates with sepsis; we identified no studies on neonates with NEC. Four of the six trials had high risk of bias for at least one risk of bias domain. Comparison 1: PTX with antibiotics compared to placebo with antibiotics, or antibiotics alone, in neonates with sepsis may reduce all-cause mortality during hospital stay (typical RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.93; typical RD -0.08, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.01; NNTB 13, 95% CI 7 to 100; 6 studies, 416 participants, low-certainty evidence) and may decrease length of hospital stay (LOS) (MD -7.74, 95% CI -11.72 to -3.76; 2 studies, 157 participants, low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain that PTX with antibiotics compared to placebo or no intervention results in any change in chronic lung disease (CLD) (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.45 to 5.05; 1 study, 120 participants, very low-certainty evidence), severe intraventricular haemorrhage (sIVH) (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.03; 1 study, 120 participants, very low-certainty evidence), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.63; 1 study, 120 participants, very low-certainty evidence), NEC (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.06; 6 studies, 405 participants, very low-certainty evidence), or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.98; 1 study, 120 participants, very low-certainty evidence) in neonates with sepsis. Comparison 2: the evidence is very uncertain that PTX with antibiotics compared to PTX with antibiotics and IgM-enriched IVIG has any effect on mortality (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.10; 102 participants, 1 study, very low-certainty evidence) or development of NEC in neonates with sepsis (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.31 to 5.66; 1 study, 102 participants, very low-certainty evidence). The outcomes of CLD, sIVH, PVL, LOS, and ROP were not reported. Comparison 3: the evidence is very uncertain that PTX with antibiotics compared to IgM-enriched IVIG with antibiotics has any effect on mortality (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.36 to 4.39; 102 participants, 1 study, very low-certainty evidence) or development of NEC (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.31 to 5.66; 102 participants, 1 study, very low-certainty evidence) in neonates with sepsis. The outcomes of CLD, sIVH, PVL, LOS, and ROP were not reported. All of the included studies evaluated adverse effects due to PTX, but none were reported in the intervention group in any of the comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence suggests that adjunct PTX therapy in neonatal sepsis may decrease mortality and length of hospital stay without any adverse effects. The evidence is very uncertain if PTX with antibiotics compared to PTX with antibiotics and IgM-enriched IVIG, or PTX with antibiotics compared to IgM-enriched IVIG with antibiotics, has any effect on mortality or development of NEC. We encourage researchers to undertake well-designed multicentre trials to confirm or refute the effectiveness and safety of pentoxifylline in reducing mortality and morbidity in neonates with sepsis or NEC.

### Treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis with probiotics [^6714f619]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating condition characterized by diffuse intestinal inflammation and necrosis in preterm infants. It is the most common gastrointestinal emergency in the neonatal intensive care unit and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Primary risk factors include prematurity and low birth weight. Although the pathogenesis of NEC is complex and not entirely understood, it is known that an interplay between immature intestinal immune responses and the process of bacterial colonization is required for the development of this disease.

### Early antibiotic exposure and necrotizing enterocolitis among preterm infants [^b087782e]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

To investigate whether use, duration, and types of early antibiotics were associated with the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) among preterm infants born at < 34 weeks' gestation.

Methods

This multicenter prospective cohort study included all infants with gestational age < 34 weeks and admitted to neonatal intensive care units across China. Early antibiotic exposure was defined as the antibiotic treatment initiated within the first three postnatal days. The short-term outcomes included death, NEC, death and/or NEC. Propensity score matching was performed to generate matched cohorts. The impacts of early antibiotics exposure on the outcomes were evaluated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.

Results

Among 24,926 eligible infants, 20164 (80.9%) received early antibiotics. After matching, early antibiotics exposure was not significantly associated with the death and/or NEC (adjusted OR, 0.93; 95%CI, 0.72–1.21), NEC (adjusted OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.60–1.10) or death (adjusted OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.90–2.25). However, prolonged antibiotic treatment (adjusted OR, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.67–5.22), especially broad-spectrum antibiotics exposure (adjusted OR, 5.09; 95% CI, 1.84–14.10), was independently associated with death.

Conclusion

While early antibiotics exposure was not associated with the risks of NEC, prolonged antibiotic duration, especially broad-spectrum antibiotics, was associated with a higher mortality.

Impact

This multicenter cohort study sheds light on whether use, duration, and types of early antibiotics were associated with the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis among preterm infants < 34 weeks of gestation. In preterm infants, early antibiotics exposure was not significantly associated with the risks of death and/or NEC. However, prolonged antibiotic duration, especially broad-spectrum antibiotics, was associated with a higher mortality. Our study emphasizes the importance of neonatal antimicrobial stewardship in improving the prognosis of premature infants.

### Influencing factors for surgical treatment in neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8ed5034a]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a complex disease characterized by gastrointestinal inflammation and is one of the most common gastrointestinal emergencies in neonates. The disease is marked by mucosal ischemic necrosis, abdominal mass, erythema of the abdominal wall, pneumatosis intestinalis, portal venous gas, and, in severe cases, pneumoperitoneum. NEC is notorious for its rapid onset, diagnostic challenges, and high mortality rate, posing a severe threat to neonatal life.

Due to the absence of reliable epidemiological data, the true incidence of neonatal NEC remains unclear. However, estimates from various reports in the United States suggest an incidence rate of 0.1–0.3%, with over 30–50% of NEC patients requiring surgical intervention. The overall mortality rate post-surgery ranges from 20 to 30% and up to 50% in some reports. Survivors often suffer from multiple complications, leading to lifelong disabilities such as intestinal stricture, short bowel syndrome, malnutrition, and neurodevelopmental delays, which significantly decrease the quality of life for the patients and their families due to the high costs of ongoing treatment.

The treatment for NEC depends on the severity of the condition. Medical treatment for mild to moderate cases includes cessation of enteral feeds, empirical antibiotic therapy, supportive care, and close monitoring of vital signs. Severe cases require surgical intervention, such as intestinal resection, peritoneal drainage, and medical treatment. Intestinal perforation is an absolute indication for surgery for NEC. However, evidence for other surgical indications is scarce and largely dependent on the surgeon's experience, leading to outcome variability. The primary aim of this study is to identify the risk factors for surgical intervention in neonatal NEC, which will aid in predicting the optimal timing for surgical intervention, allowing these patients to benefit from earlier surgery, preserving more viable intestinal segments, reducing complications, and improving outcomes.

### Standardizing the evaluation and management of necrotizing enterocolitis in a level IV NICU… [^5bef3f6a]. publications.aap.org (2022). Medium credibility.

Over 5. 5 years, there were 124 evaluations for NEC. Special cause variation was noted in the observed-to-expected antibiotic and NPO days ratios, decreasing from 1. 94 to

1. 18 and 1. 69 to
2. 14, respectively. Piperacillin/tazobactam utilization increased from 30% to 91%. There were no increases in antifungal use, surgery, or death. Using this proposed, unit-developed guideline, we aimed to align our current management of NEC, thereby decreasing variation of practice within our unit regarding antibiotic choice, antibiotic days, and nil per os days without increasing morbidity or mortality. Specifically, the guideline narrowed antibiotics to 1 agent and recommended a course of treatment on the basis of the severity of NEC disease. All aims were planned on a 2-year timeline. 8, 26 Piperacillin/tazobactam was chosen as the preferred single-agent antibiotic.

Piperacillin/tazobactam has the fewest compatibility concerns with other commonly used intravenous medications and parenteral nutrition, compared with alternative antibiotic regimens. 51 In addition, piperacillin/tazobactam is generally less nephrotoxic than most aminoglycosides, 52 with less concern for increasing ampicillin and gentamicin resistance to common bacterial pathogens, 53 and has good coverage for pathogenic intestinal bacteria, including anaerobic species. 53, 54. Antibiotic search terms included clindamycin, meropenem, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam. From this preliminary list, inclusion was determined through manual data collection by a second team member via chart review and cross-referenced with data collected by our Vermont Oxford Network data collector. Because PDSA cycles began in February 2018, data collected before this date were marked as "preintervention" and subsequent as "postintervention.

" NEC was defined as previously described per the VON definition. Before our guideline, 30% of NEC patients were treated with piperacillin/tazobactam. After this initiative, piperacillin/tazobactam was the antibiotic of choice in 91% of patients with NEC. Although there is no clear evidence for selecting one antibiotic regimen over another in the management of NEC.

### Antibiotics in the medical and surgical treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis. A systematic review [^61f9d54f]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Ampicillin and gentamicin work synergistically and have created the base for many treatment regimens for NEC. Hansen et al. showed that the intervention group receiving oral gentamicin had significantly higher serum-gentamicin peak values compared to the control group (receiving only IV gentamicin) questioning the safety regarding known side effects of aminoglycosides.

One study investigating the effect of clindamycin was terminated prior to completion due to an increase in the frequency of intestinal stenosis. A study by Autmizguine et al. analyzing data from 2780 infants with NEC who were treated with or without antibiotics for anaerobic bacteria (clindamycin or metronidazole) showed that infants treated with the anaerobic antimicrobials developed more strictures (OR 1.73; 95% CI, 1.11–2,72). However, this was not significant when analyzed for clindamycin alone. Other studies showed no effect of anaerobe antimicrobials in preventing progression of stage II NEC.

Piperacillin/tazobactam might be an alternative treatment in NEC. In a small study with 27 very low birth weight infants there was a trend towards preventing progression of NEC. and no adverse events were reported.

The limitations of this review are studies of older date where methodology and reporting were of a different, less strict, and structured format. As a result, it was difficult to obtain equivalent information from all the included studies.

With the rising concerns about antibiotic resistance, efforts to find a treatment regimen with maximal effect is warranted, as is more knowledge on antibiotic treatment in the prevention and progression of NEC in addition to postoperative treatment. Another problem is the dose needed for a sufficient penetration of the antibiotic to the peritoneal cavity. The approved method with intraperitoneal microdialysis to measure antibiotic concentrations could be an option.

### Survey on antibiotic regimens for necrotizing enterocolitis prescribed by Chinese pediatricians in 2020 [^f0ae032e]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The American Surgical Infection Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America issued guidelines in 2010 which suggest that broad-spectrum antibiotics, including ampicillin, metronidazole, and gentamicin; ampicillin, metronidazole, and cefotaxime; and meropenem, may be effective for the treatment of NEC in neonates. In addition, when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or ampicillin-resistant infection is suspected, the guidelines recommend the use of vancomycin instead of ampicillin. However, the use of gentamicin is prohibited by law due to the adverse effects of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity in children under 6 years old. In addition, according to the investigations into antibiotic resistance in recent years, the levels of resistance to penicillin and ampicillin are extremely high, and these antibiotics are not used for the treatment of NEC in China. Foreign retrospective studies have reported that antianaerobic therapy has no added benefit with regard to mortality due to NEC, nor can it prevent progression to surgical NEC. Researchers also retrospectively evaluated the effect of broad-spectrum antibiotics combined with metronidazole in the prevention of the progression of NEC from stage II to III, eventually concluding that the addition of metronidazole did not prevent the progression of NEC. Therefore, whether metronidazole, ornidazole, clindamycin, and other antianaerobic agents should be routinely included in the treatment of NEC is still controversial, and a large-scale, multicenter, prospective study is needed.

The etiology of NEC remains unclear, and recent studies have reported that it is related to genetic susceptibility, intestinal immaturity, hemodynamic instability, intestinal microbial imbalance and inflammation. There are distinct microorganisms responsible for NEC outbreaks; thus, it is clear that NEC is not caused by one species alone. A wide range of pathogens are associated with NEC; among anaerobic bacteria, some toxigenic Clostridium strains, such as Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile and C. butyricum, are implicated as causative pathogens in NEC. Although the specific pathogens responsible for NEC may affect the selection of antibiotic regimens, there is no established standard to suggest a benefit from a wider range of antibiotics. Additionally, the intestinal microbiota in newborns are easily affected by the environment. Given the differences among NICUs and antibiotic strategies, the environmental flora are likely to differ, which may lead to different pathogenic bacteria causing NEC.

### Evidence vs experience in neonatal practices in necrotizing enterocolitis [^64c33ea7]. Journal of Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) has been recognized for over 40 years as a cause of inflammation and necrosis of the small and large intestine of infants born at less than 36 weeks of gestation. NEC remains a significant health problem for infants born prematurely and may become the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among these infants worldwide. The sequence of events leading to NEC is complex and multifactorial, although damage to the intestinal epithelium and invasion by bacteria are known to play central roles in disease pathogenesis.

Study Design

Bacteria initiate a cascade of inflammation that may progress to intestinal necrosis and perforation with sepsis and death.

Result

Treatment of infants at risk for NEC with probiotic bacteria may be an area of great potential, as probiotic bacteria may promote maturation of the epithelial barrier and function to exclude bacterial pathogens from critical niches in the intestine, thereby disrupting a primary pathway in disease pathogenesis.

Conclusion

Understanding how probiotic bacteria, or other novel therapies, prevent or limit disease propagation in NEC will be paramount in limiting the impact of disease in a growing population of premature newborns.

### A systematic review of perinatal antibiotic stewardship-where we are, where to go? [^377dd010]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

According to the World Health Organization, the perinatal period is defined as the period between the completed 22 nd week of pregnancy and the first seven days after birth. Within the perinatal period, three distinct phases with specific health care priorities can be defined: antepartum, intrapartum and postpartum phase. An optimal start at the beginning of life has a significant impact on a person's health and well-being. Use of antibiotics in the perinatal period is high with potential impact on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and future health. AMR is one of the main challenges of medicine with currently more than 1.2 million deaths annually directly related. The perturbation of the development of the non-resilient microbiome in early life plays a key role for future health. Exposure to antibiotics in the perinatal period was reported to be associated with asthma, allergies, atopic dermatitis, obesity, celiac disease, diabetes and other immune disorders later in life. In addition, late onset sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) were reported as short-term adverse outcomes in preterm infants treated with prolonged exposure to antibiotics. Late onset sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis are associated with impaired neurological long-term outcomes.

### Necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight neonates: a natural history study [^9afd2a0e]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

We characterize the most recent natural history of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), as this is an essential first step in guiding the prevention and treatment of this disease in the present day.

Study Design

We performed a retrospective cohort study of neonates who were born at 23 to 29 weeks' gestation and birth weight < 1,500g who received care from the Pediatrix Medical Group between 2004 and 2019. We assessed the incidence of medical and surgical NEC and the patterns of initial antibiotic treatment to develop a contemporary cohort for further analysis. Among patients discharged between 2015 and 2019, we characterized the stage-specific risk factors for patients diagnosed with medical or surgical NEC, as well as patterns of disease onset, progression, biomarkers, and outcomes. We used the same approach to characterize patients diagnosed with suspected NEC.

Results

Among 34,032 patients in the contemporary cohort, 1,150 (3.4%) were diagnosed with medical NEC and 543 (1.6%) were diagnosed with surgical NEC. The temporal pattern of disease onset was different for medical and surgical NEC, with gestational age- and birth weight-specific risk disparities emerging earlier in surgical NEC. Thirty-day mortality was much greater among surgical NEC patients (medical NEC 16.4% vs. surgical NEC 43.0%), as were rates of various in-hospital and long-term outcomes. Suspected NEC was diagnosed in 1,256 (3.7%) patients, among whom risk factors and disease onset, progression, and outcomes closely resembled those of medical NEC.

Conclusion

Analyzing data from a contemporary cohort enabled us to characterize the current, stage-specific natural history of NEC, including novel insights into suspected NEC. Future studies could leverage this cohort to characterize how specific patient characteristics, care processes, or biomarkers may influence or predict disease outcomes.

Key Points

· The incidence of NEC has reached a stable baseline in recent years. · Risk factors for NEC vary in a stage-specific manner. · The stage-specific onset and progression of NEC differ by gestational age and birth weight.

### A quality improvement initiative standardizing the antibiotic treatment and feeding practices in patients with medical necrotizing enterocolitis [^fd89be5b]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Evaluate the impact of a multidisciplinary guideline standardizing antibiotic duration and enteral feeding practices following medical necrotizing enterocolitis (mNEC).

Study Design

For preterm infants with Bell Stage 2A mNEC and negative blood culture, antibiotic treatment was standardized to 7 days. Trophic feeds of unfortified human milk began 72h after resolution of pneumatosis. Feeds were advanced by 20cc/kg/day starting on the last day of antibiotics. Primary outcomes were antibiotic days and days to full feeds, defined as 120cc/kg/day of enteral nutrition. Secondary outcomes included central line days and length of stay (LOS).

Results

Antibiotic duration decreased 23%. Time to start trophic feeds and time to full feeds decreased 33 and 16% respectively. Central line use dropped (98 to 72% of infants) and central line days were reduced by 59%.

Conclusion

Implementation of a mNEC QI package reduced antibiotic duration, time to full feeds, central line use and CL days.

### Clinical NEC prevention practices drive different microbiome profiles and functional responses in the preterm intestine [^7719a424]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

About eleven percent of all infants worldwide are born prematurely, i.e. before 37 weeks' gestation. Very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants (< 1500 g) are particularly vulnerable to acute and long-term clinical complications. Of particular concern is the development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a serious gastrointestinal threat that occurs in 7–11% of VLBW infants. In such cases, mortality can reach up to 30%.

NEC is a devastating multifactorial disease that is driven in part by perturbations of the microbiome, including colonization and overgrowth of certain microbes with potentially pathogenic potential such as Escherichia coli or Clostridium perfringens.

Given the rapid onset of NEC, a number of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) have developed specific NEC prophylaxis programmes that include the use of probiotics, antibiotics, and differentiated feeding protocols and that have resulted in a recent, substantial decrease in NEC rates in preterm infants.

Probiotic treatments are usually based on the use of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species. Bifidobacterium, in particular, is considered as an important member of the resident infant microbiome that is maintained into early childhood and promotes healthy infant development.

Antibiotics are administered intravenously at the first signs of infection to control early-onset sepsis. As a result, the majority of VLBW infants are exposed to antibiotics in the first few days of life and for extended periods of time. A number of publications have emphasized the need for responsible antibiotic usage in such vulnerable patients, as their use is associated with the risk of infection with multi-drug resistant (MDR) microorganismsand is believed to have other, largely unknown, long-term effects. Overall, antibiotic exposure is often considered as preventable.

Additionally, the use of enteral antibiotics may be effective as NEC prophylaxis. The findings of the Cochrane Neonatal Collaborative Review Groupsuggest that oral administration of prophylactic enteral antibiotics results in a statistically significant reduction in NEC and in NEC-related deaths in low-birth-weight preterm infants. However, the risks of enteral antibiotics have not yet been quantified; thus, this strategy has never been widely adopted due to concerns about the emergence of resistant bacteria and the absorption of antibiotics from the gut. However, such adverse effects have not been reported so far.

### Antibiotic use in acute upper respiratory tract infections… [^bb6f1df9]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

The most common pathogens are nontypeable H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis. 32 Viruses have been found in the respiratory secretions of patients with AOM and may account for many cases of antibiotic failure. 33–35 Group B streptococcus, gram-negative enteric bacteria, and Chlamydia trachomatis are common middle ear pathogens in infants up to eight weeks of age.
8. If there is no response to initial antibiotic therapy within 48 to 72 hours, the patient should be reexamined to confirm the diagnosis, and amoxicillin/clavulanate should be initiated. 7, 8 Ceftriaxone can be used as a second-line agent or in children with vomiting. 7 Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin/sulfisoxazole are not effective for the treatment of AOM. 7, 8 Longer courses of antibiotics have lower failure rates than shorter courses.
41.

Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis Approximately 90 percent of adults and 70 percent of children with pharyngitis have viral infections. 44–46 In those with bacterial cases of pharyngitis, the leading pathogen is group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Appropriate antibiotic treatment in these cases has been shown to decrease the risk of rheumatic fever, alleviate symptoms, and decrease communicability. 20, 45, 47 Antibiotic treatment does not prevent glomerulonephritis and has inconsistent results in the prevention of peritonsillar abscess. 20, 44. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends diagnostic testing to confirm group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection before initiating antibiotics to avoid overuse. 55, 56 The incidence of epiglottitis in children has decreased with the use of H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccines in early infancy.

13, 57 A combination of an intravenous antistaphylococcal agent that is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and a third-generation cephalosporin may be effective. 12 Intravenous monotherapy with ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin/sulbactam is also recommended. 13–15.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized infants. First classified through Bell staging in 1978, a number of additional definitions of NEC have been proposed in the subsequent decades. In this review, we summarize eight current definitions of NEC, and explore similarities and differences in clinical signs and radiographic features included within these definitions, as well as their limitations. We highlight the importance of a global consensus on defining NEC to improve NEC research and outcomes, incorporating input from participants at an international NEC conference. We also highlight the important role of patient-families in helping to redefine NEC.

### Neonatal complicated intraabdominal infection [^636eb53f]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to summarize the treatment of complicated intraabdominal infections (cIAIs) in premature infants.

Recent Findings

Recent work has continued to define the complex nature of cIAIs and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). This includes new findings on the microbiome, breast milk and risk factors associated with NEC. The treatment of cIAIs employs a combination of both surgical and medical treatment. Further look at what type and timing of surgical intervention is used as well as the ideal antibiotic regimen. Upcoming research is highlighted in future directions of NEC treatment.

Summary

cIAIs in premature infants is a challenging disease with more research needed to further delineate the pathophysiology and treatment options.

### Probiotics for the prevention of surgical necrotising enterocolitis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^15d61961]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common life-threatening surgical emergency affecting neonates, we still do not know how to prevent or medically treat the disease. Many infants with NEC may have surgery with the aim of removal of necrotic intestine. Although the indications for surgery are not well defined, radiological evidence for intestinal perforation is often regarded as an absolute indication for surgery, and many surgeons would operate for failure to improve, or clinical deterioration, in response to medical management such as cessation of enteral feeds, antibiotic treatment and supportive treatment. In the last few years, there has been a surge of interest in the potential role of probiotics to prevent NEC and this has resulted in the publication of many randomised controlled trials (RCT), followed by systematic reviews and meta-analyses of these RCTs. Some commentators have asserted that it is 'almost unethical' to withhold probiotic administration to all preterm infants in order to prevent NEC. As the type/strain, dose, duration and timing of probiotics are not standardised, others find the evidence less compelling. The American Pediatric Surgical Association Outcomes and Clinical Trials Committeeconsidered the level of evidence for routine probiotic supplementation and concluded that available data supported the routine supplementation of premature infants with probiotics although no conclusions could be drawn for the extremely low birth weight population (ie, those with the highest incidence of NEC) due to lack of data. However, most RCTs, and the systematic reviews and meta-analyses that result, focus on the development of confirmed NEC (ie, Bell's stage 2) and not on the potential effect of probiotic administration on surgical NEC. We focused on surgical NEC since there is general recognition that infants who are treated surgically have more advanced disease than those who are managed medically and importantly are noted to have worse outcomes including higher mortality, more frequent need for further surgery and greater long-term neurodevelopmental impairment. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to compare the effects of probiotic administration and placebo on surgical NEC in preterm infants.

### Management of neonates born at ≤ 34 6 / 7 weeks' gestation with suspected or proven early-onset bacterial sepsis [^51e79711]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship in preterm EOS management — empiric exposure and outcomes are summarized: Currently, most premature infants with very low birth weight (VLBW) are treated empirically with antibiotics for risk of EOS, often for prolonged periods, even without culture-confirmed infection, and prolonged empirical antibiotics are administered to approximately 35% to 50% of infants with a low gestational age. In a multicenter cohort of 4039 infants with a birth weight of < 1000 g, those who died or had necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) before discharge were significantly more likely to have received prolonged empirical antibiotics in the first week; the estimated risk of NEC increased by 7% for each additional day of antibiotics administered in the absence of a culture-confirmed infection. A single-center VLBW study estimated that NEC risk increased by 20% for each additional day of antibiotics administered without a culture-confirmed infection. Across 11 669 VLBW infants, higher antibiotic use during the first week after birth or during the entire hospitalization was associated with increased mortality, even after adjustment. Even among 5640 infants born at 22 to 28 weeks' gestation at a lower risk for EOS, prolonged empirical antibiotics in the first week after birth were associated with higher rates of death and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

### Risk factors for necrotizing enterocolitis: a prospective multicenter case-control study [^5a9f7261]. Neonatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The identification of independent clinical risk factors for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) may contribute to early selection of infants at risk, allowing for the development of targeted strategies aimed at the prevention of NEC.

Objective

The objective of this study was to identify independent risk factors contributing to the development of NEC in a large multicenter cohort.

Methods

This prospective cohort study was performed in 9 neonatal intensive care units. Infants born at a gestational age ≤ 30 weeks were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected daily until day 28 postnatally. Factors predictive of the development of NEC were identified using univariate and multivariable analyses in a 1: 5 matched case-control cohort.

Results

In total, 843 infants (56 NEC cases) were included in this study. In the case-control cohort, univariate analysis identified sepsis prior to the onset of NEC and formula feeding to be associated with an increased risk of developing NEC, whereas the administration of antibiotics directly postpartum was inversely associated with NEC. In a multivariable logistic regression model, enteral feeding type and the number of days parenterally fed remained statistically significantly associated with NEC, whereas the administration of antibiotics directly after birth was associated with a lower risk of developing NEC.

Conclusions

Formula feeding and prolonged (duration of) parenteral feeding were associated with an increased risk of NEC. Contrary to expectations, the initiation of treatment with antibiotics within 24 h after birth was inversely associated with NEC.

### Prolonged duration of initial empirical antibiotic treatment is associated with increased rates of necrotizing enterocolitis and death for extremely low birth weight infants [^4d2b33cd]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Our objectives were to identify factors associated with the duration of the first antibiotic course initiated in the first 3 postnatal days and to assess associations between the duration of the initial antibiotic course and subsequent necrotizing enterocolitis or death in extremely low birth weight infants with sterile initial postnatal culture results.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of extremely low birth weight infants admitted to tertiary centers in 1998–2001. We defined initial empirical antibiotic treatment duration as continuous days of antibiotic therapy started in the first 3 postnatal days with sterile culture results. We used descriptive statistics to characterize center practice, bivariate analyses to identify factors associated with prolonged empirical antibiotic therapy (≥ 5 days), and multivariate analyses to evaluate associations between therapy duration, prolonged empirical therapy, and subsequent necrotizing enterocolitis or death.

Results

Of 5693 extremely low birth weight infants admitted to 19 centers, 4039 (71%) survived > 5 days, received initial empirical antibiotic treatment, and had sterile initial culture results through the first 3 postnatal days. The median therapy duration was 5 days (range: 1–36 days); 2147 infants (53%) received prolonged empirical therapy (center range: 27%-85%). Infants who received prolonged therapy were less mature, had lower Apgar scores, and were more likely to be black. In multivariate analyses adjusted for these factors and center, prolonged therapy was associated with increased odds of necrotizing enterocolitis or death and of death. Each empirical treatment day was associated with increased odds of death, necrotizing enterocolitis, and the composite measure of necrotizing enterocolitis or death.

Conclusion

Prolonged initial empirical antibiotic therapy may be associated with increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis or death and should be used with caution.

### A comparison of sequelae after a practice change from vancomycin to ampicillin containing antibiotic regimens for necrotizing enterocolitis [^52920396]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare sequelae and acute kidney injury (AKI) occurrence among patients with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) after changing institutional guidelines replacing vancomycin with ampicillin for gram-positive coverage. This was a retrospective, single-center cohort analysis of patients from 2016–2020 (n = 73) with NEC at a surgical neonatal intensive care unit with a high community prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Multivariate logistic regression was utilized to assess associations. Twenty-five (34%) patients had at least 1 sequela related to NEC. Ampicillin containing regimens were not associated with any sequelae type or AKI. Postmenstrual age < 29 weeks at diagnosis ([OR] 5.8 [1.2–28.8], P = 0.03; and receipt of vasopressors [OR] 3.3 [1.1–10.2], P = 0.04) were independently associated with sequalae. Stage III NEC was independently associated with AKI, OR 10.6 (2–55.6), P = 0.005. In conclusion, ampicillin-containing regimens are effective for NEC management at our institution despite a high prevalence of MRSA.

### Core outcome set for necrotizing enterocolitis treatment trials [^32afff5d]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Variability in outcome reporting in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) treatment trials hinders conducting meta-analyses and implementing novel treatments. We aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS) for NEC treatment trials including outcome measures most relevant to patients and physicians, from NEC diagnosis to adulthood.

Methods

Clinicians and/or researchers from low-middle- and high-income countries were approached based on their scientific contributions to NEC literature, and patients and parents through local organizations. We presented participants with 45 outcomes used in NEC research, identified through a systematic review. To achieve consensus, outcomes were rated on a scale of 1 to 9 in 3 online Delphi rounds, and discussed at a final consensus meeting.

Results

Seventy-one participants from 25 countries completed all Delphi rounds, including 15 patients and family representatives. Thirteen outcomes reached consensus in one of the stakeholder groups and were included in the consensus meeting, 6 outcomes reached consensus in both groups. Twenty-seven participants from both high- and low-middle-income countries attended the online consensus meeting, including family representatives and NEC patients. After discussion and a final vote, 5 outcomes reached consensus to be included: mortality, NEC-related mortality, short bowel syndrome, quality of life, and neurodevelopmental impairment.

Conclusions

This NEC COS includes 5 predominantly long-term outcomes agreed upon by clinicians, patients, and family representatives. Use of this international COS will help standardize outcome selection in clinical trials, ensure these are relevant to those most affected by NEC care, and, ultimately, improve the care of infants with NEC.

### Challenges and opportunities for antibiotic stewardship among preterm infants [^8f0cd3b2]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2019). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship programmes aim to optimise antimicrobial use to prevent the emergence of resistance species and protect patients from the side effects of unnecessary medication. The high incidence of systemic infection and associated mortality from these infections leads neonatal providers to frequently initiate antibiotic therapy and make empiric antibiotic courses one of the main contributors of antibiotic use in the neonatal units. Yet, premature infants are also at risk for acute life-threatening complications associated with antibiotic use such as necrotising enterocolitis and for long-term morbidities such as asthma. In this review, we discuss specific aspects of antibiotic use in the very low birthweight preterm infants, with a focus on empiric use, that provide opportunities for stewardship practice. We discuss strategies to risk-stratify antibiotic initiation for the risk of early-onset sepsis, optimise empiric therapy duration and antibiotic choice in late-onset sepsis, and standardise decisions for stopping empiric therapy. Lastly, review the evolving role of biomarkers in antibiotic stewardship.

### Incidence of necrotising enterocolitis before and after introducing routine prophylacticandprobiotics [^3e9ccd65]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in premature very low birthweight (VLBW; < 1500 g) babies. Prevention of NEC is a top UK research priority.NEC aetiology is multifactorial, with abnormal gut microbiota increasingly recognised as central. Probiotics are ' live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host'. Multiple randomised controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs and observational studies have shown that prophylactic probiotics prevent NEC in preterm babies. A 2012 meta-analysis, updated in 2017 to include 25 RCTs and > 7000 neonates, showed strong evidence for using multispecies probiotics to reduce NEC incidence (pooled OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.53, p < 0.00001), and associated mortality (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.79, p = 0.0006). Yet at present most UK centres do not offer probiotics routinely. Uncertainties about effectiveness may arise from RCTs which have not shown benefit, heterogeneity, multiplicity, and dosage of probiotic microorganisms, differing inclusion criteria, treatment durations and NEC definitions used to assess benefit.

There are no published reports on the safety or efficacy of routine probiotics used in any UK centres. We therefore aimed to assess whether routine probiotic supplementation has been associated with a decreased incidence of NEC, sepsis, and all-cause mortality in our centre.

### Early use of antibiotics is associated with a lower incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm, very low birth weight infants: the NEOMUNE-neoNutriNet cohort study [^0f8cb5ba]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether commencement of antibiotics within 3 postnatal days in preterm, very low birth weight (VLBW; ≤ 1500 g) infants is associated with the development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).

Study Design

Preplanned statistical analyses were done to study the association between early antibiotic treatment and later NEC development, using the NEOMUNE-NeoNutriNet cohort of VLBW infants from 13 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in 5 continents (n = 2831). NEC incidence was compared between infants who received early antibiotics and those who did not, with statistical adjustments for NICU, gestational age, birth weight, sex, delivery mode, antenatal steroid use, Apgar score, and type and initiation of enteral nutrition.

Results

The incidence of NEC was 9.0% in the group of infants who did not receive early antibiotics (n = 269), compared with 3.9% in those who did receive early antibiotics (n = 2562). The incidence remained lower in the early antibiotic group after stepwise statistical adjustments for NICU (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.35–0.94, P < .05) and other potential confounders (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.12–0.47; P < .0001).

Conclusions

In this large international cohort of preterm VLBW infants, a small proportion of infants did not receive antibiotics just after birth, and these infants had a higher incidence of NEC. It is important to better understand the role of such variables as time, type, and duration of antibiotic treatment on NEC incidence, immune development, gut colonization, and antibiotic resistance in the NICU.

### Safety and effectiveness of probiotics in preterm infants with necrotizing enterocolitis [^fd0ba6d8]. NeoReviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Although necrotizing enterocolitis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among preterm infants, its underlying pathophysiology is not fully understood. Gut dysbiosis, an imbalance between commensal and pathogenic microbes, in the preterm infant is likely a major contributor to the development of necrotizing enterocolitis. In this review, we will discuss the increasing use of probiotics in the NICU, an intervention aimed to mitigate alterations in the gut microbiome. We will review the existing evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of probiotics, and their potential to reduce rates of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants.

### Antibiotic stewardship in a tertiary care NICU of Northern India: a quality improvement initiative [^2b7cd0c8]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are the most commonly used medication in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Sepsis being the leading cause of mortality and morbidity, globally as well as in India, the treatment and survival of newborn infants, in particular the premature, is hugely dependent on effective antibiotics. A risk-based approach with low threshold is often used for starting antibiotic in neonatal sepsis, which has been quite successful in lowering its incidence, but increased number of non-infected infants are exposed to antibiotics. Empiric therapy is often extended to five to 5–7 days even in the absence of positive blood cultures. Infants commonly present with non-specific systemic signs suggestive of infection, leading to the frequent use of broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics in infants who are subsequently found to be uninfected. Unreliable clinical signs, disastrous outcome in case of delayed start of antibiotic treatment and reluctance to withdraw initiated treatment often result in overuse of antibiotics in NICU.

Antibiotics are powerful, life-saving drugs, but when used inappropriately, they may have serious adverse effects. Prolonged empirical antibiotic use among preterm infants with negative cultures has been associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidities such as late-onset sepsis (LOS), necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), > stage 3 retinopathy of prematurity, emergence of fungal infections and multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO), and also poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Antibiotic overuse causes disruption of the microbiome, which may have lasting consequences reflected as dysbiosis, increased carriage of antibiotic resistance genes and MDROs. Each additional day of antibiotic exposure in the absence of positive blood cultures increases the risk of NEC in very low birthweight (VLBW) babies 7%–20%.

In a recent study, Flannery et al demonstrated that 78.6% of VLBW and 87% of extremely low birthweight (ELBW) infants were treated with antibiotics in their first days of life. Additionally, as per a meta-analysis, 26·5% of VLBW and 37·8% of ELBW infants received more than 5 days of antibiotic treatment.

### Antibiotic use during pregnancy: how bad is it? [^ce0e5fe7]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Antibiotic use in pregnancy - an opinion

Perhaps the most clinically relevant aspect of the pregnancy microbiome is antibiotic treatment during pregnancy. Antibiotics account for 80% of all prescribed medication in pregnancy, yet surprisingly, few published human studies have carefully evaluated the direct effects of antibiotics during pregnancy on either the maternal or fetal microbiome, or evaluated long-term sequelae of such antibiotic use. Thus, there may be a reason for caution in prescribing antibiotics during pregnancy.

In pregnant NOD mice, antibiotic treatment caused alteration of gut microbiota and immunological changes in the intestine of the offspring. In pregnant women, it was demonstrated that antibiotic administration during pregnancy leads to alterations in the vaginal microbiome prior to birth, with long-term effects on the early microbial colonization of the newborn and an association with childhood obesity.

There are several components to this issue. Antibiotic treatment of infectious diseases is one of the greatest advances of modern medicine. Accordingly, antibiotics are widely prescribed during pregnancy as the most important modality for treating and preventing infections. It is estimated that one in five pregnant women in Europe is prescribed at least one antibiotic during pregnancy; in the United States, the rate is double. Nevertheless, prescription of antibiotics should be carefully considered on an individual basis, weighing its benefits versus drawbacks for both the fetus and the mother. It has been shown that administration of certain antibiotics is linked to a significantly higher rate of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis, although antibiotic treatment is also associated with a reduced rate of lung complications and major cerebral abnormalities, relative to non-antibiotic treated controls. A more recent study published in 2008 demonstrated that the prescription of antibiotics for women in spontaneous preterm labor with intact membranes was associated with an increased risk of cerebral palsy and functional impairment among their children at 7 years of age.

### Survey on surgical treatment of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis in China 2022 [^0827d43e]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated CRP levels are common signs in infants with NEC. The great majority of surgeons indeed relied on these parameters for the assessment of severity in our study. It is noteworthy that surgeons have paid less attention to hyponatremia because it is an independent predictor of bowel ischemia and reflects the severity of inflammation. Interpretation of electrolyte disorders should be given more attention.WBC, CRP, PCT, and IL-6 are all non-specific mediators of inflammation; CRP is the most commonly used biomarker as a late-warning biomarker, whereas IL-6, an early-warning biomarker, has not been frequently employed in clinical settings because many hospitals do not have relevant detection capability. Since the cut-off values for fecal calprotectin cannot be identified and it is significantly influenced by gestational and postnatal age, it is rarely used in routine clinical practice.

No agreement has been achieved about the empirical use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for medical NEC, which is also represented in the questionnaire. According to the severity of the disease, antibiotics should be applied for 7–14 days, varying from 7–10 days for mild cases to 10–14 days for severe cases. Currently, ampicillin, gentamycin, and metronidazole are widely used abroad, while carbapenems, penicillin and cephalosporins, and nitroimidazole are the most used antibiotics in China. There is no consensus on the best combination of antibiotics. Aminoglycosides are not commonly used in China due to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Another essential component of treatment is fasting, which is typically advised for 7–10 days. Some surgeons would choose to fast for a shorter period of time. Currently, some studies indicate that fasting for fewer than 7 days does not increase the risk of NEC recurrence, intestinal stenosis, or mortality in infants with non-surgical NEC.

### Clinical vignettes provide an understanding of antibiotic prescribing practices in neonatal intensive care units [^3ac5f1b8]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To use clinical vignettes to understand antimicrobial prescribing practices in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).

Design

Vignette-based survey.

Setting

Four tertiary care NICUs.

Participants

Antibiotic prescribers in NICUs.

Methods

Clinicians from 4 tertiary care NICUs completed an anonymous survey containing 12 vignettes that described empiric, targeted, or prophylactic antibiotic use. Responses were compared with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for appropriate use.

Results

Overall, 161 (59% of 271 eligible respondents) completed the survey, 37% of whom had worked in NICUs for 7 or more years. Respondents were more likely to appropriately identify use of targeted therapy for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, that is, use of oxacillin rather than vancomycin, than for Escherichia coli, that is, use of first-generation rather than third-generation cephalosporin, (P < .01). Increased experience significantly predicted appropriate prescribing (P = 0.02). The proportion of respondents choosing appropriate duration of postsurgical prophylaxis (P < .01) and treatment for necrotizing enterocolitis differed by study site (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

The survey provides insight into antibiotic prescribing practices and informs the development of future antibiotic stewardship interventions for NICUs.

### Survey on surgical treatment of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis in China 2022 [^6f1a98fc]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to identify the state of surgical treatment of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in China.

Methods

A total of 246 delegates (88.0% senior surgeons) completed a survey sent by the Neonatal Surgery Group of the Pediatric Surgery Branch of the Chinese Medical Association in 2022. Five centers were eliminated due to lack of experience.

Results

Generally, 38.2% of surgeons work in centers where more than 20 cases of surgical NEC are treated per year. A total of 81.3% of surgeons reported the use of ultrasonography; the most used biomarkers were white blood cell count (95.9%), C-reactive protein (93.8%), and procalcitonin (76.3%). Most surgeons (80.9%) used a combination of two (67.2%) antibiotics or single (29.5%) antibiotic for a treatment period of 7–14 days, and most used antibiotics were carbapenems (73.9%), penicillin and cephalosporins (56.0%). Patients are issued the fasting order for 5–7 days by nearly half surgeons (49.8%) for conservative treatment. 70.1% of surgeons deemed that the most difficult decision was to evaluate the optimal timing of surgery. Most surgeons (76.3%) performed diagnostic aspiration of peritoneal fluid. Laparoscopy was performed for the diagnosis and/or treatment of NEC by 40.2% of surgeons. A total of 53.5% of surgeons reported being able to identify localized intestinal necrosis preoperatively. Surgeons relied the most on pneumoperitoneum (94.2%) and failure of conservative treatment (88.8%) to evaluate the surgical indications. At laparotomy, surgical treatments vary according to NEC severity. Infants are fasted for 5–7 days by 55.2% of surgeons postoperatively. Most surgeons (91.7%) followed up with patients with NEC after discharge for up to 5 years (53.8%).

Conclusions

The most difficult aspect of surgical NEC is evaluating the timing of surgery, and surgeons in the children's specialized hospitals are experienced. The treatment of NEC totalis is controversial, and the indications for laparoscopy need to be further clarified. More multicenter prospective studies are needed to develop surgical guidelines in the future.

### Evidence-based practices reduce necrotizing enterocolitis and improve nutrition outcomes in very low-birth-weight infants [^a856e288]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common gastrointestinal emergency in preterm infants. Survivors may suffer both short- and long-term morbidities. Current evidence suggests that the incidence of NEC can be reduced by standardizing the care delivery in addressing key risk factors including an altered gut microbiome, use of formula milk, hyperosmolar feeds, and unrestricted use of high-risk medications METHODS: Since 2014, the department has a workgroup who analyzed all cases of NEC within a month of diagnosis to identify preventable risk factors. Existing evidence-based quality improvement strategies were revised and new ones were implemented sequentially over the next 4 years. These strategies include (1) a standardized feeding protocol, (2) early initiation of enteral feeding using human milk, (3) optimization of the osmolality of preterm milk feeds using standardized dilution guidelines for additives, and (4) promotion of healthy microbiome by use of probiotics, early oral care with colostrum and by restricting high-risk medications and prolonged use of empirical antibiotics RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of the patients including sex, gestational age, and birth weight were similar during the study period. After implementing the evidence-based practices successively over 4 years, the incidence of NEC in very- low birth-weight (VLBW) infants dropped from 7% in 2014 to 0% (P < .001) in 2018. The duration of parenteral nutrition, use of central line, and days to full feeds were also reduced significantly (P < .05) CONCLUSION: Adopting evidence-based best practices resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of NEC and improved the nutrition outcomes in VLBW infants.

### Probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea [^66003520]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Probiotics are increasingly used for prevention and treatment of diarrhea more in children than in adults. Given the broad spectrum of diarrhea, this review focuses on the main etiologies: acute gastroenteritis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). For each, we reviewed randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and guidelines. For acute gastroenteritis we found 12 guidelines: 5 recommended probiotics and 7 did not. However, the guidelines containing positive recommendations provided proof of evidence from clinical trials and meta-analyses. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Saccharomyces boulardii had the most compelling evidence of efficacy as they reduced the duration of the disease by 1 day. For AAD 4 meta-analyses were found, reporting variable efficacy of probiotics in preventing diarrhea, based on the setting, patient's age, and antibiotics. The most effective strains were LGG and S. boulardii. For NEC, we found 3 randomized controlled trials, 5 meta-analyses, and 4 position papers. Probiotics reduced the risk of NEC enterocolitis and mortality in preterm babies. Guidelines did not support a routine use of probiotics and asked for further data for such sensitive implications. In conclusion, there is strong and solid proof of efficacy of probiotics as active treatment of gastroenteritis in addition to rehydration. There is solid evidence that probiotics have some efficacy in prevention of AAD, but the number needed to treat is an issue. For both etiologies LGG and S. boulardii have the strongest evidence. In NEC the indications are more debated, yet on the basis of available data and their implications, probiotics should be carefully considered.

### Grading the evidence to identify strategies to modify risk for necrotizing enterocolitis [^f9abd21e]. Pediatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Although risk for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is often presented from the perspective of a premature infant's vulnerability to nonmodifiable risk factors, in this paper we describe the evidence and present recommendations to manage modifiable risks that are amenable to clinical actions. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria, we present recommendations in the context of their supporting evidence in a way that balances risks (e.g. potential harm, cost) and benefits. Across the prenatal, intrapartum, early and late clinical course, strategies to limit NEC risk in premature infants are presented. Our goal is to summarize modifiable NEC risk factors, grade the evidence to offer quality improvement (QI) targets for healthcare teams and offer a patient-family advocate's perspective on how to engage parents to recognize and reduce NEC risk.

### Reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in the neonatal intensive care unit (SCOUT): a prospective interrupted time-series study [^3c59d45d]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are used frequently in the neonatal intensive care unit. We aimed to inform antibiotic stewardship strategies in a level 3 neonatal intensive care unit by surveillance and assessment of all antibiotic use during a 14-month period, identifying scenarios where antibiotic use can be reduced, and implementing interventions while monitoring safety.

Methods

The SCOUT study is an observational study in the level 3 neonatal intensive care unit at Parkland Hospital, Dallas, TX, USA. All antibiotic use in infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit between March 1, 2012, and Nov 30, 2012 (9 months), was monitored and analysed. After the baseline period (Oct 3, 2011, to Nov 30, 2012), continuation of empirical antibiotic therapy for ruled-out sepsis courses beyond 48 h, pneumonia, and "culture-negative" sepsis were selected as targets for antibiotic stewardship interventions. During the intervention period (Oct 1, 2013, to June 30, 2014), empirical antibiotic therapy was set to discontinue after 48 h in the electronic medical record and the duration of therapy for pneumonia and culture-negative sepsis was limited to 5 days. Antibiotic use, defined as days of therapy per 1000 patient-days, was compared between the baseline and intervention periods. The primary outcome was the change in total antibiotic days of therapy per 1000 patient-days between the baseline and intervention periods. Safety outcomes measured were instances in which infants received 5 or more days of therapy and subsequently had antibiotic therapy reinstituted within 14 days for any indication; a composite of late-onset sepsis, necrotising enterocolitis (modified Bell stage ≥ 2), or death in infants 32 weeks' gestation or younger; prevalence of multidrug-resistant organism colonisation; and length of hospital stay.

Findings

2502 infants were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit during the two study periods (1607 in the baseline period and 895 in the intervention period). Antibiotic use declined from 343·2 days of therapy per 1000 patient-days during the baseline period to 252·2 days of therapy per 1000 patient-days in the intervention period (p < 0·0001), representing an overall decrease of 27%. No difference in safety outcomes was observed between the intervention and baseline periods.

Interpretation

Thorough assessment of antibiotic consumption in a neonatal intensive care unit can inform high-yield stewardship targets tailored to the individual centre. Effective interventions to reduce antibiotic use can then be designed and implemented in a collaborative manner.

### Necrotising enterocolitis [^eaa29703]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Necrotising enterocolitis is one of the most common gastrointestinal emergencies in newborn infants. Here we review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and pathophysiology of the disease, as well as strategies for diagnosis, management, and prevention. Necrotising enterocolitis is one of the most devastating and unpredictable diseases affecting premature infants. Despite decades of research, its pathogenesis remains unclear; diagnosis can be difficult; and treatment is challenging. We will need to improve our understanding of intestinal defences in premature infants, dietary and bacterial factors, and genetic effects that could predispose infants to necrotising enterocolitis before we can develop new strategies for prevention and treatment.
