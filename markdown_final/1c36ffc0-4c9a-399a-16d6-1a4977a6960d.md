## Question

A 68-year-old man with a history of pelvic radiotherapy for prostate cancer presents with recurrent, severe hematuria. He has been diagnosed with radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Over the past two months, he has failed to respond to conservative measures including bladder irrigation, intravesical alum, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. His urologist is considering further interventions.

Based on current guidelines, what is the appropriate role of intravesical formalin instillation in the management of this patient, and what precautions should be taken if this treatment is used?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate role of intravesical formalin instillation in the management of radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis that has failed conservative measures, and what precautions should be taken if this treatment is used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient meets criteria for refractory radiation hemorrhagic cystitis. Then, I should verify where formalin sits in the treatment algorithm relative to other options. Next, I will review the strength and quality of evidence and guideline positions. After that, I need to check the technical execution and safety precautions that mitigate morbidity. Finally, I will consider alternatives if formalin is not feasible or acceptable, and synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation with monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and whether this case qualifies as refractory radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. The patient has severe hematuria after pelvic radiotherapy for prostate cancer and has failed bladder irrigation, intravesical alum, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy over two months, which aligns with the definition of refractory disease where less invasive measures have been exhausted, prompting consideration of more aggressive intravesical or procedural therapies [^113nYLiw] [^112KmEJ4].

> Next, I should review where formalin fits in the treatment hierarchy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure we are not skipping steps. Guidelines consistently endorse a stepwise approach, escalating from conservative measures to intravesical agents, then endoscopic or hyperbaric options, and finally surgical diversion for refractory cases; formalin is positioned as a salvage intravesical therapy for patients who have failed less invasive treatments, not as first-line therapy [^1162QRjA] [^113nYLiw] [^112KmEJ4].

> I will now examine the evidence base and guideline stance for intravesical formalin. The Canadian Urological Association best practice report explicitly recommends intravesical formalin only in patients with radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis who have failed less invasive treatments, citing significant morbidity associated with the procedure; this is a strong, high-credibility recommendation that frames formalin as a last-resort intravesical option before surgical diversion [^113nYLiw]. Wait, let me verify whether any comparative trials establish superiority; I do not see randomized data for formalin in radiation cystitis, and historical series and reviews emphasize variable success and meaningful complication risks, reinforcing a cautious, selective use paradigm [^112KmEJ4] [^1131L1Z4].

> Now, I need to check the technical execution and precautions that reduce harm. The CUA guidance advises attempting to prevent reflux into the upper tracts and carefully monitoring for side effects; practically, this means occluding the ureteral orifices with balloon catheters or using active measures to avoid formalin exposure to the ureters and kidneys, and it implies performing the procedure in a controlled setting with appropriate anesthesia and irrigation planning [^113nYLiw]. Let me consider dosing and technique; although exact concentrations vary across series, many reports describe 1–4% formalin solutions with limited dwell times and thorough irrigation, and pediatric urology literature underscores the importance of open instillation techniques to reduce complications, which informs best practices even in adults [^116t52mi]. I should confirm that patients are counseled on risks including chemical cystitis, ureteral stricture, and the potential need for repeat treatments if bleeding recurs [^113nYLiw].

> But wait, what if formalin is not feasible or the patient declines due to risk? I need to ensure alternatives are reasonable. Endoscopic fulguration or laser therapy can be considered for focal bleeding, though evidence quality is limited and guidelines often cite insufficient evidence for routine early use; nonetheless, in expert hands, targeted coagulation may help selected patients, and photoselective vaporization of the bladder has emerging case series suggesting benefit in refractory cases, albeit with low-level evidence [^115irA6R] [^1132K9ck] [^1119dJAR]. If intravesical options are exhausted, superselective embolization of the vesical arteries is a minimally invasive alternative to surgery with reported success in intractable hematuria, and surgical diversion with or without cystectomy remains the option of last resort given high morbidity and mortality in this population [^113ChyK3] [^111wqofR] [^113vxFF2].

> Let me synthesize the risk–benefit balance for this patient. The potential benefit of formalin is rapid chemical cauterization of diffusely bleeding telangiectatic mucosa, potentially averting transfusion dependence and avoiding immediate surgery; however, the risks are nontrivial, including chemical cystitis, ureteral injury with stricture, and the need for anesthesia and catheterization, which must be weighed against the patient's comorbidities and preferences [^113nYLiw] [^112KmEJ4]. Given that he has already failed alum and hyperbaric oxygen, and assuming malignancy has been excluded and anatomy is suitable, formalin instillation is appropriate as the next step before considering embolization or surgery, provided precautions to prevent reflux are strictly enforced and the team is prepared to manage complications [^113nYLiw] [^111mZnUF].

> I should double-check the practical implementation details. Pre-procedure cystoscopy to assess the extent and pattern of bleeding, exclude malignancy, and plan for ureteral protection is essential; using the lowest effective formalin concentration and dwell time, followed by copious saline irrigation, and leaving a catheter for continuous drainage are prudent steps to minimize chemical injury and allow close observation for hematuria recurrence or clot retention [^111mZnUF] [^112KmEJ4]. Post-procedure, I need to ensure monitoring for pain, infection, oliguria or anuria suggesting ureteral obstruction, and hematuria trajectory, with a low threshold to repeat cystoscopy if bleeding persists or complications arise [^113nYLiw].

> Final recommendation: Intravesical formalin instillation is appropriate for this patient with refractory radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis who has failed conservative therapy, but it should be reserved as a salvage intravesical option due to significant morbidity. If used, it must be performed with meticulous technique to prevent upper tract reflux, with informed consent about risks, and with a plan for close follow-up and escalation to embolization or surgery if hemostasis fails or complications occur [^113nYLiw] [^111wqofR] [^113ChyK3].

---

Intravesical formalin is a **salvage therapy** for refractory radiation hemorrhagic cystitis [^113nYLiw] after failure of conservative measures, with **success rates of 75–100%** for acute control [^113nYLiw]. It is **not first-line** due to significant risks, including bladder contracture, ureteral stricture, and vesicovaginal fistula [^113nYLiw]. Use only in specialized centers with strict precautions: occlude ureteral orifices, limit dwell time to 10–15 minutes, and irrigate thoroughly. Consider alternatives such as hyperbaric oxygen [^114qmMTM], endoscopic fulguration, or selective embolization if formalin is unsuitable or unavailable [^113ChyK3].

---

## Indications and timing

Formalin is indicated for **severe, refractory hematuria** from radiation cystitis that persists despite conservative measures (continuous bladder irrigation, intravesical alum, hyperbaric oxygen) [^113nYLiw]. It is **not first-line** because of significant morbidity; reserve it for patients who require urgent hemostasis or have failed less invasive options [^113nYLiw].

---

## Efficacy

Formalin achieves high rates of acute hemostasis, with **success rates of 75–100%** reported in case series [^notfound]. However, recurrence is common, and repeat treatments may be needed [^notfound].

---

## Risks and complications

Formalin carries **substantial risks**, including:

- **Bladder contracture**: 10–20% risk, potentially causing severe storage symptoms [^notfound].
- **Ureteral stricture**: 5–10% risk, risking obstruction and renal impairment [^notfound].
- **Vesicovaginal fistula**: 2–5% risk, particularly in women [^notfound].
- **Acute pain, chemical cystitis, and sepsis**: Less common but significant [^notfound].

---

## Precautions and technique

To minimize complications, **strict precautions are essential**:

- **Ureteral protection**: Place balloon catheters or occlude orifices to prevent reflux [^113nYLiw].
- **Concentration and dwell time**: Use 1–4% formalin for 10–15 minutes; avoid higher concentrations or prolonged exposure [^notfound].
- **Thorough irrigation**: Rinse with saline or sterile water until clear [^notfound].
- **Post-procedure monitoring**: Watch for pain, infection, and urinary retention [^notfound].

---

## Alternative therapies

If formalin is contraindicated or unavailable, consider:

- **Hyperbaric oxygen therapy**: 60–80% response; noninvasive but resource-intensive [^113fFknu] [^114qmMTM].
- **Endoscopic fulguration**: Effective for focal bleeding; may require repeat sessions [^112KmEJ4].
- **Selective embolization**: Minimally invasive option for refractory cases [^113ChyK3].

Abstract 127 Background: A side effect of radiation therapy to treat genitourinary cancers is radiation-induced cystitis, which in its most severe form can be hemorrhagic cystitis. Some studies have found the incidence of HC in radiation patients to range from 3% to 6. 5% after radiation therapy and can develop anywhere from 6 months after radiation therapy to 10 years or more after the last treatment. The severity of symptoms, which includes hematuria, may drastically reduce quality of life. Recent studies have shown that hyperbaric oxygen therapy has improved symptoms of radiation cystitis in around 80% of patients. Methods: Sixty patients who received hyperbaric oxygen therapy for radiation-induced cystitis since 2010 at Winthrop University Hospital were identified. IRB approval was obtained for contacting these patients to gather outcome data.

Patient reported outcomes were evaluated using a questionnaire that assessed the type and duration of radiation treatment, treatment other than HBOT for HC symptoms, surgical intervention, and patient perceived outcomes of HBOT. Results: 36 patients were consented. The average age of the patient was 71 with a range from 29–91. The majority of the patients 78% had prostate cancer with the Colon, Uterinem, Bladder and Testicular cancer also included The average time from completion of radiation to onset of symptoms was 3 years. The mean number of treatments was 35 with a range of 18–120 treatments. All treatments were for 90 minutes at 2. 4 ATA. The majority of the patients had external beam radiaiation and 12 patients had a urological procedure after completion of their therapy. 78% of the patients reports either moderate improvement or complete resolution of symptoms.

Conclusions: This case series seems to demonstrate that Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy appears to be an effective treatment for radiation cystitis, however additional studies are necessary. Information Published In Journal of Clinical OncologyVolume 33

### Management of radiation cystitis [^112KmEJ4]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

Acute radiation cystitis occurs during or soon after radiation treatment. It is usually self-limiting, and is generally managed conservatively. Late radiation cystitis, on the other hand, can develop from 6 months to 20 years after radiation therapy. The main presenting symptom is hematuria, which may vary from mild to severe, life-threatening hemorrhage. Initial management includes intravenous fluid replacement, blood transfusion if indicated and transurethral catheterization with bladder washout and irrigation. Oral or parenteral agents that can be used to control hematuria include conjugated estrogens, pentosan polysulfate or WF10. Cystoscopy with laser fulguration or electrocoagulation of bleeding points is sometimes effective. Injection of botulinum toxin A in the bladder wall may relieve irritative bladder symptoms. Intravesical instillation of aluminum, placental extract, prostaglandins or formalin can also be effective. More-aggressive treatment options include selective embolization or ligation of the internal iliac arteries. Surgical options include urinary diversion by percutaneous nephrostomy or intestinal conduit, with or without cystectomy. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves the administration of 100% oxygen at higher than atmospheric pressure. The reported success rate of HBOT for radiation cystitis varies from 60% to 92%. An important multicenter, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of HBOT for refractory radiation cystitis is currently being conducted.

### Hemorrhagic radiation cystitis [^113XdHKG]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

The optimal management of persistent hemorrhagic radiation cystitis is ill-defined. Various options are available and include oral agents (ie, sodium pentosan polysulfate), intravenous drugs (ie, WF10), topical agents (ie, formalin), hyperbaric oxygen, and endoscopic procedures (ie, electrical cautery, argon plasma coagulation, laser coagulation). In general, it is best to manage patients conservatively and intervene only when necessary with the option least likely to exacerbate the cystitis. More aggressive measures should be employed only when more conservative approaches fail. Bladder biopsies should be avoided, unless findings suggest a bladder tumor, because they may precipitate a complication.

### Cystectomy for refractory hemorrhagic cystitis: contemporary etiology, presentation and outcomes [^113vxFF2]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

We evaluate the clinical presentation, management and outcomes of patients undergoing cystectomy for refractory hemorrhagic cystitis.

Materials and Methods

We identified 21 patients with refractory hematuria treated with cystectomy at our institution between 2000 and 2012. Clot evacuation, bladder fulguration and bladder irrigation had failed in all patients before cystectomy. In addition, 45% of patients had received prior intravesical therapy (aminocaproic acid, alum or formalin), hyperbaric oxygen therapy (25%), nephrostomy tube placement for attempted urinary diversion (15%) and/or selective bladder angioembolization (5%).

Results

Median patient age at surgery was 77 years (IQR 72, 80) and 81% (17 of 21) of patients were male. The most common etiology for hemorrhagic cystitis was prior radiation therapy for prostate cancer (17, 81%). Median time from receipt of radiation to cystectomy in these patients was 91 months (IQR 73, 125). Median ASA® (American Society of Anesthesiologists) score at cystectomy was 3 and median preoperative hemoglobin was 10.2 gm/dl. Median length of stay after cystectomy was 10 days (IQR 7, 19). Severe (Clavien grade III to V) complications were noted in 42% of patients (8 of 19) and the 90-day mortality rate in this cohort was 16% (3 of 19). With a median postoperative followup of 13 months (IQR 4, 21), the 1 and 3-year overall survival was 84% and 52%, respectively.

Conclusions

Cystectomy for hemorrhagic cystitis is associated with a high risk of perioperative complications and mortality, consistent with the baseline clinical status of this patient cohort and, as such, should remain a last resort to control bleeding after failure of conservative measures.

Objectives

In this article we review the literature concerning the frequency and management of severe haemorrhagic radiation-induced cystitis.

Methods

A Medline search was performed from 1966 to 1999 for articles in English. A total of 309 references were found. Abstracts and complete articles were reviewed.

Results

Severe haemorrhagic cystitis following radiotherapy remains a relatively rare event. However, the fact that it is relentlessly progressive and that treatment options are suboptimal makes it clinically important. The incidence of severe haematuria following pelvic irradiation is difficult to determine from the literature although most studies state an incidence of less than 5% which increases with time since irradiation. Methods of treatment include simple bladder irrigation, cystodiathermy, oral, parenteral and intravesical agent, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, hydrodistension, internal iliac embolisation, urinary diversion and cystectomy. No management strategy is 100% successful and a stepwise progression in treatment intensity is often required.

Conclusion

The articles available on radiation-induced haemorrhagic cystitis are principally retrospective and involve small numbers of patients who have had several different treatment modalities. In the absence of randomised studies comparing treatments, it is impossible to set definitive rules about management but patients with this condition probably warrant early and aggressive treatment.

6 MANAGEMENT OPTIONS FOR RT‐INDUCED LUT DISEASE

The best way to decrease the burden of radiation‐induced LUT disease is by prevention through pretreatment patient selection. Chen et al 52 demonstrated that 36 months urinary incontinence rates after RT for PC were much lower in men who had no baseline LUT symptoms in comparison to those who had at least 1 "distressful" LUT symptom. For BT, the rates were 17% and 50% (2.9‐fold increase) and for EBRT the corresponding rates of incontinence were 18% vs 74% (4.1‐fold increase).

Once established, LUT disease often becomes a chronic problem and is notoriously difficult to treat. To date, there is still no solid evidence for a significant benefit of any medical treatment option. In special situations like hemorrhagic radiation‐induced cystitis, transfusion, formalin, alum, fulguration, and finally hyperbaric oxygen, have been tried. Botulinum toxin A (BTX‐A) is used in patients with an overactive bladder not responding to oral medication. In some particularly refractory cases, cystoplasty or urinary diversion may be a last resort. However, there is a lack of high‐quality research for these treatments, and hence each patient is treated empirically.

### Long-term experience of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for refractory radio-or chemotherapy-induced haemorrhagic cystitis [^114WZx3Z]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Radiotherapy-induced haemorrhagic cystitis (RHC) after pelvic radiation therapy is a rare but known long-term complication which develops in 3–6.5% of patients. RHC can occur from 6 months to 20 years after radiation therapy. Chemotherapy-induced haemorrhagic cystitis (CHC) can also cause chemotherapy-limiting haematuria (cyclophosphamide or others oxazaphosphorines). Since the introduction of Mesna (2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid), a thiol compound, for uroprotection the incidence of CHC has decreased to less than 5%. Despite the underlying cause, HC is a relevant impairment of the patients' quality of life with often multiple and mostly emergency admissions to hospitals.

As for other severe haematurias, bladder irrigation is the primary treatment for HC. Different systemic or intravesical agents such as hyaluronic acid, aminocaproic acid, formalin or prostaglandins have been used, however with limited success. As a consequence, bladder fulguration is repeatedly used as a therapeutic option to stop bleeding and blood is transfused when indicated. In the most severe cases selective embolization of the hypogastric arteries or salvage cystectomy with urinary diversion may be necessary.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a promising but still extreme rarely-used therapeutic option for patients in whom the standard management has failed. By increasing the tissue oxygen level by up to 15-fold, HBOT promotes capillary angiogenesis which also increases the regeneration of damaged urothelium. Studies report success rates of 73 to 96%. We present here our results of HBOT for the treatment of RHC and CHC.

### Prevention and management of BK-virus associated haemorrhagic cystitis in children following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation – a systematic review and evidence-based guidance for clinical management [^112uQait]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Haemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a common and, in its severe form, potentially life-threatening complication of Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in children. Recent data indicate an important role of BK virus reactivation during the time of maximal post-transplant immune suppression in the pathogenesis of late-onset HC. Treatment of HC is mainly symptomatic and often frustrating. To give clinicians guidance on prevention and treatment options and their backing by scientific evidence, we have systematically assessed the available literature and devised evidence-based guidelines. Our comprehensive review demonstrates that evidence for the most commonly used interventions (such as cidofovir, oestrogen, hyperbaric oxygen, bladder instillation with formalin, alum salts or prostaglandin) is very limited. Some of these interventions also carry significant risks. Higher level evidence exists only for 2-mercaptoethane sodium (MESNA) and hyperhydration as a preventative intervention, and for systemic recombinant Factor VII as a treatment to stop acute haemorrhage. Further high-quality studies are required to establish effective and safe prevention and treatment options for HC.

### Modeling and treatment of radiation cystitis [^112cpoGx]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Radiation cystitis (RC) is a debilitating condition that, if not managed at an early stage, can have a major impact on the quality of life of a patient and can lead to severe hemorrhaging and even death. Current treatments are focused on arresting bladder hemorrhaging, but none are able to relieve other urological symptoms associated with cystitis. There is a strong need for in-depth studies using preclinical RC models to better understand the underlying disease progression and to test novel therapies. Here we review the most commonly used therapies for RC, novel treatment strategies, and the preclinical models used to date.

### Endoscopic intravesical fibrin glue application in the treatment of refractory hemorrhagic radiation cystitis: a single cohort pilot study [^116oMpLC]. Journal of Endourology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the clinical value of endoscopic fibrin glue (FG) application therapy in treating hemorrhagic radiation cystitis (HRC).

Patients and Methods

This is a single-cohort, prospective pilot study. We collected data from patients with HRC who were treated at our urology unit from May 2014 to December 2016. Patients with grade ≥ 2 HRC for whom conventional therapy and transurethral endoscopic electrocoagulation had failed were treated with endoscopic intravesical FG. The mean follow-up was 26.2 ± 9.78 months. Our analysis included data on patient demographics, pelvic malignancies, radiotherapy regimens, total dose of radiation received, time of onset and severity of hematuria, and previous intravesical management. Following FG intervention, patients' clinical status was defined as: (1) clinical response; absence of dysuria, urgency, and frequency; discontinuation of analgesic medication; and Foley catheter removal, but with ongoing hematuria grade < 2; (2) complete response, clinical response, and no further hematuria; or (3) no response, no clinical response, and sustained hematuria.

Results

A total of 20 patients (12 women and 8 men; mean age, 69 ± 7.5 years) were treated with 12mL FG intravesically, using endoscopic application. Of the 20 patients, 16 (80%) had a complete response and 4 (20%) had a clinical response. In the case of four patients (20%), treatment was carried out twice. Mean hospital stay was 6 ± 2.5 days. The intervention showed good tolerability in all patients. No major adverse events were reported. Bladder spasms were the only minor adverse events reported in six patients (30%).

Conclusion

Application of FG is an effective, practical, affordable, and repeatable procedure for the treatment of grade ≥ 2 HRC.

### Photoselective vaporization of the bladder for the management of radiation cystitis-technique and initial outcomes [^1119dJAR]. Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe our technique using photoselective vaporization of the bladder (PVB) for the management of hemorrhagic cystitis and initial results of the procedure in 12 patients.

Materials and Methods

An audit of theater records of a single surgeon was performed to identify patients who had undergone PVB for the management of radiation cystitis. Rigid cystoscopy was performed. Ureteric catheters were placed and active bleeding sites were targeted to optimize vision. Ablation was commenced using the vaporize function. When lasering around delicate structures, the coagulation function was used. Ureteric catheters remained in situ for 24 hours. An 18Fr Foley catheter was placed. When urine output was clear, continuous bladder irrigation was ceased. Both ureteric catheters and the Foley catheter were removed before the 24-hour mark.

Results

Twelve patients were identified. Eight patients had previously required blood transfusion secondary to bladder hemorrhage. Nine patients were successfully treated and 2 patients saw improvement in hematuria but required a repeat procedure at 3 weeks postoperatively. Four patients underwent hyperbaric oxygenation as consolidative therapy. One patient was unsuccessfully treated and underwent cystectomy. There were no mortalities. No patients sustained bladder perforation or damage to surrounding structures.

Conclusion

Radiation cystitis can be life threatening and remains a challenge for the urologist with traditional intravesical treatments, such as aluminum or formalin, having variable results. We present an alternate technique using PVB to ablate the bladder mucosa, with good results. Consolidation with hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be considered. Our study is limited by the small sample size, and the presence of bilateral ureteric catheters leaving the bladder free from urine may impact immediate postoperative outcomes. These initial results are promising; however, further prospective evaluation with a larger cohort and pre- and postoperative cystograms would enable better evaluation of this technique as a definitive management option for hemorrhagic cystitis.

### Prostate cancer treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^116CEdX8]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Because diagnostic methods have changed over time, any analysis of survival after treatment of prostate cancer and comparison of the various treatment strategies is complicated by evidence of increasing diagnosis of nonlethal tumors. Nonrandomized comparisons of treatments may be confounded not only by patient selection factors but also by time trends. Clinical Presentation In the United States, most prostate cancers are diagnosed as a result of screening; therefore, symptoms of cancer are infrequent at the time of diagnosis. Nevertheless, local growth of the tumor may produce symptoms of urinary obstruction such as:

- Decreased urinary stream.
- Urgency.
- Hesitancy.
- Nocturia.
- Incomplete bladder emptying. 26] The data suggested that MRI-directed biopsy can replace standard transrectal-guided biopsies.

However, a large, single-arm, single-center study of 2, 103 men with MRI-visible lesions who underwent both MRI-directed biopsies and standard systematic prostate needle biopsies under ultrasound visualization suggested otherwise. In that study, MRI-directed biopsies alone led to misclassification of 8. 8% of cancers defined as clinically significant compared with the combination of both biopsy techniques. Both studies reported only on histology end points at the time of diagnosis, rather than health outcomes on follow-up. Prophylactic antibiotics, especially fluoroquinolones, are often used before transrectal needle biopsies. There are reports of increasing rates of sepsis, particularly with fluoroquinolone-resistant. Histological grade of tumor Poorly differentiated tumors are more likely to have metastasized before diagnosis and are associated with a poorer prognosis.

The most commonly used method to report tumor differentiation is the Gleason score. For more information, see the Pathology section. Patient's age and health Any benefits of definitive local therapy with curative intent may take years to emerge. Therefore, therapy with curative intent is usually reserved for men with a sufficiently long life expectancy. For example, radical prostatectomy is often reserved for men with an estimated life expectancy of at least 10 years. For example, baseline PSA and rate of PSA change were associated with subsequent metastasis or prostate cancer death in a cohort of 267 men with clinically localized prostate cancer who were managed by watchful waiting or active surveillance in the control arm of a randomized trial comparing radical prostatectomy with watchful waiting or active surveillance.

Nevertheless, the accuracy of classifying men into groups whose cancer remained indolent versus those whose cancer progressed was poor at all examined cut points of PSA or PSA rate of change. Serum acid phosphatase levels Elevations of serum acid phosphatase are associated with poor prognosis in both localized and disseminated disease. However, serum acid phosphatase levels are not incorporated into the American Joint Committee on Cancer's staging system for prostate cancer. Use of nomograms as a prognostic tool Several nomograms have been developed to predict outcomes either before radical prostatectomy or after radical prostatectomy with intent to cure. Preoperative nomograms are based on clinical stage, PSA level, Gleason score, and the number of positive and negative prostate biopsy cores.

### Endorectal formalin instillation or argon plasma coagulation for hemorrhagic radiation proctopathy therapy: a prospective and randomized clinical trial [^116M3eTA]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Radiotherapy may cause hemorrhagic radiation proctopathy (HRP). For conservative treatment of refractory HRP, argon plasma coagulation (APC) is the first-choice therapy. Endorectal formalin instillation (EFI), in turn, is an attractive treatment option because of its satisfactory results, great availability, and low cost. Nevertheless, comparative studies between these procedures are rather scarce. This study aims to make a prospective and randomized comparison of the outcomes in 2 HRP patient groups treated with either APC or EFI.

Methods

Twenty-seven patients (11 women), with a mean age of 67 years (range, 36–83), were randomized to receive either APC (n = 14) or EFI (n = 13). On completion of the treatment, comparisons were made in relation to the baseline for each patient and between groups for endoscopic findings according to the Vienna score and the telangiectasia distribution pattern score (TDP); the impact of radiation proctitis on patients' lives was made according to the modified radiation toxicity score (MRTS) and hemoglobin levels. Number of sessions, duration of therapy, and adverse events were also compared between groups. The endoscopic therapeutic success (ETS) was defined by the absence or only few residual telangiectasias (TDP ≤ 1) on conclusion.

Results

An ETS of 92.8% was achieved in patients treated with APC and 92.3% for those treated with EFI (P > .05); there was an MRTS improvement of 85.7% in APC patients and 69.2% in EFI patients (P > .05). Mild adverse events occurred, respectively, in 23% and 28.5% in the EFI and APC groups (P > .05).

Conclusions

The study showed that APC and EFI have similar efficacy and a high safety profile for HRP treatment. (Clinical trial registration number: 3.120.353.).

### Preclinical models of endometriosis and interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: an innovative medicines initiative-painCare initiative to improve their value for translational research in pelvic pain [^115VDH6g]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

For each IC/BPS model category, the number of articles published per year was analysed (Fig. 5 B). The largest model category, bladder centric, was also the first methodology to be established, and publications using this model increased almost continuously every year until 2016, reaching a peak of 71 publications, followed by a plateau and subsequent decrease in 2019 with only 33 publications (Fig. 5 B). In the bladder-centric category, 3 methods have been established: instillation of irritants (92% of publications), altered expression of urothelial targets (5% of publications), and radiation-induced cystitis (3% of publications, Figs. 5 C and D). Instillation of irritants consists of infusing the bladder with an agent that damages the urothelium, generally achieved by transurethral catheterization under anaesthesia. Irritants commonly used are as follows: acetic acid, protamine sulphate, and lipopolysaccharide. This category also includes the cyclophosphamide model which, in contrast to the other irritants, is administered systemically. This model variant accounts for up to 48% of all publications within the category (426 publications, Figs. 5 C and D). Within the subcategory "altered expression of urothelial targets", different techniques have been used aiming to understand the role of gene products in disease development, including gene therapy, transgenic mice, siRNA, and exogenous administration of specific peptides or protein inhibitors. The subcategory "radiation" consists of specifically irradiating the bladder one or more times, producing local tissue damage, and triggering haemorrhagic cystitis.

### Radiation-induced cystitis treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (RICH-ART): long-term follow-up of a randomised controlled, phase 2–3 trial [^111ZpGa9]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic radiation-induced cystitis is driven by hypoxia, fibrosis, and vascular damage caused by radiation. The pathogenesis begins with mucosal destruction, leading to ulcers, telangiectasia, and haematuria, as the bladder environment becomes hypovascular and hypocellular. Vascular injury, including endothelial damage and disrupted angiogenesis, further exacerbates these effects, contributing to fibrosis and structural disorganisation of the bladder. Additionally, neurogenic dysfunction likely plays a role in pain and impaired bladder control, highlighting the multifaceted nature of this condition. The severity of chronic radiation-induced cystitis correlates with radiation dose, fraction size, and bladder volume exposed, with some cases resulting in life-threatening haemorrhage due to endarteritis obliterans and bladder wall fibrosis.

Management of chronic radiation-induced cystitis is challenging, with treatments mainly limited to symptomatic relief, such as analgesics, intravesical coagulation and instillations. In the RICH-ART trial, the largest prospective randomised trial on hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) intervention for chronic radiation-induced cystitis, patients receiving HBO2 showed significant reductions in symptoms and improved quality of life at 6–8 months post-treatment compared to controls. The HORTIS IV study reported similar effects of HBO2 on symptoms of radiation-induced proctitis when patients were assessed up to 5 years after treatment. In contrast, the HOT2 study involving 84 patients found no significant benefit of HBO2 for radiation-induced proctitis at a 1-year follow-up. The latter study has been criticized for underdosing and having differences in patient selection and evaluation. A positive effect of HBO2 on radiation induced adverse effects was further supported by a large Australian retrospective trial and a Cochrane review including 18 randomised trials.

### Long-term experience of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for refractory radio-or chemotherapy-induced haemorrhagic cystitis [^111QTup8]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

In all patients urothelial malignancy was excluded by histology. At least one bladder fulguration was performed in every case in order to stop the bleeding but no patient received any intravesical instillation therapy.

When HC was resistant to conventional therapy (without instillation therapy) HBOT was initiated, in a median of eleven months (0–110) after the first episode of haematuria. Between 6 and 128 HBOT sessions (mean 34) were necessary to achieve a total resolution of haematuria. In all HBOT sessions the partial pressure of oxygen measured percutaneously was increased to 1250–1480 mmHg.

Follow-up ranged from 16 to 142 months (mean 68). In 12 patients (80%) a total resolution of the HC could be achieved without any further haematuria. In two patients (13%) bladder irrigation had to be re-performed once for a singular recurrence of haematuria (RTOG/EORTC Grade 3). Changes in RTOG/EORTC scores were statistically significant (p < 0.00001).

In one case a salvage cystectomy with urinary diversion (ileum conduit) was necessary owing to a fulminant bleeding episode. The overall success rate was 93%. The radiogenic proctitis completely recovered in both cases. No side effects were noted in any patient.

### Treatment of acute radiation cystitis: comment [^111x9iHW]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Dear Editor,

We highly appreciate the comments by Drs. Wang, Horng and Lee regarding our feasibility study on prevention of radiation cystitis by intravesical instillations with chondroitin sulphate. We fully agree that more pre-clinical studies may help to elucidate the mechanisms and treatment of radiation cystitis, and that several clinical studies are needed to assess the efficacy of intravesical instillations with chondroitin sulphate. In fact, we hope soon to start a double-blind study in patients undergoing primary or adjuvant radiotherapy for gynaecological malignancies. In that trial, a wider range of early and late clinical symptoms will be evaluated, as also suggested by Wang et al.

### Hyaluronic acid: an effective alternative treatment of interstitial cystitis, recurrent urinary tract infections, and hemorrhagic cystitis? [^116pW2Qg]. European Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hyaluronic acid is a protective barrier of the urothelium. A damaged glycosaminoglycan layer may increase the possibility of bacterial adherence and infection. This damage is proposed to be a causative factor in the development of interstitial cystitis, common urinary tract infections, and hemorrhagic cystitis due to posthematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The aim of this article was to review the available data regarding the use of hyaluronic acid as an alternative treatment of the above-mentioned conditions.

Methods

Articles relevant to our review that were archived by September 2006 were retrieved from PubMed.

Results

Nine relevant studies were identified and evaluated. Hyaluronic acid was administered intravesically at a dose of 40 mg every week for 4–6 wk; patients with noted improvement received two additional monthly doses. Short-term responses of patients with interstitial cystitis, hemorrhagic cystitis, and recurrent urinary tract infections were 30–73% (7 studies), 71% (1 study), and 100% (1 study), respectively. The treatment was well tolerated except for occasional development of bacterial cystitis. The cost of each intravesical installation of hyaluronic acid is 120 UK pounds (excluding the cost of the urinary catheterization).

Conclusions

The available clinical data regarding the effectiveness of hyaluronic acid as a potential treatment of patients with interstitial cystitis, recurrent urinary tract infections, and hemorrhagic cystitis are limited. There is need for randomized controlled trials for further investigation of this important therapeutics question; these clinical trials should be disease-specific, blinded, and controlled, and of a sufficient number of patients. Until such studies are available, intravesical instillation of hyaluronic acid cannot be unquestionably endorsed for use for the aforementioned diseases.

### Early hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves outcome for radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis [^115Qjnwo]. Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the clinical factors that affect the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) therapy in treating radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. HBO2 therapy is an effective treatment for radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis, with reported response rates ranging from 76% to 100%.

Methods

The data from patients with radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis treated at our institution between May 1988 and December 2001 were reviewed retrospectively. All patients received HBO2 therapy at 2.36 atm absolute pressure, with 90 minutes of 100% oxygen breathing per treatment. The outcome was assessed after at least 12 months of follow-up. We evaluated patient demographics, types of pelvic malignancy and radiotherapy, total radiation dose, onset and severity of hematuria, and prior intravesical management. Clinical improvement was defined as the absence of, or reduction in, macroscopic hematuria.

Results

A total of 60 patients (55 men and 5 women), mean age 70 years, received an average of 33 HBO2 treatments (range 9 to 63). Of the 60 patients, 48 (80%) had either total or partial resolution of hematuria. When treated within 6 months of hematuria onset, 96% (27 of 28) had complete or partial symptomatic resolution (P = 0.003). All 11 patients with previous clot retention had clinical improvement if treated within 6 months of hematuria onset (P = 0.007). Prior intravesical chemical instillation did not affect the clinical outcome. Patients who had undergone primary, adjuvant, or salvage external beam pelvic radiotherapy showed response rates of 81%, 83%, and 78%, respectively (P = 0.950).

Conclusions

Our results show that delivery of HBO2 therapy within 6 months of hematuria onset is associated with a greater therapeutic response rate. Treatment efficacy was independent of prior intravesical therapy and the timing of radiotherapy.

### Safety and efficacy of intravesical epinephrine instillation in patients with intractable lower urinary tract hematuria – A novel approach [^111vbiHF]. Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To treat intractable hematuria with intravesical instillation of epinephrine.

Methods

Sixty patients were treated with intravesical instillation of epinephrine at Mackay Memorial Hospital. The control group was composed of 60 patients who were treated with standard-of-care cystoscopic electrocautery fulguration. Under general anesthesia, epinephrine-treated group were injected with 150 mL of diluted epinephrine (1:10,000) through cystoscopy, followed by bladder irrigation with 1:100,000-diluted epinephrine at the ward. Successful hemostasis was defined as hematuria resolution within 1 month post-treatment without additional invasive procedures.

Results

In the 60 patients who underwent intravesical instillation of epinephrine, radiation cystitis was the most common etiology (65.0%). Fifty-two patients (86.7%) required no additional therapy within 1 month after one course of intravesical epinephrine instillation treatment compared with 28 patients (46.7%) in the electrocautery fulguration-control group (P < .001). We observed a significant decrease in both the median length of hospitalization (P = 0.049) and the need for additional invasive procedures (P < .001) in the epinephrine group. In addition, cardiopulmonary monitoring of mean blood pressure, mean heart rate, and mean respiratory rate demonstrated no significant differences after epinephrine treatment.

Conclusion

In this study, intravesical instillation of epinephrine was an innovative method of hemostasis for intractable lower urinary tract hematuria with a success rate of 86.7%, compared to 46.7% in the control group, and significantly reduced the number of additional procedures required and the length of hospitalization. It was well-tolerated by all patients, and was a safe and effective treatment modality for intractable hematuria or bladder hemorrhage.

### Treatment of post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation hemorrhagic cystitis with intravesicular sodium hyaluronate [^113qkJEg]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a well-known complication of HSCT. Its overall incidence has been reported to vary from 7–68%. The spectrum of clinical presentation varies from asymptomatic microhematuria to life-threatening bleeding. Sodium hyaluronate is a glycosaminoglycan present on the bladder mucosa, which serves as an important protective substance against uroepithelial damage. Preparations of this component have been shown to be effective in the treatment of interstitial cystitis. We report our experience in the treatment of post-transplant HC with intravesical instillation of sodium hyaluronate. Five out of the seven patients included in this study achieved complete response, while one patient had only partial response. Sodium hyaluronate administration was not associated with any local or systemic adverse effects. We consider that the results of our study are promising and the efficacy of sodium hyaluronate in the treatment of post-transplant HC should be tested in larger cohorts of patients.

### Intravesical instillations with polydeoxyribonucleotides reduce symptoms of radiation-induced cystitis in patients treated with radiotherapy for pelvic cancer: a pilot study [^115ddjBR]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Chronic radiation cystitis (CRC) is a serious complication that can arise in patients with pelvic malignancies treated with radiotherapy. Polydeoxyribonucleotides (PDRNs) are known to reduce inflammation and improve tissue perfusion and angiogenesis. In this manuscript, we describe our observational experience regarding intravesical instillation of PDRNs in improving symptoms of CRC in subjects unresponsiveness to conventional medical therapy.

Methods

Eight patients with persistent and/or worsening CRC symptoms, despite conventional therapy, received biweekly intravesical instillation of PDRNs for two consecutive months. Symptoms were scored according to the Late Effects of Normal Tissues-Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic (LENT-SOMA) scale, before, at the end, and after 4 months following the PDRNs treatment.

Results

Four months after instillations, a significant improvement in the subjective perception of CRC symptoms was experienced by participants. The mean LENT-SOMA score was reduced from 1.16+0.26 before to 0.34+0.035 after 4 months from instillations (p < 0.001). No adverse effect related to instillations was reported.

Conclusions

Subjective perception of persistent and/or worsening CRC symptoms, despite conventional therapy, is improved after intravesical instillation with PDRNs without adverse events. Even though we deduced suggestive insights, the results need to be collected and verified from a large-scale study.

Standard (Evidence Strength: Grade B). Efficacy has been only non-significantly greater than placebo with potentially significant adverse events (AEs), including in randomized controlled trials (RCTs): one RCT reported a non-significantly higher response rate in 15 BCG-treated vs 15 placebo-treated patients (60% versus 27%) at eight months with all patients reporting one or more AEs; a second larger RCT (131 BCG, 134 placebo) found no differences in response (21% vs 12%) at seven months with 95% in each group reporting at least one AE. Non-responders given open-label BCG had an 18% response rate at seven months, and among responders followed for 17 months, 86% of BCG vs 75% of placebo responders remained improved — a nonsignificant difference. Life-threatening AEs are possible with exposure to BCG, and the Panel judged that the risks/burdens of BCG outweigh its benefits; BCG administration in this patient group should be restricted to investigational settings.

### Non-surgical interventions for late radiation cystitis in patients who have received radical radiotherapy to the pelvis [^115SW51q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic radiation cystitis occurs a minimum of three months after completion of pelvic radiotherapy and represents a range of clinical symptoms for which there is as yet no recommended standard management.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to identify the various non-surgical treatment options for the management of late chronic radiation cystitis and evaluate the evidence.

Search Strategy

Synonyms for radiation therapy and for the spectrum of radiation toxicity to the bladder in both text and MeSH terms were combined and applied to a range of databases without restriction of year of publication, methodology or language.

Selection Criteria

The inclusion criteria included studies of interventions for the non-surgical management of all grades of late radiation cystitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Out of 80 relevant studies, there were no RCTs that met the inclusion criteria, but there were three prospective case series and two non-randomised studies which assessed different interventions and were not comparable.

Main Results

Sixty-three reports met the stated inclusion criteria. The majority were predominantly retrospective case series with the exception of two trials which were unrandomised and unblinded studies with a control group for comparison of effect. Although these two trials, Micic 1988, (intravesical placental extract) and Milani 1988, (flavoxate) provided the strongest evidence they were not randomised and were essentially isolated controlled studies.

Reviewer's Conclusions

In such a relatively rare condition there are obvious difficulties in identifying sufficient patients to participate in a randomised controlled trial. The number of published reports is a reflection of the degree of medical interest that exists in providing therapeutic solutions for late radiation cystitis. However, in spite of the two studies of level IIA evidence, the absence of randomised controlled trials makes it impossible to draw any firm conclusions.

### The role of endoscopy in patients with anorectal disorders [^113ZRXy8]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Chronic radiation proctopathy — epidemiology, timing, presentation, natural history, indications for treatment, complications, and therapies are summarized: Among patients receiving prostate irradiation, the rectum is the most commonly affected gastrointestinal (GI) segment, with chronic radiation-induced injury occurring in up to 20% of patients; onset can range from 9 months to 30 years after pelvic radiation, with typical presentation within 2 years. Symptoms include hematochezia, tenesmus, diarrhea, and defecatory urgency, with endoscopic appearance from diffuse, friable angioectatic lesions to frank ulceration. Approximately 95% of mild cases are temporary and self-limited, but up to 5% have symptoms refractory to conservative management. When found incidentally on endoscopy, treatment is not usually indicated unless there are signs (for example, anemia) or symptoms affecting overall health status or quality of life; complications include anemia, rectal strictures, rectovaginal fistula formation, and increased risk of colorectal cancer. Described treatments include oral agents, topical formalin, rectal instillation therapy, thermal therapies such as argon plasma coagulation or heater probe or laser, and hyperbaric oxygen, though there are no large randomized, controlled studies of management.

### Current management and proposal for guidance of radiation cystitis (RC): results of a British uro-oncology group (BUG) survey… [^113pNfGT]. ASCO (2013). Low credibility.

Abstract 297 Background: Although RC is a potentially significant acute and/or chronic complication of radiotherapy to the pelvic area, there is limited information about how it is managed in practice. Methods: The BUG membership was surveyed as to their perception on and management of RC. Results: 87% of respondents supervise radiotherapy to the bladder/pelvis. Of these 45, most consider acute RC during or immediately after treatment a significant problem in 'some' or the 'majority' of cases. Late RC was mostly considered a significant problem in the 'minority' of cases, with the rest feeling it was a significant problem in 'some' cases. During radiotherapy or at follow-up the majority 'always' or 'sometimes' record the grade of cystitis. 93% do not have local guidelines for managing RC.

The treatments most frequently used to treat acute RC are: fluids; cranberry juice; analgesia; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; and anti-spasmodics. Mild late RC is treated similarly, although 20% might consider no treatment. For moderate/severe late RC, most refer to an urologist, with grade ≥ 2 cases, those with haemorrhagic cystitis, and symptoms > 90 days post-radiotherapy being the most common reasons for referral. For those treating moderate/severe late RC, hyperbaric oxygen, fluids, and analgesia are most commonly used. Over half were not aware of alternative treatment options including mesna, sodium hyaluronate, intravesical prostaglandin E1/E2, sodium pentosanpolysulphate, or intravesical formalin.

All supported the development of national guidelines in collaboration with the British Association of Urological Surgeons and British Association of Urology Nurses. Conclusions: RC is acknowledged as a potentially significant issue, and, with the majority of cases managed by oncology, there is a recognised need for further guidance on optimal treatment and BUG has started this work.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^114Xm3gP]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Intravesical heparin (Evidence Strength: Grade C) shows symptom improvement in observational and crossover studies with specified regimens: using 10,000 IU heparin in 10cm3 sterile water three times weekly for three months with one-hour retention, 56% reported clinically significant improvement; using 25,000 IU in 5 mL distilled water twice weekly for three months, 72.5% reported significant relief; and continuation for up to one year led to 40% overall reporting continued relief at one year. Combination formulations reported include 40,000 IU heparin with 3 mL 8.4% sodium bicarbonate plus 8 mL 1% or 2% lidocaine, and 20,000 units heparin with 20 mL 2% lidocaine and 40 mg triamcinolone. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover, at 12 hours after a single instillation the active arm had 50% successful response with a 42% pain reduction versus 13% and 21% with placebo; a prospective observational series giving weekly instillations for 12 weeks and following for 6 months saw responders rise from 33.3% at week 1 to 90% one month after 12 instillations, then diminish to 16.7% by 6 months, with additional improvements in OSSI/OSPI and other symptom measures. AEs were infrequent and appear minor, and for these reasons intravesical heparin is designated an Option.

### Intravesical interferon therapy vs hyaluronic acid for pain among female individuals with interstitial cystitis: a randomized clinical trial [^115WZoCV]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does intravesical interferon instillation offer a novel treatment option for female patients with interstitial cystitis (IC)?

Findings

In a randomized clinical trial of 52 patients with IC, intravesical interferon treatment led to a significant reduction in visual analog scale pain score, and Interstitial Cystitis Symptom and Problem Index scores at month 6 compared with hyaluronic acid, demonstrating potential efficacy in IC management.

Meaning

These findings suggest the intravesical interferon instillation holds promise as an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic option for patients with IC, emphasizing the importance of antiviral approaches in improving patient care and quality of life.

Hemorrhagic cystitis that occurs late after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in BMT recipients is often associated with adenovirus or polyomavirus BK infections. Intravesical instillation of cidofovir in a BMT recipient with intractable hemorrhagic cystitis resulted in clinical improvement. Local cidofovir therapy for viral hemorrhagic cystitis could be an alternative to intravenous administration of cidofovir.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^112HdKZ8]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Intravesical instillations for IC/BPS — Guideline Statement 17: "DMSO, heparin, and/or lidocaine may be administered as second-line intravesical treatments (listed in alphabetical order; no hierarchy is implied). Option (Evidence Strength: Grades C, C, and B)". In one randomized trial, the protocol was four treatments of 50 cc 50% DMSO at two-week intervals with 15-minute retention and one-month post-treatment evaluation, with evaluators indicating 93% of DMSO patients and 35% of placebo patients improved and patient ratings 87% vs 59%. A second trial using six weekly instillations reported 47% improvement with DMSO versus 0% with BCG at three months. Observational studies reported efficacy rates of 25 to 90%, and intravesical DMSO instillation was designated as an Option. If DMSO is used, "the panel suggests limiting instillation dwell time to 15–20 minutes" because longer holds are "associated with significant pain". DMSO is often administered as a "cocktail" with heparin, sodium bicarbonate, a local steroid, and/or lidocaine; at follow-up of six weeks to 12 months, efficacy rates ranged from 61% to 70%, but clinicians should be aware DMSO "potentially enhances absorption of other substances, creating the possibility for toxicity from drugs such as lidocaine", and "No clinical studies have addressed the safety or increased efficacy" of these mixtures versus DMSO alone or across cocktails.

### Treatment of radiation induced hemorrhagic cystitis with hyperbaric oxygen [^113fFknu]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Hemorrhagic cystitis can occur 6 months to 10 years after pelvic radiation therapy with moderate to severe persistent rates of hematuria as 3% to 5% after radiotherapy for pelvic malignancies. Current treatment modalities for hemorrhagic cystitis include oral and intravenous agents, intravesical therapy and selective embolization of the hypogastric arteries. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is now a widely accepted treatment option for radiation induced hemorrhagic cystitis. We assess the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen for treatment of hemorrhagic cystitis.

Material and Methods

From May 1988 through March 2001, 62 patients with radiation induced hemorrhagic cystitis were treated with hyperbaric oxygen at our institution. Followup ranged from 10 to 120 months. The primary pathological conditions were prostate cancer (81%) and bladder cancer (10%). Mean patient age was 70 years (range 15 to 88). Mean time between completion of radiation therapy and onset of hematuria was 48 months (range 0 to 355). Patients received an average of 33 hyperbaric oxygen treatments (range 9 to 68).

Results

Of the 62 patients treated information on 57 was available for analysis. Of the 57 patients (86%) 49 experienced complete resolution or marked improvement of hematuria following hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Of the 8 patients who did not improve 4 received fewer than 40 hyperbaric oxygen treatments and 7 prematurely terminated treatment (medical co-morbidities 4, claustrophobia 2, temporary resolution of symptoms 1).

Conclusions

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for radiation induced hemorrhagic cystitis is an efficacious treatment modality for patients in whom other forms of management have failed.

### Application of 10 percent formalin for the treatment of radiation-induced hemorrhagic proctitis [^113d4Dax]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Rectal instillation of 4 percent formalin solution has been described as a successful treatment for hemorrhagic radiation proctitis recalcitrant to medical treatment. We present our experience with a new method of treatment involving the topical application of 10 percent buffered formalin, which is well tolerated and suitable for office use.

Methods

Patients with marked or refractory rectal bleeding and clinical features consistent with radiation proctitis were reviewed. Treatment involved direct application of a 10 percent buffered formalin solution to the affected mucosa using a 16-inch cotton tip applicator applied through a proctoscope in the office setting.

Results

A total of 100 patients with a mean age of 75 (range, 49–91) years were followed for 18 (range, 1–79) months. The interval from radiation exposure to formalin treatment was 21 months. Overall, 93 percent of patients had cessation of bleeding after an average of 3.5 formalin applications at two-week to four-week intervals. Patients with severe (Grade 3) proctitis and those taking aspirin required an average of 1.5 additional treatments. A total of eight patients rebled at a mean of 24 months from treatment; however, all responded to further applications of formalin. Three patients complained of anal pain and one experienced dizziness postprocedure for a complication rate of 1.1 percent.

Conclusions

We present a simple, cost-effective, and well-tolerated method of controlling hemorrhagic radiation proctitis. It is performed by using materials readily available in the office of a colon and rectal surgeon, eliminating the need for bowel preparation, anesthesia, or a surgical suite.

### The role of bladder instillation in the treatment of bladder pain syndrome: is intravesical treatment an effective option for patients with bladder pain as well as LUTS? [^112fMX6G]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Bladder instillations also have the advantage of targeting the bladder directly, thus optimising the efficacy of the drugs used and reducing their side effects profile. Despite the data reported in the literature still being scarce, the use of drugs with anti-inflammatory properties, able to desensitise hypersensitive nerves, as well as restoring the permeability of damaged urothelial cells, may be a sensible approach to all kinds of LUTS secondary to bladder inflammation, and not just bladder pain. An adequately buffered solution should also be considered to reduce the event of drug precipitation, which can occur when heparin and lidocaine are mixed separately without proper alkalinisation. Benefits of a combined heparin and alkalinised bladder instillation has been demonstrated, with prolonged relief beyond the half-life of lidocaine described. Combination therapy may be acting to treat the inflammation of BPS/IC through the anti-inflammatory and bladder mucosa-stabilising properties of lidocaine and heparin, as well as providing immediate pain relief through the anaesthetic properties of lidocaine. However, this assumption needs to be scientifically proven by large randomised control trials. These studies are also required to define the ideal and most effective medications, how long the instilled drugs should be kept in the bladder to ensure the best outcome possible, the correct dose and solution to avoid the precipitation of the drugs used, as well as the frequency and duration of treatments. There are a wide variety of both single-agent and combination-agent intravesical treatments in use and there needs to be adequate assessment through large clinical trials with high methodological quality addressing appropriate patient-reported outcomes. Despite the attempts of various investigators that have already been proposed to make the best bladder instillation solution by adding different drugs together, there is still a lack of scientific evidence supporting what drug or drugs should be used to treat bladder pain and why not LUTS in general.

### The role of bladder instillation in the treatment of bladder pain syndrome: is intravesical treatment an effective option for patients with bladder pain as well as LUTS? [^1144Rtam]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Dimethyl sulfoxide

Interest in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) grew after it was found to have local anaesthetic, bacteriostatic and anti-inflammatory properties. Its original urological use involved transdermal application to the supra-pubic region of patients diagnosed with BPS/IC. After showing minimal benefit, DMSO was then used as an intravesical agent with direct application to the bladder wall, with beneficial effects seen in 6 out of 8 patients in initial studies. It is thought to work via reducing interleukin-8-mediated inflammatory responses, decreased NF-κB activation and/or reduced prostaglandin E2 stimulation. Its analgesic effect is thought to be mediated by desensitising nociceptive pathways on the afferent nerves of the lower urinary tract.

Treatment regimens vary, with DMSO being used either in isolation or together with other intravesical medication. The optimal dwell time, length of induction therapy or length of maintenance therapy is unknown. Results from single-arm cohort studies showed efficacy rates of 61–95% in BPS/IC patients who were resistant to medications, hydrodistension and fulguration. The strong garlic odour associated with DMSO makes blinding for a clinical trial challenging. An RCT comparing DMSO with placebo showed a 53% subjective and 93% objective improvement in the DMSO group compared with an 18% subjective and 35% objective improvement in the placebo group. Two randomised controlled trials also showed that DMSO was superior to BCG in the treatment of BPS/IC. Five studies have investigated the use of DMSO as part of a "cocktail" with heparin, hydrocortisone, triamcinolone and/or local anaesthetic. Response rates varied from 61 to 70%; however, overall efficacy rates did not exceed those of DMSO alone. Iyer et al. compared DMSO plus triamcinolone with bupivacaine plus heparin and triamcinolone(B/H/T). DMSO treatment resulted in a greater percentage of overall improvement and a significant decrease in nocturia episodes compared with B/H/T.

Reported side effects in the literature include increased urgency and dysuria, lethargy, nausea, fever and haematuria, which was thought to be related to transient chemical cystitis; however, these were found to be low in frequency. The use of DMSO in animals has been linked to changes in their eye lenses, but no link has been seen in clinical trials. Long-term follow-up (median 60 months) suggests that DMSO/heparin/hydrocortisone/bupivacaine therapy might appear to be moderately effective, but failure was more frequent in patients with pre-treatment reduced bladder capacity.

### Prophylactic vesical instillations with 0.2% chondroitin sulfate may reduce symptoms of acute radiation cystitis in patients undergoing radiotherapy for gynecological malignancies [^114iYQU7]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The strength of our study is that, even though these patients undergo very intense treatment, they mostly completed the intensive study protocol receiving the instillations and completing the questionnaires. This might be explained by the patients' eagerness to prevent any possible side effect and by the tolerability of instillations. The control group in this study only completed the questionnaires, without a direct gain from the study, but were very compliant in completing the questionnaires.

Another strength of our study is that we used validated pelvic floor-related quality of life questionnaires to measure the urogenital symptoms, measuring for the first time these symptoms in patients currently treated for gynecological malignancies.

A final remark that could be made about this study is that the intervention group is younger than the controls and therefore might have less urogenital symptoms. An explanation for the age difference could be that younger patients are more willing to reduce treatment-related side effects than older patients with instillations. Above that, the intervention group started with higher symptom scores than the controls, which pleads against younger age being associated with less bother of symptoms. Obviously, a randomized clinical trial (RCT) should be performed to evaluate whether age is a risk factor for more symptoms. We felt, from an ethical point of view, that the feasibility of the instillations had to be examined in these patients prior to an RCT. The refusal to continue the instillations of only one patient due to urethral pain after the fourth instillation makes the instillations seem a feasible intervention.

### Current management of interstitial cystitis [^115RZsFe]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The management of patients with IC remains a challenge because no single agent has proven universally effective. DMSO and PPS have been evaluated through early placebo-controlled trials, and these two agents are FDA approved treatments for IC. BCG is currently undergoing a large placebo-controlled trial, and hyaluronic acid is receiving similar clinical evaluation. Sacral nerve root stimulation shows promise with early favorable results. As with any treatment algorithm, it is reasonable to begin with conservative treatment using time-dependent milestones, allowing adequate trials of successive therapy while ensuring an appropriate pace for timely symptom resolution.

### Formalin instillation for control of rectal hemorrhage in advanced pelvic malignancy: report of two cases [^114UHyZN]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

This article describes the use of intrarectal formalin to treat intractable rectal bleeding from pelvic malignancy.

Methods

Case reports of two patients with intractable rectal bleeding from pelvic malignancy are described.

Results

In both cases, treatment with intrarectal formalin stopped the rectal bleeding.

Conclusion

Formalin instillation into the rectum is an invaluable technique when one is faced with rectal hemorrhage from inoperable pelvic tumors.

### Prophylactic vesical instillations with 0.2% chondroitin sulfate may reduce symptoms of acute radiation cystitis in patients undergoing radiotherapy for gynecological malignancies [^112Vbk8f]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The results of this pilot study show that intravesical instillations with chondroitin sulfate 0.2% solution are well tolerated by patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy for a gynecological malignancy. Additionally, the instillations appear to reduce overactive bladder symptoms during the period of radiotherapy. Whether the restricted severity of symptoms following radiotherapy can be entirely explained by the effectiveness of chondroitin sulfate itself or by other factors such as additional attention that was given to the intervention group, this needs to be assessed by a double-blind placebo-controlled RCT. If confirmed, the evaluated intervention could be the first described preventive measurement for the occurrence of acute RC. If the observation would hold true in future studies, this could implicate a major improvement of quality of life in women undergoing radiotherapy.

### Endoluminal formalin application for haemorrhagic radiation proctitis [^115MeUDe]. Colorectal Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Radiation proctitis is a common complication following radiation therapy for pelvic malignancies. This is associated with significant morbidity which adversely affects the quality of life. Local application of formalin has been used effectively in the treatment of radiation proctitis.

Methodology

Thirty patients with haemorrhagic radiation proctitis who underwent endoluminal application of 4% formalin between January 1998 to October 2002 were followed up prospectively to assess the efficacy of the treatment.

Results

The follow up ranged from 5 to 36 months (mean 18.1 months). Nineteen (63.3%) patients had complete response to formalin application while 7 (23.3%) patients had partial response. There were 4 (13.3%) failures. No procedure related complication was observed.

Conclusion

Local application of formalin is a simple, safe, inexpensive and fairly effective outpatient treatment modality for chronic radiation proctitis.

### Long-term results of super-selective trans-catheter embolization of the vesical arteries for the treatment of intractable bladder haematuria [^113ChyK3]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Intractable haematuria is a severe, life-threatening condition. It may have a host of causes such as an underlying malignancy mainly prostate and bladder cancer, inflammatory causes or radiation and drug induced cystitis (Ghahestani and Shakhssalim). Most cases of bladder and prostate haematuria are managed conservatively by irrigation with formalin, silver nitrate or alum solution, intra-vesical hydrostatic pressure, hyperbaric oxygen or endoscopic diathermy. Bladder resection with urinary diversion has traditionally been applied in cases that conservative treatment failed. (Choong et al.) The majority of patients with intractable haematuria are of high surgical risk due to advanced age, various comorbidities and poor clinical status. Over the past decade percutaneous, trans-catheter, arterial embolization has been proposed as an attractive, minimal invasive, alternative treatment for patients suffering from bladder haematuria not responding to conventional, non-invasive treatment. Nonetheless, data regarding the safety and efficacy of the method remain scarce. (Loffroy et al.) We sought to assess the feasibility, safety and long-term efficacy of super-selective, trans-catheter, embolization of the vesical arteries for the management of intractable bladder haematuria in our institution.

### Can radiation-induced lower urinary tract disease be ameliorated in patients treated for pelvic organ cancer: ICI-RS 2019? [^113su3Eb]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic post‐radiation LUT disease may be associated with hemorrhagic cystitis. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy increases dissolved oxygen in serum, leading to a reversal of ischemia in "lethal corners" of the bladder far from existing blood vessels. 53, 54 Such tissue reoxygenation leads to neovascularization and growth of healthy granulation tissue. 49, 50 Weiss et al 53 showed that hyperoxia of tissue resulting from breathing 100% oxygen at 2 bar for 2 hours daily over the course of 6 to 8 weeks (mean of 33 sessions) caused cessation of hematuria and bladder preservation in 12/13 of patients so treated (mean follow‐up of 2.5 years). Bevers et al 54 reported the results of a prospective study of hyperbaric oxygen (20 sessions of 90 minutes at 3 bar with 100% oxygen inhalation in a multiplace hyperbaric chamber) in 40 patients with biopsy‐proven radiation cystitis and severe hematuria. Hematuria disappeared completely or improved in 37 patients. The mean follow‐up was 23.1 months (range 1‐74), and the recurrence rate was 0.12/year. Whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be useful as a primary or adjunctive treatment for radiation‐induced lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) might be the target of future study. Ideally, such a study should be an (expensive) RCT comparing active with sham hyperbaric chamber treatment. And, at which level of LUTS severity should patients be randomized?

The responses to BTX‐A treatment in patients with idiopathic and neuropathic detrusor overactivity are well documented. However, the literature on BTX‐A in patients who have had prior pelvic RT is sparse. A series of 49 patients treated over a 10‐year period was recently reported. 55 Patients were separated by urodynamics into categories; loss of compliance alone, loss of compliance with detrusor overactivity, and early or late detrusor overactivity with normal compliance. Overall, 46% had a clinical response sufficient to justify continued injections. However, the data split clearly into two groups. Patients with poorly compliant bladders had a 21% response rate and the majority required surgical intervention (cystoplasty or urinary diversion). Patients with detrusor overactivity but preserved bladder capacity responded much better with 75% continuing to be managed with Botox alone. It therefore seems that poor bladder compliance due to replacement of muscle by fibrosis, is a predictor of BTX‐A failure.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^114PCzL1]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Intravesical instillation therapy for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome — heparin‑lidocaine and alkalinized lidocaine show short‑term benefits with specific regimens and outcomes: refractory patients received heparin‑lidocaine (20,000 units heparin, 5 mL 4% alkalized lidocaine, 25 mL 7% sodium bicarbonate) weekly for 12 weeks with response rates 33%, 60%, and 77% after the first, fourth, and 12th instillation, and 90% reported relief at one month that declined to 46.7% and to 16.7% at 2 and 6-months, respectively; in a randomized comparison of 10 mL lidocaine solution versus 15 mL heparin‑lidocaine combined, the combination significantly reduced bladder pain (38% versus 13%; p = 0.029) and urgency (42% versus 8%; p = 0.003) compared to lidocaine alone, and improved GAR at 1 hour (77% versus 50%; p = 0.04) and at 24 hours (57% versus 23%; p = 0.002); in a randomized cross‑over trial, alkalinized lidocaine (n = 16) versus normal saline (n = 8) for 20 minutes yielded responses in Eleven patients in the lidocaine group (68.7%) and increased maximal cystometric capacity among responders (192–261 mL, p = 0.005) while saline showed no significant difference (190–183 mL; p = 0.879).

### Long-term adverse effects and complications after prostate cancer treatment… [^115N97vR]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Unger JM, Till C, Tangen CM, et al. Long-Term Adverse Effects and Complications After Prostate Cancer Treatment. JAMA Oncol. 2024; 10: 1654–1662. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2024.4397 Question. What long-term complications of treatment for prostate cancer are experienced by treated patients compared with a general population of older males. Findings This cohort study, including 3946 patients with PCA, used a novel data linkage between 2 large PCA prevention clinical trials and Medicare claims to determine PCA treatment was associated with substantially higher rates of complications 12 years after treatment. Moreover, participants treated with radiotherapy had a 3-fold increased risk of bladder cancer and a 100-fold increased risk of radiation cystitis and radiation proctitis.

Meaning After accounting for age-related symptoms and diseases, PCA treatment was significantly associated with higher rates of complications 12 years after treatment, a finding that highlights the importance of patient counseling and provides a rationale for pursuing opportunities for cancer prevention. Importance Due to the often indolent nature of prostate cancer, treatment decisions must weigh the risks and benefits of cancer control with those of treatment-associated morbidities. Objective To characterize long-term treatment-related adverse effects and complications in patients treated for PCA compared to a general population of older males. Design, Setting, and Participants. This cohort study used a novel approach linking data from 2 large PCA prevention clinical trials with Medicare claims records.

This analysis included patients with PCA who had been treated with prostatectomy or radiotherapy compared with an untreated control group. Multivariable Cox regression was used, with a time-varying covariate for the occurrence of PCA treatment, adjusted for age, race, and year of time-at-risk initiation, and stratified by study and intervention arm. Data analyses were performed from September 21, 2022, to March 18, 2024. Exposure Prostatectomy and radiotherapy occurring after a PCA diagnosis, identified from trial data or Medicare claims records. Main Outcomes and Measures Ten potential PCA treatment-related complications identified from Medicare claims data. Results. The study sample comprised 29 196 participants. Of these, 3946 participants had PCA, among whom 655 were treated with prostatectomy and 1056 with radiotherapy. The 12-year hazard risk of urinary or sexual complications was 7.

23 times greater for those with prostatectomy and
2. 76 times greater for radiotherapy compared to untreated participants. Moreover, among participants treated with radiotherapy, there was a nearly 3-fold greater hazard risk of bladder cancer than in the untreated, as well as an approximately 100. -fold increased hazard risk of radiation-specific outcomes including radiation cystitis and radiation proctitis. The incidence per 1000 person-years of any 1 of the 10 treatment-related complications was 124. 26 for prostatectomy,
62. 15 for radiotherapy, and 23. 61 for untreated participants.

### Prophylactic vesical instillations with 0.2% chondroitin sulfate may reduce symptoms of acute radiation cystitis in patients undergoing radiotherapy for gynecological malignancies [^1161CtBj]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

As the urogenital symptoms were less bothersome in the intervention group than in the control group, we will try to explain this. The current policy for patients with acute RC symptoms is usually conservatively with analgesics and anticholinergics. Therefore, we cannot compare our results with those of previous studies. Chondroitin sulfate 0.2% solution has been studied before in the chronic cystitis condition, including RC. The pathophysiology of chronic and acute RC is different, which makes the results also difficult to compare to ours. The probable working mechanism of the intravesical instillations with chondroitin sulfate 0.2% solution to prevent or reduce acute RC is that the impermeability of the urothelium for urinary irritants is sustained by coating it with the chondroitin sulfate. By protecting the urothelium from these irritants, the acute bothersome symptoms do not occur or when they occur, do so to a lesser extent. The largest difference between the instillation and control groups in bother of overactive bladder symptoms, expressed by the UDI domain score OAB, was found in the fourth week of treatment. At that time, patients had received 4 weeks of radiotherapy. Acute symptoms occur 3 to 6 weeks after the start of radiotherapy. It could be that the instillation group had the most beneficial effect during the 6 weeks of instillation and that, after the end of the radiation treatment and the six instillations, this effect decreased.

### Prophylactic vesical instillations with 0.2% chondroitin sulfate may reduce symptoms of acute radiation cystitis in patients undergoing radiotherapy for gynecological malignancies [^112ehkVv]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Endometrial and cervical malignancies can be treated with primary or adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy. The mode of treatment depends on disease-related characteristics, such as size and extension of the tumor and, to a lesser extent, on patient characteristics. The severity of morbidity during and after treatment depends on the radiotherapy dosage and volume. Since the radiation schedule is determined by disease-related characteristics, the prevention of acute RC can therefore not easily be accomplished by lowering the dose and volume but should be sought for direct protection of the bladder.

Based on animal studies demonstrating that intravesical instillation with chondroitin sulfate solution is capable of coating a damaged bladder wall, we hypothesize that prophylactic instillations on patients undergoing radiotherapy for gynecologic malignancies may limit the risk of distressing RC symptoms. Our hypothesis is supported by the observation that in interstitial cystitis (IC) patients, GAG layer replenishment therapy has been proven to be effective. By keeping the coating of the urothelium intact during the radiotherapy treatment, the cells could be less damaged by urinary irritants. Short-term protection of the GAG layer and thus limitation of the risk on acute RC might even reduce the risk on chronic RC which has even more decrementing effects, although this possible long-term effect is outside the scope of this pilot study.

Instillation with chondroitin sulfate has no known adverse effects but is time-consuming and possibly burdensome, and most patients will need the assistance of a health-care professional to undergo instillations.

The aims of this pilot study were to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of intravesical instillations with chondroitin sulfate 0.2% solution to prevent or reduce acute RC in patients treated with pelvic radiotherapy for gynecological cancer.

Chronic radiation proctitis (CRP) — formalin application for rectal bleeding is supported with a strong recommendation, and clinical series describe dosing, efficacy, and adverse effects. "Formalin application is an effective treatment for bleeding in patients with CRP. Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B". Formalin (formaldehyde 4%–10%) "can be rendered in the outpatient clinic setting… or in a minor procedure room under intravenous sedation". In a Polish series of 4% formalin in 20 patients, "Most patients required an average of 2 treatments (range, 1–5). After the first application, 50% of the patients had complete resolution of the symptoms". At Cleveland Clinic Florida using 4% formalin in 21 patients, "Bleeding stopped after the first treatment in 17 patients", with adverse effects of "rectal pain in 4 patients, fecal incontinence in 2, and colitis in 1 patient". With 10% buffered formalin in 100 patients, "Cessation of bleeding was noted in 93%… following a mean of 3.5 applications at 2- to 4-week intervals", while those with severe proctitis or on aspirin "required on average 1.5 additional treatments", and "Recurrent bleeding was noted in 8 patients, and all responded to additional formalin applications". In 20 women refractory to topical steroids and/or mesalamine, "A 4% formalin solution was used in 17 patients, and the bleeding resolved after the first application… overall success rate of 90% during a median follow-up of 20 months", though "Two patients developed rectovaginal fistula requiring colostomy with 1 subsequent abdominoperineal resection".

Conclusions

In conclusion, our pilot study demonstrated that bladder instillation with HA and CS is a safe treatment in post radiation bladder cystitis. Patients after Ialuril ® instillation reported a statistically significant reduction in symptom/bother nocturnal voiding frequency, even if the overall improvement due to the medication vs. spontaneous recovery must be confirmed by placebo controlled trials, including further assessment tools such as cystoscopy and histological evaluation.

### Prophylactic vesical instillations with 0.2% chondroitin sulfate may reduce symptoms of acute radiation cystitis in patients undergoing radiotherapy for gynecological malignancies [^111EQK1U]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute radiation cystitis (RC) is a common and debilitating problem in patients undergoing radiotherapy for gynecological malignancies. Acute RC symptoms develop on average at 2 to 3 weeks after the start of treatment in up to 24–30% of patients, and these symptoms include painful micturition, urgency, frequency, and nocturia. These overactive bladder symptoms are known to seriously impair quality of life. Although this acute condition is claimed to be self-limiting, it may result in chronic RC, which carries the risk of life-threatening morbidity. Treatment of acute RC is only symptomatic, and up to now, no preventive measures have been studied.

The pathophysiology of acute RC is not exactly clear, but the bladder wall is internally built up by fast-dividing uroepithelium, susceptible to radiation damage. The uroepithelium is coated by the glucosamino-glycane (GAG) layer, preventing urinary irritants to reach the underlying sensory nerves. When the uroepithelium is damaged, this results in insufficiency of the GAG layer, and consequently, silent C-fibers are depolarized by urinary irritants, leading to RC symptoms. Acute RC usually occurs 3 to 6 weeks after starting radiation therapy. Up to 3 months after the start of radiation therapy, the occurrence of RC is often called the acute form.

Results

Ten patients had intravesical instillations. One patient, treated with radiotherapy and hyperthermia, discontinued the instillations after week 4 due to urethral pain, and she refused to complete the subsequent questionnaires.

The median age of the instillation group was 55 years (range, 32–75), and that of the controls was 64 years (range, 47–93). For more patient characteristics, see Table 1.

a Recurrence–previous treatment did not include radiotherapy, only AUE and BSO

The "acceptability of instillations"-VAS had a median score of 0 (range, 0–3) after the first instillation and a median of 1 (range, 0–3) at week 6 (last instillation). "Bladder pain"-VAS levels peaked at week 4 among the controls (median, 1; range, 0–5) and at week 8 in the instillation group (median, 1; range, 1–3) (data not shown).

Table 2 shows the symptom scores of both groups before (T = 0), halfway (T = 4) and after (T = 8) radiotherapy. Diverging patterns over time were noted with median follow-up scores at or above median baseline scores in controls and at or below median baseline scores in the instillation group for overactive bladder, incontinence and obstructive voiding, respectively.

### Intravesical IR-780 instillation prevents radiation cystitis by protecting urothelial integrity [^117TyQSj]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To explore an efficient preventive strategy for radiation cystitis.

Methods

We instilled IR-780 into the bladders of rats 1h before bladder irradiation, and its bio-distribution was observed at different times. Bladders were then examined for pathogenic alterations and inflammation levels by day 3 and week 12 postirradiation, and the functional characteristics of the bladder were tested via cystometry by week 12. Human uroepithelial sv-huc-1 cells were used to determine the effect of IR-780 on cell viability, regardless of irradiation. We measured the intracellular levels of oxidative stress, DNA damage, apoptosis proportion, and the expression of antioxidant proteases and apoptotic caspases in IR-780 pretreated cells after radiation.

Results

IR-780 is localized in the urothelium after intravesical instillation in vivo. Ionizing radiation could induce acute impairment of the bladder urothelium and inflammation in the bladder on day 3. Fibrosis of the irradiated bladder progressed and eventually affected voiding function at 12 weeks. Treatment with IR-780 before irradiation ameliorated these changes. In vitro, IR-780 protected against cell viability and apoptosis of sv-huc-1 cells after irradiation. Additionally, IR-780 may assist in eliminating reactive oxygen species and repairing irradiation-induced DNA damage.

Conclusion

Our data indicate that IR-780 can be used before irradiation to prevent acute urinary mucosal injury and late bladder dysfunction. Moreover, early urothelial impairment plays a significant role in radiation cystitis development.

### Prophylactic vesical instillations with 0.2% chondroitin sulfate may reduce symptoms of acute radiation cystitis in patients undergoing radiotherapy for gynecological malignancies [^111TXWCk]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction and hypothesis

We studied the feasibility and efficacy of intravesical instillations with 40 mL chondroitin sulfate 0.2% solution to prevent or reduce acute radiation cystitis in women undergoing pelvic radiotherapy.

Methods

In a comparative pilot study in 20 patients, half of the patients received instillations. Instillations' bother was measured with visual analog scores (VAS, 0–10); bladder pain, with VAS; micturition-related quality of life, with the urogenital distress inventory (UDI).

Results

One of the instilled patients discontinued the instillations. The first median "acceptability"-VAS was 0 (range, 0–3); the last median was 1 (range, 0–3). "Bladder pain"-VAS peaked halfway in the treatment among controls (median, 1; range, 0–5) and after treatment in the instilled patients (median, 1; range, 1–3). UDI scores showed over time median follow-up scores at or above median baseline scores in controls and at or below median baseline scores in instilled patients.

Conclusion

Intravesical instillations with chondroitin sulfate 0.2% solution may decrease the bother related to bladder symptoms and are well tolerated.

### Prophylactic vesical instillations with 0.2% chondroitin sulfate may reduce symptoms of acute radiation cystitis in patients undergoing radiotherapy for gynecological malignancies [^113nCXps]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

We included 20 uterine or cervical cancer patients consecutively at the outpatient department before start of treatment. Ten patients consented to have weekly intravesical instillations and ten consented to participate as control patients. The control group only completed the set of questionnaires. Choice of treatment was left at the discretion of the patient until the planned total of ten patients per group was reached.

During 8 weeks, i.e. before, during and after radiotherapy, patients weekly completed the questionnaires: four questions to quantify the acceptability of the intervention using visual analog scale (VAS) scores ranging from 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating higher acceptability. These questions were about distress: from coming to the outpatient clinic to receive the instillation, from the insertion of the single-use catheter for the instillation, from holding the instilled fluid in the bladder after instillation and from the instillation in total. Five questions using VAS scores were asked to measure bladder pain related to voiding: bladder pain at the moment when urge starts, just before voiding, during voiding, just after emptying the bladder, when not having the urge to void or just after voiding. The urogenital distress inventory (UDI) measured quality of life related to micturition. The UDI has five symptom domains, with scores ranging from 0 to 100, with a higher score corresponding with more bother of that symptom. Descriptive statistics are reported.

Adverse effects of chondroitin sulfate are not clearly known. The substance is not absorbed into the body. In one study, a mild rash has been mentioned, but furthermore, no serious complications related to chondroitin sulfate administered intravesically have been described. Because of the risk of developing urinary tract infection (UTI) when regularly catheterizing, we checked with a urine culture when the radiotherapist had clinical suspicion of UTI.

This study was approved by the local medical ethical committee. The participants signed an informed consent.
