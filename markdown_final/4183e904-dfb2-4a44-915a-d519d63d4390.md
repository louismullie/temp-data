## Question

What should be done for a chronic tympanic membrane perforation that has been present for 15 years?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what should be done for a tympanic membrane perforation that has persisted for 15 years. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the ear is dry or draining and whether there are red flags such as cholesteatoma. Then, I should verify hearing status and quantify the perforation size and location to link anatomy with functional impact. Next, I will consider non-surgical versus surgical closure options and the sequencing of infection control before repair. Finally, I should confirm perioperative considerations, Eustachian tube function, counseling points, and expected outcomes with appropriate techniques and follow-up imaging only if indicated [^114ksP7G] [^114HusFZ].

> Let me first confirm whether this is a dry, stable perforation or part of chronic suppurative otitis media with persistent otorrhea, because that determines initial management; chronic discharge with a perforation is CSOM, for which topical antibiotics are the mainstay, and cholesteatoma should be kept in mind given its association with long-standing middle ear disease and perforation-related pathology [^114ksP7G].

> Wait, let me verify ototopical safety before I recommend drops; with a known or suspected perforation, guidelines advise a non-ototoxic topical preparation, which in practice means preferring fluoroquinolone ear drops over aminoglycosides, and avoiding analgesic combinations like antipyrine/benzocaine that are contraindicated when there is a spontaneous TM perforation or discharge [^114C4PPy] [^112ohKcZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about vinegar or other antiseptics; although acetic acid has case-level support for chronic Pseudomonas otorrhea, the evidence is limited, so I should prioritize guideline-concordant non-ototoxic antibiotics for CSOM and reserve antiseptics only when antibiotics are unavailable or unsuitable, acknowledging the weaker evidence base for antiseptics in this setting [^112rU2Lp] [^114ksP7G].

> Next, I should review hearing and function; I need a full audiologic assessment with air–bone gap quantification and speech measures because conductive hearing loss correlates with perforation size, and umbo involvement worsens thresholds by about 5–6 dB, which helps align anatomy with expected functional loss and informs the threshold for repair versus rehabilitation [^11338GZP] [^115oFBv8].

> I will now examine the perforation carefully and quantify size and location; objective measurement improves decision-making and counseling, and a validated smartphone-based quantification approach can reduce interobserver variability when estimating perforation area at the point of care, which is particularly helpful when tracking change over time or comparing pre- and post-intervention images [^114aBCy8].

> But wait, what if there are red flags for cholesteatoma such as marginal/superior perforation with keratin debris, retraction with debris, or focal granulation; in that case I should obtain temporal bone imaging and plan referral for definitive cholesteatoma surgery, recognizing the trade-offs between canal wall up and down strategies and the role of mastoid obliteration or canal wall reconstruction when needed [^114HusFZ].

> Let me consider conservative and office-based closure options first if the perforation is small and the ear is dry; paper patching can close a portion of small chronic perforations, and platelet-rich plasma or growth factor–assisted techniques show promise but have mixed and generally low-to-moderate quality evidence, so I should be transparent that success is size- and site-dependent and that results vary across studies and centers [^114kGDbq] [^1121gdgv] [^1136NpAn].

> Hold on, I should verify patient selection for biologic regeneration approaches; outcomes with atelocollagen plus basic fibroblast growth factor are better when the TM lacks calcification and the perforation does not involve the annulus, which may help prognosticate and select candidates, while pediatric regenerative series suggest high closure ratios but remain early-stage and not directly generalizable to all chronic adult perforations [^114Mmx75] [^115Xq5Sf].

> Now, if symptoms are significant or the perforation is moderate-to-large, I need to discuss tympanoplasty; for large perforations, cartilage-perichondrium over-underlay techniques achieve high long-term graft success with meaningful hearing gains but require infection control first, while for anterior or unfavorable perforations, transcanal endoscopic approaches and lateral cartilage graft techniques can improve access and outcomes in experienced hands [^113Twgnr] [^112tKzGb] [^1173sA4P] [^116dvEeK].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought location alone would dictate hearing results, but I should double-check; while posterior perforations can show worse low-frequency thresholds in some series, the strongest and most consistent predictor of conductive loss is overall perforation size and umbo involvement, so counseling should emphasize size over quadrant, with a plan to address any ossicular pathology encountered at surgery if the air–bone gap pattern deviates from the expected "inverted V" configuration [^115oFBv8] [^11338GZP].

> Let me think about preoperative optimization; I need to ensure the ear is dry with topical quinolones and aural toilet before grafting, reinforce strict water precautions, and address Eustachian tube dysfunction contributors when feasible because persistent dysfunction can compromise graft take and explains poorer outcomes in selected pediatric cohorts with ETD, even though retractions themselves often follow a benign course under observation [^114ctX7D] [^113pwaTn] [^114Lwxi2].

> I should confirm counseling points and alternatives; for a patient with a long-standing perforation who declines surgery or is high risk, modern air- or bone-conduction amplification can be effective for rehabilitation, and mastoid cavity or canal wall down situations require ongoing water precautions and debridement, so the patient should weigh hearing improvement, infection reduction, swimming freedom, and follow-up burden against surgical risks and expected closure rates [^114ksP7G] [^114HusFZ].

> Next, I should review expected outcomes to set realistic expectations; endoscopic anterior myringoplasty series report roughly 88–93% closure with average air–bone gap improvement near 10 dB at 6 months, lateral cartilage graft tympanoplasty can achieve over 90% final closure in difficult perforations with similar hearing gains, and large-perforation cartilage-perichondrium over-underlay techniques report approximately 92% long-term success with a small risk of graft cholesteatoma that mandates follow-up [^112tKzGb] [^1173sA4P] [^113Twgnr].

> Let me reconsider postoperative surveillance; if reconstruction is performed, I need interval otoscopy and audiometry to confirm graft integrity and hearing benefit, with imaging only if there are concerning findings for cholesteatoma or if revision planning is required, keeping in mind that complications like persistent pinhole perforation or myringitis are usually manageable with topical therapy and, when necessary, secondary revision [^114HusFZ] [^113Twgnr].

> To synthesize a plan for a 15-year chronic perforation, I should first ensure the ear is dry using non-ototoxic topical therapy if needed, obtain baseline audiometry with perforation size quantification, exclude cholesteatoma by exam and image only if suspicious, then offer tympanoplasty if the patient has recurrent infections, bothersome water precautions, or a conductive deficit impacting function, selecting a cartilage-based technique for larger or anterior defects and counseling on success rates and follow-up needs accordingly [^114C4PPy] [^114aBCy8] [^114HusFZ] [^113Twgnr].

A chronic tympanic membrane perforation present for 15 years requires a structured approach. First, **confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications** with otoscopy [^114ksP7G], audiometry [^11338GZP], and imaging if cholesteatoma is suspected [^114HusFZ]. Keep the ear dry [^114C4PPy] and use **ototopical quinolones** for otorrhea [^114ctX7D] [^114ksP7G]; avoid ototoxic drops [^112ohKcZ] and water exposure [^114ksP7G]. If the perforation is large, symptomatic, or complicated, **refer for tympanoplasty**, which has high closure and hearing improvement rates [^113Twgnr]; cartilage grafts are preferred for large or anterior defects [^112tKzGb] [^1173sA4P]. Monitor for cholesteatoma [^114HusFZ], ossicular erosion, and persistent hearing loss, and provide hearing rehabilitation if needed [^114ksP7G].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnosis

- **Otoscopy**: Confirm chronic perforation, assess size [^114aBCy8], location, and middle ear mucosa.

- **Audiometry**: Quantify conductive hearing loss [^115oFBv8] and guide management.

- **Imaging**: Use high-resolution CT [^114HusFZ] if cholesteatoma or ossicular erosion is suspected.

---

## Conservative management

- **Ear hygiene**: Keep the ear dry [^114C4PPy]; avoid water exposure and trauma.

- **Topical antibiotics**: Use ototopical quinolones (e.g. ofloxacin) [^114ctX7D] for otorrhea [^114ksP7G]; avoid ototoxic drops [^112ohKcZ] [^114C4PPy].

- **Regular follow-up**: Monitor for complications such as cholesteatoma [^114ksP7G] or persistent infection.

---

## Surgical management

- **Indications**: Persistent perforation with hearing loss [^114ksP7G], recurrent infections, or cholesteatoma.

- **Tympanoplasty**: High closure rates and hearing improvement [^113Twgnr]; cartilage grafts are preferred for large or anterior defects [^112tKzGb] [^1173sA4P].

- **Mastoidectomy**: Consider if cholesteatoma [^114HusFZ] or extensive disease is present.

---

## Potential complications

Potential complications include **conductive hearing loss** proportional to perforation size [^11338GZP] and recurrent otorrhea consistent with chronic suppurative otitis media [^114ksP7G]; there is also a **risk of cholesteatoma** from epithelial ingrowth with possible ossicular erosion [^114HusFZ].

---

## Long-term outcomes

Conservative management is effective for small, dry perforations with minimal hearing loss [^114kGDbq], whereas **surgical management** achieves high rates of closure and hearing improvement [^113Twgnr]; cartilage grafts are durable for large defects [^1173sA4P].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patient education and counseling should emphasize **keeping the ear dry** [^114C4PPy] and avoiding trauma, discuss hearing rehabilitation with hearing aids or other assistive devices if needed [^114ksP7G], and ensure **regular follow-up** to monitor for complications and recurrence. Priorities are to **keep the ear dry**, treat otorrhea with non-ototoxic drops [^112ohKcZ], and seek **ENT evaluation for possible tympanoplasty** [^113Twgnr].

### Outcomes of perichondrium graft covering the epithelium of the tympanic membrane for large-sized perforations: A 3–5-year follow-up study [^113Twgnr]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2023). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the graft outcomes and iatrogenic cholesteatomas for three years following the cartilage-perichondrium over-underlay technique with a perichondrial graft covering the epithelium for large-sized tympanic membrane (TM) perforations.

- **Materials and methods**: This prospective case series enrolled patients with large-sized perforations who underwent the endoscopic cartilage-perichondrium over-underlay technique. The graft success rate, hearing outcomes, and development of iatrogenic middle ear cholesteatomas and graft cholesteatomas were assessed three years postoperatively.

- **Results**: This study included 62 ears of 62 patients. The mean follow-up duration was 47.3 ± 10.8 months (range: 38–64 months). Neovascularization was observed in the lateral perichondrium graft in 55 (88.7%) patients, which inosculated into the TM remnant at 4–5 weeks. However, graft neovascularization was not observed in the four patients with excessive perichondrium graft migration into the external auditory canal and the three patients with middle ear infections. The graft failure rate was 6.5% at 6 months, 11.3% at 12 months, and 6.5% at 24 months; the overall graft success rate was 91.8% at the last follow-up. Granular myringitis developed in 11.3% (7/62) of the patients. High-resolution computed tomography revealed well-pneumatized mastoids and middle ear at the final follow-up; however, graft cholesteatomas were observed in 3 (4.8%) patients at 7–24 months postoperatively.

The cartilage-perichondrium over-underlay technique with a perichondrial graft covering the epithelium of the tympanic membrane for large-sized perforations demonstrated a high success rate over three to five years.

### Chronic suppurative otitis media [^114ksP7G]. Lancet (2024). Low credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a leading global cause of potentially preventable hearing loss in children and adults, associated with socioeconomic deprivation. There is an absence of consensus on the definition of CSOM, which complicates efforts for prevention, treatment, and monitoring. CSOM occurs when perforation of the tympanic membrane is associated with severe or persistent inflammation in the middle ear, leading to hearing loss and recurrent or persistent ear discharge (otorrhoea). Cholesteatoma, caused by the inward growth of the squamous epithelium of the tympanic membrane into the middle ear, can also occur. The optimal treatment of discharge in CSOM is topical antibiotics. In resource-limited settings where topical antibiotics might not be available, topical antiseptics are an alternative. For persistent disease, surgery to repair the tympanic membrane or remove cholesteatoma might offer long-term resolution of otorrhoea and potential improvement to hearing. Recent developments in self-fitted air-conduction and bone-conduction hearing aids offer promise as new options for rehabilitation.

### Endoscopic transcanal myringoplasty for anterior perforations of the tympanic membrane [^112tKzGb]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Repairing anterior perforations of the tympanic membrane has been challenging for otolaryngologists, making it crucial to devise a simple and effective technique for performing the repair.

- **Objective**: To assess the results of endoscopic transcanal myringoplasty for repairing anterior perforations of the tympanic membrane.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This medical record review included 59 patients who underwent endoscopic transcanal myringoplasty from January 1, 2013, to June 1, 2015, at PoJen General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. Patients with ossicular chain disease, cholesteatoma, or inadequate follow-up were excluded. Patients were followed up for 6 months, with the final follow-up completed on January 1, 2016.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The main outcome was the rate of overall graft success after endoscopic transcanal myringoplasty. Secondary outcomes included hearing results and prognostic factors.

- **Results**: The study sample comprised the medical records of 59 patients (30 men [51%]; 29 women [49%]; mean [SD] age, 49.5 [13.1] years) who underwent endoscopic transcanal myringoplasty. Overall, 55 patients (93%) had a successful graft at 6 postoperative months. The mean (SD) preoperative and postoperative air-bone gaps were 15.9 (9.4) and 5.4 (7.0) dB, respectively, demonstrating a significant mean (SD) improvement of 10.3 (7.6) dB (Cohen d, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.90–1.63; p < 0.001, paired t test) in the gap. The postoperative air-bone gap was less than 10 dB in 46 patients (78%), 10 to 20 dB in 12 patients (20%), and more than 20 dB in 1 patient (2%).

### ESR essentials: imaging of middle ear cholesteatoma-practice recommendations by the European Society of Head and Neck Radiology [^114HusFZ]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

The surgical management of cholesteatoma most commonly utilizes a retro-auricular approach. This approach can be classified based on whether the posterior external auditory canal (EAC) wall is removed, known as a canal wall down mastoidectomy (CWDM), or preserved, known as a canal wall up mastoidectomy (CWUM). A CWDM is effective in eradicating cholesteatoma; however, it results in a large cavity that requires frequent cleaning, mandates water precautions, and complicates the fitting of hearing aids. In contrast, a CWUM mitigates these disadvantages but presents challenges due to the greater preservation of bony structures, which makes complete removal of cholesteatoma more difficult. CWUMs are associated with higher residual disease rates. To address CWDM's disadvantages, the posterior EAC wall can be reconstructed and the mastoid obliterated using various materials, such as cartilage, bone (powder, chips, or pâté), fascia, or hydroxyapatite.

Mastoidectomy types are depicted with sagittal and axial reconstructions from an unenhanced CT through the left temporal bone of a patient previously undergoing CWDM. There is a deficiency of the posterior EAC wall and cavity formation, which requires cleaning under otoscopic guidance. In another patient, sagittal and axial CT reconstructions illustrate a CWUM with an intact posterior EAC wall. A defect in the superomedial EAC wall and tympanic membrane has been repaired with tragal cartilage.

For smaller cholesteatomas, minimally invasive endaural or transcanal approaches are recommended.

### Improving patient care pathways in otitis externa [^115VNDHx]. Family Practice (2022). Low credibility.

Referrals for otitis externa (OE) have dramatically increased, but the reasons for this remain unclear. We aim to characterize the management of patients both pre- and post-referral to identify areas of improvement at the primary-secondary care interface.

- **Methods**: This was a questionnaire study from a consultant-led research clinic specifically set up to prospectively analyze OE referrals at a tertiary referral center for Otolaryngology.

- **Results**: Sixty-two patients were included; 63% were female, with a median age of 57 years. One patient was excluded due to non-OE clinical diagnosis. Most patients had multiple primary care visits before referral (average 4 visits to GP; 2 to a practice nurse). Sixty per cent had received oral antibiotics, with 16% receiving multiple classes. Eighteen per cent had never used ear drops, and 39% were not advised to keep their ears dry. Twenty-one per cent had dermatitis, 13% had contact allergies, 30% had systemic allergies, and 5% had diabetes. Less than 10% had narrow ear canals. Thirty-six per cent had active discharge, but less than 7% needed a wick. Approximately 75% appear suitable for community aural care clinics.

- **Conclusions**: OE occurs most commonly in female patients and often presents with associated risk factors. Patients frequently consult primary care multiple times prior to referral. Lifestyle advice and ototopical drops are frequently overlooked and patients are often inappropriately treated with oral antibiotics. Most ears were anatomically normal, and community aural care clinics may play a role in providing more timely and accessible treatment.

### Ménière's disease [^112hapz6]. Lancet (2008). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Ménière's disease:

- **Definition**: Ménière's disease is a chronic disorder of the inner ear characterized by intermittent episodes of vertigo and fluctuating hearing loss.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of Ménière's disease is multifactorial, with a characteristic sign being endolymphatic hydrops, a disorder in which excessive endolymph accumulates in the inner ear and causes damage to the ganglion cells.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of Ménière's disease in the US is estimated at 190 per 100,000 population.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for Ménière's disease include adult age, family history, and certain lifestyle and environmental factors, such as allergies.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients experience intermittent episodes of vertigo lasting from minutes to hours, along with fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss that can progress over time. Tinnitus and aural pressure are also common symptoms. The severity and frequency of these symptoms can vary greatly among patients.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of Ménière's disease is generally favorable in terms of symptom management.

### American cochlear implant alliance task force guidelines for clinical assessment and management of cochlear implantation in children with single-sided deafness [^114meGxu]. Ear and Hearing (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for acute bacterial meningitis, specifically concerning the management of hearing loss, the ACI Alliance 2022 guidelines recommend isolating the input from the contralateral, normal-hearing ear when assessing the impaired ear (measurement of aided sound field thresholds and speech recognition) for cases of single-sided deafness. The recommended methods include:

- **Direct audio input technology**: Use of technology to directly input signals into the impaired ear.
- **Plugging the contralateral ear and placing a circumaural phone over the pinna**: Physically isolating the normal-hearing ear.
- **Masking the contralateral ear via an insert phone and placing a circumaural phone over the pinna**: Using audio masking techniques to ensure accurate assessment of the impaired ear.

### Protocol for the development of the WHO package of ear and hearing care interventions [^113wvLcf]. BMJ Public Health (2025). Low credibility.

The core research group will conduct a systematic literature search of guideline databases and selected academic databases for each condition identified in phase 1. Websites for professional otolaryngology and audiology associations will also be searched for relevant guidelines. All processes related to the systematic literature reviews, including the development of search strings, will be conducted under the guidance of the WHO EHC Programme. As necessary, search terms and filters will be adapted to effectively conduct the search across different databases and websites. Searches will identify clinical practice guidelines published from 2014 onwards to ensure interventions reflect evidence-based research and practice, and in several languages, including English, Spanish, French, Russian, or Chinese.

Two members of the core research group will serve as reviewers and will independently screen the titles and abstracts of the clinical practice guidelines. The following exclusion criteria will be applied: (1) the identified literature is not a guideline; and (2) the guideline is not related to the selected EHC condition. The same two reviewers will perform a full-text screen of clinical practice guidelines. Guidelines will be excluded if there is a (1) presence of commercial funding and/or unmanaged conflicts of interest of contributors; and/or (2) absence of affiliations of all contributors. Any disagreements related to the inclusion/exclusion of guidelines will be resolved by a discussion between the two reviewers.

### A multi-center study of ossiculoplasty hearing outcomes and a grading scale of ear environment risk [^112i9qK9]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Low credibility.

The modern concept of ossiculoplasty, including the use of synthetic materials, is roughly as old as the concept of tympanoplasty itself. Indeed, alongside the classic descriptions of tympanoplasty by Wullstein and Zöllner of the 1950s, one will also discover the first report of a synthetic ossicular replacement prosthesis by Wullstein in 1952, wherein a vinyl-acrylic strut was placed between a mobile stapes footplate and a grafted tympanic membrane. A few years later, Hall and Rytzner reported the use of an incus autograft for ossiculoplasty in 1959.

Early attempts at ossiculoplasty using various synthetic materials such as solid plastics and metals were plagued by undesired consequences such as foreign body reaction, demineralization of adjacent native ossicles, resorption, and extrusion, which prompted a common sentiment that perhaps synthetic prostheses were inherently unfit for use in chronic middle ear disease. Thus, throughout the latter half of the twentieth century, advancements in ossiculoplasty were heavily focused on the key issue of biocompatibility. Autograft ossiculoplasty with sculpted native ossicles arose as a viable alternative concept but with limitations related to technical complexity and a unique risk of prompting recidivism in patients with cholesteatoma. A noteworthy breakthrough in this realm involved high-density porous polyethylene implants, which were popularized in the 1970s to eventually attain broad use worldwide. Although high-density porous polyethylene still had shortcomings such as long-term stability, its general biocompatibility was a significant advancement.

### The impact of platelet-derived growth factor on closure of chronic tympanic membrane perforations: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^1136NpAn]. Otology & Neurotology (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with tympanic membrane (TM) perforations often have infections, and repetitive topical treatment may be required. These infections can be prevented by permanent closure of the TM perforation. Different surgical treatment options have been described, but noninvasive techniques may be preferred as they carry less risk than surgery. One noninvasive approach is to induce wound healing by application of growth factors. The effect and clinical use of applying topical platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) for decrease of size and closure of chronic TM perforations is evaluated.

- **Study design**: Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study.

- **Setting**: Tertiary referral center.

- **Patients**: Twenty patients with chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma for more than 3 months.

- **Intervention**: Topical treatment with PDGF or placebo applied weekly to the TM for 6 weeks.

- **Main outcome measures**: Success rate, defined as a reduction of perforation size of 50% or more to determine relative changes in the perforation size; effect of initial size and location of TM perforation on success rate; and air and bone conduction thresholds to determine air-bone gap measured before treatment.

Randomization made matching pretreatment perforation size of the two study groups impossible, and the initial rate perforation/TM was significantly smaller in the PDGF group. No difference between the two groups was found for perforation/TM less than 10%. However, the success rate did not differ significantly between the two groups (power = 0.8).

### Can vinegar be used in treating Pseudomonas ear infections in a patient with a perforated eardrum [^112rU2Lp]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic Pseudomonas ear infections are difficult to treat, particularly in immunodeficient patients. Vinegar therapy is a time-tested measure for the treatment of these infections. It is inexpensive, simple, easy to administer, and very effective. However, some physicians are reluctant to use it in immunocompromised patients or in the setting of a perforated tympanic membrane.

We describe our successful use of vinegar therapy in a 32-year-old man with both of these conditions. His Pseudomonas ear infection had persisted for more than 5 years despite conventional drug treatment. Eventually, we treated him with instillations of topical vinegar, and his infection cleared in 3 weeks.

### The natural course of tympanic membrane retractions in the posterosuperior quadrant of pars tensa: A watchful waiting policy [^114Lwxi2]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). High credibility.

Tympanic membrane retraction (TMR) is a relatively common otologic finding. Currently, there is no consensus on the optimal treatment of TMR. Some ENT surgeons advocate surgical correction, while others opt for a watchful waiting policy. Our aim was to investigate the natural course of retraction pockets in the posterosuperior quadrant of the pars tensa in a large cohort of patients.

- **Methods**: An observational retrospective cohort study was conducted, including patients of all ages with a posterosuperior pars tensa retraction. The primary outcome measure was the difference between audiometry at the first and last visits. Secondary outcomes were patients' complaints, otoscopic outcomes (Sade classification), and complications (perforation, ossicular chain damage, and/or cholesteatoma).

- **Results**: A total of 71 patients with 81 ears and a median age of 23 years (IQR 14–47) were included. The median duration of follow-up was 64 months (IQR 44–102). The mean air-bone gap at the first and last visits was 17.9 dB (SD 11.3) and 15.5 dB (SD 12.9), respectively, with a mean improvement of 2.4 dB (p = 0.08). In 10 ears (12%), the hearing level (air-bone gap) deteriorated by 10 dB or more. Patients who presented with a TMR Sade grade I at the first visit had significantly better audiometric outcomes than those presenting with Sade grade III (p = 0.001). Progression to cholesteatoma occurred in one patient (1%), progression to perforation occurred in five patients (6%), and progression to ossicular chain damage occurred in five patients (6%).

### Tympanic membrane regeneration therapy for pediatric tympanic membrane perforation [^115Xq5Sf]. Otology & Neurotology (2024). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate tympanic membrane regeneration therapy (TMRT) for pediatric tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs).

- **Study design**: Intervention study conducted at a research institute hospital.

- **Patients**: In this study, 20 patients with chronic TMP (M/F: 13/7, 13/8 ears, age 0–15 years) treated with TMRT were evaluated. For comparison, 20 pediatric patients with chronic TMP who underwent myringoplasty/tympanoplasty were included.

- **Interventions**: For the TM repair procedure, the edge of the TMP was disrupted mechanically, and a gelatin sponge immersed in basic fibroblast growth factor was placed inside and outside the tympanic cavity and covered with fibrin glue. The TMP was examined 4 ± 1 weeks later. The protocol was repeated up to four times until closure was complete.

- **Main outcome measures**: Closure of the TMP and hearing improvement were evaluated at 16 weeks after the final regenerative procedure. Adverse events were monitored.

- **Results**: The mean follow-up period was 427.1 days. The TM regenerated in all cases, but pinhole reperforation occurred in two cases, with a final closure rate of 90.5% (19 of 21). Hearing improved from 24.9 ± 7.6 dB on average before surgery to 13.8 ± 5.4 dB after surgery. The AB gap improved from 12.9 ± 8.0 to 5.2 ± 3.5 dB. The myringoplasty/tympanoplasty group had significantly lower AB gap improvement compared with the TMRT group. There were no adverse events.

- **Conclusions**: TMRT can be expected to regenerate near-normal TMs with a high closure ratio, resulting in better hearing improvement compared with the myringoplasty/tympanoplasty group.

### WHO wrote this clinical practice guideline [^112bCM64]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation clinical practice guidelines address a variety of otolaryngologic diseases and procedures. While it may seem reasonable to create these guidelines by assembling a team of expert clinicians familiar with the pertinent clinical issues and the available evidence, with debate and eventual agreement leading to recommendations, trustworthy clinical practice guidelines are in fact created via a defined process. This process involves assembling a guideline development group composed of diverse stakeholders, including clinician generalists and specialists, content experts, methodologists, physicians and non-physicians, patients, and advocates. Such a guideline development group can create a valuable and trusted guideline for clinicians and affected patients.

### The development and evaluation of a smartphone-aided diagnosis application to measure tympanic membrane perforations [^114aBCy8]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). High credibility.

Chronic otitis media is a long-term infection of the middle ear characterized by persistent discharge from the middle ear through a perforated tympanic membrane. It is one of the most common causes of preventable hearing loss, especially in developing countries. Precise estimation of the size of tympanic membrane perforation is essential for successful clinical management. In this study, we developed a smartphone-based application to calculate the ratio of the area of tympanic membrane perforation to the area of the tympanic membrane. Twelve standardized patients and 60 medical students were involved to assess the area of tympanic membrane perforation, in particular, the percentage of perforation size.

- **Methods**: In total, 60 student doctors, including year 5 and year 6 medical students, interns, and post-graduate year training doctors, were recruited during their rotation at the Otolaryngology Department of Taipei Medical University Shuang-Ho Hospital. Twelve standardized patients with chronic otitis media were recruited through a single otology practice. Oto-endoscopic examination was performed for all patients using a commercially available digital oto-endoscope, and clinical images of the tympanic membrane perforation were obtained. To demonstrate the variability of perforation size estimation by different student doctors, we calculated the percentage of perforation using the smartphone-based application for 12 tympanic membranes objectively and compared the results with those visually estimated by the 60 student doctors subjectively.

### Preoperative factors affecting tympanic membrane regeneration therapy using an atelocollagen and basic fibroblast growth factor [^114Mmx75]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2015). High credibility.

Use of growth factors to achieve closure of perforated tympanic membranes (TMs) has recently become popular. However, preoperative factors affecting treatment outcomes have seldom been discussed. This study aims to evaluate preoperative factors contributing to the success or failure of healing of perforated TMs.

This retrospective cohort study involved 153 patients (48 males and 105 females) with a duration of perforation longer than 6 months prior to treatment. They were observed for at least 1 year after treatment between July 2009 and June 2012. Eight factors considered likely to affect the outcome of perforation closure were statistically evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Each perforated TM was filled with a synthetic graft material, consisting of an atelocollagen sponge and silicone membrane, containing human basic fibroblast growth factor to promote wound healing after TM perforation closure. The main outcomes measured were complete closure versus residual perforation.

After 1 year of follow-up, 101 patients (66.0%) achieved complete closure, 30 patients (19.6%) had residual pinhole perforations (< 1 mm diameter), and 22 patients (14.4%) had larger residual perforations. Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for each explanatory variable identified significant factors as a TM without calcification (odds ratio [OR], 2.68 [95% CI, 1.17–6.15]; p = 0.03) and a perforation not involving the tympanic annulus (odds ratio, 2.75 [95% CI, 1.09–6.94]; p = 0.04). Insignificant factors included perforation ma…

### A study of correlation between tympanic membrane perforation size with hearing loss in patients with inactive mucosal chronic otitis media [^115oFBv8]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Low credibility.

This study is directed towards establishing a correlation between the objective measurement of tympanic membrane (TM) perforation size with hearing loss in patients with inactive mucosal chronic otitis media (COM), and to compare the otoscopic findings of the TM perforation vis-a-vis the results obtained by image analysis of the endoscopic image of the perforation.

- **Materials and methods**: An observational, prospective, and hospital-based study was performed on 107 ears (78 patients) with inactive mucosal chronic otitis media. Objective measurement of the TM perforation size was done by capturing the images of the perforation on ImageJ analysis software. A correlation was established between the hearing loss and the perforation with respect to its size and location. The accuracy of the otoscopic finding of the perforation was established with respect to the endoscopic image of the perforation.

- **Results**: The extent of the hearing loss was seen to increase with increasing size of the TM perforation (r = 0.435, p < 0.0001). Posterior perforations had a 12% greater hearing loss than anterior perforations, but this was significant only at the frequency of 500Hz (p = 0.02). There was a positive correlation between the otoscopic estimation of the size of the perforation with the endoscopically obtained image.

- **Conclusion**: Hearing loss in chronic otitis media is directly proportional to the size of the TM perforation, and posteriorly based perforations have worse audiometric thresholds at lower frequencies (500Hz).

### Long-term outcomes of cartilage-buttressed T-tube tympanoplasty for prolonged middle ear ventilation [^116te48o]. The Laryngoscope (2019). Low credibility.

To report on the safety and efficacy of cartilage-buttressed T-tube tympanoplasty for long-term middle ear ventilation, specifically by examining the duration of tube survival, as well as adverse events associated with prolonged middle ear intubation, including persistent tympanic membrane perforation.

- **Study design**: Retrospective case series of patients undergoing cartilage-buttressed T-tube tympanoplasty between January 2005 and December 2016 in a tertiary-care neurotology private practice.

- **Methods**: Patients who underwent cartilage T-tube tympanoplasty with complete pre- and postoperative audiometric data and a minimum follow-up duration of 12 months were analyzed. T-tube survival and adverse events, including persistent tympanic membrane perforation, were recorded and compared to published data for other long-term middle ear ventilation techniques.

- **Results**: The study cohort included 72 cartilage-buttressed T-tube tympanoplasties in 68 patients. Median tube survival was 34 months (range, 2–131 months). The incidence of persistent tympanic membrane perforation (n = 1) was 1.4%. Cartilage-buttressed T-tube tympanoplasty is a safe and effective means of accomplishing long-term middle ear ventilation, with a considerably lower rate of persistent tympanic membrane perforation compared to alternative methods of prolonged middle ear ventilation.

- **Level of evidence**: 4 Laryngoscope, 129:203–208, 2019.

### Functional correlations of tympanic membrane perforation size [^11338GZP]. Otology & Neurotology (2012). Low credibility.

The correlation between tympanic membrane perforations and hearing loss was studied. **Study design**: Prospective data from 220 patients, who underwent primary surgery for simple chronic otitis media with a perforated eardrum, were analyzed. **Setting**: Tertiary referral center. **Patients**: One hundred fifty-one patients with 155 eardrum perforations, which were checked for correct diagnosis, normal middle-ear status, and integrity of the ossicular chain, were included. **Interventions**: All patients underwent primary myringoplasty. **Main outcome measures**: Preoperative conductive hearing loss due to eardrum perforations.

- **Results**: Hearing loss shows a linear relationship with increasing eardrum perforation size. Umbo involvement shows a worsening of the hearing by 5 to 6 dB (p < 0.0001). The least impact of a perforation is seen at the resonance frequency of 2 kHz. Above and below 2 kHz, an 'inverted V shape' of the air-bone gap is a consistent finding. If the air-bone gap exceeds the 'inverted V-shape' pattern, additional pathology behind the eardrum must be assumed and addressed.

- **Conclusion**: We propose using standardized photographs or drawings to document preoperative perforation sizes. A linear relationship between the size of a perforation and the conductive hearing loss does exist. Umbo involvement at the perforation margin may worsen the hearing by 5 to 6 dB, whereas the position of the perforation itself does not play a role. The least impact of a perforation is seen at the resonance frequency of 2 kHz.

### The natural course of tympanic membrane retractions in the posterosuperior quadrant of pars tensa: A watchful waiting policy [^114iQriW]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Low credibility.

Furthermore, the ossicular chain damage was not systematically collected; it was solely based on descriptions in the medical records and when the ossicular chain was clearly visible on the oto-endoscopic images. No classification system was used because the entire ossicular chain could not be visualized during otoscopy. Lastly, seven patients in our cohort received ventilation tubes after the watchful waiting policy was initiated. The indication for these ventilation tubes was OME and not for the TMR. These patients with ventilation tubes were not excluded due to the intention-to-treat principle. We have used this principle to mirror expected outcomes seen in real-world practice. One excluded patient developed cholesteatoma during follow-up; this patient was excluded due to missing oto-endoscopic images. It was noted in the clinical records that this patient had a retraction and developed cholesteatoma.

- **Clinical implications**: Based on our data, a watchful waiting policy can be justified in patients with a pars tensa retraction, especially in patients who have mild hearing loss. However, caution should be taken in patients with a pars tensa retraction that involves the promontory (Sade grade III) at the first visit to the otorhinolaryngology clinic. The decision to operate on a patient should be individually discussed and be based on the age of the patient, severity of the retraction, and the initial amount of hearing loss. A large prospective study is needed to confirm these results.

### Otorrhea in young children after tympanostomy-tube placement for persistent middle-ear effusion: Prevalence, incidence, and duration [^114tJfSg]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to characterize the occurrence of tube otorrhea after tympanostomy-tube placement (TTP) for persistent middle-ear effusion (MEE) in a group of otherwise healthy infants and young children.

- **Methods**: In a long-term, prospective study of child development in relation to early-life otitis media, we enrolled by 2 months of age healthy infants who presented for primary care at one of two urban hospitals or one of two small-town/rural and four suburban private pediatric group practices. We monitored their middle-ear status closely. Children who developed persistent MEE of specified durations within the first 3 years of life became eligible for random assignment to undergo TTP either promptly or after an extended period if MEE persisted. The present report concerns 173 randomly assigned children who underwent bilateral TTP between ages 6 and 36 months and were followed for at least 6 months thereafter. Episodes of tube otorrhea were treated with oral antimicrobial drugs and, if persistent, with ototopical medication.

- **Results**: Socioeconomic status, as estimated from maternal education and type of health insurance, was lowest at the urban sites and highest at the suburban sites. The tenure of the 230 tubes that were extruded during the observation period ranged from 19 days to 38.5 months (mean = 13.8 months; median = 13.5 months). During the first 18 months after TTP, the proportion of children who had tubes in place and who developed one or more episodes of otorrhea increased progressively, reaching 74.8% after 12 months and 83.0% after 18 months.

### Acute otitis media [^114DG2iZ]. Canadian Family Physician Medecin de Famille Canadien (2007). High credibility.

The disease acute otitis media can be associated with various symptoms and conditions: exposure to secondhand smoke, conjunctivitis, a bulging tympanic membrane, difficulty sleeping, sinusitis, ear pain, and atopy. Common considerations include children's susceptibility and parental suspicion of otitis media. It can also be associated with an immunocompromising condition, a distinctly red tympanic membrane, irritability, ear rubbing, headache, somnolence, a cloudy tympanic membrane, and ear fullness. Additionally, eustachian tube dysfunction, an increased white blood cell count, fever, neck pain, poor feeding, enlarged adenoids, distinctly impaired tympanic membrane mobility, otorrhea, hearing loss, cigarette smoking, an increased serum CRP, and a retracted tympanic membrane are considered relevant factors.

### Clinical practice guidelines on the management of patients with common otologic pathology toward European consensus: Outline of approach [^113y7PsS]. Otology & Neurotology (2013). Low credibility.

To achieve a European consensus about the best-evidence-informed management of patients with common otologic-related problems, a consensus process was supported by the European Academy of Otology & Neuro-Otology. A guideline for a specific disease should include evidence-informed recommendations about questions relating to treatment, prognosis, and diagnosis.

A standardized method to design guideline questions is essential to search for evidence and to grade the quality of available evidence, which results in an overview of the best available literature. Experts reach a consensus on best practices and articulate recommendations on evidence-based actions to be taken in patient care accordingly. The advantages of such an evidence-based consensus usually include expert opinions and arguments on availability, transferability, applicability, and affordability.

The volume of new information increases at a staggering pace, leading to an increasing demand for consistent systematic management of the available evidence. Systematic filtering of available evidence helps clinicians find and apply the best available and latest evidence efficiently and quickly. Despite the otologic line of approach, the present article provides a step-by-step "guideline development instruction manual", which could be used within other medical specialties.

### Surgery for tympanic membrane retraction pockets [^115RNL97]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Tympanic membrane retractions are commonly managed by ENT surgeons. There is currently no consensus as to the indications, timing, and options for management of this condition.

- **Objectives**: To study the effectiveness of different surgical options in the management of tympanic membrane retractions.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2010 Issue 1); PubMed (1950 to 2010); EMBASE (1974 to 2010); CINAHL (1982 to 2010); BIOSIS Previews; ISI Web of Science; CAB Abstracts; LILACS; KoreaMed; IndMed; PakMediNet; China National Knowledge Infrastructure; ISCTRN; UKCRN; ICTRP and Google. The date of the search was 17 March 2010.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the surgical management of tympanic membrane retraction pockets in adults or children. Staging of the retraction using a known system must have been performed. Studies of cholesteatoma or perforations were excluded.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently collected and analysed data to minimize the effects of selection and reporting bias.

- **Main results**: Two RCTs were included, involving 71 participants. The first study showed no statistically significant benefit of cartilage graft tympanoplasty over a watch-and-wait policy for either disease progression or hearing outcome. The second study showed no additional benefit from the insertion of ventilation tubes over cartilage tympanoplasty alone with regards to hearing outcome.

### Natural course of tympanic membrane pathology related to otitis media and ventilation tubes between ages 8 and 18 years [^113W9iyC]. Otology & Neurotology (2005). Low credibility.

To present the course of tympanic membrane pathology in childhood and young adulthood after otitis media (OM) in early life, a prospective follow-up study was conducted. This community study involved a birth cohort of 358 subjects, differentiated as those with a history of OM (OM+) and those without (OM-), as well as subjects with a history of ventilation tube insertion (VT+) and those without (VT-).

Standardized otomicroscopic examinations were performed at ages 8 and 18 years to identify tympanic membrane abnormalities. These included tympanosclerosis, atrophy, atelectasis, retraction pockets of the pars tensa, and retraction of the pars flaccida.

At the age of 8 years, tympanic membrane pathology was highly prevalent in both OM+ subcohorts. Specifically, it was found in 92% of the OM+VT+ group and 46% of the OM+VT- group. In contrast, only 11% of the OM- ears exhibited tympanic membrane abnormalities. Over the following ten years, many tympanic membrane abnormalities disappeared spontaneously. However, the prevalence of tympanosclerosis remained substantial in the OM+VT+ cohort.

The study concludes that the natural course of most tympanic membrane pathology associated with OM in early life is favorable over time. This suggests an intrinsic repair capacity of the tympanic membrane. Notably, tympanosclerosis, the most prevalent sequela of OM and treatment with ventilation tubes, shows little tendency for resolution.

### Types and causes of otorrhea [^112foxMy]. Auris, Nasus, Larynx (2003). High credibility.

Otorrhea can occur due to a variety of causes. It may arise from chronic otitis media, acute otitis externa, or tympanic membrane perforation. Additionally, conditions such as skull fracture, suppurative otitis media, cholesteatoma, foreign body presence in the ear canal, malignant otitis externa, and mastoiditis can also cause otorrhea.

### A multi-center study of ossiculoplasty hearing outcomes and a grading scale of ear environment risk [^117LC4hg]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Low credibility.

This report shows that modern ossiculoplasty is an effective means of improving hearing due to ossicular dysfunction. This large series of 1679 cases reports a mean improvement in PTA-ABG of 12.1 dB over a mean follow-up time of 33.6 months. In the context of traditional bracketed groups of hearing outcomes, 15.0% had PTA-ABG closure of 10 dB or less, 53.4% 20 dB or less, and 79.7% 30 dB or less. For many patients, the outcome that matters most is the postoperative air conduction hearing threshold, and in this respect, ossiculoplasty is also successful in the majority of cases. For example, cases involving purely conductive hearing loss in the moderate or worse range were corrected into the normal range in 54% of attempts, and hearing was corrected into the mild or normal range in over 80% of attempts. These results strongly suggest that ossiculoplasty holds the potential to mitigate the need for amplification in a large percentage of patients with conductive hearing loss.

Complications, which plagued the early era of synthetic prosthesis use for ossiculoplasty, were uncommon in this large cohort. The rate of known prosthesis extrusion was a mere 2.1%, with an additional 3.4% of cases suspected to have a shifted prosthesis. However, these data regarding prosthesis positioning are admittedly unreliable because they are based on clinicians' impressions, not radiologic confirmation. Nevertheless, low rates of extrusion in this series and several other past publications have likely been achieved by routine application of a cartilage cap, which appears to be fairly standard.

### Clinical practice guideline: Tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^111Vvt6Y]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for otitis media with effusion, the AAO-HNSF 2022 guidelines recommend reevaluating pediatric patients with chronic OME who have not received tympanostomy tubes at 3- to 6-month intervals. This should continue until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is detected, or structural abnormalities of the tympanic membrane or middle ear are suspected.

### Otitis media [^1162Rm7A]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2016). High credibility.

The disease otitis media with effusion can be associated with a variety of symptoms and conditions. These include difficulty sleeping, exposure to irritants, cloudy tympanic membrane, loss of appetite, irritability, and recent upper respiratory infection. Additionally, it can be linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia, drinking while lying on the back, delayed speech and language skills, Down's syndrome, cleft palate, and immobile tympanic membrane. Other associated factors are enlarged adenoids, sudden increase in air pressure, developmental delay, listlessness, bulging tympanic membrane, allergic rhinitis, hearing loss, retracted tympanic membrane, and ear pain.

### The natural course of tympanic membrane retractions in the posterosuperior quadrant of pars tensa: A watchful waiting policy [^111WSTUJ]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Low credibility.

Sade et al. described 308 ears (215 patients) with different types of tympanic membrane retractions followed up for an average of 37 months (range: 12–108 months). Sixty-eight retractions were found in the pars tensa, of which 50 were described as large. Only 1 of the 50 large retractions (2%) progressed into cholesteatoma (average follow-up 34 months). This is compared with our study results; progression to cholesteatoma occurred in one patient (1%).

Parkes et al. described a prospective cohort study of 37 pars tensa retractions in 26 children with cleft palate, a population known for a higher risk of OME and Eustachian tube dysfunction, in which a wait-and-see policy was maintained. The median age in this cohort was 15 years (range: 9–21 years) and the median duration of follow-up was 6.4 years (range: 0.75–7.6 years). They found that 28 of 37 (76%) retractions had either stable (n = 16) or better (n = 12) outcomes. The incidence of cholesteatoma was 2.6% over an 8.5-year period. In the present cohort, 95% of retractions had stable or improved outcomes on otoscopy.

An argument against the wait-and-see policy is the possible risk of developing cholesteatoma. However, both our study results and the aforementioned studies show that in the natural course of TMRs, the incidence of cholesteatoma is rather low (1–2.6%).

In the patient group aged 18 years or younger, the level of hearing increases by 8.0 dB (SD 11.8). An explanation for this hearing improvement might be that the middle ear ventilation is improved by the maturation of the Eustachian tube.

### Prevalence of tympanic membrane perforations among adolescents, adults, and older adults in the United States [^111f2ydS]. Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Tympanic membrane (TM) perforations can occur at any age, but limited population-level data are available. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of the prevalence and population estimates for TM perforations among individuals aged 12 years and older in the United States. Overall, TM perforations have a prevalence of 2.1% (95% CI, 1.7%-2.6%), corresponding to 5.8 million Americans. Across the life course, older adults have the highest prevalence of TM perforations at 6.1% (95% CI, 4.7%-7.6%), corresponding to nearly 3 million Americans, as opposed to a prevalence of 0.6% (95% CI, 0.3%-0.9%) in adolescents, which equates to 0.2 million Americans. Males and females have a similar prevalence at 2.3% (95% CI, 1.6%-3.0%) among males and 2.0% (95% CI, 1.4%-2.6%) among females. These prevalence and population estimates provide the first US-based population estimates of the burden of TM perforations over the life course.

### Endoscopic lateral cartilage graft tympanoplasty [^1173sA4P]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe a novel technique for lateral graft tympanoplasty.

- **Study design**: Case series with chart review.
- **Setting**: Tertiary care university hospital.
- **Subjects and methods**: Pediatric and adult patients with tympanic membrane perforations deemed unfavorable for a medial graft technique due to the perforation characteristics or myringitis.

Results showed that between 2014 and 2016, 34 ears from 31 patients underwent a transcanal endoscopic lateral cartilage graft tympanoplasty. The mean age of the patients was 24.4 years (range, 6–71 years), with 22 patients (65%) younger than 18 years. All patients had tympanic membrane perforations. Eighteen patients (53%) had total or near-total perforations, leaving a minimal anterior remnant, and 16 patients (47%) had extensive myringitis. A bisected tragal cartilage-perichondrium shield graft was used in 33 patients (97%).

The mean (SD) follow-up length was 9.8 (5.7) months. The initial perforation closure rate was 88.2% (30/34). Three of the persistent perforations underwent a revision endoscopic medial graft tympanoplasty with successful closure, leaving a final closure rate of 97.1% (33/34). Five patients (15%) required topical therapy for postoperative myringitis. Mean (SD) pure-tone average and air-bone gap significantly improved by 11.5 (10.7) dB (P < .001) and 11.4 (10.6) dB (P < .001), respectively. Twenty-seven patients (79%) closed their air-bone gap within 20 dB.

In conclusion, transcanal endoscopic lateral cartilage graft tympanoplasty is feasible, and initial data support favorable outcomes. Further data are necessary for evaluation of long-term effects.

### The natural course of tympanic membrane retractions in the posterosuperior quadrant of pars tensa: A watchful waiting policy [^113bNhKz]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Retraction pockets in both pars tensa and pars flaccida**: In 20 ears (29%), there was a retraction in both the pars tensa and the pars flaccida. In this group of patients, 2 (10%) presented with Sade grade I; 7 (35%) presented with Sade grade II; and 11 patients (55%) presented with Sade grade III. At the last visit, one patient (5%) was in remission; one patient presented with Sade grade I (5%); seven patients (35%) presented with Sade grade II; and 11 patients (55%) presented with Sade grade III. Reintervention occurred in four patients (20%). All four patients received ventilation tubes for OME. Progression to perforation occurred in two patients (10%). Progression to ossicular chain damage also occurred in two patients (10%). There was no progression to cholesteatoma. The mean air-bone gap at the first and last visits was 16.6 dB (SD 8.5) and 13.6 dB (SD 10.5), with a mean improvement of +3.0 dB (p = 0.34).

- **Presentation with otitis media with effusion**: Twelve patients presented with OME when the TMR was diagnosed. In this group of patients, the mean air-bone gap at the first and last visits was 25.3 dB (SD 12.9) and 12.3 dB (SD 8.5), with a mean improvement of +13.0 dB (SD 12.9). In the remaining patients (n = 69), the mean air-bone gap at the first and last visits was 16.6 dB (SD 10.6) and 16.1 dB (SD 12.4), with a mean improvement of +0.5 dB (SD 10.9). The difference in hearing gain was statistically significant (p = 0.001, T test).

### Anterior transcanal tympanoplasty: A novel technique to repair anterior perforations [^116dvEeK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

To report a novel, minimally invasive technique for anterior tympanic membrane (TM) perforation repair, a transcanal repair of the anterior TM was performed on 45 patients. A total of 689 patients with chronic suppurative otitis media underwent surgical intervention; of these, 45 patients with isolated anterior TM perforations underwent an anterior tympanoplasty. This approach is similar to a transcanal approach for small posterior perforations; an anterior rather than a posterior flap is raised.

- **Results**:
	- Perforations ranged from 20% to 50% in size. Preoperative air-bone gaps ranged from 5 to 51 dB and averaged 25 dB. Postoperative air-bone gaps ranged from 0 to 33 dB and averaged 14 dB. Of 45 patients, 40 (88%) had closure of their perforations. Data from 1- to 10-year follow-up are provided.

- **Conclusions**:
	- The anterior transcanal tympanoplasty is a minimally invasive technique to repair anterior TM perforations. The procedure is simple and obviates the need for a large postauricular incision.

### Platelet-rich plasma myringoplasty: A new office procedure for the repair of small tympanic membrane perforations [^1121gdgv]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2017). Low credibility.

We conducted a prospective study to assess the effectiveness of a platelet-rich plasma hourglass graft in the repair of small tympanic membrane perforations as an office-based procedure. Our study population was made up of 25 patients — 10 men and 15 women, aged 19 to 45 years (mean: 30.4 ± 7.2) — who each underwent repair of one eardrum. After administering topical anesthesia, a single piece of platelet-rich plasma approximately double the size of the perforation was obtained from each patient's intravenous blood sample. Following the freshening of the perforation's margin, the platelet-rich plasma was placed in an hourglass configuration, with equal portions lying medial and lateral to the perforation. Successful perforation repair was achieved in 21 of the 25 ears (84%). No patient developed an infection, hearing impairment, tinnitus, vertigo, bleeding, taste disturbance, or hyperkeratosis. We conclude that office-based platelet-rich plasma myringoplasty is a safe and effective minimally invasive procedure suitable for repairing small tympanic membrane perforations.

### Protocol for the development of the WHO package of ear and hearing care interventions [^114u5sR5]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Evidence from high-quality systematic reviews will be used to complement evidence from clinical practice guidelines in the following cases: (1) no clinical practice guidelines are identified for a given ear and hearing care (EHC) condition after screening and quality appraisal, (2) the selected clinical practice guidelines provide contradictory recommendations for a given intervention, and/or (3) the clinical practice guideline makes recommendations for an intervention based on evidence that is published prior to 2014. Systematic reviews will be identified by the core research group, under the guidance of the WHO EHC Programme. The identification or conduct of systematic reviews is meant to overcome limitations in the availability of clinical practice guidelines.

First, Cochrane systematic reviews, published or updated since 2014, will be identified. If Cochrane systematic reviews for a given intervention do not exist, other high-quality systematic reviews will be identified through a systematic search process. To ensure the selection of high-quality systematic reviews, two reviewers will independently appraise the quality of the systematic review methodology using the A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2). All non-Cochrane systematic reviews will (1) be screened on AMSTAR 2 item 2 (whether the report of the review contained an explicit statement that the review methods were established prior to the conduct of the review) and (2) when item 2 was rated 'yes', reviewers will assess the remaining critical domains.

### Epidemiology of persistent tympanic membrane perforations subsequent to tympanostomy tubes assessed with real world data [^112GsJsP]. Otology & Neurotology (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to quantify the incidence of persistent tympanic membrane perforation (TMP) after tympanostomy tube (TT) surgery using a large population-based cohort.

- **Study design**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using Medicaid claims data from 1999 to 2006.

- **Patients**: This study focused on healthy children with Medicaid eligibility within 6 months of birth, who received TTs and had 2 to 7 years of follow-up.

- **Main outcome measures**: Persistent TMP was operationalized by a charge for tympanoplasty and/or one or more diagnoses of TMP.

- **Results**: The study identified 47,724 children who received TTs and had at least 2 years of eligibility. The incidence of persistent TMP varied based on definition and follow-up. The 2 and 7-year TMP rates were:

- 0.38% and 3.81% for two TMP diagnoses 6 months apart or tympanoplasty
- 0.26% and 2.94% for two TMP diagnoses 6 months apart
- 0.13% and 1.73% for tympanoplasty alone
- 0.04% and 1.21% for tympanoplasty preceded by one TMP diagnosis
- 0.01% and 0.52% for tympanoplasty and two TMP diagnoses 6 months apart

Reinserting TTs was associated with an increased likelihood of persistent TMP (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.98, 95% CI 1.49–2.63). Each year increase in age was associated with a 49% increase in the risk of persistent TMP.

- **Conclusion**: Billing claims data may be used to assess the rate of persistent TMP after TT placement in large populations, yielding results consistent with findings from cohort studies and meta-analyses. The findings may serve as the basis for future TMP research using real world datasets.

### Long-term follow-up after fat graft myringoplasty: Do size and location matter [^1125H6jx]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Low credibility.

To assess clinical and functional outcomes of a fat graft myringoplasty under local anesthesia in an office setting, a prospective case series was conducted at a tertiary care facility.

Patients included were those with a tympanic membrane (TM) perforation from December 2005 to June 2019. Inclusion criteria were perforation size greater than 25% of the surface of the pars tensa of the TM, entire perforation margins visible through a transcanal view, and lack of spontaneous closure at the 6-month follow-up. Exclusion criteria comprised the presence of cholesteatoma, wet appearance of the mucosa in the tympanic cavity, ear discharge in the 3 months before surgery, or signs of ossicular inconsistency.

The intervention involved an in-office fat graft myringoplasty technique under local anesthesia.

- **Main outcome measures**: Complete perforation closure rate and audiometric outcomes.

A total of 121 patients underwent the procedure, with 21 having bilateral sequential procedures (total 142 ears). The average age was 51.1 ± 18.4 years (range, 3–78 years). The perforation sizes were less than 25% of TM in 39 (27.5%) ears, 25–50% of TM in 49 (34.55%) ears, 50–75% of TM in 34 (23.91%) ears, and 75–100% of TM in 20 (14.10%) ears. Complete perforation closure was evident in 130 (91.55%) of the 142 ears. The preoperative mean air conduction threshold was 59.3 dB (17–95 dB), which significantly improved to 35.6 dB (10–85 dB; P < .0004) after surgery. The preoperative air-bone gap was 30.2 dB (5–70 dB) and also significantly improved to 10.2 dB (5–65 dB; P < .0001) after surgery.

### Systematic review on the management of term prelabour rupture of membranes [^115uvPmK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

Furthermore, the results from the systematic review are in agreement with a recent Cochrane systematic review published by Middleton et al. in that the quality of most studies on this topic is generally low. Since there was a high degree of heterogeneity in the outcomes to be measured, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis. All the studies found in the searches that met the criteria are presented in Table 4, and no studies were omitted due to their quality. Therefore, there is no bias in reporting.

A total of 13 questions were to be answered by the RCTs and 12 questions for the observational studies. All questions were deemed equally important and carried the same weight. All studies were given a score between 0 and 12 or 13, where 0 indicated very poor quality and 12–13 indicated extremely good quality. A percentage was then obtained, for example, 8/13 (61.5%). It was decided a priori that studies scoring less than 40% were considered low quality; studies scoring between 41% and 79% were considered intermediate quality; and studies scoring 80% or more were deemed high quality.

To maintain consistency and rigor, in the case of RCT studies where it was unclear what the primary and secondary outcomes were, or in cases where these were not stated, these studies were given a score of 0 in answer to the question: "Were the primary and secondary outcomes clearly stated?" Furthermore, in the case of RCT studies, if the randomization system used was not stated or the allocation to treatment…

### Paper patching for chronic tympanic membrane perforations [^114kGDbq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

This study was designed to evaluate the results of paper-patch myringoplasty in patients with chronic perforations of the tympanic membrane of different sizes.

- **Study design and setting**: A retrospective survey of paper-patch myringoplasties was conducted at a tertiary referral academic medical center, involving 77 patients with chronic eardrum perforations. The data included causes of perforations, the duration they had been present, their size, number of patch applications, duration of application, and number of successfully closed perforations.

- **Results**: Closure rates were 63.2% for small perforations, 43.5% for medium perforations, and 12.5% for large perforations. Small perforations required the least number of repeated applications and the least time for closure.

- **Conclusions and significance**: Paper patching is technically simple, time-saving, safe to perform, cost-effective, suitable as an outpatient procedure, and has a good success rate. It should be considered for perforations smaller than 5 mm before referring a patient for surgery.

### Rare case of ballooning herniation of the tympanic membrane [^113MCNcY]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 30-year-old, otherwise healthy Swiss military officer presented to his local otolaryngologist with an episode of otitis media with effusion on the right side. The patient, a water sports enthusiast, had a 10-year history of recurrent episodes of acute otitis media on the affected side. These episodes were often accompanied by perforation of the tympanic membrane and otorrhea but showed spontaneous remission each time. The patient had been treated with antibiotics three times during the last 12 months and reported hearing loss and non-pulsatile permanent tinnitus (murmur) on the right side at presentation. He claimed intermittent slight otalgia but denied otorrhea or vertigo. Habitual Valsalva maneuvers helped to improve his hearing ability.

Once again, the effusion resolved spontaneously after conservative treatment. However, during the next presentation, 2 months later, the local otolaryngologist noticed a mass of unclear origin within the proximal external auditory canal. The formation persisted during two subsequent examinations in the following month. A needle aspiration revealed no substance, and the patient was referred to our clinic for further evaluation.

### Rare case of ballooning herniation of the tympanic membrane [^115S54w7]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Eustachian tube dysfunction is defined by signs and symptoms of pressure dysregulation in the middle ear, such as 'aural fullness', 'popping', discomfort, pain, or 'underwater sensation', and represents a common problem with reported incidences ranging from 0.9% to 5%.

According to Schilder et al, the three subtypes of Eustachian tube dysfunction include barochallenge-induced dysfunction in conditions of alteration of the ambient pressure, patulous Eustachian tube dysfunction, and dilatory Eustachian tube dysfunction. The latter can be broken down into functional obstruction, dynamic dysfunction due to muscular failure, and anatomical obstruction.

Acute episodes are often preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection or exacerbation of allergic rhinitis, which causes inflammation in the Eustachian tube orifice or lumen. Chronic Eustachian tube dysfunction is defined by symptoms lasting for more than 3 months and has been associated with damage to the middle ear and the eardrum. Complications include otitis media with effusion (glue ear), middle ear atelectasis (retraction of the eardrum), and chronic otitis media with defects of the tympanic membrane. Consequently, it must be considered the primary cause of herniation of the tympanic membrane.

The earliest mention referring to a 'hernia of the tympanic membrane' dates back to November 4, 1932. In a written protocol of a case discussion in 'The Section of Otology', a 24-year-old male patient was presented, who reported otorrhea from childhood up to the age of 17, which then dried up. Seven years later, the case was further discussed.

### Diagnostic accuracy of group A Streptococcus rapid antigen detection test on middle ear fluid in children with acute otitis media with spontaneous perforation: A prospective multicenter evaluation [^116sdm8N]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). High credibility.

Spontaneous perforation of the tympanic membrane (SPTM) accounts for approximately 7% of acute otitis media (AOM) cases. Several studies have shown that group A Streptococcus (GAS), which represents 12% to 17% of cases, is more often involved in children aged 3 years and older. Moreover, when GAS is isolated from middle ear fluid (MEF), co-infections and recurrent AOM (reAOM) are less frequent than in SPTM due to Haemophilus influenzae infection.

To describe the bacteriologic spectrum of AOM with SPTM, we conducted an observational study from 2015 to 2018, as described elsewhere. Because our results showed that GAS ranked first in infections in children older than 3 years of age, it seemed potentially relevant to perform and evaluate a GAS rapid antigen detection test (RADT) on MEF in addition to otorrhea culture. RADTs have been developed for GAS pharyngitis and are the cornerstone of managing sore throat in many countries. Although this use is off-label, the diagnostic accuracy of GAS RADTs in extrapharyngeal infections (such as perineal infections, blistering dactylitis, and pleural fluid) was assessed in several studies and seemed comparable to that found for pharyngitis. However, to our knowledge, the performance of RADTs in children with SPTM was never evaluated before.

The present study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a GAS RADT compared with the culture of MEF in children with AOM with SPTM.

### Clinical practice guideline: Tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^113cejFM]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for otitis media with effusion, particularly in relation to tympanostomy, the AAO-HNSF 2022 guidelines recommend considering tympanostomy tube insertion for at-risk pediatric patients with unilateral or bilateral OME that is likely to persist. This recommendation is based on a type B (flat) tympanogram or a documented effusion lasting three months or longer.

### Development and validation of DeciBHAL-US: A novel microsimulation model of hearing loss across the lifespan in the United States [^113UuU8a]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

DeciBHAL incorporates acute otitis media (AOM), persistent otitis media with effusion (OME), and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) as explicit etiologic contributors to conductive hearing loss (CHL), and simulates all other causes of CHL in aggregate. All persons in the model, except those with active CSOM, experience age- and region-specific yearly probabilities of at least one episode of AOM. We assumed that simulated persons who have at least one episode of AOM during ages 0–12 years experience an average of 2.8 episodes per year, while those older than age 12 experience one episode per year. The model stratifies two risk groups of persons based on AOM history during the first two years of life: persons experiencing two or more episodes of AOM receive double the risk of subsequent AOM and OME throughout their lifetime. In the absence of adult-specific data, we assume that 17% of all simulated patients who have at least one episode of AOM in a year develop recurrent AOM (reAOM), defined as three or more episodes in one year, and transition to the reAOM/persistent OME health state the subsequent year.

- **Conductive hearing loss health state diagram**: This health state transition diagram shows a schematic of the microsimulation model, where each circle represents a distinct health state and arrows represent transition probabilities. It illustrates the health states related to otitis media and conductive hearing loss in the simulation model. Simulated persons experience yearly probabilities of at least one episode of acute otitis media.

### Rates of tympanic membrane closure in double-tympanocentesis studies [^112mUKNB]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Data on the outcome of tympanic membrane (TM) closure after tympanocentesis in acute otitis media (AOM) patients is limited. The objective was to analyze the dynamics of TM perforation closure after one or two tympanocentesis procedures performed at diagnosis and during AOM treatment.

The study population included 113 children enrolled in four double-tympanocentesis studies. Only the files of patients whose first and second examination were performed by the same two otorhinolaryngologists were analyzed. Middle ear fluid (MEF) was cultured on day 1 and days 4–6, the latter only in initially culture-positive patients. Patients were also examined on days 11–14 and followed until days 22–28.

- **Results**: Ninety-three (82%) patients underwent tympanocentesis on days 4–6; 103 (91%) and 95 (84%) were evaluable on days 11–14 and 22–28, respectively. One hundred seventy-three ears underwent tympanocentesis on day 1 and 139 on days 4–6. Ninety-seven (86%) patients had positive MEF cultures. One hundred fifty-three (88%) tympanocentesis procedures performed at enrollment were closed on days 4–6. No differences were recorded in the closure rates as a function of patient age, previous AOM history, MEF culture positivity, pathogens isolated at enrollment, and pathogen eradication on days 4–6. The 20 eardrums still open on days 4–6 were closed on days 11–14. Eleven (9%) of the evaluable ears tapped on days 4–6 were not closed on days 11–14, and 9 of 10 were closed on days 22–28.

TM perforation closed in most cases within a few days regardless of patient and disease characteristics.

### American cochlear implant alliance task force guidelines for clinical assessment and management of cochlear implantation in children with single-sided deafness [^116AM9Co]. Ear and Hearing (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for acute bacterial meningitis, particularly in managing hearing loss, the ACI Alliance 2022 guidelines recommend plugging the normal-hearing ear with an insert plug. This approach is advised to limit the influence of environmental noise during the behavioral measurement of electric threshold levels. It is also suggested to keep the normal-hearing ear plugged during procedures for behavioral measurement of most comfortable loudness levels, to rank loudness for individual channels, and to balance loudness across channels.

### Tympanic membrane abnormalities and hearing levels at the ages of 5 and 6 years in relation to persistent otitis media and tympanostomy tube insertion in the first 3 years of life: a prospective study incorporating a randomized clinical trial [^112TvtgB]. Pediatrics (2004). High credibility.

One practice guideline recommends myringotomy with tympanostomy tube insertion (M&T) for young children in whom middle-ear effusion (MEE) has persisted for 3 months. Another guideline recommends the procedure after MEE has persisted for 4 to 6 months, provided that a bilateral hearing loss of ≥ 20 dB is present. Sequelae of M&T are not uncommon, but the extent to which these sequelae are attributable to M&T itself, the middle-ear disease that prompted the procedure, or both has not been clear. Our objective in the present study was to examine the prevalence of various tympanic membrane (TM) abnormalities in otherwise healthy children at the age of 5 years and hearing levels at the age of 6 years in relation to persistent MEE and M&T in the children's first 3 years of life.

- **Methods**: In a prospective study of child development in relation to early-life otitis media, we randomly assigned 429 children who met specified criteria regarding the persistence of MEE in their first 3 years of life to undergo M&T either promptly (the "early-treatment" group) or following a defined extended period if MEE remained present (the "late-treatment" group). We also followed a representative sample of 241 children who ranged from having no MEE to having MEE whose cumulative duration fell just short of meeting randomization criteria for the clinical trial (the "nontrial" group). Most of the children in each group underwent both otomicroscopic examination at the age of 5 years and audiometric testing at the age of 6 years, at times when they were free of MEE.

### Rare case of ballooning herniation of the tympanic membrane [^1169dzPF]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Although bulging of the tympanic membrane is commonly encountered, a ballooning herniation occupying the external auditory canal is extremely rare. The development of these lesions is thought to require a pre-existing defect of the tympanic membrane and positive pressure inside the middle ear. Habitual Valsalva maneuvers, the so-called 'autoinflation', can transiently relieve symptoms in these patients but are also part of the pathomechanism in the first place. Severe cases are recommended to be treated surgically, while in mild cases, observation may be a reasonable approach.

### Natural history of pediatric tympanic membrane perforation [^115RZmEk]. Otology & Neurotology (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the natural history of pediatric tympanic membrane perforation using an existing clinical database. The aim was to define the time beyond which a perforation is unlikely to close naturally.

- **Study design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: Conducted in a tertiary center.

- **Patients and interventions**: A database of pediatric ear, nose, throat, and audiology consultations containing 20 years of data was analyzed. A total of 2,865 episodes of perforation were followed, with all cases of surgical reconstruction excluded. Cases of perforation after ventilation tube extrusion were tagged. Statistical techniques, including survival analysis, were used.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary measure was the time from diagnosis of perforation to diagnosis of closure, expressed in years.

- **Results**: There was a predominance of perforations in boys (59.1% versus 40.9%). The time to closure increased by 7% for each 1-year increase in age at diagnosis. Time-to-closure curves for children older than 12 years diverged considerably from those for younger children after approximately 18 months. Centiles of time to closure were calculated for each 1-year age band. After 2.5 years of follow-up, rates of closure were 90% in children diagnosed younger than 7 years, and 75% in children diagnosed between the ages of 7 and 12 years. No significant difference was found in time to closure between boys and girls, left-sided and right-sided perforations, or in ventilation tube-related perforations and others. Comparison of membranes suffering a first perforation with those suffering a second perforation suggested a borderline significance.

### Traumatic perforation of the tympanic membrane: A review of 80 cases [^115u61ca]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Traumatic perforation of the tympanic membrane (TPTM) is often encountered in primary care or in the emergency department (ED). Several therapeutic interventions have been described, but conservative follow-up until spontaneous complete recovery is the most common choice.

- **Objective**: Our goal was to analyze the trauma mechanism, perforation characteristics, and outcome of patients with TPTM.

- **Methods**: The study included patients examined in the ED of a tertiary, university-affiliated medical center because of TPTM between 2012 and 2016. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed for demographics, trauma mechanism, clinical characteristics, and outcome. A phone survey was performed to obtain the missing information of all the patients who did not continue their follow-up in our outpatient clinic.

- **Results**: We reviewed the histories of 80 patients with a mean age of 26.7 ± 14.6 years (20 children; 25%). TPTM was caused by blunt trauma in 45 patients (56%) and penetrating trauma in 35 patients (44%). Thirty-five patients (44%) completed their follow-up in the hospital outpatient clinic, with a mean duration of 6.2 weeks. Twenty-five patients (38%) completed their follow-up in a community-based otolaryngology clinic, 6 patients (9%) chose not to complete their follow-up, and 14 patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 60 patients who completed follow-up, 56 patients recovered spontaneously, 3 patients underwent successful tympanoplasty, and 1 patient was referred to surgery but was lost to follow-up. All children healed spontaneously.

- **Conclusion**: TPTM was m

### The evolution of ototopical therapy: From cumin to quinolones [^114ctX7D]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2004). Low credibility.

A radical change has occurred in the management of otorrhea over the past decade. Multiple studies have supported the efficacy of topical quinolones in the management of acute otitis media, acute otitis externa, and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). For the first time, otolaryngologists have a scientific foundation on which to base treatment protocols for these conditions. No longer must they rely solely on clinical experience and prejudices. The quinolone drops have a superior safety profile, a broad antimicrobial spectrum, and their overall cost is lower than alternatives. Additionally, their convenient dosing schedule is well tolerated by most patients.

When considering all these factors, it becomes clear that topical quinolone therapy, with or without a steroid additive, is the treatment of choice for otorrhea in patients with a tympanic membrane perforation or ventilating tube. The development of ototopical medications has paralleled Darwinian evolution, and quinolone drops have clearly demonstrated the concept of "survival of the fittest".

### Surgical results and factors affecting outcome in patients with fat-graft myringoplasty [^113pwaTn]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Objectives: We evaluated the closure rate after fat-graft myringoplasty (FGM) of perforations differing in size and location, exploring whether patient factors and the FGM surgical technique influenced surgical outcomes.

Methods: We retrospectively studied patients with tympanic membrane perforations who underwent FGM from March 2015 to March 2019. All procedures were performed by a single senior surgeon at our tertiary hospital. The patients who followed up for at least 6 months after surgery were enrolled. We recorded hypertension and diabetes status, age, any prior ear surgery, and any calcific plaques adjacent to the perforation, as well as perforation size and location.

Results: A total of 150 patients were enrolled. Our success rate of FGM was 90%. Hypertension, diabetes, prior ear surgery history, and eardrum calcific plaques did not affect the surgical outcomes. There was no statistical difference in the surgical success rate according to the size or location of the perforation. Notably, FGM was successful in only two of six children (33.3%) aged ≤ 15 years, significantly less than in the other groups. FGM is a fast, safe, and efficient method for repairing tympanic membrane perforation. The surgical outcome is not significantly affected by underlying disease, perforation size or location, or by the condition of the tympanic membrane or older age. However, it may be poor in children with a dysfunctional Eustachian tube.
