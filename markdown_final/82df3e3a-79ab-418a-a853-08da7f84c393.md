## Question

Epinephrine dosage for adult anaphylaxis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the epinephrine dosing strategy for adult anaphylaxis, including when to use 0.3 mg vs 0.5 mg, how to repeat doses, when to escalate to IV infusion, and how to counsel on autoinjector use and follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the universal first-line principle and route. Then, I should verify the weight-based dosing formula and the adult maximum. Next, I will examine the 0.3 mg vs 0.5 mg debate and any evidence favoring the higher dose. After that, I need to check repeat-dosing intervals and the threshold for escalation to IV infusion. Finally, I should review autoinjector prescribing, needle length considerations, and patient counseling on when to activate EMS and how to monitor for adverse effects.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis and should be given intramuscularly in the anterolateral thigh as soon as anaphylaxis is suspected, without waiting for diagnostic confirmation, because delays worsen outcomes and IM administration achieves faster and higher plasma levels than subcutaneous injection [^114yXqEr] [^113beyxM] [^114MhG3L].

> I need to verify the dosing formula and adult maximum. The standard dose is 0.01 mg/kg of 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) epinephrine, with a maximum of 0.5 mg in adults. In practical terms, this corresponds to 0.3–0.5 mg IM for most adults, repeated every 5–15 minutes as needed based on clinical response [^113TpACE] [^112h6JEB] [^115wHAWj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using 0.3 mg for everyone. I should review the rationale for preferring 0.5 mg in larger or higher-risk adults. Multiple guidelines and PK studies suggest that 0.5 mg yields higher plasma catecholamine exposure than 0.3 mg without excess adverse events, and a recent retrospective analysis found significantly less escalation of care with 0.5 mg vs 0.3 mg; expert consensus also supports moving to 0.5 mg at lower body weights in some regions, reflecting concern for underdosing with 0.3 mg in heavier adults [^114VEZgW] [^116DvCC1] [^112MExti].

> Wait, let me verify the repeat-dosing cadence and when to escalate. If symptoms persist or recur, repeat IM epinephrine every 5–15 minutes. After two appropriate doses without adequate response, guidelines recommend urgent expert involvement and initiation of a low-dose IV epinephrine infusion, titrated to effect with continuous monitoring, rather than repeated boluses that increase risk of overdose and arrhythmias [^111cNTT7] [^115Xu9gD] [^114MhG3L].

> I should confirm autoinjector prescribing and device selection. Patients at risk should generally carry at least two autoinjectors because approximately 7–18% require more than one dose; when selecting devices, consider dose, needle length, affordability, and patient preference, and recognize that many adults may benefit from a 0.5 mg autoinjector where available to mitigate underdosing, with attention to needle length in obesity to ensure IM delivery [^116vtunq] [^1149vpWH] [^115sRLBQ].

> Let me think about timing and EMS activation. Epinephrine should be administered immediately at the first signs of anaphylaxis. Immediate EMS activation is not universally required if there is a prompt, complete, and durable response and additional epinephrine is available, but patients should activate EMS for severe reactions, incomplete or non-durable responses, or recurrence/worsening of symptoms, and shared decision-making should address local access and patient preferences [^112GRPaw] [^114rH4ux].

> I need to ensure I cover safety and adverse effects counseling. Serious adverse reactions to appropriately dosed IM epinephrine are rare, but transient palpitations, tremor, anxiety, pallor, or headache can occur. Patients with cardiac risk factors should be counseled to seek immediate evaluation if chest pain or concerning symptoms occur, and clinicians should reassure that the benefits of timely epinephrine outweigh risks in anaphylaxis [^115HC4z2] [^112GRPaw].

> But wait, what if the patient is on beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors? I should double-check that these are not absolute contraindications to epinephrine. They are not, though they may blunt response, so higher vigilance and readiness to escalate to IV infusion are warranted if the clinical response is suboptimal [^112BbTVy] [^111cNTT7].

> Let me reconsider device technique and special populations. The anterolateral thigh is preferred for IM injection, and in obesity, longer needles may be needed to ensure IM deposition; training with trainer devices and periodic review of technique improve real-world performance and should be reinforced at follow-up visits [^115sRLBQ] [^1149vpWH].

> In summary, I should confirm the practical adult dosing recommendation: use 0.3–0.5 mg IM in the anterolateral thigh immediately for suspected anaphylaxis, favor 0.5 mg in larger adults or when available, repeat every 5–15 minutes if needed, and escalate to IV infusion after two appropriate IM doses without adequate response. Prescribe at least two autoinjectors when indicated, tailor device choice to dose and needle length, and counsel on prompt use, EMS activation triggers, and adverse effect monitoring to optimize outcomes [^112h6JEB] [^111cNTT7] [^116vtunq] [^112GRPaw].

The adult epinephrine dose for anaphylaxis is **0.3–0.5 mg IM** [^115wHAWj] into the anterolateral thigh, repeated every 5–15 minutes [^114jPxbF] if symptoms persist [^114aTMaW]. Use **0.5 mg for patients ≥ 50 kg or with severe reactions** [^116DvCC1], and **0.3 mg if < 50 kg or if 0.5 mg is unavailable**. Administer immediately [^113beyxM] and continue until symptoms resolve or advanced care is available [^111cNTT7].

---

## Recommended adult epinephrine dose

- **Standard dose**: 0.3–0.5 mg IM into the anterolateral thigh [^111YjuCL] [^112h6JEB].
- **Repeat dosing**: every 5–15 minutes [^114jPxbF] if symptoms persist or worsen [^115Xu9gD].
- **Maximum dose**: no absolute maximum; titrate to clinical response [^115Xu9gD] [^113beyxM].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dose selection

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Higher IM doses (0.5 mg) yield higher plasma epinephrine and faster symptom relief than 0.3 mg in adults [^112MExti].
- **Clinical outcomes**: 0.5 mg IM reduces the need for additional doses or escalation versus 0.3 mg in adults ≥ 50 kg [^116DvCC1].
- **Safety**: 0.5 mg IM is well tolerated; transient palpitations, anxiety, and tremor are common but generally benign [^115HC4z2].

---

## Factors influencing dose selection

- **Body weight**: Use 0.5 mg for patients ≥ 50 kg; consider 0.3 mg if < 50 kg or if 0.5 mg is unavailable [^116DvCC1] [^114VEZgW].
- **Severity**: Prefer 0.5 mg for severe reactions with cardiovascular collapse or airway compromise [^notfound].
- **Comorbidities**: Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease; start at 0.3 mg if concerned, but do not withhold epinephrine [^115Bh26S] [^112BbTVy].

---

## Timing and route of administration

The **route** is intramuscular injection into the anterolateral thigh (vastus lateralis) [^114aTMaW]; inject through clothing if needed [^116EqLYj]. The **timing** is immediate upon recognition of anaphylaxis; delays increase risk of biphasic reactions, hospitalization, and mortality [^113beyxM] [^115FckNG].

---

## Clinical response and need for repeat dosing

- **Response**: Most patients respond to a single dose; 7–18% require > 1 dose [^116vtunq] [^111Ed1Rf].
- **Repeat dosing**: Give additional IM doses every 5–15 minutes [^114jPxbF] until symptoms resolve or advanced care is available [^114rH4ux].
- **Escalation**: If symptoms persist after 2–3 IM doses, initiate an IV epinephrine infusion [^111cNTT7] with expert monitoring [^112vURqw].

---

## Special considerations

In pregnancy, **do not withhold epinephrine**; use standard IM dosing and monitor mother and fetus [^notfound]. In older adults, **start at 0.3 mg if cardiovascular risk is high**, but do not delay life-saving therapy [^115HC4z2]. For obese patients, ensure **IM delivery**; longer needles may be needed to reach muscle [^115sRLBQ] [^112NSnyV].

## Adult epinephrine dosing for anaphylaxis

| **Patient factor** | **Recommended dose** | **Repeat dosing** |
|-|-|-|
| Standard adult | 0.3–0.5 mg IM | Every 5–15 minutes |
| ≥ 50 kg or severe reaction | 0.5 mg IM | Every 5–15 minutes |
| < 50 kg or 0.5 mg unavailable | 0.3 mg IM | Every 5–15 minutes |
| Refractory after 2–3 IM doses | IV infusion | Titrate to effect |

---

The adult epinephrine dose for anaphylaxis is **0.3–0.5 mg IM** [^111pp2uW] into the anterolateral thigh, repeated every 5–15 minutes as needed. Use **0.5 mg for patients ≥ 50 kg or with severe reactions** [^116DvCC1], and **0.3 mg if < 50 kg or if 0.5 mg is unavailable**.

DOES EPINEPHRINE SAVE LIVES?

On the basis of observational studies in humans and animal models of anaphylaxis, epinephrine is clearly an effective treatment for anaphylaxis. A systematic review and meta-analysis reported that 2.2% (95% CI: 1.1%-4.1%) of allergic reactions fail to respond to 2 epinephrine doses, and 0.3% (95% CI: 0.1%-1.3%) are treated with 4 or more doses. Reports of severe anaphylaxis reactions (typically venom-induced) clearly show that some reactions require much more epinephrine than can be delivered using 1 or 2 EAI devices.– Fatal outcomes can occur despite the timely administration of epinephrine. In a case series of 32 fatal anaphylaxis events, at least 4 patients received epinephrine in a timely manner. In the United Kingdom, at least one-third of fatalities due to food-induced anaphylaxis occurred despite timely epinephrine administration. There are many potential reasons for a suboptimal response to epinephrine (see Table V), and identifying individuals at risk of a suboptimal response has proven challenging. –

Overall, there can be no doubt that epinephrine can save lives, but whether epinephrine administered via EAI reduces mortality is difficult to assess. Fatal anaphylaxis is fortunately very rare, and the rate of fatality has remained stable in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom over the past 2 to 3 decades, despite evidence of a significant increase in EAI prescriptions over the same time period. Irrespectively, there are clear benefits to prescribing EAI. Individuals with EAI report that their allergies are taken more seriously and may feel more confident. It is also possible that patients who have administered EAI have a more rapid EMS response than those without EAI, although formal data are lacking. Thus, EAI prescription may have important "indirect" benefits for reducing morbidity from anaphylaxis, although patient values and preferences are sure to impact these outcomes. We therefore recommend shared decision-making when prescribing EAI to reduce the potential risk of an adverse impact on HRQL – and improve compliance with both EAI carriage and appropriate use.

With the lack of data that EAI reduce mortality, individuals at risk of anaphylaxis must be counseled to administer epinephrine early to treat anaphylaxis and activate EMS for persistent or worsening symptoms. For health care professionals, there is increasing recognition that a suboptimal response to 2 doses of epinephrine can be a useful indicator of anaphylaxis severity – and should prompt urgent escalation and consideration of a low-dose intravenous epinephrine infusion along with intravenous fluid support.

Epinephrine auto-injector (EAI) adverse events and counseling — Recommendation 27 (CBS) states that "Serious adverse reactions to intramuscular epinephrine are very rare and should not pose a barrier to the prescription or early administration of EAIs when indicated", and "we recommend that clinicians counsel patients and caregivers on the proper use of EAIs, the common adverse effects, and the need for immediate evaluation and treatment when signs or symptoms of serious adverse events develop" (Strength of Recommendation: Strong; Certainty of Evidence: Low). Epinephrine is described as "generally safe, and there are no absolute contraindications to its use for anaphylaxis", and, compared with intravenous administration, "intramuscular epinephrine is associated with reduced risk of dosing errors and adverse events". Quantitatively, "the serious adverse event rate for EAI administration was only 0.73%"; in an ED cohort, "adverse cardiovascular events were reported in 4 of 316 (1.3%) intramuscular administrations", and a registry-based study reported "4 of 256 (1.6%) intramuscular or subcutaneous administrations". Risk appears higher in older patients "(age ≥ 50 years)", and "Clinicians should counsel patients with cardiac risk factors to seek immediate evaluation and treatment if chest pain or other signs or symptoms of cardiac adverse events develop after epinephrine use".

WHO SHOULD BE PRESCRIBED AN EPINEPHRINE AUTOINJECTOR?

Although there is some variation, anaphylaxis guidelines typically recommend EAI prescription to any patient with a history of anaphylaxis who cannot easily avoid re-exposure to the causative allergen (Table I).– Anaphylaxis to medication or radiocontrast media in isolation is not usually an indication for EAI because these allergens are generally easy to avoid outside of health care settings. Patients with latex allergy may find it challenging to avoid accidental exposure, particularly if their exposure is occupational related. Guidelines also encourage EAI prescription to patients without prior anaphylaxis but with risk factors considered to raise their risk of anaphylaxis, such as a diagnosis of asthma or a prior reaction to a "trace" amount of allergen (Table I). However, the evidence supporting many of these factors is very limited, as recently highlighted. For example, data suggest that previous mild reactions to "trace" amounts of allergenor a diagnosis of asthmado not increase the risk of anaphylaxis; although poorly controlled asthma is likely to be a risk factor, supporting evidence is lacking. Data suggest that at least for peanut allergy, "the absence of prior anaphylaxis [is likely to] reflect insufficient allergen exposure rather than an inherently lower risk of anaphylaxis". Guidelines often flag adolescents and young adults as being at higher risk (albeit still very low) of near-fatal and fatal anaphylaxis, whereas epidemiological studies show that this risk remains elevated well into the fourth decade of life.

Rather than use a risk-stratified approach to guide EAI prescription, some health care providers err on the side of caution by universally prescribing EAI to all patients at potential risk of anaphylaxis to food, venom, and/or latex. Our inability to predict future risk of severe reactions remains one of the biggest evidence gaps in allergy, although our understanding of the risk factors and/or cofactors that may exacerbate reaction severity is improving. Severe reactions can occur in allergic individuals with no prior history of anaphylaxis; likewise, many people with prior anaphylaxis do not experience it subsequently. Lack of access to epinephrine may result in treatment delay, which can be substantial, particularly in remote locations or situations where emergency response times are prolonged. Observational studies have linked delays in epinephrine administration to increased risk of a biphasic reaction and hospitalization,– as well as death, although the data are confounded by a lack of agreement as to what constitutes delayed versus timely epinephrine.

### Anaphylaxis on the other front line: perspectives from the emergency department [^112ihZTf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Although most cases of anaphylaxis are treated in the emergency department (ED), personnel may not immediately recognize anaphylaxis based on presenting symptoms because it has a wide range of clinical manifestations and variable progression. When symptoms happen to be atypical or mild and when no trigger is identified, the diagnosis of anaphylaxis can be challenging. Underdiagnosis of anaphylaxis can lead to delayed use of appropriate first-line epinephrine in favor of treatments that should be used as adjunctive only. Even when anaphylaxis is recognized, the choice between an epinephrine autoinjector or epinephrine ampule can still present a challenge. Treatment of anaphylaxis in the ED should include a combination of intramuscular epinephrine, supplemental oxygen, and intravenous fluids. If there is an incomplete response to the initial dose of epinephrine, additional doses or other measures may be considered. The most important management consideration is avoiding treatment delays, because symptoms can progress rapidly. Upon discharge from the ED, all patients with anaphylaxis should be given a prescription for at least 2 epinephrine autoinjectors, an initial emergency action plan, education about avoidance of triggers, and a referral to an allergist. A significant limitation of current studies is that clinical outcomes in anaphylaxis associated with established poor rates of diagnosis and use of recommended treatments are unclear; such trials must be conducted as supporting evidence for ED management guidelines for anaphylaxis.

### Expertly managing anaphylaxis [^112e1yS6]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a (frequently underdiagnosed) type 1 hypersensitivity reaction, and the astute clinician must remain vigilant to recognize it, especially in children. Myriad triggers may precipitate anaphylaxis. The multi-system manifestations are numerous and may be confused with other diagnoses. Timely treatment with appropriately dosed epinephrine is essential to prevent complications or recurrent symptoms. Clinicians may consider using antihistamines, steroids, beta-agonists, fluids, or even vasopressors. Once symptoms are mitigated, patients require epinephrine autoinjector prescriptions and education, and a clear anaphylaxis emergency plan. Close follow-up with primary care and/or an allergy specialist is prudent.

### Use of multiple epinephrine doses in anaphylaxis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117TG69L]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first systematic review in the literature in which meta-analysis was used to evaluate the rate of anaphylaxis reactions treated with more than 1 dose of epinephrine. We found that approximately 1 in 10 reactions are treated with at least 1 additional epinephrine dose. This estimate did not change significantly in the sensitivity analyses, including when the data were limited to those reactions for which subsequent doses were administered by a health care professional (which arguably might reflect a higher degree of confidence in the persistence of anaphylaxis symptoms despite initial treatment with epinephrine). This estimate was robust despite a high degree of heterogeneity between the included data sets, reflecting differences in cohort characteristics, study design and setting, and anaphylaxis definition used. The majority of the data sets assessed anaphylaxis occurring in the community; it is therefore likely that these data are representative of the broader population of individuals with allergy.

One potential limitation is that we were unable to distinguish between the administration route or dose of epinephrine given, as these data were not available for most data sets. However, the majority of data included was related to initial doses given in the community via use of EAIs. Excluding data sets published before 2006 (when the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters published its recommendation that epinephrine be administered by the intramuscular route) did not demonstrate any significant impact on the pooled estimates. Furthermore, we did not find that year of publication was a significant moderator in heterogeneity across studies. Several data sets reported biphasic reactions; unfortunately, we were unable to clarify with study authors whether the data provided with respect to epinephrine administration was for the first or delayed phase of these reactions. Thus, we were unable to assess the need for more than 1 dose of epinephrine to treat late-phase reactions.

### Comparison of international guidelines for the emergency medical management of anaphylaxis [^117BsTRz]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Guideline-based treatment approaches for managing anaphylaxis are widely believed to result in good outcomes, but the strength of evidence underpinning the recommendations made therein is unclear.

Objective

To identify and compare national guidelines for the emergency medical management of anaphylaxis and to describe the extent to which the evidence base in support of key recommendations is made clear.

Methods

We systematically searched key medical databases and contacted the World Allergy Organization and anaphylaxis charities in several countries to identify national guidelines. Full text copies of relevant papers were obtained and, where necessary, translated. Data were abstracted onto a customized data extraction sheet; this process was independently checked by a second reviewer.

Results

Guidelines originating from Australia, Canada, Russia, UK, Ukraine and the USA were identified. While these were in agreement on the broad principles of management, there were important variations in relation to the treatments to be used and the dose and route of administration of these preparations. Most guidelines failed to make clear the strength of evidence underpinning the recommendations being made.

Conclusions

There are important international differences in the recommended emergency management of anaphylaxis. It is important that an agreed core evidence-based guideline for the management of anaphylaxis is now developed, which can then be adapted for national/local use. Clinicians need to be aware of the limitations of existing guidelines.

### Knowledge gaps in the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis [^112bwVoj]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Knowledge gaps in the diagnosis and treatment of anaphylaxis impede the clinician's ability to effectively manage patients with anaphylaxis. This review will emphasize the lack of a global consensus on defining and determining the severity of anaphylaxis; the need for validating biomarkers used for diagnosing anaphylaxis; and data collection deficiencies. Perioperative anaphylaxis has a wide differential diagnosis, often requires treatment beyond epinephrine, and poses a challenge for the clinician in identifying the responsible trigger(s) and in preventing future reactions. Consensus-derived definitions and determination of risk factors for biphasic, refractory, and persistent anaphylaxis are needed, recognizing that these often affect the emergency department observation time after recovery from initial anaphylaxis. Knowledge gaps exist in the use of epinephrine, including route of administration, dosage, needle length, and ideal timing for administration. Consensus is needed on when and how many epinephrine autoinjectors to prescribe and how to prevent patient underuse and accidental injury. The role of antihistamines and corticosteroids in the prevention and treatment of anaphylaxis requires consensus and additional research. A consensus-derived algorithm for management of idiopathic anaphylaxis is needed. The role of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the incidence, severity, and treatment of anaphylaxis remains unanswered. Rapid recognition and treatment of anaphylaxis in the community needs improvement. The article will conclude with exploring the recommended components of both a patient-specific and generic anaphylaxis emergency plan, including when to activate emergency medical services, all of which are paramount to improving patient outcomes.

### Emergency medicine updates: anaphylaxis [^113XAv8v]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anaphylaxis is a potentially deadly condition that requires emergent therapy. While frequently treated in the emergency department (ED), recent evidence updates may improve the diagnosis and management of this condition.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

The presentation of anaphylaxis can vary. Current diagnostic criteria can be helpful when evaluating patients for anaphylaxis, though multiple criteria exist. While the most common causes of anaphylaxis include medications, insect venom, and foods, recent literature has identified an IgE antibody response to mammalian galactose alpha-1,3-galactose, known as alpha-gal anaphylaxis. Epinephrine is the first-line therapy and is given in doses of 0.01 mg/kg (up to 0.5 mg in adults) intramuscularly (IM) in the anterolateral thigh. Intravenous (IV) epinephrine administration is recommended in patients refractory to IM epinephrine and IV fluids, or those with cardiovascular collapse. Antihistamines and glucocorticoids should not delay administration of epinephrine and do not demonstrate a significant reduction in risk of biphasic reactions. Biphasic reactions may affect 1–7% of patients with anaphylaxis. Risk factors for biphasic reaction include severe initial presentation and repeated doses of epinephrine. Disposition of patients with anaphylaxis requires consideration of several factors.

Conclusions

Emergency clinicians must be aware of current updates in the evaluation and management of this disease.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^111cNTT7]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Are additional doses of adrenaline effective in the treatment of anaphylaxis reactions refractory to initial treatment with adrenaline?

Updated recommendations

1 Subsequent doses of adrenaline should be given every 5 min, titrated to clinical response, in patients whose symptoms are refractory to initial treatment (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence).
2 Where respiratory and/or cardiovascular features of anaphylaxis persist despite 2 appropriate doses of adrenaline (administered by IM or IV route), seek urgent expert help (e.g. from experienced critical care clinicians) to establish an intravenous adrenaline infusion to treat refractory anaphylaxis (strong recommendation, low certainty evidence).
3 Low dose intravenous adrenaline infusions appear to be effective and safe to treat refractory anaphylaxis (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence).

(adapted from RCUK 2008, EAACI 2014 and ASCIA 2020 guidelines, with greater emphasis on early recognition of refractory reactions and further adrenaline treatment, preferably using a low dose IV adrenaline infusion)

### Epinephrine: the drug of choice for anaphylaxis. A statement of the World Allergy Organization [^117C6RX8]. Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is an acute and potentially lethal multi-system allergic reaction. Most consensus guidelines for the past 30 years have held that epinephrine is the drug of choice and the first drug that should be administered in acute anaphylaxis. Some state that properly administered epinephrine has no absolute contraindication in this clinical setting. A committee of anaphylaxis experts assembled by the World Allergy Organization has examined the evidence from the medical literature concerning the appropriate use of epinephrine for anaphylaxis. The Committee strongly believes that epinephrine is currently underutilized and often dosed suboptimally to treat anaphylaxis, is under-prescribed for potential future self-administration, that most of the reasons proposed to withhold its clinical use are flawed, and that the therapeutic benefits of epinephrine exceed the risk when given in appropriate i.m. doses.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^114XURcH]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Anaphylaxis and allergic reaction — initial epinephrine: Epinephrine administration is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis, and if signs of anaphylaxis are present, administer epinephrine 1 mg/mL at the following dose and route: adult (25 kg or more) 0.3 mg IM in the anterolateral thigh and pediatric (less than 25 kg) 0.15 mg in the anterolateral thigh; epinephrine 1 mg/mL may be administered from a vial or via auto-injector, if available. If signs of allergic reaction without signs of anaphylaxis, go to Step 8.

### Myths, facts and controversies in the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis [^1149FdUN]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a serious systemic allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Despite numerous national and international guidelines and consensus statements, common misconceptions still persist in terms of diagnosis and appropriate management, both among healthcare professionals and patient/carers. We address some of these misconceptions and highlight the optimal approach for patients who experience potentially life-threatening allergic reactions.

### Use of multiple epinephrine doses in anaphylaxis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113a3w3Z]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

A strength of this meta-analysis is the high response rate from authors who were contacted to provide further clarification. Many authors shared anonymized raw data, which facilitated the analyses. However, the meta-analyses were undertaken by using aggregate data from individual studies rather than individual patient data (IPD). Although this allowed for inclusion of a greater number of studies, we were unable to further assess potential risk factors for the use of multiple epinephrine doses, which would have been possible with an IPD meta-analysis. Given the inconsistencies in reported risk factors for multiple epinephrine use, an IPD meta-analysis would help address this evidence gap.

Recommendations vary with respect to the number of EAIs that patients at risk of anaphylaxis should be prescribed — both between countries and within a single country in which guidelines from specialist societies may contradict official government advice. Many anaphylaxis reactions resolve spontaneously without treatment, and in this analysis, we found that only 50.4% of anaphylaxis reactions were treated with any epinephrine, a rate that is consistent with the literature. It is clearly inappropriate to not treat anaphylaxis with epinephrine, which is rightly the universal recommendation in all international guidelines. A single dose of epinephrine may be insufficient to terminate a reaction for multiple reasons, including the following: reaction progression; underdosing (international guidelines recommend that teenagers and adults receive 0.5 mg of epinephrine, but for most EAI devices, the highest dose available is 0.3 mg of epinephrine); incorrect administration; subcutaneous administration, which is associated with a prolonged onset of action; delayed administration; and biphasic course of reaction. Our analysis, which is based on more than 25,000 anaphylaxis events, provides an important estimate of the frequency of multiple epinephrine doses given to treat anaphylaxis. Whether patients could be risk-stratified to assess the need for repeat doses of epinephrine requires further analysis, as is discussed in a recent publication by Shaker et al.

Conclusions

Around 10% of patients receiving epinephrine for anaphylaxis have a suboptimal response to a single dose of epinephrine, as assessed by a health care professional. These data are important in informing guidance on the provision of EAI for patients at risk of anaphylaxis in the community.

Clinical implications

Around 10% of anaphylaxis reactions are treated with more than 1 dose of epinephrine, including when the decision to administer a further dose was made by a health care professional.

Anaphylaxis implies a risk of death even in patients whose prior episodes have been considered mild and managed easily. Anaphylaxis occurs in all age groups, from infants to the elderly, but most deaths occur in adults. Factors or circumstances associated with near-fatal or fatal anaphylaxis are reviewed from the following 10 perspectives: accidents and mishaps, adulterated products, age, allergens, atopy, comorbidities, Munchausen syndrome or contrived anaphylaxis, patient factors, route of administration, and treatment-related issues. There are no absolute contraindications to self-injectable epinephrine, and epinephrine can be administered for anaphylaxis to elderly patients or to those patients receiving beta-adrenergic blockers.

### Anaphylaxis pathogenesis and treatment [^111TYwtq]. Allergy (2011). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and sometimes leads to death. Understanding mechanisms, triggers, and patient-specific risk factors for severe or fatal anaphylaxis is critically important. Diagnosis of anaphylaxis is currently based on established clinical criteria. Epinephrine (adrenaline) is the first-line medication for anaphylaxis treatment and delay in injecting it contributes to biphasic reactions, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and fatality. Here, we focus on four important areas of translational research in anaphylaxis: studies of potential new biomarkers to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis, laboratory tests to distinguish allergen sensitization from clinical risk of anaphylaxis, the primary role of epinephrine (adrenaline) in anaphylaxis treatment, and strengthening the overall evidence base for anaphylaxis treatment.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^114MhG3L]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale

There are no trials comparing different routes of adrenaline administration in patients during anaphylaxis. IM adrenaline is recommended over other routes of administration for initial treatment of anaphylaxis, due to a favourable adverse event profile (including in those with cardiovascular co-morbidities). The subcutaneous route is not recommended, on the basis of (low certainty) evidence that higher plasma adrenaline levels are achieved by the IM route; the available data relates to pharmacokinetic studies undertaken in patients outside the context of an allergic reaction and "may be confounded by using different injection sites (thigh versus arm), in addition to different depth of injection". Comparing the IM to IV route, the EAACI 2020 systematic review identified a single case series (children and adults) which found that "IV bolus administration was associated with a 13% increase in the incidence of adrenaline overdose and an 8% increase in the incidence of cardiovascular events compared with IM administration". Excessive doses of adrenaline, particularly by the IV route, can cause tachyarrhythmias, severe hypertension, myocardial infarction and stroke. Fatalities have occurred in the UK due to the inappropriate use of intravenous adrenaline to treat allergic (but non-anaphylaxis) reactions. Both IM and IV routes are recommended for treating perioperative anaphylaxis by experienced anaesthetists, although international guidelines recommend IM adrenaline for first-line treatment of anaphylaxis in all settings. If cardiac arrest is imminent or has already occurred, an intravenous (or interosseous) bolus dose of adrenaline is indicated.

Although the evidence was assessed as being of low certainty, the working group agreed with the evaluation in other guidelines that "given the totality of the evidence and clinical experience over many decades… a strong recommendation for the use of intramuscular adrenaline was appropriate". A strong recommendation for the IM route was deemed justified, as the working group placed a high value on the relative ease and safety of IM adrenaline administration by a wide variety of healthcare staff, and the current acceptance of the IM route in both clinical and non-clinical settings (including by patients for self-administration using an autoinjector device). Despite the limited evidence, we have made a strong recommendation for titrating the dose of adrenaline (as an intravenous infusion) against the clinical response, since this is routine in clinical practice to mitigate against the side effects of excessive adrenaline administration.

Route data indicate "plasma levels of epinephrine reach higher levels more rapidly when epinephrine is administered intramuscularly in the thigh compared with subcutaneous administration in the arm", and in adults "Intramuscular injection in the thigh… produced significantly higher peak plasma epinephrine concentrations more rapidly than epinephrine injected intramuscularly or subcutaneously in the upper arm".

### Self-injectable epinephrine for first-aid management of anaphylaxis [^114dJyGz]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially fatal systemic allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Epinephrine is the primary medical therapy, and it must be administered promptly. This clinical report focuses on practical issues concerning the administration of self-injectable epinephrine for first-aid treatment of anaphylaxis in the community. The recommended epinephrine dose for anaphylaxis in children, based primarily on anecdotal evidence, is 0.01 mg/kg, up to 0.30 mg. Intramuscular injection of epinephrine into the lateral thigh (vastus lateralis) is the preferred route for therapy in first-aid treatment. Epinephrine autoinjectors are currently available in only 2 fixed doses: 0.15 and 0.30 mg. On the basis of current, albeit limited, data, it seems reasonable to recommend autoinjectors with 0.15 mg of epinephrine for otherwise healthy young children who weigh 10 to 25 kg (22–55 lb) and autoinjectors with 0.30 mg of epinephrine for those who weigh approximately 25 kg (55 lb) or more; however, specific clinical circumstances must be considered in these decisions. This report also describes several quandaries in regard to management, including the selection of dose, indications for prescribing an autoinjector, and decisions regarding when to inject epinephrine. Effective care for individuals at risk of anaphylaxis requires a comprehensive management approach involving families, allergic children, schools, camps, and other youth organizations. Risk reduction entails confirmation of the trigger, discussion of avoidance of the relevant allergen, a written individualized emergency anaphylaxis action plan, and education of supervising adults with regard to recognition and treatment of anaphylaxis.

### Anaphylaxis in the young adult population [^111gr1rp]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

It is critical that clinicians treating young adults understand the presentation and management of anaphylaxis. The most common trigger for anaphylaxis in this population is food. The prevalence of food allergy is growing, with 8% of US children and adolescents affected. All patients at risk for anaphylaxis should be prescribed epinephrine autoinjectors, as epinephrine is the only life-saving medication for a severe anaphylactic reaction. The presentation of anaphylaxis can involve multiple organ systems (eg, mucocutaneous, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal) and, as such, patient education is needed to assist in prompt recognition. Appropriate training of patients and caregivers about how to identify anaphylaxis and what to do in an emergency is critical. Training of school and college staff also is essential, as 1 in 4 first-time reactions occurs outside the home. Additional counseling for adolescents at risk for anaphylactic reactions should address increased risk-taking behavior, decreased adult supervision, dating, and the transition of disease management from an adult to the patient.

Patient counseling and shared decision-making are essential to support patients' treatment decisions and capacity to manage the risk of anaphylaxis at home and in other community settings. Activation of emergency medical services after home epinephrine administration may not be required in all cases, and patients should be engaged in shared decision-making to determine when home management may be appropriate.

### Epinephrine, auto-injectors, and anaphylaxis: challenges of dose, depth, and device [^112NSnyV]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This review was undertaken to review epinephrine dosing, site and route of administration, focusing on special populations (patients weighing less than 15kg, and obese patients); and to discuss storage and delivery of epinephrine in prehospital and hospital settings.

Data Sources

Review of published literature.

Study Selection

Relevance.

Results

The recommended 0.01-mg/kg (maximum 0.3–0.5mg) epinephrine dose in anaphylaxis is based on limited pharmacokinetic data in healthy volunteers. No pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics studies involving patients in anaphylaxis have been published. When epinephrine auto-injectors (EAIs) are used in infants, the dose increasingly exceeds the recommended dose as weight decreases, although the clinical significance of this is unclear. Limited data indicate that the intramuscular route and lateral thigh site are superior. Ultrasound studies suggest that 0.15 EAI needles may be too long for many patients weighing less than 15kg, and 0.3mg EAI needles may be too short for obese patients weighing more than 30kg. A newly available 0.1mg EAI has a lower dose and shorter needle better suited to patients weighing 7.5 to 15kg. In some medical settings, vials and syringes may provide a safe, efficient alternative with substantial cost savings over EAIs.

Conclusion

EAIs should be available in the community with doses and needle depths that meet the needs of all patients. More research on epinephrine pharmacodynamics are needed in children and adults in anaphylaxis, to better delineate what optimal doses should be. Optimizing epinephrine dose and delivery has the potential to improve anaphylaxis outcomes and prevent adverse events.

### Epinephrine in the management of anaphylaxis [^111J8E3i]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Epinephrine is life-saving and the only first-line medication in the management of anaphylaxis. At therapeutic doses, it acts rapidly to reverse nearly all symptoms of anaphylaxis, and stabilize mast cells. The standard approved doses administered intramuscularly in the lateral thigh have a long track record for safe and effective use, but more information is needed on epinephrine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to ensure that current dosing strategies are optimal. Epinephrine should be administered promptly once anaphylaxis is suspected, to minimize morbidity and mortality. Providers on the front-line for managing patients with life-threatening allergic reactions need clear parameters and tools to guide the appropriate use of epinephrine, which take into account the potential evolution of symptoms and signs over time. All patients at risk for anaphylaxis should carry 2 epinephrine autoinjectors and be taught and able to demonstrate how to use them. Epinephrine autoinjectors need to be affordable, readily available, and easy for patients with allergies to carry and use. Furthermore, these devices should be available to meet the needs of all patients, from small infants through large or obese adults. The ideal means for storing and delivering epinephrine in prehospital and hospital environments warrants further study, to determine how to best balance efficiency, safety, and costs.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^1151Em7g]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

The Resuscitation Council UK has updated its Guideline for healthcare providers on the Emergency treatment of anaphylaxis. As part of this process, an evidence review was undertaken by the Guideline Working Group, using an internationally-accepted approach for adoption, adaptation, and de novo guideline development based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) evidence to decision (EtD) framework, referred to as GRADE-ADOLOPMENT. A number of significant changes have been made, which will be reflected in the updated Guideline. These include: emphasis on repeating intramuscular adrenaline doses after 5 min if symptoms of anaphylaxis do not resolve; corticosteroids (e.g. hydrocortisone) no longer being routinely recommended for the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis; interventions for reactions which are refractory to initial treatment with adrenaline; a recommendation against the use of antihistamines for the acute management of anaphylaxis; and guidance relating to the duration of observation following anaphylaxis, and timing of discharge.

### Anaphylaxis in practice: a guide to the 2023 practice parameter update [^1139i5Kv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

This review summarizes new research developments and clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis presented in the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters 2023 Anaphylaxis practice parameter Update. It is intended to serve as a high-level summary of the 2023 practice parameter, which makes clinically impactful recommendations based on evidence that has emerged since the 2015 practice parameter. We invite clinicians to explore the full 2023 practice parameter to understand the research methods and underlying evidence that have informed the recommendations summarized here. There are new and evolving diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis, rules for defining elevated tryptase levels, and recognition of signs and symptoms particular to infants and toddlers. The administration of epinephrine should not be used as a surrogate to diagnose anaphylaxis. Risk factors for anaphylaxis should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Patient counseling and shared decision-making are essential to support patients' treatment decisions and capacity to manage the risk of anaphylaxis at home and in other community settings. Activation of emergency medical services after home epinephrine administration may not be required in all cases, and patients should be engaged in shared decision-making to determine when home management may be appropriate.

### Use of multiple epinephrine doses in anaphylaxis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116PaEZh]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was registered at inception with PROSPERO (identifier CRD42017069109). The study is reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement 2009 and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology recommendations.

Search strategy and eligibility/inclusion criteria

We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, including all primary records from 1946 to July 2019 that referred to anaphylaxis in response to food or venom triggers, which included data with respect to the use of epinephrine (for search strategies and terms, see Tables E1-E3 in this article's Online Repository at). The search was updated in January 2021 by using the same methodology to include relevant studies published between July 2019 and December 2020. Eligible studies included those reporting more than 10 cases of anaphylaxis (by any definition) in individuals of all ages and in any country; the requirement for at least 10 cases was to minimize selection bias. We included both prospective and retrospective data, including data from food challenges conducted under medical supervision and patient surveys in which the categorization of anaphylaxis was evaluated by a health care professional (for further details, see the Methods section of the Online Repository at). No language restrictions were made, and we planned to include non-English articles if they met our inclusion criteria. We excluded data relating to adverse events following immunotherapy, as well as data sets that reported fatal anaphylaxis exclusively. Abstracts were independently screened by 2 researchers, and disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third team member. We also reviewed reference lists of included studies and review articles to identify other relevant studies. In cases in which potentially eligible studies did not report the number of epinephrine doses given, those studies' authors were contacted to determine whether these additional data could be provided.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines on anaphylaxis [^115Xu9gD]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Epinephrine dosing and repeat administration in anaphylaxis — Pediatric intramuscular (IM) dosing is 0.01 mg·kg−1 until the adult dose is reached; for pediatric epinephrine autoinjectors (EAI), 0.15 mg is accepted for 7.5 to 25 kg. There is no cumulative maximum dose, and repeat IM doses can be given every 5 to 15 min if there has been no improvement. Although most cases resolve after 1 dose, 8 to 12% of emergency department (ED) adults and children and 6 to 19% in urban pediatric EDs have required 2 or more initial doses. For adult intravenous (IV) administration in refractory anaphylaxis, 1 mg in 1 L normal saline (1 microgram·mL−1) is started at 0.1 microgram·kg−1·min−1, or 1 mg in 10 mL (0.1 mg·mL−1) is given slowly via IV bolus starting at 50 to 100 microgram·min−1 (0.5–1 mL·min−1) with careful monitoring. Recommendations: Standard IM doses of epinephrine may be repeated every 5 to 15 min for an inadequate response to initial anaphylaxis treatment or hours later for a biphasic reaction (1B).

### A 13.2 mg epinephrine intranasal spray demonstrates comparable pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety to a 0.3 mg epinephrine autoinjector [^117FSPHR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Anaphylaxis, a rapid-onset type 1 allergic reaction that can lead to acute, life-threatening respiratory failure, represents the most severe form of an allergic reaction. It is characterized by sudden onset and rapid progression of symptoms as well as airway, breathing, or circulation problems and often skin or mucosal changes, the latter of which may be subtle or absent in 10% to 20% of reactions.

The incidence of anaphylaxis is between 50 and 112 episodes per 100,000 person-years. In the United States, between 2004 and 2016, the incidence was 2.1 per 1000 person-years, with one quarter of anaphylactic reactions affecting children younger than 17 years old. Notably, the incidence of anaphylaxis peaks in children 2 to 12 years of age and adults between 50 and 69 years of age. Additionally, most anaphylactic reactions occur outside the hospital setting.

Lifetime prevalence is estimated to be 0.3% to 5.1%, depending on the definitions used, study methodology, and geographical area evaluated. Importantly, the rate of occurrence of anaphylaxis in the general population is increasing approximately 3% to 5% per year, especially in people in their first 20 years of life. In addition, food allergy and anaphylaxis appear to be increasing in the United States, especially in young children. Among allergens leading to severe allergic reactions, food allergies are highly prevalent, occurring in approximately 6% to 8% of children and 2% to 5% of adults ≥ 18 years of age.

A 2019 study reported that at least 10.8% (> 26 million) of US adults are food allergic, and approximately 19% of adults believe that they have a food allergy. Notably, this is higher than other reports, which typically cite a 6% to 8% incidence in the adult population. This study demonstrated that among food-allergic adults, 51.1% experienced a severe food allergy reaction, 45.3% were allergic to multiple foods, and 48.0% developed food allergies as an adult. Among these patients, 24.0% reported a current epinephrine prescription and 38.3% reported at least 1 food allergy–related lifetime emergency department visit, demonstrating the impact on health care utilization.

### Systematic review of outcome measures in trials of pediatric anaphylaxis treatment [^114x68Em]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

This review failed to uncover any completed randomized or controlled trials of pediatric anaphylaxis treatments despite a broad search strategy. Therefore, the primary objective could not be determined. In the one planned RCT of IV versus IM epinephrine, the two main outcomes proposed were resolution of the main clinical features of anaphylaxis (defined according to consensus definition), or improvement on an ordinal severity scale at 15 minutes. The planned secondary outcome was adverse effects at 15 and 60 minutes. The definition of anaphylaxis and its resolution were current, and the outcome measures proposed are appropriate.

Clinical implications

Epinephrine remains the treatment of choice for anaphylaxis although there are no RCTs supporting its use. Epinephrine has been relatively well investigated in both children and adults in observational studies, RCTs involving non-anaphylactic patients, epidemiologic studies, fatality studies, and in vitro and animal studies. Many of these studies have identified that delays in instituting treatment with epinephrine are associated with risks of mortality.

On the basis of this evidence, an expert panel published the 2011 National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) guidelines for acute treatment of anaphylaxis. They recommended immediate use of intramuscular epinephrine, concluding that the benefits far outweigh the risks. They concluded that the quality of evidence is moderate, although the contribution of expert opinion is still significant. NIAID dosing recommendations for Epinephrine 1:1000 solution for children and adults is based on pharmacologic studies. They recommend 0.15 mg for children weighing 10–25 kg, and 0.3 mg for children over 25 kg. They also suggest repeat dosing every 5–15 minutes as needed.

While second line medications such as corticosteroids and antihistamines are still recommended as adjunctive treatments, the expert panel did note the lack of evidence for these modalities. Possible reasons for continuing poorly investigated interventions in pediatrics include: "biological plausibility" of the intervention, extrapolation of data from adult studies, acceptance of lower quality research, lack of known significant harm of the intervention, and a need to do "something" rather than nothing in acute situations. Perceived concerns about medico-legal liability may also contribute to provision of treatments with no known benefits and lack of perceived harm. In their report, NIAID identified several knowledge gaps, including the role of adjunctive treatments for anaphylaxis (steroids, antihistamines and others), appropriate treatment of biphasic or protracted reactions, and the benefits and risks of alternative routes of epinephrine dosing (e.g. sublingual).

### Prevention of anaphylaxis: the role of the epinephrine auto-injector [^115tCTDo]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition, with at-risk individuals remaining at chronic high risk of recurrence. Anaphylaxis is frequently underrecognized and undertreated by healthcare providers. The first-line pharmacologic intervention for anaphylaxis is epinephrine, and guidelines uniformly agree that its prompt administration is vital to prevent progression, improve patient outcomes, and reduce hospitalizations and fatalities. Healthcare costs potentially associated with failure to provide epinephrine (hospitalizations and emergency department visits) generally exceed those of its provision. At-risk patients are prescribed epinephrine auto-injectors to facilitate timely administration in the event of an anaphylactic episode. Despite guideline recommendations that patients carry 2 auto-injectors at all times, a significant proportion of patients fail to do so, with cost of medicine cited as one reason for this lack of adherence. With the increase of high-deductible healthcare plans, patient adherence to recommendations may be further affected by increased cost sharing. The recognition and classification of epinephrine as a preventive medicine by both the US Preventive Services Task Force and insurers could increase patient access, improve outcomes, and save lives.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^113beyxM]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

What is the optimal timing of adrenaline in the treatment of anaphylaxis?

Recommendation

Adrenaline should be administered early once symptoms of anaphylaxis have been recognized or suspected (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence).

(adopted from RCUK 2008 and EAACI 2014 guidelines)

Rationale

There is a lack of high-certainty evidence to differentiate the effect of early versus delayed administration of adrenaline on clinical outcomes. Case series (including reports of fatal anaphylaxis) suggest that early adrenaline administration for out-of-hospital anaphylaxis is associated with improved outcomes. There is no evidence that pre-emptive use of adrenaline to treat mild, non-anaphylaxis reactions prevents progression to anaphylaxis. However, despite the lack of evidence to inform the optimal timing of administration, it seems reasonable to recommend adrenaline is given as soon as features of anaphylaxis are apparent; this is the consensus reflected in international guidelines.

With respect to biphasic reactions, the 2020 JTFPP identified eight retrospective case series, three of which found that delayed administration was associated with a higher rate of biphasic reaction. A prospective cohort study of 430 anaphylaxis reactions found that delayed administration of adrenaline (more than 30 min after onset of symptoms) was associated with a higher rate of biphasic reaction (OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.13–10.18). The 2020 JTFPP concluded that "there does appear to be a trend to lower rates of biphasic reactions with earlier epinephrine administration following development of anaphylaxis".

What is the optimal route of adrenaline to treat anaphylaxis?

Updated recommendations

1 The intramuscular (IM) route is recommended for initial adrenaline treatment for anaphylaxis (strong recommendation, very low certainty evidence).
2 The intravenous (IV) route is not recommended for initial management of anaphylaxis, except in the perioperative setting (as an alternative to IM adrenaline) by those skilled and experienced in its use (good practice statement).
- In such circumstances, adrenaline should preferably be administered as an IV infusion and not as a bolus dose (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence).
3 Titrate the administration of adrenaline (by any route) against clinical response (strong recommendation, very low certainty evidence).

(adapted from RCUK 2008 and EAACI 2014 guidelines, with greater emphasis on IM route and where needed, use of IV adrenaline infusion rather than IV bolus therapy)

### A 13.2 mg epinephrine intranasal spray demonstrates comparable pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety to a 0.3 mg epinephrine autoinjector [^111rTftD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

An ad hoc committee speaking on behalf of the World Health Organization released a statement regarding the use of epinephrine in the treatment of anaphylaxis. They noted that epinephrine is currently underused, is often dosed suboptimally, and is underprescribed for self-administration. Many reasons proposed to withhold its use are flawed, and the therapeutic benefits of epinephrine exceed the risk when provided in appropriate intramuscular doses. The guidelines also mention the limited availability of epinephrine autoinjectors in many countries as well as their affordability for some patients. Overall, this signals an unmet need to improve the management of patients at risk for anaphylaxis and an acknowledgment that current autoinjector use remains suboptimal.

Current treatment guidelines list epinephrine as an essential medication for the treatment of anaphylaxis. As a result of the low oral BA of epinephrine, intramuscular administration is considered the first line of treatment. Three major issues hindering subjects' compliance with carrying and using the intramuscular autoinjectors include reluctance to use self-injectors (eg, needle-use anxiety), reluctance to carry as a result of autoinjector size, and application error. Consequently, only 30% to 40% of individuals experiencing anaphylaxis receive epinephrine through autoinjectors. With the suboptimal use of emergency epinephrine in both outpatient and clinical settings, recommendations for the clinical management of anaphylaxis have been recently updated with emphasis on repeating intramuscular epinephrine doses after 5 to 20 minutes if symptoms do not resolve. However, there is a dosing restriction for use of no more than 2 autoinjectors. Patients are advised to seek medical attention if symptoms do not resolve, highlighting the importance of timely and appropriate administration in an emergent situation.

### Myths, facts and controversies in the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis [^1174GY9b]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Delays in treating with epinephrine are a risk factor for fatal outcome: it is this, as well as our inability to predict severe reactions, which drives the provision of epinephrine autoinjectors. A summary of recent guidelines on who should be prescribed autoinjectors is summarised in table 1. Healthcare professionals must consider the patient/family preference: if prescription boosts patient confidence and allows them to lead a less restrictive life, then autoinjectors should be part of the management plan. However, this requires actual carriage: the autoinjectors need to be available at all times, otherwise prescription is pointless.

Table 1
Factors to be considered as part of the risk assessment on whether to prescribe epinephrine autoinjectors

Controversy exists over the number of autoinjectors to be prescribed. The BSACI and ASCIA in general recommend one device (for school children, one device for home and a second for school, while in the USA, physicians will generally prescribe two devices). In 2014, following an extensive review of epinephrine autoinjectors prompted by a coronial inquest, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued guidance that individuals at risk of anaphylaxis should carry two epinephrine autoinjectors at all times due to 'uncertainties about the site of drug delivery and the speed of epinephrine action within the body', which, together with device misuse or malfunction, might result in a second dose being needed. The BSACI guidance (issued after the 2014 statement) recommends a single device on the basis that one dose is usually effective for most reactions. The MHRA recently reiterated its policy, in line with new Department of Health guidance for school children at risk of anaphylaxisThe MHRA review also addressed a concern that in some individuals (predominantly adolescent and adult women), the needle length in some autoinjectors may be insufficient to deliver an intramuscular (rather than subcutaneous) injection, although data to inform this are limited. At the current time, prescribing practice remains divided among UK healthcare professionals.

### EAACI guidelines: anaphylaxis (2021 update) [^1121RF1J]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a clinical emergency which all healthcare professionals need to be able to recognize and manage. The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Anaphylaxis multidisciplinary Task Force has updated the 2014 guideline. The guideline was developed using the AGREE II framework and the GRADE approach. The evidence was systematically reviewed and recommendations were created by weighing up benefits and harms. The guideline was peer-reviewed by external experts and reviewed in a public consultation. The use of clinical criteria to identify anaphylaxis is suggested with blood sampling for the later measurement of tryptase. The prompt use of intramuscular adrenaline as first-line management is recommended with the availability of adrenaline autoinjectors to patients in the community. Pharmacokinetic data should be provided for adrenaline autoinjector devices. Structured, comprehensive training for people at risk of anaphylaxis is recommended. Simulation training and visual prompts for healthcare professionals are suggested to improve the management of anaphylaxis. It is suggested that school policies reflect anaphylaxis guidelines. The evidence for the management of anaphylaxis remains mostly at a very low level. There is an urgent need to prioritize clinical trials with the potential to improve the management of patients at risk of anaphylaxis.

Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines — field treatment directives for anaphylaxis specify that intramuscular epinephrine is the primary treatment and should be administered before adjunctive treatments such as antihistamines, corticosteroids, and inhaled β agonists. For outdoor schools and organizations, selecting a method to administer epinephrine in the field is based on considerations of cost, safety, and first responder training, as well as federal guidelines and state-specific laws. Prior guidelines in 2010 and 2014 supported the concept that nonmedical professionals whose duties include providing first aid or emergency medical care in the field also be trained to administer epinephrine for anaphylaxis, and the current guidelines expand the focus to the broader field treatment of anaphylaxis, with consideration for hospital-based treatment.

### Anaphylaxis: guidelines from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology [^1157MQJ9]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a clinical emergency, and all healthcare professionals should be familiar with its recognition and acute and ongoing management. These guidelines have been prepared by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Taskforce on Anaphylaxis. They aim to provide evidence-based recommendations for the recognition, risk factor assessment, and the management of patients who are at risk of, are experiencing, or have experienced anaphylaxis. While the primary audience is allergists, these guidelines are also relevant to all other healthcare professionals. The development of these guidelines has been underpinned by two systematic reviews of the literature, both on the epidemiology and on clinical management of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening condition whose clinical diagnosis is based on recognition of a constellation of presenting features. First-line treatment for anaphylaxis is intramuscular adrenaline. Useful second-line interventions may include removing the trigger where possible, calling for help, correct positioning of the patient, high-flow oxygen, intravenous fluids, inhaled short-acting bronchodilators, and nebulized adrenaline. Discharge arrangements should involve an assessment of the risk of further reactions, a management plan with an anaphylaxis emergency action plan, and, where appropriate, prescribing an adrenaline auto-injector. If an adrenaline auto-injector is prescribed, education on when and how to use the device should be provided. Specialist follow-up is essential to investigate possible triggers, to perform a comprehensive risk assessment, and to prevent future episodes by developing personalized risk reduction strategies including, where possible, commencing allergen immunotherapy. Training for the patient and all caregivers is essential. There are still many gaps in the evidence base for anaphylaxis.

### Myths, facts and controversies in the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis [^114iYA6G]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute management

Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis according to all guidelines. It has both α-sympathomimetic and β-sympathomimetic actions, causing peripheral vasoconstriction, increased cardiac output and bronchodilation; importantly, it is the only drug that inhibits the further release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells and basophils.

Myth 4: 'Epinephrine is dangerous'

Epinephrine given by intramuscular injection into the outer mid-thigh is very safe and starts to work within minutes. Epinephrine can either be injected using a needle–syringe (using 1:1000 epinephrine, which results in a lower volume, less painful injection than if using 1:10 000) or by autoinjector device (eg, Emerade, EpiPen, Jext). Where an autoinjector is used, note that both EpiPen and Jext are only available in 150 µg and 300 µg doses, which means that the 300 µg is effectively an underdose in someone over 30 kg (this may explain why some patients require a second epinephrine dose). Younger children should be transitioned to a 300 µg dose when their body weight is > 25 kg, and some centres advocate doing so from 20 kg. Around 10%–20% of patients report transient effects including pallor, anxiety, palpitations, dizziness and headache (although these symptoms may also be due to the reaction and/or the patient's own endogenous epinephrine production).

Epinephrine is underused in the treatment of anaphylaxis, both prehospital and in emergency departments. Further intramuscular doses of epinephrine should be administered in the event of persisting respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms. Epinephrine can and should be repeated after 5 min; the administration of other medication such as antihistamines or steroids must not cause delay or distraction, as these are not first-line (or even second-line) treatments for anaphylaxis(figure 2A). An alternative summary of anaphylaxis treatment, consistent with national and international guidelines, is shown in figure 2B.

### Office approach to anaphylaxis: sooner better than later [^114gJz9k]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis, an acute and potentially lethal multisystem allergic reaction, is almost unavoidable in medical practice. Physicians must be able to recognize anaphylaxis, treat it promptly and appropriately, and provide preventive recommendations. Epinephrine, which should be administered immediately, is the drug of choice for acute anaphylaxis.

Rationale

The safety and efficacy of the dosing regimen (Table 4) has been established in clinical practice for over 20 years. In children, a dose of 0.01 mg/kg (max 500 microgram) titrated to clinical response is recommended in international guidelines. Many guidelines (including those from EAACI, WAO and RCUK) simplify the dosing regimen to age categories, based on what is considered to be safe and practical to draw up and inject in an emergency. This pragmatic approach (which matches the licensed doses used for auto-injectors) seems to be effective and safe. Four small crossover RCTs have been published which compare different doses of IM adrenaline: one in children (weight 15–30 kg) comparing 150/300 micrograms; and three comparing 300/500 micrograms in teenagersor adults. In all four studies, the higher dose had a more favourable absorption profile, however how this impacts on clinical response in patients with anaphylaxis is unknown. While the certainty of evidence with respect to dose is low, the working group concluded that a strong recommendation was appropriate given these doses have been widely used globally for many decades. In addition, we did not identify any new evidence to challenge current dosing recommendations.

In terms of the practicalities of IM administration, the EAACI 2020 systematic review identified one study in which untrained caregivers were more able to give adrenaline using a prefilled syringe correctly, than when using an adrenaline auto-injector (AAI) (OR 4.07, 95%CI 1.29–12.86; low certainty). A study with radiologists found that using an AAI reduced the time to administration by an average of 70 s compared to drawing up manually from an ampoule, and resulted in fewer administration errors. Most AAIs deliver a maximum of 300 micrograms epinephrine, while the appropriate dose in teenagers and adults is 500 micrograms. Coronial inquests have identified that the use of AAIs for anaphylaxis can therefore result in substantial underdosing, which may contribute to fatal outcomes. A single-blinded, cross-over RCT in 12 food-allergic teenagers reported that a 500 microgram dose (given by AAI) had a more favourable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile compared to 300 micrograms, without causing a higher rate of systemic adverse events. Therefore, while some settings may prefer to use an AAI to administer an initial dose of adrenaline (for speed and ease), further doses should be given by needle/syringe in order to deliver an optimal dose.

### Appropriate use of epinephrine in anaphylaxis [^115scNHW]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

We are submitting a case-based presentation illustrating medical errors in the use of epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Readers will learn from mistakes made by other emergency caregivers in treating anaphylaxis. The article will specifically review the recommended use of epinephrine in the management of anaphylaxis. Four patients are presented who were seen in consultation by our outpatient allergy service. In all 4 cases, the history was suggestive of an episode of anaphylaxis in which emergency care providers mismanaged treatment. In 2 cases, the patients required ICU care after improperly receiving intravenous epinephrine. In the remaining 2 cases, epinephrine use was either omitted or significantly delayed in its administration. Our presentation includes a review of consensus statements regarding the treatment of anaphylaxis with particular regard to the use of epinephrine. We hope that this information will help prevent similar errors from harming other patients.

### Who needs epinephrine? Anaphylaxis, autoinjectors, and parachutes [^114DcQUN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

International guidelines stipulate that intramuscular (IM) epinephrine (adrenaline) is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, with an established good safety profile. The availability of epinephrine autoinjectors (EAI) has greatly facilitated the lay administration of IM epinephrine in community settings. However, key areas of uncertainty remain around epinephrine usage. These include variations in prescribing EAI, what symptoms should prompt epinephrine administration, whether emergency medical services (EMS) need to be contacted after administration, and whether epinephrine administered via EAI reduces mortality from anaphylaxis or improves quality of life measures. We provide a balanced commentary on these issues. There is increasing recognition that a poor response to epinephrine, particularly after 2 doses, is a useful marker of severity and the need for urgent escalation. It is likely that patients who respond to a single epinephrine dose do not require EMS activation or emergency department transfer, but data are needed to demonstrate the safety of this approach. Lastly, patients at risk of anaphylaxis must be counseled against over-reliance on EAI alone.

Is adrenaline effective for the treatment of anaphylaxis?

Recommendation

We recommend adrenaline as the first line treatment for anaphylaxis (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence)

(adopted from RCUK 2008 and EAACI 2014 guidelines)

Rationale

International guidelines agree that adrenaline (epinephrine) is first line treatment for anaphylaxis. However, supporting evidence is limited to observational studies (case series and fatality registers) in humans, animal models, epidemiological studies, and pharmacokinetic studies in patients who might be at risk for anaphylaxis but not experiencing allergic symptoms at the time of study. The EAACI 2014 guideline concluded "there is some evidence to support the use of adrenaline for the emergency management of anaphylaxis", while the WAO 2011 Guideline noted that "the evidence base for prompt epinephrine injection in the initial treatment of anaphylaxis is stronger than the evidence base for the use of antihistamines and glucocorticoids in anaphylaxis". A systematic review by EAACI in 2020 only identified observational studies examining the efficacy of adrenaline and noted a high risk of bias; no eligible studies compared adrenaline with no adrenaline for critical outcomes such as mortality, or most other outcomes.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

See FDA-Approved Patient Labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use)

A healthcare provider should review the patient instructions and operation of epinephrine injection, in detail, with the patient or caregiver.

Epinephrine is essential for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Carefully instruct patients who are at risk of or with a history of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) to insect stings or bites, foods, drugs, and other allergens, as well as idiopathic and exercise-induced anaphylaxis, about the circumstances under which epinephrine should be used.

Administration

Instruct patients and/or caregivers in the appropriate use of epinephrine injection. Epinephrine injection should be injected into the middle of the outer thigh (through clothing if necessary).

Instruct caregivers to hold the leg of young children firmly in place and limit movement prior to and during injection. Lacerations, bent needles, and embedded needles have been reported when epinephrine injection has been injected into the thigh of young children who are uncooperative and kick during an injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Advise patients to seek immediate medical care in conjunction with administration of epinephrine injection.

Complete patient information, including dosage, directions for proper administration and precautions can be found inside each epinephrine injection carton. A printed label on the surface of epinephrine injection shows instructions for use and a diagram depicting the injection process.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines on anaphylaxis [^114yXqEr]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society anaphylaxis — epinephrine primary treatment and initial management: Epinephrine is the essential, primary treatment that should be given once anaphylaxis has been diagnosed (1A). Given its effectiveness and rapid administration, intramuscular (IM) epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. The preferred injection site is the anterolateral thigh, followed by the deltoid (1B). Over-the-counter, metered-dose inhalers of epinephrine have not been found to be a practical or effective treatment for anaphylaxis (1B). Delay in epinephrine administration has been repeatedly associated with fatal anaphylaxis. Epinephrine may be given intravenous (IV) as a continuous infusion or intermittent boluses when anaphylactic shock is refractory to repeated IM injections (see "Dosage" and "Refractory Anaphylaxis" sections). If possible, separating the patient from the inciting allergen is prudent, but vomiting should not be induced to eliminate a food-based allergen (1C).

### Management of anaphylaxis [^115w8Ltj]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a severe systemic reaction that can be managed appropriately with expedient diagnosis and treatment. Intramuscular epinephrine continues to be the mainstay of treatment of anaphylaxis; however, it is still underused in the community and in the medical setting. Further education and counseling of patients and health care providers is required to prevent and manage anaphylaxis successfully. In-office management of anaphylaxis includes training of staff, preparedness with the necessary supplies and medication, and an effective action plan.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^114VEZgW]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Anaphylaxis practice parameter — epinephrine dosing and EAI weight bands are described as follows: The current standard practice is to treat anaphylaxis with a dosage of epinephrine of 0.01 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 0.3 mg for children and teenagers and 0.5 mg for adults. In the United States, the FDA has approved 0.3 mg EAIs for patients weighing more than or equal to 30 kg, 0.15 mg EAIs for patients weighing 15 to 30 kg, and a 0.1 mg EAI (Auvi-Q) for patients weighing 7.5 to 15 kg. Clinical experience suggests that infants tend to tolerate doses of epinephrine higher than 0.01 mg/kg well, and the JTFPP's 2020 anaphylaxis practice parameter update supports the use of 0.15 mg EAI for infants or children weighing less than 15 kg. A 0.5 mg EAI (Emerade) is also available in some countries for patients weighing more than 60 kg. To limit underdosing, the AAAAI, AAP, CSACI, and EAACI support switching to 0.3 mg at 25 kg, and the CSACI advises that clinicians may consider prescribing a 0.5 mg EAI (not currently available in USA) for people weighing more than or equal to 45 kg. Among teenagers, a small randomized trial of EAI administration found no significant adverse events following intramuscular self-injection with 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg of epinephrine, and the 0.5 mg dose resulted in higher plasma catecholamine level than the 0.3 mg dose.

### Who needs epinephrine? Anaphylaxis, autoinjectors, and parachutes [^1144kWbc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

The treatment of patients presenting with cutaneous and gastrointestinal symptoms after exposure to a causative food allergen is more controversial. Anaphylaxis guidelines diverge on whether gastrointestinal and cutaneous symptoms together, without other symptoms, constitute anaphylaxis (and thus warrant epinephrine). In some countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia, food-induced reactions causing gastrointestinal and cutaneous symptoms alone do not meet local criteria for anaphylaxis and thus are not usually treated with epinephrine. Epidemiological outcomes from anaphylaxis in these countries are not less favorable than in North America, where the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria are commonly used. However, the NIAID/FAAN criterion of "persistent gastrointestinal symptoms"is ambiguous, both in terms of what might be considered "persistent" and whether certain persisting symptoms such as mild abdominal pain or nausea justify treatment with epinephrine. This was perhaps best demonstrated in PALISADE, a phase 3 study of peanut oral immunotherapy: at baseline challenge, at least one-third of 551 participants received epinephrine but only 28 had reactions that met the NIAID/FAAN anaphylaxis criteria. Thirty-five events were treated for wheezing — 7 more than those diagnosed with anaphylaxis — and at least 14 without anaphylaxis received multiple doses of epinephrine. An attempt was made by the World Allergy Organization (WAO) in its 2020 guidance to align these different definitions (Figure 2). The WAO criteria were adopted by 50 national societies including the American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology, but not the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology nor the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Thus, the lack of a single harmonized approach to defining anaphylaxis at the global level remains an important gap.

### Retrospective comparison between 0.3 mg and 0.5 mg dosing of intramuscular epinephrine for anaphylaxis [^116DvCC1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Anaphylaxis is an acute and life-threatening reaction. Intramuscular (IM) epinephrine is the first line agent for management. The World Allergy Organization recommends IM epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 0.5 mg. However, 0.3 mg is commonly used which may increase the risk of poor outcomes in adults greater than 50 kg. This study aims to investigate the incidence of escalating care after initial epinephrine dosing in management of anaphylaxis.

Methods

This retrospective study included patients who received IM epinephrine 0.3 or 0.5 mg for anaphylaxis within a single health system. The primary outcome was the incidence of escalating care after an initial dose of IM epinephrine, defined as an additional dose of IM epinephrine, epinephrine infusion initiation, or intubation. Secondary outcomes, including adverse effects, were compared between groups.

Results

Of 338 meeting inclusion criteria, 254 and 84 patients were in the 0.3 mg and 0.5 mg groups, respectively. The primary composite outcome was significantly higher in the 0.3 mg group compared to the 0.5 mg group (29.5% vs. 7.1%, p < 0.001). Individual outcomes of an additional IM dose and infusion initiation were significantly higher in the 0.3 mg group. A multivariate logistic regression confirmed an initial dose of 0.5 mg epinephrine was independently associated with a lower incidence of the primary outcome.

Conclusion

Significantly fewer patients receiving an initial 0.5 mg IM epinephrine dose required escalation of care compared to those who received 0.3 mg. Future prospective studies are needed to confirm the results of this study.

Epinephrine use and diagnosis — epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, and meeting diagnostic criteria is not required before use because there are scenarios in which epinephrine may be warranted before a reaction is diagnosed as anaphylaxis; however, a lack of clinical response to epinephrine should not be used as a surrogate marker to establish a diagnosis of anaphylaxis.

### Use of multiple epinephrine doses in anaphylaxis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Ed1Rf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Regulatory bodies recommend that all patients at risk of anaphylaxis be prescribed 2 epinephrine autoinjectors, which they should carry at all times. This is in contrast to some guidelines. The proportion of anaphylaxis reactions that are treated with multiple doses of epinephrine has not been systematically evaluated.

Objective

Our aim was to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies reporting epinephrine treatment for anaphylaxis in which data relating to the number of doses administered were available.

Methods

We searched the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases for relevant studies reporting at least 10 anaphylaxis events (due to food or venom) from 1946 until January 2020. Data were extracted in duplicate for the meta-analysis, and the risk of bias was assessed. The study was registered under the PROSPERO identifier CRD42017069109.

Results

A total of 86 studies (36,557 anaphylaxis events) met the inclusion criteria (20 of the studies [23%] were prospective studies; 64 [74%] reported reactions in the community, and 22 [26%] included food challenge data). Risk of bias was assessed as low in 50 studies. Overall, 7.7% of anaphylaxis events from any cause (95% CI = 6.4–9.1) were treated with multiple doses of epinephrine. When only epinephrine-treated reactions for which subsequent doses were administered by a health care professional were considered, 11.1% of food-induced reactions (95% CI = 9.4–13.2) and 17.1% of venom-induced reactions (95% CI = 11.3–25.0) were treated with more than 1 epinephrine dose. Heterogeneity was moderate to high in the meta-analyses, but at sensitivity analysis this estimate was not affected by study design or anaphylaxis definition.

Conclusion

Around 1 in 10 anaphylaxis reactions are treated with more than 1 dose of epinephrine.

### Adrenaline auto-injectors for the treatment of anaphylaxis with and without cardiovascular collapse in the community [^111KX4XW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Anaphylaxis is a serious hypersensitivity reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Adrenaline (epinephrine) auto-injectors are recommended as the initial, potentially life-saving treatment of choice for anaphylaxis in the community, but they are not universally available and have limitations in their use.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of adrenaline (epinephrine) auto-injectors in relieving respiratory, cardiovascular, and other symptoms during episodes of anaphylaxis that occur in the community.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid SP) (1950 to January 2012), EMBASE (Ovid SP) (1980 to January 2012), CINAHL (EBSCO host) (1982 to January 2012), AMED (EBSCO host) (1985 to January 2012), LILACS, (BIREME) (1980 to January 2012), ISI Web of Science (1950 to January 2012). We adapted our search terms for other databases. We also searched websites listing on-going trials: the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the UK Clinical Research Network Study Portfolio, and the meta Register of Controlled Trials; and contacted pharmaceutical companies who manufacture adrenaline auto-injectors in an attempt to locate unpublished material.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing auto-injector administration of adrenaline with any control including no intervention, placebo, or other adrenergic agonists were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Authors' Conclusions

Based on this review, we cannot make any new recommendations on the effectiveness of adrenaline auto-injectors for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Although randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of high methodological quality are necessary to define the true extent of benefits from the administration of adrenaline in anaphylaxis via an auto-injector, such trials are unlikely to be performed in individuals experiencing anaphylaxis because of ethical concerns associated with randomization to placebo. There is, however, a need to consider trials in which, for example, auto-injectors of different doses of adrenaline and differing devices are compared in order to provide greater clarity on the dose and device of choice. Such trials would be practically challenging to conduct. In the absence of appropriate trials, we recommend that adrenaline administration by auto-injector should still be regarded as the most effective first-line treatment for the management of anaphylaxis in the community. In countries where auto-injectors are not commonly used, it may be possible to conduct trials to compare administration of adrenaline via auto-injector with adrenaline administered by syringe and ampoule, or comparing the effectiveness of two different types of auto-injector.

### Value of a second dose of epinephrine during anaphylaxis: a patient / caregiver survey [^116K3PAP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Anaphylaxis guidelines recommend prescription of more than 1 epinephrine autoinjector (EAI) for patients at risk. A second epinephrine dose is required in 16% to 36% of patients.

Objective

To evaluate real-world use of EAIs and understand the patients'/caregivers' adherence to guidelines.

Methods

We collected survey responses from US patients and caregivers with an EAI prescription in November 2015. The survey covered several domains relevant to anaphylaxis and EAI use.

Results

The survey was completed by 953 respondents (505 patients and 448 caregivers). Most respondents were women (71%). Most of the respondents had previously administered an EAI (75%). The mean age of the respondents was 28 ± 14.0 years. A total of 786 (82%) respondents did not carry 2 EAIs all the time, and the main reason given was to have 1 EAI in another location. Most respondents kept at least 1 EAI at home (84%). The percentages of respondents with more than 1 EAI available at locations surveyed were low (patients: 22% at home, 2% at work; caregivers: 27% at home, 10% at school). During training, most respondents (64%) were instructed to always carry 1 EAI and keep the other in another location. Half of the respondents reported the use of a second epinephrine dose in a previous event. Forty-five percent of the 73 respondents who sought emergency care did so because of the unavailability of a second dose.

Conclusions

Our study suggests poor adherence in patients and caregivers to anaphylaxis guidelines recommending more than 1 EAI available at all times and implies that this can result in adverse outcomes.

### First-aid treatment of anaphylaxis to food: focus on epinephrine [^114AYbkV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Avoiding food triggers for anaphylactic reactions (severe acute systemic allergic reactions) is easier said than done. Most episodes of anaphylaxis to food occur unexpectedly in the community in the absence of a health care professional. All individuals at risk should therefore have an emergency action plan in place. The cornerstone of first-aid treatment of anaphylaxis is epinephrine injected intramuscularly in the vastus lateralis muscle (lateral aspect of the thigh). In this review, we focus on epinephrine. We examine a therapeutic dilemma: the issue of epinephrine dose selection in an individual for whom no optimal fixed-dose auto-injector formulation exists, and a therapeutic controversy: the issue of epinephrine injection versus an oral H1-antihistamine in anaphylaxis episodes that appear to be mild. The pharmaceutical industry could address the first of these issues by providing a wider range of epinephrine fixed doses in easy-to-use auto-injectors, or by providing adjustable epinephrine doses in auto-injectors. The second issue could be addressed in part by development of alternative routes of epinephrine administration for the first-aid, out-of-hospital treatment of anaphylaxis.

### Anaphylaxis in practice: a guide to the 2023 practice parameter update [^116M7pYJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). High credibility.

Epinephrine autoinjectors: when and how to prescribe — guidance covers prescribing to higher-risk patients, quantity decisions, administration timing, emergency activation, adverse event counseling, cost and device selection factors, and follow-up education. We recommend clinicians routinely prescribe EAIs to patients at higher risk of anaphylaxis, and when deciding whether to prescribe EAIs to lower-risk patients, we suggest that clinicians engage in a shared decision-making process that considers patients' risk factors, values, and preferences. We suggest that in jurisdictions where single-packs of EAIs are available, clinicians consider a patient's risk factors, values, preferences, and contextual factors when deciding whether to prescribe only one vs multiple EAIs, and we suggest they routinely prescribe more than one EAI when patients have previously required multiple doses of epinephrine and/or have a history of biphasic reactions. We suggest that clinicians counsel patients and caregivers to give epinephrine at the first sign of suspected anaphylaxis and, in general, not to give epinephrine preemptively to an asymptomatic patient. We suggest that clinicians counsel patients that immediate activation of emergency medical services may not be required with prompt, complete, durable response when additional epinephrine and care are readily available, and we suggest that patients always activate emergency medical services after epinephrine use if anaphylaxis is severe, fails to resolve promptly or completely or nearly completely, or returns or worsens. Serious adverse reactions to intramuscular epinephrine are rare and should not pose a barrier to prescription or early administration when indicated, and to manage risk we recommend counseling on proper EAI use, common side effects, and the need for immediate evaluation if serious adverse event signs or symptoms develop. We suggest discussing potential financial and psychosocial burdens during shared decision-making, and when selecting an EAI we suggest considering dosage, needle length, affordability, access, and patient treatment preferences. During visits after prescribing EAIs, we recommend routinely reviewing carriage, storage, and use; encouraging regular practice with a trainer device; and discussing strategies to manage barriers to adherence.

Epinephrine autoinjector dosing — weight bands, approvals, and device selection: Clinicians should consider the dosage, needle length, affordability, accessibility, and patient treatment preferences when choosing among brands or formulations of EAI, clinicians should prescribe at least two EAIs to patients with a history of anaphylaxis requiring multiple doses of epinephrine and/or biphasic anaphylaxis, and the standard recommended dosage of epinephrine for treating anaphylaxis is 0.01 mg/kg up to a maximum of 0.3 mg for children and 0.5 mg for adults with US approvals for 0.1 mg EAI at 7.5 to 15 kg, 0.15 mg at 15 to 30 kg, and 0.3 mg at 30 kg or greater; other countries have approved 0.5 mg EAI for patients weighing more than 60 kg, expert consensus supports switching to 0.3 mg EAI at 25 kg and 0.5 mg EAI at 45 kg when available, and clinical experience suggests it is safe to prescribe 0.1 or 0.15 mg EAI to infants and children weighing less than 15 kg.

### Use of multiple epinephrine doses in anaphylaxis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115UadCc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Epinephrine is established as the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. The majority of allergic reactions occur in the community. Delayed administration of epinephrine has been associated with poor outcomes in anaphylaxis. To mitigate against this, patients at risk of anaphylaxis to food and insect stings are often prescribed epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs) for self-administration.

National and international regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom, and the European Medicines Agency recommend that individuals at risk of anaphylaxis carry at least 2 EAIs at all times. This is in contrast to guidelines from some specialist societies, which make this recommendation for only selected "at-risk" patients. This divergence in advice is potentially problematic for clinicians, who might be faced with medicolegal consequences if they go against official recommendations from regulatory authorities and prescribe only a single EAI device.

A number of observational studies have assessed the frequency of anaphylaxis reactions that fail to adequately respond to a single dose of epinephrine. However, the data are limited by the studies' small sample sizes and differences in local practice in defining and treating anaphylaxis and heterogeneity in study design. As a result, estimates for the rate of allergic reactions treated with more than a single dose of epinephrine vary widely, ranging from 0%to 32%. We therefore undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the proportion of anaphylaxis reactions reported in the literature that were treated with at least 2 doses of epinephrine.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE Adrenalin® is a non-selective alpha and beta adrenergic agonist indicated for: Emergency treatment of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Anaphylaxis: Adults and Children 30 kg or more:

0. 3 to
0. 5 mg intramuscularly or subcutaneously into anterolateral aspect of the thigh every 5 to 10 minutes as necessary or more:

0. 3 to
0. 5 mg of undiluted Adrenalin® administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh, up to a maximum of 0. 5 mg per injection, repeated every 5 to 10 minutes as necessary. Monitor clinically for reaction severity and cardiac effects.
8. 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies for the treatment of anaphylaxis have not been performed in subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, other reported clinical experience with use of epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylaxis has identified that geriatric patients may be particularly sensitive to the effects of epinephrine. Therefore, for the treatment of anaphylaxis, consider starting with a lower dose to take into account potential concomitant disease or other drug therapy.
12. 2 Pharmacodynamics Through its action on alpha-adrenergic receptors, epinephrine lessens the vasodilation and increased vascular permeability that occurs during anaphylaxis, which can lead to loss of intravascular fluid volume and hypotension.

Through its action on beta-adrenergic receptors, epinephrine causes bronchial smooth muscle relaxation and helps alleviate bronchospasm, wheezing and dyspnea that may occur during anaphylaxis.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^113TpACE]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Anaphylaxis management — intramuscular epinephrine dosing, adjunctive therapy, and EMS activation are specified: epinephrine is dosed as "0.01 mg/kg of a 1:1000 [1 mg/mL] solution to a maximum of 0.5 mg in adults and 0.3 mg in prepubertal children". Use before symptom development is "a low-value practice (providing uncertain benefit with potential for harm at substantial cost)", while "appropriate use of epinephrine during anaphylaxis improves quality of life and self-efficacy". Supportive measures such as "intravenous fluids and supplemental oxygen, may play an important role in the treatment of anaphylaxis, even before the development of hypotension", and "use of epinephrine does not mandate universal activation of EMS" when the response is prompt, complete, and durable with access to advanced care.

### Guidance on completing a written allergy and anaphylaxis emergency plan [^114j6uGK]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening, severe allergic reaction. The immediate assessment of patients having an allergic reaction and prompt administration of epinephrine, if criteria for anaphylaxis are met, promote optimal outcomes. National and international guidelines for the management of anaphylaxis, including those for management of allergic reactions at school, as well as several clinical reports from the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend the provision of written emergency action plans to those at risk of anaphylaxis, in addition to the prescription of epinephrine autoinjectors. This clinical report provides information to help health care providers understand the role of a written, personalized allergy and anaphylaxis emergency plan to enhance the care of children at risk of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. This report offers a comprehensive written plan, with advice on individualizing instructions to suit specific patient circumstances.

### Epinephrine (Epipen Jr) [^112UjQk3]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

EpiPen®or EpiPen®Jr Auto-Injector prescribers should ensure that the patient or caregiver understands the indications and use of this product. A health care provider should review the patient instructions and operation of the EpiPen®or EpiPen®Jr Auto-Injector, in detail, with the patient or caregiver. Inject EpiPen®or EpiPen®Jr intramuscularly or subcutaneously into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh, through clothing if necessary. See detailed Directions for Use on the accompanying Patient Instructions.

Selection of the appropriate dosage strength is determined according to patient body weight.

EpiPen®Auto-Injector delivers 0.3 mg epinephrine injection (0.3 mL, 1:1000) and is intended for patients who weigh 30 kg or more (approximately 66 pounds or more).

EpiPen®Jr Auto-Injector delivers 0.15 mg epinephrine injection (0.3 mL, 1:2000) and is intended for patients who weigh 15 to 30 kg (33–66 pounds).

Each EpiPen®or EpiPen®Jr Auto-Injector contains a single dose of epinephrine. Since the doses of epinephrine delivered from EpiPen®or EpiPen®Jr Auto-Injector are fixed, consider using other forms of injectable epinephrine if doses lower than 0.15 mg are deemed necessary. The prescriber should carefully assess each patient to determine the most appropriate dose of epinephrine, recognizing the life-threatening nature of the reactions for which this drug is indicated. With severe persistent anaphylaxis, repeat injections with an additional EpiPen®Auto-Injector may be necessary.

Patients should be instructed to periodically visually inspect the epinephrine solution for particulate matter and discoloration. If the solution contains particulate matter or develops a pinkish color or becomes darker than slightly yellow, the patient should immediately contact their physician for a replacement, since these changes indicate that the effectiveness of the drug product may be decreased.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^113gQEEE]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Anaphylaxis — Key points of consensus state that anaphylaxis is a serious, systemic hypersensitivity reaction that is usually rapid in onset and may cause death, and severe anaphylaxis is characterized by potentially life-threatening compromise in respiration and/or the circulation, and it may occur without typical skin features, circulatory shock, or compromised breathing being present. There are similarities and differences between the 2006 NIAID and 2020 WAO anaphylaxis criteria and further studies should be conducted to validate the 2020 WAO anaphylaxis criteria, and use of the 2007 Brighton Collaborative Criteria in establishing the diagnosis of anaphylaxis may lead to overdiagnosis of anaphylaxis. Biphasic anaphylaxis is highly likely when the patient develops anaphylaxis after initial signs and symptoms have completely resolved for at least one hour before the onset of repeated anaphylaxis with 48 hours and without re-exposure to an allergen trigger and is unlikely when anaphylaxis is not severe and the patient remains symptom-free for one hour of observation following resolution of initial anaphylaxis; biphasic anaphylaxis is more likely to occur with increasing anaphylaxis severity and in patients who have received more than one dose of epinephrine for anaphylaxis treatment. Persistent anaphylaxis is highly likely when anaphylaxis persists for at least 4 hours, and refractory anaphylaxis is highly likely when anaphylaxis continues despite appropriate epinephrine dosing and symptom-directed medical management; refractory anaphylaxis increases the risk for anaphylaxis fatality. Additional points note that anaphylaxis severity is a continuum that results from a combination of risk factors, including those related to the allergen as well as the patient and other patient specific factors and comorbidities, and that patients with severe anaphylaxis are more likely to demonstrate hypotension and hypoxemia with severe anaphylaxis associated with older age, pre-existing cardio-pulmonary disease, and drug etiology.

### EAACI guidelines on the management of IgE-mediated food allergy [^115hzfhP]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Reason for recommendation

Anaphylaxis is a potentially life‐threatening allergic reaction for which adrenaline remains the treatment of choice. In the community, adrenaline should ideally be administered intramuscularly using an AAI, with an adequate needle length and a dosage adapted to weight and to age.

Strength of recommendation

There are data to support different training strategies for recognising anaphylaxis and its treatment; however, they were not obtained in an acute real‐world setting. Therefore, the certainty of evidence is low, but the strength or recommendation is strong as it places high value on the patients' safety.

Practical implications

Training programs for patients and caregivers that focus on recognising anaphylaxis and other allergic symptoms and signs and stepwise treatment are essential. Training teachers and peers is also important. A switch of focus from child to adolescent and in transition to adulthood is key to ensure that patients feel confident and empowered to manage their allergic reactions and self‐administer treatment, if needed. Training programs should be tailored to the specific patient setting, age, language, and baseline allergy understanding of the disease and risk of anaphylaxis. Different strategies and educational tools may be required, sometimes repeatedly, to empower patients to identify allergic symptoms and initiate medical treatment. Indeed, AAI training should be repeated as part of every follow up visit.

Patients and their caregivers must be empowered to identify and treat anaphylaxis. Whilst definitions of anaphylaxis vary across the world, all these reactions are severe and life‐threatening. We shall refer to the EAACI definition of anaphylaxis as a reference. It is critical that patients can identify airway, breathing and circulatory compromise as these can prove fatal. Skin and mucosal changes are usually present but are not required to support a diagnosis of anaphylaxis.

Adrenaline administration, preferably using an AAI device, remains the treatment of choice in moderate–severe food‐induced allergic reactions. AAI are available in many countries worldwide, but access and reimbursement greatly vary. Doses may include 0.15 mg, 0.3 mg and 0.5 mg adrenaline (additionally, 0.1 mg in the US), and the prescribing clinician should best match these to the patient's age and weight. The instructions for each device vary, so patients must be trained to use the device they are carrying. Patients must be trained to identify the correct body positioning during anaphylaxis and the anatomical landmarks needed for AAI administration into the thigh muscle.

### Anaphylaxis in practice: a guide to the 2023 practice parameter update [^112GRPaw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). High credibility.

Recommendation 26 — Post-epinephrine actions and home management: Clinicians should counsel patients always to activate emergency medical services after epinephrine administration when their anaphylaxis is severe, symptoms do not promptly resolve completely or nearly completely, and/or symptoms return or worsen after the first dose of epinephrine. Immediate activation of emergency medical services after epinephrine use may not be necessary if the patient experiences a prompt, complete or nearly complete, and durable response to treatment and has additional doses of epinephrine available; in such cases, home management of anaphylaxis may be considered. There is no evidence that preemptively administering epinephrine to asymptomatic patients prevents anaphylaxis after exposure to a potential trigger. Clinicians should discuss potential barriers to treatment adherence, regularly review the essentials of EAIs (epinephrine autoinjectors), encourage practice with trainer devices, counsel about common side effects and signs of rare serious adverse events, and note that the risk of serious adverse reactions to intramuscular epinephrine is low and should not pose barriers to EAI prescription or use. When developing a management plan, clinicians and patients should engage in SDM that considers risk factors for severe and biphasic anaphylaxis, access to epinephrine and medical services, and capacity to administer EAI effectively and gauge treatment response.

Anaphylaxis training

All staff should undertake evidence-based, best-practice anaphylaxis training in accordance with the National Allergy Council minimum content requirements for anaphylaxis training (Box 1). Anaphylaxis training should be undertaken at least every 2 years and include hands-on practice with AI trainer devices. Hands-on practice with AI devices improves the ability to demonstrate correct administration of the device in the future. Subsequent anaphylaxis refresher training should be undertaken twice yearly including hands-on practice with AI trainer devices.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^112iAu8T]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

This practice parameter update focuses on 7 areas in which there are new evidence and new recommendations. Diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis have been revised, and patterns of anaphylaxis are defined. Measurement of serum tryptase is important for diagnosis of anaphylaxis and to identify underlying mast cell disorders. In infants and toddlers, age-specific symptoms may differ from older children and adults, patient age is not correlated with reaction severity, and anaphylaxis is unlikely to be the initial reaction to an allergen on first exposure. Different community settings for anaphylaxis require specific measures for prevention and treatment of anaphylaxis. Optimal prescribing and use of epinephrine autoinjector devices require specific counseling and training of patients and caregivers, including when and how to administer the epinephrine autoinjector and whether and when to call 911. If epinephrine is used promptly, immediate activation of emergency medical services may not be required if the patient experiences a prompt, complete, and durable response. For most medical indications, the risk of stopping or changing beta-blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medication may exceed the risk of more severe anaphylaxis if the medication is continued, especially in patients with insect sting anaphylaxis. Evaluation for mastocytosis, including a bone marrow biopsy, should be considered for adult patients with severe insect sting anaphylaxis or recurrent idiopathic anaphylaxis. After perioperative anaphylaxis, repeat anesthesia may proceed in the context of shared decision-making and based on the history and results of diagnostic evaluation with skin tests or in vitro tests when available, and supervised challenge when necessary.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^1166wCiE]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Epinephrine auto-injector (EAI) counseling and use — patients and caregivers: We suggest that clinicians counsel patients and caregivers to give epinephrine at the first sign of suspected anaphylaxis. We suggest that, in general, clinicians counsel patients or caregivers not to give epinephrine preventively to an asymptomatic patient. We suggest that clinicians counsel patients that immediate activation of EMS may not be required if the patient experiences prompt, complete, and durable response to treatment with epinephrine, provided that additional epinephrine and medical care are readily available, if needed. We suggest that clinicians counsel patients to always activate EMS after epinephrine use if anaphylaxis is severe, fails to resolve promptly, fails to resolve completely or nearly completely, or returns or worsens after a first dose of epinephrine. Serious adverse reactions to intramuscular epinephrine are very rare and should not pose a barrier to the prescription or early administration of EAIs when indicated. To manage the risk of adverse events, we recommend that clinicians counsel patients and caregivers on the proper use of EAIs, the common adverse effects, and the need for immediate evaluation and treatment when signs or symptoms of serious adverse events develop. We suggest that clinicians discuss the potential financial and psychosocial burdens of EAIs with patients while engaging in shared decision-making. When deciding which EAI to prescribe, we suggest that clinicians consider dosage, needle length, affordability, access, and patient treatment preferences. During visits with patients who have been prescribed EAIs, we recommend that clinicians routinely review the essentials of EAI carriage, storage, and use; encourage patients to regularly practice EAI administration with a trainer device; and discuss strategies to manage barriers to adherence that patients may have experienced.
