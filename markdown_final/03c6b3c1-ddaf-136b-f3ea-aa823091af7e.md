## Question

Why do my four months old premie baby born on 34 weeks who has milk protein allergy has black poop? Baby currently on Puramino formula with rice cereal.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why their 4-month-old premature infant, born at 34 weeks, who has a milk protein allergy and is on Puramino (an amino acid–based formula) with rice cereal, is having black stools. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely explanation for black stool in this context. Then, I should verify whether this could reflect ongoing allergic inflammation or bleeding. Next, I will consider medication or supplement contributions. After that, I need to check for less common but serious causes like upper GI bleeding or NEC. Finally, I will outline a practical, evidence-based plan for evaluation and follow-up, including when to escalate care.

> Let me first confirm the most likely explanation: black stool in infants on iron-fortified formula or cereal is commonly due to iron oxidation in the gut, which darkens stool to dark green or black without indicating bleeding. This is a well-described, benign phenomenon and is expected with iron-containing products, so I should not jump to conclusions about blood loss just because the stool is dark [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify whether this could still reflect ongoing milk protein–related bleeding. In non–IgE-mediated cow's milk protein allergy, the typical pattern is visible blood mixed with mucus in an otherwise well-appearing infant, and symptoms usually resolve within 1–2 weeks of eliminating the offending protein. Persistent black, tarry stools would be atypical for resolved proctocolitis, so if the stool is truly black and tarry (melena), I should reconsider whether there is upper GI bleeding or another source of blood being digested in the gut [^279b4e13] [^8fdd7c28].

> Hold on, I should verify medication and supplement sources of black discoloration. Iron drops, multivitamins with iron, and iron-fortified cereals frequently cause dark green to black stools due to ferrous iron oxidation; this is a recognized, nonpathologic effect and does not indicate gastrointestinal bleeding by itself, so I need to ask explicitly about any iron-containing products the infant is receiving [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I am not missing a more serious cause. Melena from upper GI bleeding is uncommon in otherwise healthy infants but can occur with significant esophageal, gastric, or duodenal bleeding; it typically looks sticky, tarry, and malodorous, and would usually be accompanied by concerning systemic signs. Given this infant is a former 34-week preemie, I should also keep NEC in the differential if there is abdominal distension, bilious emesis, lethargy, or pneumatosis on imaging, but isolated black stool without these features is not NEC [^eaa29703] [^ac987daf].

> Let me consider the current feeding regimen and whether it aligns with best practice. Puramino is an amino acid–based formula appropriate for infants with severe or persistent non–IgE-mediated CMPA, and rice cereal is a common early solid introduced around 4–6 months. However, I should confirm that the cereal is iron-fortified, because that would directly explain dark stools, and I should also remember that rice is a recognized FPIES trigger in some infants, so if new GI symptoms emerged with cereal, I should reassess for FPIES rather than proctocolitis [^e8163395] [^f72daf1e].

> Next, I should review a practical, stepwise plan. First, I will examine the stool myself to distinguish dark green/black from true melena and check for mucus or visible blood. Second, I will obtain a focused history on iron supplements, iron-fortified cereal, and any new foods or medications. Third, I will perform a guaiac test if there is any doubt about occult blood; if negative, iron-related discoloration is most likely. Fourth, I will monitor growth, feeding tolerance, and any new red flags such as vomiting, distension, or lethargy. Finally, if melena is confirmed or red flags appear, I will escalate to urgent pediatric evaluation and consider imaging or specialty referral [^notfound].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite appropriate formula choice? If there is ongoing hematochezia or poor growth, I should double-check the diagnosis and consider whether an amino acid formula is truly necessary or if there is an alternate diagnosis; ESPGHAN emphasizes avoiding overdiagnosis of CMPA and using controlled challenges to confirm the diagnosis when stable, which can prevent unnecessary prolonged use of specialized formulas and guide safe reintroduction timelines [^9b293df3] [^aedf25d3].

> In summary, I should confirm that the black stool is most likely benign iron-related discoloration from the formula and/or iron-fortified rice cereal, while remaining vigilant for atypical features that would suggest upper GI bleeding or an alternate diagnosis. If the infant is thriving, feeding well, and has no red flags, continued observation with routine follow-up is reasonable; if melena is confirmed or concerning features arise, prompt evaluation is warranted [^notfound].

Black stools in a 4-month-old, 34-week premature infant with milk protein allergy on Puramino and rice cereal are most often due to **iron from the formula or cereal** [^notfound], which darkens stool and is harmless. Less commonly, black stool can signal **upper GI bleeding** (melena) from ongoing allergy-related inflammation or an unrelated issue. If the stool is tarry, foul-smelling, or accompanied by vomiting, anemia, or poor growth, **urgent evaluation is needed** [^0f3deb38]. Otherwise, monitor and discuss with your pediatrician at the next visit.

---

## Possible causes of black stool in infants

### 1. Iron supplementation or iron-fortified formulas

- **Iron oxidation**: Iron in Puramino or rice cereal can oxidize in the gut, causing dark green or black stools — a common, benign finding [^notfound].
- **Common in preterm infants**: Preemies often receive iron to prevent anemia, increasing the chance of dark stools [^notfound].

---

### 2. Gastrointestinal bleeding (melena)

- **Upper GI bleeding**: Black, tarry stools can reflect digested blood from the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum [^notfound].
- **Allergy-related inflammation**: Milk protein allergy can cause mucosal injury and bleeding, though melena is less common than visible blood [^279b4e13].
- **Other causes**: Rarely, congenital anomalies, infections, or medications cause bleeding [^notfound].

---

### 3. Dietary factors

Rice cereal may transiently change stool color or consistency; **black discoloration is uncommon** but can occur with iron fortification or minor GI irritation.

---

## Clinical significance of black stool in infants with milk protein allergy

In infants with milk protein allergy, **black stool is usually due to iron** rather than ongoing bleeding. However, persistent or recurrent black stools warrant evaluation for **continued mucosal injury** or other GI pathology [^9b293df3].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Seek **immediate medical attention** if any of the following occur:

| **Symptom** | **Indication** |
|-|-|
| Tarry, foul-smelling stools | Possible melena (upper GI bleeding) |
| Vomiting blood (hematemesis) | Active GI bleeding |
| Signs of anemia (pallor, lethargy, poor feeding) | Significant blood loss |
| Poor weight gain or failure to thrive | Chronic GI disease or malabsorption |
| Severe abdominal distension or pain | Obstruction or serious GI pathology |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

If melena is suspected, your pediatrician may order:

- **Stool occult blood test**: Confirm presence of blood [^notfound].
- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Assess for anemia or infection [^8a6087a8].
- **Basic metabolic panel**: Evaluate electrolytes and renal function [^notfound].
- **Abdominal ultrasound or X-ray**: Evaluate for structural abnormalities or obstruction [^ac987daf].
- **Endoscopy**: Rarely needed if bleeding persists or other pathology is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **cause**:

- **Iron-related discoloration**: No intervention needed; reassure and continue current feeding [^notfound].
- **Ongoing allergy-related bleeding**: Confirm formula adherence, consider strict maternal elimination if breastfeeding, or switch to an amino acid formula if not already used [^e8163395].
- **Other GI pathology**: Treat the underlying condition (e.g. medications, surgery) as indicated [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and long-term implications

Most infants with milk protein allergy **outgrow it by 1–3 years**; dark stools from iron are harmless and do not predict long-term problems. Persistent bleeding or poor growth needs ongoing follow-up to ensure resolution and adequate nutrition [^cfded648].

---

## Conclusion

Black stools in a 4-month-old preemie on Puramino and rice cereal are **most often from iron** and not dangerous. If the stool is tarry, foul-smelling, or accompanied by red flags, **seek prompt medical evaluation** to rule out bleeding or other pathology.

Participants

Subjects were randomized if they were aged < 13 months and had a clinical history or strong suspicion of an allergic reaction to cow's milk protein, based on a robust diagnostic work-up (Table 1) collectively designed by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians, comprising pediatric gastroenterology, allergy, and immunology specialists. The defined inclusion criteria (Table 1) included a negative specific IgE test (ImmunoCAP), and/or a negative skin-prick test with cow's milk protein, if a test was performed (testing was not mandatory per protocol). In addition, at study entry, the subjects had at least one of the following (GI) symptoms related to inclusion of cow's milk protein in their diet: faltering growth; frequent regurgitation or vomiting; extended periods of diarrhea with a negative stool examination (negative microbiology and virology laboratory tests); soft stool constipation; blood in stool; iron-deficiency anemia due to occult or macroscopic blood loss in stools not due to infection or dietary insufficiency; endoscopically confirmed eosinophilic enteropathy; or persistent distress or colic (> 3 h per day at least 3 days per week over a 3-week period). Infants were excluded for the following reasons: birth weight < 2,500 g, < 37 weeks' gestation requiring specific premature infant formula at study entry, severe concurrent illness, functional GI symptoms without suspicion of atopy and food allergy, immune, autoimmune, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, acute or chronic diarrhea secondary to a confirmed infectious gastroenteritis, behavioral disorders with food aversion or food phobia, GI surgery, syndromes commonly associated with functional GI disorders, and the use of probiotics, systemic antibiotics, or antimycotic drugs 4 weeks preceding study entry.

Two weeks after randomization, symptom resolution was evaluated and subjects with persistent symptoms were reassessed by the investigator, and only subjects with suspicion of, or confirmed, non-IgE CMA continued in the study. Subjects not eligible at reassessment were withdrawn (Figure 1).

The non-randomized, HBR group comprised infants who were exclusively breastfed until 7 months of age. Healthy subjects of 7 months or older did consume solids, which were recorded in dietary diaries. In addition, the subjects did not have any concurrent illness or clinical history of allergy, did not receive any treatment or nutritional intervention, and were within a similar age range to subjects in the randomized groups. Infants in the HBR group were prospectively recruited from selected study centers and local community centers.

### What is known about cow's milk protein allergy in preterm infants? [^4e9fe5fc]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background: Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is well described in term infants, as opposed to preterm infants. In preterm infants, CMPA shares many gastrointestinal symptoms with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Objectives: To evaluate the presentation of CMPA in preterm infants and to investigate the different diagnostic and therapeutic options. Materials and Methods: We searched for the relevant literature using the medical databases PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. We performed a post hoc analysis on the 25 case reports included in this study. Results: Literature was scarce and heterogeneous. The majority of preterm infants with CMPA were exposed to bovine-based milk proteins before the development of symptoms. The most common clinical manifestations were bloody stools, vomiting, and abdominal distension. Of the 25 cases, only 7 (28%) retained human milk in their diet after diagnosis. In the larger studies, no study has human milk as primary feeding choice after diagnosis. Conclusions: Preterm infants exposed to a type of cow's milk-based formula in their first days of life have a higher risk of developing CMPA. Most of the preterm infants are no longer fed with human milk after the diagnosis of CMPA is made, which is in contrast with current nutrition guidelines in preterm infants. We strongly advocate that human milk with mothers on a cow's milk-free diet is the first choice of feed after the diagnosis of CMPA. Prospective studies are necessary to obtain more information regarding clinical presentation, diagnostic tools, and therapeutic approaches.

### Allergic enterocolitis presenting as recurrent necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm neonates [^8bb22916]. Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

An uncommon clinical entity mimicking necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is allergic enterocolitis secondary to cow's milk protein allergy. Although milk protein allergy is the most common food allergy among infants and young children, the incidence and prevalence of this disease entity presenting as enterocolitis in neonates is not well documented. We report this case of milk protein-associated allergic enterocolitis to highlight the unusual recurrent presentation as NEC, (with recurrent pneumatosis, bloody stools) managed successfully with modification of milk formula.

### An extensively hydrolysed rice protein-based formula in the management of infants with cow's milk protein allergy: preliminary results after 1 month [^55d135d4]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend extensively hydrolysed cow's milk protein formulas (eHF) in the treatment of infants diagnosed with cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA). Extensively hydrolysed rice protein infant formulas (eRHFs) have recently become available, and could offer a valid alternative.

Methods

A prospective trial was performed to evaluate the clinical tolerance of a new eRHF in infants with a confirmed CMPA. Patients were followed for 1month. Clinical tolerance of the eRHF was evaluated with a symptom-based score (SBS) and growth (weight and length) was monitored.

Results

Thirty-nine infants (mean age 3.4months, range 0.5-6months) diagnosed with CMPA were enrolled. All infants tolerated the eRHF and experienced a normal growth.

Conclusions

In accordance with current guidelines, this eRHF is tolerated by more than 90% of children with proven CMPA with a 95% CI, and is an adequate alternative to cow's milk-based eHF.

Trial Registration Number

### Food allergy: a practice parameter update-2014 [^279b4e13]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Dietary protein-induced proctitis/proctocolitis — an infant condition — typically presents in generally healthy infants with visible specks or streaks of blood mixed with mucus in the stool, with IgE to specific foods generally absent. Milk protein is most commonly implicated, although multiple food allergens can be involved, and symptoms resolve with dietary avoidance, which might include maternal dietary restriction in breast-fed infants; the condition typically resolves during infancy.

### An ESPGHAN position paper on the diagnosis, management, and prevention of cow's milk allergy [^9b293df3]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

A previous guideline on cow's milk allergy (CMA) developed by the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) was published in 2012. This position paper provides an update on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of CMA with focus on gastrointestinal manifestations. All systematic reviews and meta-analyses regarding prevalence, pathophysiology, symptoms, and diagnosis of CMA published after the previous ESPGHAN document were considered. Medline was searched from inception until May 2022 for topics that were not covered in the previous document. After reaching consensus on the manuscript, statements were formulated and voted on each of them with a score between 0 and 9. A score of ≥ 6 was arbitrarily considered as agreement. Available evidence on the role of dietary practice in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of CMA was updated and recommendations formulated. CMA in exclusively breastfed infants exists, but is uncommon and suffers from over-diagnosis. CMA is also over-diagnosed in formula and mixed fed infants. Changes in stool characteristics, feeding aversion, or occasional spots of blood in stool are common and in general should not be considered as diagnostic of CMA, irrespective of preceding consumption of cow's milk. Over-diagnosis of CMA occurs much more frequently than under-diagnosis; both have potentially harmful consequences. Therefore, the necessity of a challenge test after a short diagnostic elimination diet of 2–4 weeks is recommended as the cornerstone of the diagnosis. This position paper contains sections on nutrition, growth, cost, and quality of life.

### The fifty billion dollar question: does formula cause necrotizing enterocolitis? [^1bdfc9e5]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Bovine milk protein

The protein source for preterm infant formulas is bovine milk. Allergy to and intolerance of bovine milk protein occurs in 2% of term infants with symptoms ranging from mild to severe with enterocolitis and shock. In preterm infants, bovine protein intolerance can present with hematochezia and even pneumatosis intestinalis making the distinction between NEC and bovine protein intolerance difficult at times; generally, preterm infants with the latter are less ill, more likely to have recurrent episodes, have higher eosinophil counts and lower procalcitonin levels and demonstrate recurrence of hematochezia with re-introduction of intact bovine milk protein. Many animal models include bovine formula as a trigger which is necessary but not sufficient to induce a NEC-like illness. In preterm piglets, methods of processing bovine protein and duration of storage influence the impact of formula feeding on intestinal development and NEC-like illness. In mice, NEC severity is similar whether the mice receive an amino acid formula (no intact proteins or peptides) or a preterm formula with intact bovine protein. Data from preterm infants suggesting that bovine milk protein is a trigger for NEC are lacking. It has been proposed that incomplete digestion of dietary protein in the preterm intestine stimulates dysbiosis, inflammation, and NEC, however proteomic analysis comparing stools from preterm infants just prior to NEC onset to controls did not show differences suggestive of maldigestion. If intact bovine proteins or peptides commonly trigger NEC, one would expect an extensively hydrolyzed formula to decrease NEC risk. A recent meta-analysis of 11 small clinical trials (665 preterm infants) comparing extensively hydrolyzed formula to standard formula found no difference in NEC. Human milk contains intact bovine protein unless this is removed from the maternal diet. In a small study, 120 mothers providing milk to their preterm infants were randomized to dairy-free diet vs standard diet with no difference in stage 2–3 NEC between groups.

### Food allergy: a practice parameter update-2014 [^3208f062]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Non–IgE-mediated food allergy (food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome [FPIES], allergic proctocolitis, enteropathy) — diagnosis should use careful history (including diet records), physical exam, response to trial elimination diets, and oral food challenges (OFCs); acute FPIES presents with repetitive projectile emesis in 1 to 3 hours after ingestion with potential lethargy, ashen appearance, hypothermia, and in severe cases increased white blood cell and platelet counts and methemoglobinemia; allergic proctocolitis shows blood and mucus in stool in a healthy thriving infant with 60% affected while exclusively breast-fed; food protein–induced enteropathy presents with protracted diarrhea during the first 9 months of life, typically the first 1 to 2 months, often within weeks after cow's milk formula introduction, with more than 50% having vomiting and failure to thrive, moderate anemia present in 20% to 69% of infants with cow's milk protein–induced enteropathy, and occult blood found in 5% of patients.

### Rapid resolution of milk protein intolerance in infancy [^445e50a5]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Infants with milk protein intolerance are usually switched to a casein hydrolysate or amino acid-based formula, which they continue to receive until 1 year of age, when they are rechallenged with a cow's-milk or soy protein formula. To investigate whether some of these infants actually become tolerant sooner, this study gathered preliminary data for establishing an empirical timetable for the resolution of milk protein intolerance.

Methods

This prospective, longitudinal cohort study enrolled infants < 4 months of age receiving either breast milk or a cow's-milk or casein hydrolysate formula who presented to a pediatric subspecialty practice during an 18-month period and had a positive stool guaiac test. After having been successfully switched to a casein hydrolysate or amino acid formula, infants who had guaiac-negative stools for at least 2 consecutive months were rechallenged with the formula that had necessitated the most recent switch.

Results

Of the 25 patients enrolled in the study, 16 completed the food challenge and data collection protocol. Negative stool guaiac tests following rechallenge indicated resolution of milk protein intolerance by the time subjects reached an average age of 6.7 ± 1.0 months (mean ± standard deviation). By the age of 7 months, milk protein intolerance was resolved in 12 of the 16 infants, the remainder having resolved by 10 months.

Conclusions

It may be reasonable to treat infants with milk protein intolerance for 2 to 3 months with a hypoallergenic formula, then rechallenge them at 6 months of age, usually without causing recurrence of the hematochezia. Rechallenging before 12 months old could result in cost savings to families and insurers.

### Prospective assessment of pediatrician-diagnosed food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis by gross or occult blood [^7ecb755f]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) is an early and common manifestation of food allergy, yet its epidemiology and relationship to other allergic diseases remain unclear.

Objective

To prospectively define the incidence of FPIAP as it is being diagnosed clinically in the community and to identify factors associated with its development.

Methods

A total of 1003 of 1162 eligible serial healthy newborn infants recruited from a single suburban pediatrics practice were followed prospectively for the diagnosis of FPIAP. Investigators reviewed each case to confirm prespecified inclusion criteria, including documented gross or occult blood in the stool.

Results

A total of 903 infants were analyzed (46% females, 89% term, 32% caesarian-section, 9% neonatal antibiotics); 153 cases met inclusion criteria, a cumulative incidence of 17%, while 63 (7%) had gross blood. Infants initially fed both breast milk and formula were 61% less likely to develop FPIAP compared with those exclusively formula-fed (hazard ratio, 0.39; P = 0.005). Breast milk and formula at any point during the first 4 months were also associated with lower risk compared with exclusive formula or exclusive breast milk (hazard ratio, 0.44; P = 0.005; hazard ratio, 0.62; P = 0.0497). Eczema (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–2.2; P = 0.02) or a first-degree relative with food allergies (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–2.8; P = 0.005) were among risk factors for FPIAP development.

Conclusions

The prospectively defined incidence of FPIAP when diagnosed clinically by community pediatricians without challenge is markedly higher than published estimates. Combination feeding of formula and breast milk is associated with the lowest rate of FPIAP in this population.

### Clinical features and clinical course of food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis: 10-year experience of a tertiary medical center [^82215cb7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) is a food allergy characterized by bloody stools in well-appearing breast-fed infants.

Objective

To determine the clinical course of FPIAP and the factors affecting the development of tolerance.

Methods

Over a 10-year period, patients with a diagnosis of FPIAP who were followed at the outpatient Allergy-Immunology clinic in a tertiary care children's hospital in Turkey were retrospectively analyzed.

Results

The frequency of FPIAP was 0.18% among 64,549 patients. The median age of symptom onset was 2 months (interquartile range, 1.0–3.5 months), and the median age of tolerance development was 12 months (interquartile range, 8.0–17.21 months). The occurrence of symptoms in the neonatal period was associated with a history of premature birth (odds ratio, 3.75; 95% CI, 1.33–10.59; P = 0.031) and neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization (odds ratio, 4.72; 95% CI, 1.78–12.53; P = 0.002). Use of a cow's milk-based formula was associated with a higher risk of the onset of symptoms after 1 month (odds ratio, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.19–6.07; P = 0.016). The use of an amino acid-based formula and the presence of diarrhea at admission were associated with later development of tolerance (P = 0.023 and P < .001, respectively). An IgE-mediated reaction was observed during oral food challenge testing in 6% of the patients.

Conclusions

The manifestations of FPIAP appeared earlier in premature infants and later in infants using formula. The use of amino acid-based formula and having had diarrhea were associated with delayed tolerance.

### Cow's milk protein allergy in term and preterm infants: clinical manifestations, immunologic pathophysiology, and management strategies [^4d1e0037]. NeoReviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Cow's milk allergy is a common food allergy among infants. Symptoms of cow's milk allergy are wide-ranging and depend on the mechanism involved. There are immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated, non-IgE-mediated, and mixed mechanisms of food allergy. Symptoms of IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy may be mild or may progress to anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening. Non-IgE-mediated allergy includes food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP), food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, food protein-induced enteropathy, and Heiner syndrome (pulmonary hemosiderosis). These diagnoses comprise about half of all cow's milk allergies. The most common manifestation of cow's milk allergy in infants is FPIAP. FPIAP is commonly seen in healthy, full-term infants who present with rectal bleeding and are otherwise well-appearing. This can occur in both formula-fed and exclusively breastfed infants. Food proteins secreted in maternal breast milk can contribute to the development of these symptoms. Maternal cow's milk elimination diet is often successful in helping resolve symptoms. A period of reintroduction of cow's milk resulting in re-emergence of symptoms in stable asymptomatic infants is an excellent diagnostic tool to confirm a cow's milk allergy. Preterm infants are susceptible to food allergy, as demonstrated from several case reports of necrotizing enterocolitis-like illnesses that responded clinically to cow's milk elimination. Further study is needed about food allergy in the preterm infant population.

### Safety and tolerance assessment of milk fat globule membrane-enriched infant formulas in healthy term Chinese infants: a randomised multicenter controlled trial [^b83d4fe8]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Digestive tolerance

The stool color in all three groups gradually and significantly changed from golden to light yellow during the study (Fig. 4 A, P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in frequency of stool color changes between two formula-fed groups throughout the study, with the exception that the MF group had significantly higher frequency of green stools at 12 months (odds ratio 8.92, P = 0.040, Fig. 4 A). However, the two formula-fed groups had significantly lower frequency of golden stool and higher frequency of light-yellow stool compared with the BFR group over the first year of age (odds ratio 0.21–0.47, P < 0.05–0.001). The two formula-fed groups also had significantly higher frequency of green stool compared with the BFR group at 4 months and 6 months (odds ratio 2.78–5.47, P < 0.05–0.001, Fig. 4 A), but these differences were no longer apparent at 8 months (P > 0.05). There was a low frequency of blackish green stools across all groups throughout the study. The rate of change of stool color in all three groups was relatively faster from 42 days to 8 months, and slower from 8 and 12 months of age (Fig. 4 A).

### Detection and management of milk allergy: Delphi consensus study [^9f8b3428]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There is significant overdiagnosis of milk allergy in young children in some countries, leading to unnecessary use of specialized formula. This guidance, developed by experts without commercial ties to the formula industry, aims to reduce milk allergy overdiagnosis and support carers of children with suspected milk allergy.

Methods

Delphi study involving two rounds of anonymous consensus building and an open meeting between January and July 2021. Seventeen experts in general practice, nutrition, midwifery, health visiting, lactation support and relevant areas of paediatrics participated, located in Europe, North America, Middle East, Africa, Australia and Asia. Five authors of previous milk allergy guidelines and seven parents provided feedback.

Findings

Participants agreed on 38 essential recommendations through consensus. Recommendations highlighted the importance of reproducibility and specificity for diagnosing milk allergy in children with acute or delayed symptoms temporally related to milk protein ingestion; and distinguished between children directly consuming milk protein and exclusively breastfed infants. Consensus was reached that maternal dietary restriction is not usually necessary to manage milk allergy, and that for exclusively breastfed infants with chronic symptoms, milk allergy diagnosis should only be considered in specific, rare circumstances. Consensus was reached that milk allergy diagnosis does not need to be considered for stool changes, aversive feeding or occasional spots of blood in stool, if there is no temporal relationship with milk protein ingestion. When compared with previous guidelines, these consensus recommendations resulted in more restrictive criteria for detecting milk allergy and a more limited role for maternal dietary exclusions and specialized formula.

Interpretation

These new milk allergy recommendations from non-conflicted, multidisciplinary experts advise narrower criteria, more prominent support for breastfeeding and less use of specialized formula, compared with current guidelines.

The World Allergy Organization Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for milk protein allergy, more specifically with respect to hydrolyzed infant formulas, WAO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering an extensively hydrolyzed (cow's milk) formula or a hydrolyzed rice formula as the first choice, an amino-acid formula as the second choice, and a soy formula as the third choice for infants with IgE-mediated or non-IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy not being breastfed. Consider offering either a formula without a probiotic or an extensively hydrolyzed cow's milk formula containing Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus.

### Solid-food introduction in infants diagnosed as having a cow' s-milk protein-induced enterocolitis [^f5f81554]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

In a prior retrospective analysis of 32 infants diagnosed with cow's-milk protein-induced enterocolitis (CMPIE), gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were observed with the introduction of milk-free infant cereal. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to compare the incidence of new GI symptoms with the introduction of either milk-free infant rice cereal or carrots as the first complementary food at 6 months of age in infants previously diagnosed as having CMPIE.

Patients and Methods

Thirty-nine infants were enrolled in the study. Twenty were randomized to start with pureed carrots and 19 were randomized to start with milk-free infant rice cereal. GI signs and symptoms developing within 2 weeks were recorded.

Results

No significant differences were noticed in the incidence of new GI symptoms and the change in the frequency of GI symptoms upon solid-food introduction, whether it was carrots or milk-free infant rice cereal. A high overall incidence rate (47%) of new GI symptoms was observed in the whole cohort. The mean number of days for onset of new symptoms was 6. The most common GI signs and symptoms observed were related to alteration of stool characteristics. Breast-feeding was not shown to have a protective effect on the development of new GI symptoms during solid-food introduction.

Conclusions

Many infants with CMPIE will develop GI signs and symptoms following the introduction of solid food, whether milk-free infant rice cereal or carrots are introduced, and their onset may be delayed.

### A novel infant formula milk with added long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids from single-cell sources: a study of growth, satisfaction and health [^34e045d7]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the growth, feeding and health of babies fed a novel infant formula milk with added long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPs) produced from single-cell sources, at concentrations similar to those found in mature breast milk.

Design

Randomized double-blind control trial.

Subjects

One-hundred and forty healthy, full-term infants of birth weight 2.5–4.5 kg born at the Maternity Department, East Glamorgan General Hospital, Wales, whose mothers had already decided to bottle feed.

Interventions

Subjects were randomized to two groups; one (control group) to receive a standard formula milk and the other to receive the trial milk with added LCPs. Milks were supplied in a double-blind fashion and given for the first 12 weeks of life. Anthropometric measurements were made at recruitment, 3 months, 6 months and 1 y. Feeding diaries were completed at 6 weeks and 3 months, and a parental record was kept of any ill health suffered by the subjects during the first year of life.

Results

Of 140 infants recruited, 31 did not complete the protocol. Small but statistically significant differences were found only in the subscapular skinfold thickness at 6 weeks and 3 months, that in the trial group being slightly higher, but unlikely to be of any clinical importance. No differences were found in the feeding patterns of the infants in the two groups. Stool patterns were similar, as were the frequencies of illness and allergy.

Conclusions

This study supports the view that LCPs from single-cell sources do not have detrimental effects on the growth, feeding and general health of infants.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) — chronic phenotype and OFC interpretation: General criteria are provided for patients with chronic FPIES, but given the paucity of published reports of chronic FPIES, specific major and minor criteria could not be established at this time. For severe chronic FPIES, regular ingestion of the offending food (eg, infant formula) leads to intermittent but progressive vomiting and diarrhea (occasionally with blood) sometimes with dehydration and metabolic acidosis, whereas milder chronic FPIES from lower doses (eg, solid foods or food allergens in breast milk) causes intermittent vomiting and/or diarrhea with poor weight gain/FTT but without dehydration or metabolic acidosis. It is important to recognize 2 distinct hallmarks of chronic FPIES: asymptomatic status and normal growth when the trigger food is eliminated and recurrence of repetitive FPIES symptoms on reintroduction, and criteria for interpreting OFC results differ in the degree of neutrophilia and remove stool laboratory findings.

### Effect of positional management and milk type on digestive health: a retrospective randomised controlled study on colic in preterm infants [^32679c59]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

The study related to the type of milk fed in this study showed that there was a significant difference in the degree of colic and stool type of preterm infants between the different milk type management groups as well. Human milk, as a complex food matrix, can influence the stability of the microbial composition of the infant gut by enhancing the growth of specific bacteria or limiting the growth of others. In addition to affecting intestinal stability, human milk contains a higher content of unsaturated fatty acids, lipases and bile. Unsaturated fatty acids and lipases can promote blood lipid metabolism and lipid decomposition in the gastrointestinal tract of preterm infants. Bile can promote the emulsification of fat into fine particles, facilitating its absorption by the body. While hydrolysed milk powder does break down large molecules into smaller fragments, the shortcomings in taste and the reduced metabolic substances still significantly impact the appetite of preterm infants, making it difficult to fully replace human milk. The preterm infants in the human milk group also had mostly normal stools. Human milk maintains the stability of the intestinal flora and promotes intestinal peristalsis, which also effectively avoids the symptoms of constipation and foul-smelling stools. Studies have shown that formula is one of the major allergens for infants and that the proteins in it are an important factor in the development of infant colic, which causes diarrhoea and vomiting in infants. Severe cow's milk allergy may cause allergic colitis in infants. Based on this, lactation as much as possible while reducing the use of formula is an effective model of care in order to alleviate the symptoms of colic in preterm infants.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Feeding and maternal diet guidance in cow's milk (CM)/soy-induced FPIES indicates that infants can be breast-fed or use a hypoallergenic formula, such as casein-based extensively hydrolyzed formula, and when possible breast-feeding should be continued; 10% to 20% might require an amino acid–based formula (AAF). The risk of co-reactivity to CM and soy is approximately 20% to 40% of US patients; goat and sheep milk are not recommended in CM-induced FPIES. Infants with chronic FPIES usually return to their usual state of health within 3 to 10 days of switching to a hypoallergenic formula, although in severe cases temporary bowel rest and intravenous fluids might be necessary. Summary Statement 21 states: Do not recommend routine maternal dietary elimination of offending triggers while breast-feeding if the infant is thriving and remains asymptomatic, with Strength of recommendation: Moderate; Evidence strength: III-IV; Evidence grade: C, and notes that the majority of infants do not react to food allergens present in maternal breast milk. It is also possible that milks from donkeys or camels might be tolerated in CM-induced FPIES.

### Effect of maturation at birth on the clinical features of neonatal cow's milk protein allergy: a retrospective study [^6a18e1fa]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Neonatal immune regulation transitions from fetal immunity and varies with maturation status, but its role in neonatal cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) remains unknown. We studied the association between maturation status at birth and neonatal CMPA. Clinical and laboratory data of neonates presenting with CMPA symptoms were retrospectively collected from two tertiary hospitals. Patients were assessed according to gestational age at birth: preterm, late-preterm, and full-term. Fifty-five infants (26 females, 14 preterm, 15 late-preterm, and 26 full-term) were included; 44 were negative for milk-specific immunoglobulin E. Neonatal CMPA was common during moderately premature periods. Preterm infants exhibited longer latency from initial CM exposure to disease onset, lower incidence of bloody stool, and absence of elevated monocyte counts. However, immunoreactivity to CM antigens was retained in all infants. Neonatal CMPA features varied with infant maturation status at birth. Our results improve the understanding of intestinal immunity development, fetal/neonatal immune regulation, and CMPA pathogenesis.

### Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome: case presentations and management lessons [^14186a64]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Enterocolitis induced in infants by cow's milk and/or soy protein has been recognized for decades. Symptoms typically begin in the first month of life in association with failure to thrive and may progress to acidemia and shock. Symptoms resolve after the causal protein is removed from the diet but recur with a characteristic symptom pattern on re-exposure. Approximately 2 hours after reintroduction of the protein, vomiting ensues, followed by an elevation of the peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocyte count, diarrhea, and possibly lethargy and hypotension. The disorder is generally not associated with detectable food-specific IgE antibody. There are increasing reports of additional causal foods, prolonged clinical courses, and onset outside of early infancy, leading to description of a food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome. The disorder poses numerous diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The purpose of this report is to delineate the characteristic clinical features and review the possible pathophysiologic basis to frame a rational strategy toward management.

Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) was first described in detail in the late 20th century as a non-IgE-mediated food allergy characterized by delayed gastrointestinal symptoms after ingestion of a trigger food. Although the initial case series reported infants reacting to cow's milk- and soy-based formulas, we now recognize that FPIES affects patients across the age spectrum. This brief review highlights our evolving understanding of FPIES with a discussion of triggers, epidemiology, food challenges, and pathophysiology.

It further advises to consider following hemoglobin and albumin levels if continued moderate degree of blood loss (blood is visible) in stools and to consider use of pancreatic enzymes for the mother, which can be dosed one or two to four with meals as needed dependent on the baby's symptoms. For severe cases with impaired growth, decreasing hemoglobin level, or decreasing serum albumin level, the use of a hypoallergenic formula may be considered, and referral to a specialist should be considered.

### An extensively hydrolysed rice protein-based formula in the management of infants with cow's milk protein allergy: preliminary results after 1 month [^757088d2]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

What is already known about this topic

Extensive cow's milk-based hydrolysed formulas are the first choice in the treatment of cow's milk protein allergy.
Extensive hydrolysates are not everywhere available, are expensive, have a poor palatability, and some infants are still allergic to the cow's milk peptides present in the hydrolysate.
Soy infant formula has been proposed as second option, but the negative perception of the high levels of phytoestrogens present in soy hampers their use. Moreover, 10–15% of the infants allergic to cow's milk also do not tolerate soy.

What this study adds

An extensive rice protein-based hydrolysed formula is shown to be effective in the treatment of cow's milk protein allergy.
Since rice is much cheaper and has a better palatability than cow's milk-based extensive hydrolysates, and since it does not contain phytoestrogens, it may become a first option in the treatment of cow's milk protein allergy if the efficacy and acceptability are confirmed in future studies.

### ABM clinical protocol # 24: allergic proctocolitis in the exclusively breastfed infant [^d9cea00a]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

Allergic proctocolitis — severe suspected cases: If severe allergic proctocolitis is suspected based on failure to thrive, moderate to large amounts of blood in the stool with decreasing hemoglobin, or protein-losing enteropathy, the infant should be referred to a pediatric sub-specialist (allergist or pediatric gastroenterologist) for diagnosis and treatment (III). While awaiting the appointment, begin an elimination diet in the mother, continuing dairy and soy eliminations as suggested for all breastfeeding mothers and adding calcium supplementation (1,000 mg/day divided into several doses) (II-2). In the majority of patients, it is reasonable and safe to continue breastfeeding through the elimination process while awaiting the appointment; however, if the hemoglobin or albumin level is significantly low (based on age-dependent published norms), then the use of a hypoallergenic formula may be considered (III).

### Anti-TNF α antibody infliximab treatment for an infant with fistulising Crohn's disease [^4b582c3b]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

A female infant presented at the age of 4 weeks with dyschezia and bloody streaking of stools which did not improve on elemental formula for proposed cow's milk protein allergy. At 6 months of age perianal ulceration appeared which evolved into multiple fistulas opening into the perineum. A diagnosis of infantile Crohn's disease was made after colonoscopy and histopathology examination and exclusion of other conditions. An 8 week trial of total parenteral nutrition, in addition to corticosteroids, salazopyrine, metronidazole, and azathioprine failed to arrest deterioration of the perianal fistulas. Treatment with the anti-TNFα antibody infliximab was started at 5 mg/kg/dose at 9 months of age. She was given three doses at 0, 2, and 6 weeks, respectively. This resulted in significant healing of her fistulas and cessation of fistula output. This improvement was sustained at the time of last follow-up 10 months after treatment.

### Cow's milk allergy and neonatal short bowel syndrome: comorbidity or true association? [^8f20ae8b]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Neonatal short bowel syndrome (SBS) follows early intestinal resections that may expose the children to increased intestinal contact with undigested food proteins and to the risk of food allergy. We report three consecutive cases of cow's milk allergy (CMA) in SBS infants.

Subjects/Methods

We reviewed three cases of CMA developed in 37 children with neonatal SBS followed up in the last 10 years. The setting of the survey was the Gastroenterology-Hepatology and Nutrition Unit of the Pediatric Hospital 'Bambino Gesù' in Rome. The diagnosis of CMA was based on the oral food challenge and was supported by the results of the skin prick tests (SPT) and/or the specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E.

Results

Two patients had persistent liquid stools and periodic episodes of vomiting when they were fed with an intact milk protein-based formula, that disappeared with extensively hydrolyzed formula and amino-acid-based formulae, respectively. The third patient developed maculo-papular rash, flushing and angioedema, when he was introduced a regular formula. The challenge-confirmed CMA in all patients. Positive specific IgE for milk proteins was documented in all the three patients. Two out of the three patients had positive familial history for allergy and positive SPT.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that the SBS patients require a careful clinical monitoring of the tolerance for the cow's milk proteins, because CMA could be more frequent than expected. A prospective regular assessment for the potential cow milk sensitization by SPT and specific IgE may clarify the nature of the association and support the clinical surveillance. Multicenter studies are required to better evaluate this comorbidity.

### ABM clinical protocol # 24: allergic proctocolitis in the exclusively breastfed infant [^8fdd7c28]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

Allergic proctocolitis in exclusively breastfed infants — clinical presentation indicates that the most common symptoms associated with food-induced allergic disorders are cutaneous reactions (eczema) and gastrointestinal symptoms, with the most common gastrointestinal symptom being the development of bloody stools. Onset usually occurs between 2 and 6 weeks of age, although some have reported symptoms beginning as early as the first day of life. Severe manifestations of food allergy are extremely rare. Dietary proteins excreted in the mother's milk are responsible for the majority of cases and induce an inflammatory response of the rectum and distal sigmoid colon referred to as allergic proctocolitis, and affected breastfed infants are generally well appearing aside from blood in the stool. Blood loss is typically modest but can occasionally produce anemia and/or hypoalbuminemia, very rare cases may lead to failure to thrive, and systemic manifestations such as emesis, dramatic diarrhea, or abdominal distention are rare and may suggest other allergic gastrointestinal disorders. Additional laboratory studies may be considered but are often unnecessary.

### Non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food allergy [^cfded648]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food-induced allergic disorders (non-IgE-GI-FAs) account for an unknown proportion of food allergies and include food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP), and food protein-induced enteropathy (FPE). Non-IgE-GI-FAs are separate clinical entities but have many overlapping clinical and histologic features among themselves and with eosinophilic gastroenteropathies. Over the past decade, FPIES has emerged as the most actively studied non-IgE-GI-FA, potentially because of acute and distinct clinical features. FPIAP remains among the common causes of rectal bleeding in infants, while classic infantile FPE is rarely diagnosed. The overall most common allergens are cow's milk and soy; in patients with FPIES, rice and oat are also common. The most prominent clinical features of FPIES are repetitive emesis, pallor, and lethargy; chronic FPIES can lead to failure to thrive. FPIAP manifests with bloody stools in well-appearing young breast-fed or formula-fed infants. Features of FPE are nonbloody diarrhea, malabsorption, protein-losing enteropathy, hypoalbuminemia, and failure to thrive. Non-IgE-GI-FAs have a favorable prognosis; the majority resolve by 1 year in patients with FPIAP, 1 to 3 years in patients with FPE, and 1 to 5 years in patients with FPIES, with significant differences regarding specific foods. There is an urgent need to better define the natural history of FPIES and the pathophysiology of non-IgE-GI-FAs to develop biomarkers and novel therapies.

### Evaluation of an amino acid-based formula in infants not responding to extensively hydrolyzed protein formula [^bc32ce13]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Nearly 2% to 3% of infants and children younger than 3 years have confirmed cow's milk protein allergy with multiple clinical presentations including atopic dermatitis (AD), diarrhea, and vomiting/spitting up. Although most infants with cow's milk protein allergy experience clinical improvement with the use of an extensively hydrolyzed (EH) formula, highly sensitive infants may require an amino acid-based formula. In this observational, prospective study, 30 infants (1–12 months of age) with a history of weight loss and persistent allergic manifestations while on an EH formula were provided an amino acid-based formula for 12 weeks. Mean weight gain (z score change) improved +0.43 ± 0.28 (mean ± standard deviation) after the 12-week feeding period. Improvement was observed for many allergic symptoms including significant decreases in AD severity (P = 0.02). These results indicate the new amino acid-based infant formula supported healthy weight gain and improvement in allergic manifestations in infants not responding to EH formulas.

### Dietary modifications for infantile colic [^928d1b1a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Infantile colic is typically defined as full-force crying for at least three hours per day, on at least three days per week, for at least three weeks. This condition appears to be more frequent in the first six weeks of life (prevalence range of 17% to 25%), depending on the specific location reported and definitions used, and it usually resolves by three months of age. The aetiopathogenesis of infantile colic is unclear but most likely multifactorial. A number of psychological, behavioural and biological components (food hypersensitivity, allergy or both; gut microflora and dysmotility) are thought to contribute to its manifestation. The role of diet as a component in infantile colic remains controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effects of dietary modifications for reducing colic in infants less than four months of age.

Search Methods

In July 2018 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 17 other databases and 2 trials registers. We also searched Google, checked and handsearched references and contacted study authors.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating the effects of dietary modifications, alone or in combination, for colicky infants younger than four months of age versus another intervention or placebo. We used specific definitions for colic, age of onset and the methods for performing the intervention. We defined 'modified diet' as any diet altered to include or exclude certain components.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was duration of crying, and secondary outcomes were response to intervention, frequency of crying episodes, parental/family quality of life, infant sleep duration, parental satisfaction and adverse effects.

Main Results

We included 15 RCTs involving 1121 infants (balanced numbers of boys and girls) aged 2 to 16 weeks. All studies were small and at high risk of bias across multiple design factors (e.g. selection, attrition). The studies covered a wide range of dietary interventions, and there was limited scope for meta-analysis. Using the GRADE approach, we assessed the quality of the evidence as very low. Low-allergen maternal diet versus a diet containing known potential allergens: one study (90 infants) found that 35/47 (74%) of infants responded to a low-allergen maternal diet, compared with 16/43 (37%) of infants on a diet containing known potential allergens. Low-allergen diet or soy milk formula versus dicyclomine hydrochloride: one study (120 infants) found that 10/15 (66.6%) breastfed babies responded to dicyclomine hydrochloride, compared with 24/45 (53.3%) formula-fed babies. There was little difference in response between breastfed babies whose mother changed their diet (10/16; 62.5%) and babies who received soy milk formula (29/44; 65.9%). Hydrolysed formula versus standard formula: two studies (64 infants) found no difference in duration of crying, reported as a dichotomous outcome: risk ratio 2.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 5.10; very low-quality evidence. The author of one study confirmed there were no adverse effects. One study (43 infants) reported a greater reduction in crying time postintervention with hydrolysed formula (104 min/d, 95% CI 55 to 155) than with standard formula (3 min/d, 95% CI -63 to 67). Hydrolysed formula versus another hydrolysed formula: one study (22 infants) found that two types of hydrolysed formula were equally effective in resolving symptoms for babies who commenced with standard formula (Alimentum reduced crying to 2.21 h/d (standard deviation (SD) 0.40) and Nutramigen to 2.93 h/d (SD 0.70)). Hydrolysed formula or dairy- and soy-free maternal diet versus addition of parental education or counselling: one study (21 infants) found that crying time decreased to 2.03 h/d (SD 1.03) in the hydrolysed or dairy- and soy-free group compared with 1.08 h/d (SD 0.7) in the parent education or counselling group, nine days into the intervention. Partially hydrolysed, lower lactose, whey-based formulae containing oligosaccharide versus standard formula with simethicone: one study (267 infants) found that both groups experienced a decrease in colic episodes (secondary outcome) after seven days (partially hydrolysed formula: from 5.99 episodes (SD 1.84) to 2.47 episodes (SD 1.94); standard formula: from 5.41 episodes (SD 1.88) to 3.72 episodes (SD 1.98)). After two weeks the difference between the two groups was significant (partially hydrolysed: 1.76 episodes (SD 1.60); standard formula: 3.32 episodes (SD 2.06)). The study author confirmed there were no adverse effects. Lactase enzyme supplementation versus placebo: three studies (138 infants) assessed this comparison, but none reported data amenable to analysis for any outcome. There were no adverse effects in any of the studies. Extract of Foeniculum vulgare, Matricariae recutita, and Melissa officinalis versus placebo: one study (93 infants) found that average daily crying time was lower for infants given the extract (76.9 min/d (SD 23.5), than infants given placebo (169.9 min/d (SD 23.1), at the end of the one-week study. There were no adverse effects. Soy protein-based formula versus standard cows' milk protein-based formula: one study (19 infants) reported a mean crying time of 12.7 h/week (SD 16.4) in the soy formula group versus 17.3 h/week (SD 6.9) in the standard cows' milk group, and that 5/10 (50%) responded in the soy formula group versus 0/9 (0%) in the standard cows' milk group. Soy protein formula with polysaccharide versus standard soy protein formula: one study (27 infants) assessed this comparison but did not provide disaggregated data for the number of responders in each group after treatment. No study reported on our secondary outcomes of parental or family quality of life, infant sleep duration per 24 h, or parental satisfaction.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently, evidence of the effectiveness of dietary modifications for the treatment of infantile colic is sparse and at significant risk of bias. The few available studies had small sample sizes, and most had serious limitations. There were insufficient studies, thus limiting the use of meta-analysis. Benefits reported for hydrolysed formulas were inconsistent. Based on available evidence, we are unable to recommend any intervention. Future studies of single interventions, using clinically significant outcome measures, and appropriate design and power are needed.

### Evaluation of hematochezia in a two-day-old infant [^0f3deb38]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hematochezia in the pediatric population, particularly infants, has a wide differential diagnosis ranging from benign to life-threatening causes. Obtaining a thorough history and identifying risk factors for more ominous disease is vital during the emergency department (ED) evaluation.

Case Report

The patient is a 2-day-old female who presented to the ED with 8–10 episodes of bright red blood in her stools. She was otherwise asymptomatic, with an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Her history was significant for a sibling who recently tested positive for Escherichia coli O157:H7 in his stool and a family history of lactose intolerance. She was exclusively formula fed. An abdominal plain film was obtained and was normal. Milk protein enterocolitis was suspected and she was transitioned to hydrolyzed formula with resolution of her symptoms. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? As emergency physicians, we need to be aware of the life-threatening conditions that are associated with hematochezia, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, and act quickly. However, many patients will have benign conditions, and recognizing the key historical and diagnostic pieces of the infant's presentation will prevent unnecessary evaluations and consultations.

### Diagnostic approach and management of cow' s-milk protein allergy in infants and children: ESPGHAN GI committee practical guidelines [^aedf25d3]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

This guideline provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of suspected cow's-milk protein allergy (CMPA) in Europe. It presents a practical approach with a diagnostic algorithm and is based on recently published evidence-based guidelines on CMPA.

Diagnosis

If CMPA is suspected by history and examination, then strict allergen avoidance is initiated. In certain circumstances (eg, a clear history of immediate symptoms, a life-threatening reaction with a positive test for CMP-specific IgE), the diagnosis can be made without a milk challenge. In all other circumstances, a controlled oral food challenge (open or blind) under medical supervision is required to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of CMPA.

Treatment

In breast-fed infants, the mother should start a strict CMP-free diet. Non-breast-fed infants with confirmed CMPA should receive an extensively hydrolyzed protein-based formula with proven efficacy in appropriate clinical trials; amino acids-based formulae are reserved for certain situations. Soy protein formula, if tolerated, is an option beyond 6 months of age. Nutritional counseling and regular monitoring of growth are mandatory in all age groups requiring CMP exclusion. REEVALUATION: Patients should be reevaluated every 6 to 12 months to assess whether they have developed tolerance to CMP. This is achieved in > 75% by 3 years of age and > 90% by 6 years of age. Inappropriate or overly long dietary eliminations should be avoided. Such restrictions may impair the quality of life of both child and family, induce improper growth, and incur unnecessary health care costs.

### Effect of formula composition on the development of infant gut microbiota [^1b5a1d48]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Breast-feeding induces a gut microbiota rich in bifidobacteria, whereas formula-fed babies have a more diverse colonization. This ecosystem contributes to the development of the immune response and the lower incidence of diarrhea and allergy in breast-fed infants. This randomized double-blind controlled trial aimed to evaluate the bifidogenic effect of a mainly whey protein study formula low in phosphate and protein, allowing a composition closer to that of human milk.

Patients and Methods

One hundred ninety healthy infants exclusively received study formula with or without Bifidobacterium longum (BL999), or a control formula for up to 4 months. Breast-fed infants served as a reference population. Stool samples collected at 2 months of age were analyzed for bacterial counts (log colony-forming unit [CFU]/g).

Results

Bifidobacteria counts were significantly higher in infants receiving the study formula alone (10.0[0.8], P < 0.0001, median [interquartile range]) or with BL999 (9.8[1.4], P < 0.01) than control (9.2[3.5]), and were similar to breast-fed infants (10.1[0.4], P > 0.05). The difference between the 2 study groups was 0.16 log CFU/g (90% confidence interval [CI] [0–0.4]), within the predefined equivalence margin. Microbiota profile, as a percentage of total bacteria counts, showed about 50% Bifidobacteria, 8% Enterobacteria, and < 10% Clostridia in study formulae and breast-fed infants versus 22%, 13%, and 19% in controls, respectively. There were no significant differences in growth measurements, digestive tolerance, and adverse events between groups.

Conclusions

This study showed that infant formula closer resembling human milk was more bifidogenic than the control formula and led to a microbiota profile similar to that for breast-fed infants.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) — heterogeneity and geographic variation: Summary Statement 6: Consider FPIES a heterogeneous disorder associated with a number of geographic variations in the features of disease, representing a spectrum of "syndromes" as opposed to a uniform "syndrome". [Strength of recommendation: Strong; Evidence strength: IIb-III; Evidence grade: B]. The majority of reports are from Western countries and predominantly involve white populations, whereas Japanese data suggest different phenotypes; in Japanese infants with FPIES, vomiting was observed in 100%, bloody stools in 47%, and fever in 13% at initial presentation. Forty-seven percent had detectable serum CM-specific IgE (sIgE), and 10% reported symptoms during breast-feeding, and this phenotype appears distinct in Japan compared with the vomiting-predominant presentation without bloody stools more commonly reported elsewhere.

### Evaluation of an amino acid-based formula in infants not responding to extensively hydrolyzed protein formula [^fd25f65f]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

What Is Known
Amino acid−based formulas are recommended for infants with cow's milk protein allergy who continue to exhibit allergic manifestations and poor growth while on an extensively hydrolyzed formula.
Healthy infants receiving amino acid−based formulas have demonstrated healthy growth and tolerance.

What Is New
In cow's milk protein allergy−suspected infants not responding to extensively hydrolyzed formulas, the initiation of amino acid−based formula improved growth following a 12-week feeding period.
Atopic dermatitis and gastrointestinal complications were also significantly reduced after amino acid−based infant formula feeding.

Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA), the most common food allergy, affects at least 2% to 3% of infants. CMPA can provoke both IgE-mediated (immediate onset) and non−IgE-mediated (delayed onset) reactions, and result in several clinical symptoms including atopic dermatitis (AD), diarrhea, and vomiting. Although 80% of children develop a tolerance to cow's milk protein by 3 years of age, CMPA can significantly reduce infant quality of life and result in poor growth. Current recommendations for CMPA management include complete avoidance of cow's milk protein and the initiation of an extensively hydrolyzed protein (EHP) formula.

Although most of infants with CMPA respond well to EHP formulas and experience adequate growth and reduced allergy symptoms, the formulas may still contain small peptide fragments that can exacerbate allergic reactions in highly sensitive infants. Failure to respond to an EHP formula can result in impaired growth and persistence of symptoms. Therefore, amino acid−based formulas (AAFs) are often recommended for infants with CMPA not responding to EHP formulas. AAFs have demonstrated reduced allergy symptoms and improved growth in infants with CMPA. Furthermore, similar growth, tolerance, and safety outcomes were demonstrated in healthy term infants fed AAF compared to infants receiving a control (EHP) formula. In recent studies, AAFs were well tolerated and supported growth in otherwise healthy infants without CMPA, and in those with CMPA. Furthermore, EHP and AAFs have been shown to improve the gut barrier function.

Although many studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of AAFs in healthy infants, few have examined the role of AAFs in CMPA infants not responding to EHP formulas. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of an AAF in infants between the ages of 1 and 12 months with a history of weight loss and persistent allergy symptoms while on an EH formula.

Fig. 4
Comparison of incidence of stool colors, consistency and stool mucus presented as mean percentages of total occurrences in the MF group (black column) and SF group (grey column), and BFR group (white column) at the postnatal age of 42 days, 4 months, 6 months, 8 months, and 12 months. A. Frequency of stool colors between the groups. B. Frequency of stool consistency between the groups, C. Frequency of stool mucus between the groups. ✱ p < 0.05, P < 0.005. MF: MFGM-enriched formula; SF: standard formula; BFR: breast-fed reference

Soft stool was the predominant stool pattern (50–95%) among the 3 groups of infants throughout the first year of life. There were no significant differences in the frequency of soft stools between the two formula-fed groups throughout the study, However, the frequency of soft stool in both SF and MF was higher than that for the BFR group at 42 days and 4 months of age (Odds ratio 2.95–3.27, P < 0.01, Fig. 4 B). The BFR group had a significantly higher frequency of loose stools at 42 days and 4 months compared with the two formula-fed groups (Odds ratio 1.01–14.93, P < 0.01), but this frequency declined to similar levels in the SF group by 6 months and then reached the same levels as the two formula-fed groups by 8 months of age (P > 0.05, Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, frequency of loose stools in the MF group was 50% at the first 42 days (P > 0.05), and changed to 85% "low frequency" at 6 months (odds ratio 0.22, P = 0.023, Fig. 4 B) compared to the SF group. The two formula-fed groups, in particular the SF group had significantly higher frequency of hard stools compared to the BFR group from birth to 6 months (Odds ratio 6.6–41.76, P < 0.001, Fig. 4 B), but not at 8 and 12 months (P > 0.05, Fig. 4 B).

### ABM clinical protocol # 24: allergic proctocolitis in the exclusively breastfed infant [^93e810e1]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

Allergic proctocolitis in exclusively breastfed infants — incidence and implicated antigen notes that prospective data indicate approximately 0.5–1% of exclusively breastfed infants develop allergic reactions to cow's milk proteins excreted in the mother's milk, and given that cow's milk protein is the offending antigen in 50–65% of cases, the total incidence of food allergy in this population appears slightly higher than 0.5–1%. Infants fed human milk appear to have a lower incidence of allergic reactions to cow's milk protein than those fed cow's milk–based formula, which may be attributable to a relatively low level of cow's milk protein excreted in human milk, immunomodulatory substances in human milk, or differences in intestinal flora between breastfed and formula-fed infants.

### Assessment of cow's milk-related symptom scores in early identification of cow's milk protein allergy in Chinese infants [^85382d9c]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

CoMiSS is a simple and operable method to screen for CMPA, though there may be risk of under-diagnosis when CoMiSS ≥ 12 is used as the criterion for early identification of CMPA in Chinese infants. More multi-center studies are needed to evaluate whether the factors such as bloody stool should be included in CoMiSS or CoMiSS ≥ 6 can be used as the criterion for early identification of CMPA in Chinese infants.

### Growth of healthy term infants fed ready-to-feed and powdered forms of an extensively hydrolyzed casein-based infant formula: a randomized, blinded, controlled trial [^e71579b4]. Clinical Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Extensively hydrolyzed formulas present a complex matrix subject to adverse conditions during manufacture that could influence growth and tolerance of infants fed these formulas. A masked, randomized, parallel growth study was conducted in infants fed a ready-to-feed (RTF) or powdered (PWD) form of an extensively hydrolyzed casein-based formula. Infants were enrolled between 0 and 9 days and studied to 112 days of age. Growth, formula intake, and stool patterns were assessed. There were no significant differences between groups in weight, length, head circumference, or their respective gains. Tolerance was similar between groups except that the RTF group had greater formula intakes and passed more stools/day compared to the PWD group. This study demonstrates that the PWD formulation of this RTF formula supports similar growth and tolerance in infants during the first 4 months of life.

### Natural evolution of infantile regurgitation versus the efficacy of thickened formula [^e17eb63f]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Regurgitation is frequent in infants. We evaluated changes in regurgitation among patient groups fed standard formula, standard formula subsequently thickened with cereal, or formula manufactured with bean gum as a thickening agent.

Patients and Methods

A prospective, blinded, randomised 1-month intervention trial evaluating the efficacy of parental reassurance of the regurgitating child in combination with 3 formula interventions — standard infant formula (group A); 5 g of rice cereal added to 100 mL standard formula (group B); and formula manufactured with bean gum as a thickening agent (group C) — was performed in 60 infants presenting with more than 4 episodes of regurgitation and/or vomiting per day during the week before inclusion. Formula intake, infant comfort, stool aspects, and weight gain were evaluated. All of the infants and data recorded by parents in a diary were evaluated weekly by a blinded health care professional.

Results

At baseline, groups A, B, and C were similar for all of the parameters. After the 1-month intervention, regurgitation/vomiting decreased significantly in all 3 groups (P < 0.0005). Although the decrease was largest in group C (-4.2 ± 2.1 episodes/day), the incidence did not differ significantly with groups A or B. At no evaluation interval was there a difference in volume of formula intake, infant comfort, stool frequency, or aspect. After 1 month, weight gain was significantly greater in group C compared with group A (19.9% vs 16.4%; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Thickening of formula decreases regurgitation, but not significantly. Parental reassurance remains the cornerstone of the treatment of infant regurgitation.

### Evaluation of hypoallergenicity of a new, amino acid-based formula [^8057548a]. Clinical Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) defined a formula as hypoallergenic if it ensures with 95% confidence that 90% of infants with confirmed cow's milk allergy (CMA) will not react with defined symptoms under double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions. This study's objective was to determine whether a new amino acid-based formula (AAF) meets the AAP hypoallergenicity criteria.

Methods

Children with CMA were randomized to double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC) with a new AAF and a commercial AAF in crossover fashion followed by an at-home open challenge with the new AAF. Allergic reactions were assessed using a scoring system.

Results

Thirty-three subjects completed DBPCFCs with both formulas without acute allergic reactions. The lower bound 95% confidence interval for hypoallergenicity was 91.3%. No unusual stool patterns, allergic symptoms, or signs of intolerance were reported during the open challenge.

Conclusion. The new AAF meets AAP hypoallergenicity criteria and can be recommended for the management of CMA.

### Nutrition support for neurologically impaired children: a clinical report of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^121b8fda]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Medium credibility.

Type of formula — selection and special considerations depend on clinical factors and tolerance: The choice of enteral formula depends on the child's age, medical condition, energy requirement, and mode of enteral access. Standard, age-appropriate, infant or pediatric casein-based formulas are administered routinely. Whey-based formulas may be better tolerated because they enhance gastric emptying. Children who manifest symptoms associated with cow milk protein sensitivity (allergy) may require a protein hydrolysate or amino acid formula. When high energy density (1.5 or 2 kcal/mL) formulas are used, monitoring hydration status and protein and micronutrient intake is necessary. A fiber-containing formula may ameliorate constipation, but may aggravate intestinal bloating if volume is increased rapidly.

### Growth of healthy term infants fed an extensively hydrolyzed casein-based or free amino acid-based infant formula: a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial [^5d6ad389]. Clinical Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

A masked, randomized, parallel growth study was conducted in infants fed an amino acid-based formula (AF) or an extensively hydrolyzed casein-based formula (HF). Infants were enrolled between 0 and 9 days and studied to 112 days of age. Growth, formula intake, stool patterns, and serum albumin concentrations were assessed. There were no significant differences between groups in weight, length, or head circumference, gains in weight or length, or study formula intake. The number of stools parents rated as being formed, and the mean daily number of stools were greater in the HF than in the AF group at 14 and 28 days of age. Mean serum albumin concentrations were not significantly different between groups and were within the normal range. This study demonstrates that AF supports normal growth of infants comparable to that of infants fed HF during the critical first 4 months of life.

### Unravelling a pediatric enigma: coexisting retroesophageal right subclavian artery and congenital colonic stenosis masquerading as cow's milk protein allergy and ileus in a neonate [^a950ae7b]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 36-year-old Thai primigravida mother gave birth to a male newborn at a gestational age of 41 weeks by cesarean section due to maternal preeclampsia. Both parents were healthy and had no history of consanguineous marriage. The pregnancy was normal until 40 weeks of gestation when prenatal ultrasonography diagnosed bilateral intracerebral hemorrhages in the fronto-parieto-temporo-occipital regions. The newborn had a birth weight of 3,500 g. Owing to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, his Apgar scores were 1, 3, and 3 at 1, 5, and 10 min, respectively, necessitating intubation and ventilatory support. A ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt was performed to manage obstructive hydrocephalus, yet recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) occurred postnatally. Brain imaging after the birth did not reveal any vascular malformation, brain tumor, brain infection, or intradural venous thrombosis. Congenital coagulopathy was further excluded. After weaning off intubation and initiating oral feeding at 7 days of age, the patient experienced multiple episodes of vomiting and reflux after being fed breast milk or infant formula and exhibited intermittent abdominal distension. Stool volume ranged from 20 to 100 ml/day, and the stool consistency was runny and soft, with no history of constipation. The vomiting and reflux persisted despite switching to lactose-free and hypoallergenic infant formulas. Clinical suspicion arose for non-IgE-mediated cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) due to equivocal serum level of specific IgE to cow's milk and no dermatologic symptom. At 2 months of age, the patient developed clinical signs of sepsis secondary to an infected VP shunt caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Concurrently, marked abdominal distension was noted. No history of necrotizing enterocolitis was documented. Abdominal X-ray radiograph showed multiple dilated bowel loops without air-fluid levels or pneumoperitoneum (Fig. 1 A). Abdominal ultrasonography revealed generalized bowel dilatation without midgut volvulus or malrotation. Gut obstruction was therefore excluded. The physician suspected bowel ileus associated with sepsis and the infected VP shunt. Antibiotics were administered.

### Hydrolyzed formula compared with standard formula for preterm infants [^98e37db8]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

For preterm infants, is hydrolyzed formula associated with lower rates of feeding intolerance, lower rates of necrotizing enterocolitis, and faster rates of growth compared with standard cow's milk formula?

Bottom Line

Compared with standard formula, feeding preterm infants hydrolyzed formula is not associated with a lower rate of feeding intolerance, a lower rate of necrotizing enterocolitis, or with faster growth.

### IgE-mediated cow milk allergy and infantile colic: diagnostic and management challenges [^a2337d59]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Cow milk allergy (CMA) is a common problem affecting 2–3% of children and is the most prevalent food allergy in infancy. Infantile colic is also a common problem in the first year of life. A frequent practice among physicians is to recommend a dairy-free diet to breast-feeding mothers and infants in cases of infantile colic. However, recent studies suggest that late introduction of potentially allergenic foods may increase the risk of developing a life-threatening food allergy. We describe two infants managed with dairy-free diet to control symptoms of colic in whom CMA developed. It is possible that unnecessary cow milk restriction may have contributed to the development of food allergy in these infants.

### Supplemental donor milk vs infant formula in moderate to late preterm infants: a randomized clinical trial [^369f6ec9]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design

The trial was a multisite, blinded, parallel-group, partially clustered randomized clinical trial conducted at 2 Australian neonatal units: the Women's and Children's Hospital in South Australia and the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (RBWH) in Queensland. Infants were enrolled from July 6, 2021, to April 5, 2023, with follow-up assessments until 6-month corrected age (completed by December 4, 2023). The trial protocol (see Supplement 1) was approved by the Women's and Children's Health Network Human Research Ethics Committee in South Australia (HREC/20/WCHN/126), with governance approval granted at each site. The results are reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

Participants

Infants were eligible if they met all of the following criteria: born between 32 + 0 and 36 + 6 completed weeks' gestation; birth weight of 1500 g or higher; admitted to the neonatal unit at a participating site; clinically stable as determined by the treating health care team; ready to commence enteral feeds or commenced enteral feeds but insufficient maternal milk available; aged 4 days old or younger; and had a parent or guardian capable of giving informed consent. Only infants with a gestation of 34 + 0 weeks or more at birth were enrolled at RBWH, as the provision of donor milk to infants born less than 34 weeks was standard practice at this site.

Infants with any of the following criteria were excluded: (1) major congenital malformation either likely to interfere with the ability to ingest milk or requiring surgery in the first 6 months of life; (2) metabolic disorder that precludes breastfeeding; or (3) had received formula before randomization.

After written consent was obtained from the parent or guardian, infants were randomly allocated to either the intervention or control group in a 1:1 ratio using a secure web-based randomization service (REDCap [Vanderbilt]). Stratification occurred for site and gestational age (GA) at birth (< 34 weeks, ≥ 34 weeks). A computer-generated randomization schedule using a balanced variable block design was prepared and held by an independent statistician not otherwise involved in the trial. Singletons were randomized independently, while twins and triplets were cluster randomized to the same treatment arm. Infants were randomized when the amount of maternal milk available was deemed insufficient to meet the infant's enteral feed requirements.

### Food allergies… [^a716aac8]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

MILK Cow's milk provides key nutrients, such as protein, calcium, and vitamins A and D. Observational studies support a recommendation of two 8-oz servings of cow's milk per day in toddlers to maintain adequate vitamin D and iron stores. 14, 15 Children one to two years of age should drink whole milk rather than reduced-fat milk. 8, 16, 17 Although the AAP supports considering reduced-fat milk for toddlers who are at risk of obesity or cardiovascular disease, 17 early introduction of reduced-fat milk may ultimately increase the risk of obesity. 18–20. If an alternative to cow's milk is preferred, fortified soy milk is most similar in composition to cow's milk. 3 Other alternatives, including almond, rice, coconut, and hemp milks, tend to have less protein and fat compared with cow's milk, and have been associated with decreased adult height and lower vitamin D levels. 21, 22. 3, 16, 25 Trans fats should be avoided entirely. 3, 16 Different dietary fat sources are listed in Table 2.
3.

33 The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force and American Academy of Family Physicians conclude that evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routine screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic children six to 24 months of age. 35–37 Prevention of iron deficiency in young children includes use of iron-fortified formula in formula-fed infants, consumption of iron-rich foods at the appropriate age, not introducing cow's milk before 12 months of age, and limiting cow's milk to 16 oz per day once it is introduced. Food Allergies In a sharp departure from previous recommendations, more recent guidelines recommend early introduction of potentially allergenic foods into the diets of some infants. Therefore, foods that were traditionally started in toddlers may now be given earlier.

For example, foods containing peanuts should be introduced between four and six months of age in infants with severe eczema or egg allergy and at around six months for those with mild to moderate eczema. In children with no eczema or food allergies, peanuts can be introduced as usual with other age-appropriate foods. 13 The new peanut recommendations were previously summarized in American Family Physician. 40 There is limited evidence that allergen exposure through breastfeeding reduces future allergies. 41 However, there is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for maternal food preference or avoidance while breastfeeding or for the use of infant supplements such as probiotics to affect the risk of food allergies. 42.

### Diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux in preterm infants [^e675e11b]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Preterm gastroesophageal reflux (GER) — feeding thickeners and formula selection — thickening feedings has been used, but it is recommended that xanthan gum or similar thickeners not be used in preterm or former preterm infants in the first year of life, and formula products that thicken on acidification in the stomach are not nutritionally appropriate for preterm infants. In term infants, thickened formulas reduce episodes of regurgitation but are ineffective in reducing acidic GER, and only small trials exist in preterm infants; in a starch‑thickened preterm formula, total GER episodes were unchanged versus standard formula while total lower esophageal acid exposure was less, with no assessment of effects on symptoms. Elemental or extensively hydrolyzed protein formulas reduce gastrointestinal transit time and reduce symptoms in term infants with symptomatic GER, whereas in preterm infants extensively hydrolyzed protein formula led to fewer reflux episodes by MII and pH study but did not reduce behavioral signs of GER. Because the role of cow milk protein allergy in preterm infants with signs of GER is unclear, a trial of extensively hydrolyzed protein‑based formula may be reasonable in age‑appropriate preterm infants with signs of severe reflux.

### Safety and tolerance assessment of milk fat globule membrane-enriched infant formulas in healthy term Chinese infants: a randomised multicenter controlled trial [^e262440b]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

We also analysed if the stool green and blackish green color were associated with poor growth outcome for the infants using Pearson correlation. The results showed there was a significant relationship between BMI in the SF group at 6 months and 12 months and frequency of stool consistency (P < 0.01, Table 9). The results suggest that soft stool has a beneficial effect on growth and the prevalence of loose stools may be associated with a poor growth outcome. Interestingly, the prevalence of loose stools in the BFR was significantly higher than two formula-fed groups of infants (Fig. 4 B), which is similar to the results reported by Breij et al. It might be the parents, and possibly also pediatricians, are more concerned by loose stools in infants fed formula milk compared with breast-fed infants. The intestines naturally secrete mucus to help stools pass more effectively through the intestines. Medical conditions including infections and food allergies can cause mucus in stools, which indicates a degree of dysfunction in the infant's intestinal tract. There was no significant difference in stool mucus between two formula-fed groups. Interestingly, the infants in the BFR group had higher frequency of stool mucus during early development, but it was completely eliminated by the time of the 12-month visit. There was no correlation between stool mucus and poor growth (P > 0.01, Table 7). Thus, the results imply that breast milk contains many bioactive compounds that support digestive function such as mucus production to facilitate stools passing in the intestines and to save energy lost during stool elimination process. Thus, in our study population, the mucus is part of a normal process. The characterization of stool mucus in breast-fed infants needs further study. There was no significant correlation between infant growth outcomes and stool characteristics in the MF (P > 0.01, Table 8). Overall, our results showed that MFGM enriched formula is closer to the BFR group in the stool characters, especially at 12 months of age (Fig. 4 A-C).

The Cow's Milk-related Symptom Score (CoMiSS) (Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 2,) is a clinical tool developed to improve the awareness of health care professionals (HCPs) of the possible association between clinical manifestations and cow's milk (CM) exposure and, potentially, cow's milk allergy (CMA) in infants. The original CoMiSS quantified 5 clinical items: crying time, number and volume of regurgitation episodes, stool consistency, skin manifestations (atopic dermatitis/urticaria), and respiratory symptoms, with a total score ranging from 0 to 33. Originally, an arbitrary cutoff of ≥ 12 was suggested as possibly indicating CMA, warranting an elimination diet followed by cow's milk protein (CMP) reintroduction. A recent review evaluated the performance of CoMiSS in 25 clinical studies and concluded that lowering the cutoff to ≥ 10 was justified. Previous studies on CoMiSS also demonstrate that scores ≤ 5 are unlikely to be found in infants with CMA. Scores from 6 to 9 are present in different clinical conditions: in healthy infants, those with functional gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms as well as those with CMA.

Food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES)–implicated foods — cow's milk and cereal grains are mapped to their main nutrients and alternative dietary sources. Cow's milk (CM) provides 'Macronutrients: protein, fat' along with 'Minerals and trace elements: calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, iodine' and 'Vitamins: A, B6, B12, D, riboflavin, pantothenic acid'; alternatives include 'Hypoallergenic formula, breast milk' and for 'Older toddlers (> 2 y): fortified alternative beverages such as soy, rice, hemp, almond, oat, coconut, if tolerated'. For 'Rice, oat, barley, and wheat grains', listed nutrients include 'Carbohydrate, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc' and those 'Frequently in enriched cereal products', while alternatives include 'Flours and especially enriched cereal and cereal products made from quinoa, buckwheat, millet, corn, legumes' plus 'Dark green vegetables: B vitamins, vitamin A, B6, folate, vitamin C', 'Starchy vegetables: carbohydrates', 'Sesame seeds (as tahini): protein, calcium, iron, copper, manganese, zinc, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, folate, omega 3 and 6 fatty acids', and 'Beef and lamb: iron, zinc, choline'.

Non-breastfed infants.

Modifications to the infant formula involve changing the carbohydrate (hypothesizing that malabsorption of lactose may lead to increased gas production, fussiness, and crying) or changing the protein content or type (hypothesizing that colic is secondary to intolerance or allergy). Decreasing the lactose content has not been shown to produce a difference in symptom reduction (,–). Attempts to alter the protein intake have included either modifying the amount of protein or modifying its type by using specialized formulas (soy-based, partially hydrolyzed, extensively hydrolyzed, amino acid-based/elemental, the addition of prebiotics, etc.).
Modifying the amount of protein: Double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies have failed to show a difference in the amount of crying.
Soy-based formulas: They may reduce symptoms of colic. However, the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition stated recently that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of soy formulas for colic. In addition, owing to concerns regarding a cross-over allergy to cows' milk protein and their estrogen content, it is recommended that soy-based formulas should not be given to infants.
Hypoallergenic formulas: Studies have shown conflicting results (,–). Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses that have included more than 15 RCTs and 1,200 infants have concluded that although there is insufficient evidence to recommend dietary modifications in all infants with colic, a 2–4-week elimination diet may be indicated in more severe cases, given the possibility of an underlying cow's milk allergy (CMA).

Food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) — chronic presentation includes a severe pattern with regular ingestion of the offending food causing intermittent but progressive vomiting and diarrhea (occasionally with blood) with possible dehydration and metabolic acidosis, and a milder pattern with lower doses (eg, solid foods or food allergens in breast milk) causing intermittent vomiting and/or diarrhea with poor weight gain/failure to thrive without dehydration or metabolic acidosis; the most important diagnostic criterion is resolution within days after elimination with acute recurrence when reintroduced, with vomiting in 1–4 h and diarrhea in 24 h (usually 5–10 h), and without confirmatory challenge the diagnosis remains presumptive.

Food Allergy Cow Milk Protein Allergy
- Breastfed infants who are highly sensitive to a cow's milk protein may react to foods in the maternal diet, in which case maternal avoidance may be required.
- Most formula-fed infants who have evidence of protein milk allergy when standard cow milk formulas are given they tolerate a formula labeled "hypoallergenic".
- If an infant reacts to hypoallergenic cow milk-derived formulas, an amino acid formula may be tolerated. IgE-Mediated Cow Milk Protein Allergy Cow's milk is among the most common causes of food-induced anaphylaxis, along with peanuts and tree nuts.
- CMPA is more common in males and in those with atopic diseases. IgE mediated CMPA symptoms occur within a few minutes and up to two hours after ingestion of cow milk. Symptoms include.
- Physician observed food challenges may be important to prevent lifelong avoidance of milk which has been shown to lead to
- Reduced linear growth
- Vitamin D deficiency Non-IgE Mediated Cow Milk Protein Allergy The symptoms of non-IgE mediated cow milk protein allergy may be misinterpreted as lactose intolerance.
- **Symptoms generally include**:
- Pain
- Flatulence
- Diarrhea
- Bloody stools Non-IgE mediated CMPA can involve the GI tract, the skin, and may lead to respiratory symptoms
- Restriction of all milk protein leads to a resolution of symptoms within 4 to 6 weeks. For further information on diagnosis and treatment, see FPIES. Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome FPIES is a type of allergic reaction in the GI tract that usually begins in the first 6 months of life in formula-fed infants.
- **Reported triggers are**:
- Most commonly cow milk followed by soy and then rice
- Other reported triggers include oats, barley, chicken, turkey, egg white, green pea, sweet potato, white potato, fruit protein, fish and mollusks FPIES diagnosis involves a standard skin prick testing and blood testing for specific IgE are routinely negative. A careful history and physical examination are key in diagnosis. Referral An infant or child with EoE should be referred to the nearest EoE center.

They can be accessed in full via the links below: Cow's Milk Protein Allergy The Cow's Milk Protein Allergy module provides an overview, along with detailed information on pathology and subtypes, workup and diagnosis, treatment, natural course and followup through childhood years, general guidance, and additional resources. Introduction 4b. Anticipatory Guidance
- Feeding and Nutrition Parents should be encouraged to continue to offer a variety of complementary foods, including potentially allergenic foods like peanut and egg. unless there are other risk factors. Families may offer complementary foods at an increased frequency at 9 months. This generally equates to 3 to 4 times per day in addition to offering 1 to 2 healthy snacks per day.

The majority of nutritional intake at this stage continues to come from breastfeeding, expressed breastmilk, or infant formula if the mother is not exclusively breastfeeding. Parents may continue to offer about 4oz per day of water. Using an open cup will help with development of fine motor skills. Families should continue to avoid cow's and other milks, honey, sugary foods and drinks, foods with added salt, and anything that may pose a choking hazard. A comprehensive summary on nutritional recommendations can be found in the "Nutrition in Infancy" chapter below from. Clinicians may encourage breastfeeding mothers to increase the frequency of feedings and increase the milk expression between feedings, which may help increase supply and newborn weight gain.

Signs of insufficient milk intake, caused by either lack of supply or poor transfer, include delayed gut motility, fewer bowel movements, decreased urinary output, early jaundice, hunger, lethargy, and greater than 7% loss of body weight. US formulas generally require 1 unpacked level scoop per 2 fl oz of water. Improper mixing can lead to inadequate caloric intake, causing malnutrition. It also can lead to electrolyte imbalances in infants, which can potentially cause seizures. In addition, partially hydrolyzed European formulas can be labeled "hypoallergenic, " which is inappropriate for infants with cow milk protein allergy. 18 Clinicians should strongly discourage parents from preparing or purchasing homemade formula.

Necrotising enterocolitis is one of the most common gastrointestinal emergencies in newborn infants. Here we review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and pathophysiology of the disease, as well as strategies for diagnosis, management, and prevention. Necrotising enterocolitis is one of the most devastating and unpredictable diseases affecting premature infants. Despite decades of research, its pathogenesis remains unclear; diagnosis can be difficult; and treatment is challenging. We will need to improve our understanding of intestinal defences in premature infants, dietary and bacterial factors, and genetic effects that could predispose infants to necrotising enterocolitis before we can develop new strategies for prevention and treatment.

Food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) clinical phenotyping — early onset is younger than age 9 mo and late onset is older than age 9 mo; severity ranges from mild-to-moderate (repetitive emesis with or without diarrhea, pallor, mild lethargy) to severe (repetitive projectile emesis with or without diarrhea, pallor, lethargy, dehydration, hypotension, shock, methemoglobinemia, metabolic acidosis). Acute FPIES occurs with intermittent exposures with emesis usually within 1–4 h, diarrhea can follow within 24 hours with usual onset of 5–10 h, and symptoms usually resolve within 24 h after elimination; chronic FPIES occurs with daily ingestion and infants usually return to health within 3–10 d of switching to a hypoallergenic formula. IgE-based phenotypes include classic (food specific, IgE negative) and atypical (food specific, IgE positive).

### Clinical response to 2 commonly used switch formulas occurs within 1 day [^5a6bed84]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Very fussy or extremely fussy infants were randomized to receive: soy-based formula (Soy: n = 82) or a partially hydrolyzed cow's milk protein (CMP), low-lactose formula (PHF: n = 77) in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel, prospective 28-day feeding trial. Body weight and infant formula tolerance were reported. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study. A significant reduction in mean scores of fussiness, gas, spit-up, and crying compared with baseline measures was observed in infants who received either Soy or PHF within 1 day of formula intake; improvement in symptoms was sustained by study end. Stool consistency remained constant through day 28 in the PHF group, whereas stools in the Soy group became more firm by day 2 and did not return to prestudy consistency. PHF, with a protein profile patterned more closely on human breast milk, improved symptoms of formula intolerance as well as soy-based formula.

### Efficacy of soy-based formulas in alleviating gastrointestinal symptoms in infants with milk-based formula intolerance: a randomized clinical trial [^223963ad]. Clinical Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

A randomized, blinded pilot clinical study was conducted to assess gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance in healthy, full-term infants (2–9 weeks old), whose pediatricians recommended a formula change due to perceived cow's milk formula intolerance. Infants were randomized and exclusively fed either a commercial control soy formula (SF; n = 22), an experimental partially hydrolyzed SF (10% hydrolyzed, n = 23), or a 5% hydrolyzed SF (n = 26) for 2 weeks. Age-matched reference cohorts (n = 72) with no GI intolerance on milk-based formula were assessed in parallel. Results indicated that all SF-fed groups contributed to reduction (P < .05) in common GI tolerance symptoms to levels not different from the non-symptomatic reference cohort at study end. The control SF group had more reduced fussiness, gas, and crying and higher formed stools versus hydrolyzed SF groups. In conclusion, the study suggests that SFs reduced GI intolerance symptoms in otherwise healthy infants with poor tolerance on milk-based formulas.

### Infant formula containing bovine milk-derived oligosaccharides supports age-appropriate growth and improves stooling pattern [^3655ed09]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

To conclude, this study demonstrated that infant formula supplemented with MOS at 7.2 g/L is safe and well-tolerated and supports normal age-appropriate infant growth according to WHO standards. The addition of MOS to an alpha-lactalbumin-enriched infant formula with elevated levels of sn-2 palmitate promoted a softer stooling pattern compared with the control formula without parent-reported or physician-confirmed adverse health concerns. Such an infant formula will provide a safe and effective option for healthy term infants who are formula-fed.

On the other hand, mothers allocated to the BF plus CMF group were asked to supplement BF with at least 5 mL of CMF from the first day or within the first 24 hours after delivery and with at least 40 mL/d after 1 month and to continue to the first blood test at 5 months of age or before starting solid food. Both CMF and EF were purchased from Meiji Holdings Company, Ltd. The primary outcome was atopic sensitization to cow's milk protein. Serum levels of CM-IgE at 5 and 24 months of age as a continuous variable were used as reference values for the primary outcome. Other atopic sensitizations to egg white, wheat, and mites at levels of at least 0. 35 UA/mL at 24 months of age were also evaluated to be compared with cow's milk sensitization, but not for the primary outcome.

In a post hoc analysis, levels of CM-IgE at 5 months of age did not show a clear trend, whereas those at 24 months of age showed a trend for earlier start of supplementation with CMF to be associated with higher levels of CM-IgE (. Moreover, a prospective cohort study8 showed that all 39 CMAs developed in 1539 infants who received CMF supplementation during the first 3 days of life, whereas no CMAs occurred in 210 infants who did not receive CMF supplementation, findings considered to be consistent with this trial. lower prevalence of Clostridium difficile, 22 colonization of which at 1 month of age was associated with wheeze, eczema, and asthma later in life. 23 Necrotizing enterocolitis, an inflammatory bowel necrosis most commonly affecting preterm infants, can be triggered by feeding of CMF and prevented. by BF, which may be further influenced by an altered intestinal microbiome that activates an uncontrolled proinflammatory response.

24 Based on these findings, we generated the hypothesis that exposure to a high volume of cow's milk protein with scarce growth of the gut microbiome just after birth may trigger enterocolitis, enhance permeability of gut membrane, facilitate absorption of food allergens, and increase risks of food allergy later in infancy.

### Soy protein infant formulae and follow-on formulae: a commentary by the ESPGHAN committee on nutrition [^721ab46e]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

This comment by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) Committee on Nutrition summarizes available information on the composition and use of soy protein formulae as substitutes for breastfeeding and cows' milk protein formulae as well as on their suitability and safety for supporting adequate growth and development in infants. Soy is a source of protein that is inferior to cows' milk, with a lower digestibility and bioavailability as well as a lower methionine content. For soy protein infant formulae, only protein isolates can be used, and minimum protein content required in the current European Union legislation is higher than that of cows' milk protein infant formulae (2.25 g/100 kcal vs. 1.8 g/100kcal). Soy protein formulae can be used for feeding term infants, but they have no nutritional advantage over cows' milk protein formulae and contain high concentrations of phytate, aluminum, and phytoestrogens (isoflavones), which might have untoward effects. There are no data to support the use of soy protein formulae in preterm infants. Indications for soy protein formulae include severe persistent lactose intolerance, galactosemia, and ethical considerations (e.g., vegan concepts). Soy protein formulae have no role in the prevention of allergic diseases and should not be used in infants with food allergy during the first 6 months of life. If soy protein formulae are considered for therapeutic use in food allergy after the age of 6 months because of their lower cost and better acceptance, tolerance to soy protein should first be established byclinical challenge. There is no evidence supporting the use of soy protein formulae for the prevention or management of infantile colic, regurgitation, or prolonged crying.

Methods

Study design

This monocentric, double-blind, controlled, randomized trial was conducted in 2012–2013 in the Department of Neonatology of the Fondazione IRCCS Cà Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milano, Italy (NCT01611649). The study was approved by the local Ethical Committee and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the principles and rules of the Declaration of Helsinki. Parents or legal caregivers provided written informed consent prior to enrollment of their infants in the study. The study protocol has been previously published.

Population

Healthy full-term infants born in the Department of Neonatology were screened for participation in the study. When breastfeeding was not possible (contraindication or mothers not intended to breastfeed), infants were randomly allocated to be fed for 4 months with a formula containing either: a mix of plant oils and dairy fat (D), only plant oils (P) or plant oils supplemented with ARA and DHA (PDHA). Infants whose mothers intended to exclusively breastfeed from birth through at least 4 months were enrolled in a nonrandomized reference group (BF). Inclusion criteria were: gestational age 37 to 42 weeks, birth weight > 2500 g, healthy newborns from normal pregnancy, aged up to 3 weeks when entering the study, no breastfeeding (for the formula-fed groups) or exclusive breastfeeding (for the reference group). Exclusion criteria were: positive family history of allergy to milk proteins, known congenital or postnatal diseases which could interfere with the study and newborns whose parents had planned to move within 6 months after birth.

Case presentation

A 32-year-old Caucasian woman was recruited during her first pregnancy for a longitudinal breastfeeding research study (UWA Human Research Ethics, reference RA/4/20/4023). Timing of samples and measurements collected are outlined in Table 1.

Table 1
Timing schedule for collection of maternal milk samples, 24-h milk production, and infant anthropometric measurements

Prior to conception the woman had a healthy BMI of 19.8 and Crohn's disease, medicated with Adalimumab. During pregnancy she was diagnosed with GDM and was otherwise healthy with no other reported cardiovascular or metabolic diseases. Overall, the woman reported having a healthy balanced diet, having no allergies, and being a non-smoker. Her infant was fed colostrum and she experienced breast fullness on day 4, coinciding with secretory activation. The mother was advised to pump as frequently as possible, in addition to breastfeeding, and had breastfeeding support at home, although she did not have breastfeeding support from healthcare providers until her infant was 4 months old. It is of interest that the mother herself was born SGA, 2100 g at 40 weeks.

The male infant was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks and 3 days, after induction due to diagnosed placental insufficiency resulting in fetal growth restriction. The infant birth weight was 2390 g, and below the 3rd percentile. For the first 3.5 months of life, the exclusively breastfed infant was tracking along the 3rd percentile for growth, as shown in Fig. 1 a. After 3.5 months, formula supplementation was initiated yet the infant growth continued along the 3rd percentile. In contrast, the infant was born with a head circumference of 34 cm (Fig. 1 b), just below the 50th percentile, indicating head sparing as is characteristic of SGA infants. He was otherwise healthy, with no tongue tie or other oral abnormalities, and averaged 12 feeds per day (within the population range). Solids were introduced at 5 months of age. At 1 year, the infant weighed 9604 g with a head circumference of 47.8 cm, corresponding to the 50th and 85th percentile respectively.

### Infant formula feeding practices in a prospective population based study [^2d8e404a]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

One Irish study did descriptively report the type of infant formula used by parent(s) 6 weeks following delivery. The study involved term (≥ 37 +0 weeks' gestation) singleton infants born with a birthweight of 2.5 kg or greater. Out of the total sample of 450 infants, 368 (81.8%) infants were formula-fed at 6 weeks of age and just over half (n = 197; 53.6%) were being given a standard whey-based infant formula. Nearly half (n = 181, 49.2%) of all infants had experienced at least one formula change. For infants whose formula was changed, either to a whey-based or non whey-based infant formula, parental reports of their infant's increased hunger/feeding frequency of 2–3 h was the most (54.8%) reported reason. The study did not provide any information on the initial type of infant formula, or feeding history on type of infant formula after 6 weeks of age.

An analysis of data from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II (IFPS II) examined the effect of marketing, direct or through health professionals, on formula changes. The authors reported that formula changes were made for mainly non-health reasons (health reason was defined based on stool characteristic or diarrhoea, vomiting and fussiness). In our study, parental perception of their infant's appetite was the most reported reason for changing infant formula. This was followed by advice the mother had received from a healthcare professional (nurse or doctor) at either a routine appointment (such as vaccination or developmental assessment) or if the mother specifically requested to see a doctor over a concern with her child. The influence of healthcare professionals on formula feeding practices was mainly observed at 2 months of age. At 6 and 12 months more mothers reported that they followed the label guidelines on the infant formula containers or from the helpline of the infant formula company than advice from a healthcare professional in their reason for changing their infant's formula. This brings to attention the influence of marketing from infant formula companies on changing infant formula.

### Effects of infant formula with human milk oligosaccharides on growth and morbidity: a randomized multicenter trial [^6daf2618]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Growth

In the PP population, adjusted mean (SE) weight gain through age 4 months was 29.84 (0.60) g/day for infants fed the test formula and 30.15 (0.58) g/day for those fed control (Table 2). Mean difference (95% CI) in weight gain between groups was −0.30 (−1.94, 1.34) g/day, with the lower limit of the 95% CI above the predefined noninferiority margin of −3 g/day, indicating similar weight gain in the 2 groups. Results were similar in the ITT population. Mean weight, length, head circumference, and BMI were not significantly different between groups at any study visit (see Supplemental Digital Content 3). Likewise, mean weight-for-age, length-for-age, head circumference-for-age, and BMI-for-age z scores (Fig. 2) did not differ significantly between the groups at any study visit and tracked closely with the WHO growth standards.

Triangles/dashed line = control; Circles/solid line = test. BMI = body mass index.

Formula Intake and Tolerance

Mean daily formula intake was similar between groups at all study visits. At age 4 months, mean intake was 908 mL in the test group and 929 mL in the control group (P = 0.54). GI symptoms, including flatulence, spitting-up and vomiting, were not significantly different at any study visit between the groups, indicating no association between type of formula and digestive tolerance. No differences were observed between the groups in the proportion of stools in each consistency category. Comparison of mean ± SE stool consistency ratings showed that the test group had a tendency toward softer stools at 1 month (5.9 ± 0.2 vs 5.5 ± 0.2, P = 0.064) and had significantly softer stools at 2 months (6.1 ± 0.1 vs 5.7 ± 0.2, P = 0.021); no significant differences were observed at other visits. No significant differences in stool frequency were reported at any visit.

### Point-of-care ultrasound evaluation of suspected necrotizing enterocolitis in the ED [^ac987daf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a rare but life-threatening diagnosis in infants presenting with bilious emesis, abdominal distension, or bloody stools. Ultrasonography has been advocated as an alternative initial imaging modality to abdominal radiography, and may be superior in the evaluation of NEC. We describe the use of point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) in the evaluation of suspected NEC in the emergency department (ED) when the ability to obtain immediate abdominal x-ray (AXR) was delayed due to pandemic conditions. A pre-term infant with history of bowel resection presented with non-bilious emesis, bloody stools, and slight abdominal distension. Evaluation with PoCUS identified pneumatosis intestinalis and pneumoperitoneum, which were confirmed on subsequent AXR. Pneumatosis intestinalis in a neonate is highly suggestive of NEC, but seen by itself, can be associated with milk protein allergy and Food Protein Induced Enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES). Pneumoperitoneum is considered an indication for operative intervention for NEC. The infant was re-admitted to the NICU for suspected NEC. NEC is a rare, but potentially surgical diagnosis in infants as can be FPIES, but not milk protein allergy. NEC can be identifiable using PoCUS to search for a constellation of findings that include pneumatosis intestinalis, pneumoperitoneum, free peritoneal fluid, and portal venous gas. These findings have been previously described in the PoCUS literature for other diseases, but not for a case of suspected NEC presenting to the ED.
