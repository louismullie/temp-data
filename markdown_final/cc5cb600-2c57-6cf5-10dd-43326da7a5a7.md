## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnostic test is most appropriate next for a 75-year-old man with atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and dyslipidemia who presents with severe abdominal pain worsened by eating, leukocytosis, and metabolic acidosis, and no peritoneal signs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-priority diagnosis given the clinical phenotype and risk factors. Then, I should verify which diagnostic modality is recommended first-line for that condition. Next, I will examine why the alternative options are less appropriate or potentially harmful. Finally, I will confirm the urgency and outline immediate concurrent steps in management while awaiting imaging results [^35cca917] [^2a87f0d6].

> Let me first confirm the leading diagnosis. Severe abdominal pain out of proportion to physical findings in an older adult with cardiovascular comorbidity — especially atrial fibrillation — should trigger a high suspicion for acute mesenteric ischemia, and the classic early pattern is pain without peritoneal signs because ischemia begins mucosally before transmural involvement, which fits this presentation precisely [^35cca917] [^d0e28fa5]. I should double-check the embolic risk: atrial fibrillation is a major source of emboli, and approximately half of embolic AMI cases occur in patients with AF, reinforcing the pretest probability here [^6dc20390].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line diagnostic test. Contemporary guidelines consistently recommend contrast-enhanced CT angiography as the imaging modality of choice for suspected acute mesenteric ischemia, ideally with multiphasic acquisition including arterial and venous phases to detect embolic or thrombotic occlusion, venous thrombosis, and bowel wall changes; plain radiographs are not recommended because they are insensitive early and only become abnormal late with perforation or pneumatosis [^2a87f0d6] [^a4a0c4ce]. I initially thought "triple-phase CT", but hold on, I should correct that terminology: the key is a contrast-enhanced CT angiography protocol with non-contrast, arterial, and delayed venous phases to optimize detection of arterial embolism, thrombosis, venous occlusion, and bowel compromise, which is the standard approach endorsed by WSES and emergency care reviews [^2a87f0d6] [^1d4a474d].

> I need to check why the alternatives are inferior. Angiography is invasive and is reserved for therapeutic intervention or when CT angiography is unavailable or contraindicated; it is not the appropriate first diagnostic step in the ED setting, so choosing angiography upfront would delay definitive noninvasive diagnosis and increase risk [^notfound]. Liver function tests are nonspecific and will not establish the diagnosis or guide urgent therapy in suspected AMI, so they would only distract from time-sensitive imaging and resuscitation [^notfound]. Colonoscopy is contraindicated in the acute setting of severe undifferentiated abdominal pain and would delay lifesaving imaging and revascularization decisions, so it is inappropriate here [^notfound]. Oral antibiotics are premature without a confirmed source and do not replace source control or revascularization in AMI; moreover, they could mask symptoms and delay definitive care, so they are not the next step [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stability. Even without peritoneal signs, this patient has high-risk features — elderly age, AF, CAD, severe pain, leukocytosis, and metabolic acidosis — so I should confirm that we are treating this as a vascular emergency with immediate resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and early multidisciplinary consultation while arranging emergent CTA, because delays worsen mortality and bowel salvage [^35cca917] [^1d4a474d]. I should double-check that labs alone cannot exclude AMI: lactate and D-dimer can be normal early, so normal values do not obviate the need for CTA when suspicion is high, which strengthens the case for immediate imaging rather than serial observation [^2a87f0d6] [^6dc20390].

> Putting this together, the most appropriate next step is a contrast-enhanced CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis to diagnose or exclude acute mesenteric ischemia and guide urgent management, while concurrently initiating resuscitation, antibiotics, and vascular/surgical consultation; therefore, the best answer is A. CT scan of the abdomen [^2a87f0d6] [^1d4a474d].

---

The most appropriate next step is **CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis** [^2a87f0d6] because it is the gold standard for diagnosing acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) [^dfcabbfe] and can rapidly identify arterial occlusion, bowel ischemia, or infarction [^1d4a474d]. Given the patient's atrial fibrillation, severe postprandial pain, and leukocytosis with metabolic acidosis, AMI is high on the differential [^35cca917]; early CTA enables timely revascularization or surgery, which reduces mortality [^c8344db7]. Angiography is invasive and reserved for intervention, colonoscopy is contraindicated in acute pain, and liver function tests or oral antibiotics will not establish the diagnosis or address the emergency [^c8344db7].

---

## Clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis

The patient's presentation — severe postprandial abdominal pain, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, leukocytosis, and metabolic acidosis — is classic for **acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI)** [^35cca917]. AMI is a vascular emergency with high mortality if not promptly diagnosed and treated [^1d4a474d]. The differential diagnosis also includes acute pancreatitis, perforated viscus, bowel obstruction, and ischemic colitis, but the clinical features and risk factors strongly favor AMI [^notfound].

---

## Role of CT angiography in AMI

CT angiography (CTA) is the **diagnostic gold standard** for AMI [^dfcabbfe], providing rapid, non-invasive visualization of mesenteric vessels and bowel wall changes [^1d4a474d]. CTA has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting arterial occlusion, venous thrombosis, and bowel ischemia or infarction [^43830d18]. Early CTA allows timely intervention — endovascular or surgical — significantly reducing mortality and morbidity [^c8344db7].

---

## Comparison with other diagnostic options

- **Angiography**: Invasive and reserved for therapeutic intervention, not initial diagnosis [^c8344db7].
- **Liver function tests**: Non-specific and do not address the vascular emergency [^notfound].
- **Colonoscopy**: Contraindicated in acute severe abdominal pain due to risk of perforation and inability to visualize small bowel ischemia [^notfound].
- **Oral antibiotics**: Do not establish diagnosis or address the underlying vascular pathology [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and the European Society of Vascular Surgery (ESVS) recommend **CTA as the first-line diagnostic test** for suspected AMI [^2a87f0d6]. They emphasize early CTA in patients with severe abdominal pain, especially when risk factors such as atrial fibrillation are present [^d0e28fa5].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's high-risk profile and classic presentation, **CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis** is the most appropriate next step [^2a87f0d6]. It provides rapid, accurate diagnosis and guides timely intervention, which is critical for improving outcomes in AMI [^c8344db7].

RECOGNIZE

A. Early diagnosis of AMI can be challenging, as the symptoms often mimic other abdominal pathologies. A complete history and physical examination will help establish the differential diagnosis. Severe poorly localized midabdominal pain is a hallmark of AMI; in the absence of peritonitis on examination, this constitutes the classic "pain out of proportion to physical findings". The abrupt onset of pain is consistent with acute arterial occlusion, whereas NOMI or MVT may have a more insidious presentation. A history of postprandial pain, weight loss, and food fear is consistent with chronic mesenteric ischemia, which may progress to acute arterial thrombosis. Atrial fibrillation is a common underlying etiology of embolic AMI. Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia is due to low cardiac output, vasoconstriction, or hypovolemia. It may be seen in hospitalized critically ill patients or in patients presenting to the emergency department with severe recent illness that might have led to sepsis or dehydration. Mesenteric venous thrombosis is typically seen in patients with one or more of Virchow's triad (stasis, hypercoagulability, endothelial damage), which may be associated with diseases such as pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, portal hypertension, and liver disease; it may also be seen after splenectomy or bariatric surgery.

B. Laboratory tests are invariably obtained in patients with acute abdominal pain, but it is important to recognize that no biomarkers are adequately sensitive or specific enough to diagnose or exclude AMI. A complete blood count and comprehensive chemistry panel can help identify inflammatory and metabolic disturbances. Lactate and D-dimer tests may be helpful if they are abnormal. Lactate level is often obtained in the setting of abdominal pain or sepsis and is frequently elevated in patients with AMI; lactate > 2 mmol/L is associated with increased mortality. However, a normal lactate does not exclude AMI or obviate the need for diagnostic imaging in the appropriate clinical setting.– The D-dimer has low specificity but high sensitivity, and a normal level is reassuring but cannot be completely relied upon. Noteworthy pitfalls in laboratory testing include the findings of elevated amylase or troponin I levels. They can both be elevated in the setting of AMI and may incorrectly lead the clinician toward a diagnosis of pancreatitis or acute coronary syndrome.

Early primary assessment and abdominal examination can often be enough to triage the patient with abdominal pain into those with less severe underlying pathologic condition from those with more acute findings. A focused history of the patient can then allow the clinician to develop their differential diagnosis. Once the differential diagnoses are determined, diagnostic imaging and laboratory findings can help confirm the diagnosis and allow for expeditious treatment and intervention.

### Mesenteric ischemia [^ac68b7ac]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

MI remains a highly lethal entity. Improving survival requires an aggressive, multidisciplinary approach. High-risk patients with severe abdominal pain and a paucity of physical findings should be undergo emergent imaging in a search for this disease. Improvements in laboratory tests and advances in imaging techniques may improve the ability to diagnose MI earlier in its course, before irreversible damage has occurred. Many treatment modalities are available and should be tailored to each individual case. By recognizing and preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury, the cycle of protracted complications may be broken. A decrease in the mortality from MI finally is occurring. Early recognition and aggressive treatment finally may allow clinicians to have a marked impact on patient survival.

CONCLUSION

The early management of patients with AP depends on vigilance and early moderately aggressive IV hydration guided by Do Not Miss the Goal Therapy. We strongly advocate for the importance of close monitoring vital signs and avoid a rising BUN, HCT, and/or the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Managing patients with AP requires careful identification of risk factors of severe disease, initiation of moderately aggressive IV hydration, and frequent, thoughtful, reassessment of the patient, especially in the first 48 hours.

### Acute mesenteric ischemia: updated guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^35cca917]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

The etiology of AMI has changed over the years with increasing percentages of acute arterial thrombosis due to atherosclerosis which may in part be explained by modern anticoagulant therapy used for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.

The incidence of AMI increases exponentially with age. In patients aged 75 years or older, AMI is a more prevalent cause of acute abdomen than appendicitis. The incidence of AMI in an 80-year-old is roughly tenfold that of a 60-year-old patient.

Abdominal compartment syndrome with very high intraabdominal pressure may cause bowel ischemia that is complicated with ischemia–reperfusion injury when decompression laparotomy is performed.

AMI has been described in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID -19), probably related to large vessel thromboembolic events as well as to small vessel thrombosis linked to hypercoagulability and fibrinolysis shutdown.
Severe abdominal pain out of proportion to physical examination findings should be assumed to be AMI until disproven. (Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence 1C)

The key to early diagnosis is a high level of clinical suspicion.

The clinical scenario of a patient complaining of excruciating abdominal pain with an unrevealing abdominal examination is classic for early AMI. The reason for the pain being disproportionate to the clinical findings is that ischemia starts from the mucosa toward the serosa. That is why initially there is severe pain without clinical findings.

If the physical examination demonstrates signs of peritonitis, there is likely irreversible intestinal ischemia with bowel necrosis. In a study on AMI, 95% of patients presented with abdominal pain, 44% with nausea, 35% with vomiting, 35% with diarrhea, and 16% with blood per rectum. Approximately, one-third of patients present with the triad of abdominal pain, fever, and hemoccult-positive stool. Other patients, particularly those with delayed diagnosis, may present in extremis with septic shock. Clinical signs of peritonitis may be subtle. Accordingly, one must have a high index of suspicion, because such findings are predictive of intestinal infarction.

Colon ischemia (CI) — risk factors for poor outcomes include epidemiologic factors such as "antimicrobial therapy for CI, hepatitis C positivity, history of cancer, male gender, and warfarin use at the time of the diagnosis". Presentations linked to poor outcome include "abdominal pain without rectal bleeding, nonbloody diarrhea, peritoneal signs on physical examination and symptom onset after admission". Vital sign and laboratory thresholds associated with surgical intervention and/or mortality are "A heart rate of > 100 beats per min and systolic blood pressure of < 90 mm Hg" and "Hgb < 12 mg/dl, hyponatremia (Na < 136 meq/l [mmol/l]), LDH > 450 U/l, and blood urea nitrogen (> 28 mg/dl [mmol/l])". Distribution factors also matter, as "pancolonic distribution of disease and IRCI also portend a poor outcome", and "The use of antimicrobial therapy is likely an indicator of the clinician's response to disease severity rather than the antibiotic therapy per se contributing to poor outcome".

GRACE-2 scope and purpose — intended population and setting specify an evidence-based, transparent approach for clinicians for the evaluation and management of adult patients with low-risk recurrent undifferentiated abdominal pain in the ED. The guideline is not intended for patients with unstable vital signs or significant history or physical examination findings suggesting acute abdominal pathology or other risk factors for severe abdominal disease, and it is also not intended for new, acute presentations with only short-term recurrence such as evolving appendicitis presenting on two or more occasions over a few days. The intended population includes adults with multiple similar presentations of abdominal signs and symptoms recurring over months or years, and GRACE-2 is designed for application in the United States in settings with access to advanced diagnostic imaging, laboratory testing, and specialty referral, noting that differences in international or rural U.S. settings may make recommendations less applicable.

### Mesenteric ischemia: a deadly miss [^dfcabbfe]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Mesenteric ischemia has 4 etiologies: arterial embolus, arterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis, and nonocclusive. No history or physical examination finding can definitively diagnose the condition. A wide variety of presentations occur. Pain out of proportion and gut emptying may occur early, with minimal tenderness. Once transmural infarction occurs, peritoneal findings and tenderness to palpation may occur. Physicians must be suspicious of pain out of proportion and scrutinize risk factors. Computed tomography angiography is the best imaging modality. Treatment requires surgery and interventional radiology consultation, intravenous antibiotics and fluids, and anticoagulation. The physician at the bedside is the best diagnostic tool.

Classification of disease severity and management — colon ischemia (CI) defines mild, moderate, and severe categories with paired treatments. Mild disease is characterized by "Typical symptoms of CI with a segmental colitis not isolated to the right colon and with none of the commonly associated risk factors for poorer outcome that are seen in moderate disease", with treatment listing "Observation" and "Supportive care". Moderate disease applies to "Any patient with CI and up to three of the following factors:" male gender; Hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg); Tachycardia (heart rate > 100 beats/min); Abdominal pain without rectal bleeding; blood urea nitrogen (BUN) > 20 mg/dl; hemoglobin (Hgb) < 12 g/dl; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > 350 U/l; serum sodium < 136 mEq/l (mmol/l); white blood cell count (WBC) > 15 cells/cmm (x10^3/l); or colonic mucosal ulceration identified colonoscopically, and treatment includes "Correction of cardiovascular abnormalities (e.g., volume replacement)", "Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy", and "Surgical consultation". Severe disease includes "Any patient with CI and more than three of the criteria for moderate disease or any of the following:" peritoneal signs on physical examination; pneumatosis or portal venous gas on radiologic imaging; gangrene on colonoscopy examination; or pancolonic distribution or isolated right-colon ischemia (IRCI) on imaging or colonoscopy, with treatment including "Emergent surgical consultation (treatment is likely to be surgical)", "Transfer to intensive care unit", "Correction of cardiovascular abnormalities (e.g., volume replacement)", and "Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy".

Australasian Society for Infectious Disease

Triaging severity in the Australasian Society for Infectious Disease guidelines from 2016 was broader than some of the other recent guidelines (Table 8). They once again provided an extensive list of important factors, including clinical (e.g. fever > 38.5°C, hemodynamic instability, peritonitis, ileus, or megacolon), laboratory (e.g. WBC > 15 × 10 9 /l and > 20% neutrophils, elevated lactate level, rise in creatinine > 50% above baseline, albumin < 25 mg/dl), and others (e.g. large intestine distension, colonic wall thickening, fat stranding, unexplained ascites, and pseudomembranes seen on colonoscopy). If a patient had one or more of these factors, these guidelines classified them as having severe disease. While this is an inclusive approach, many clinicians might not be able to remember this extensive list of factors, so this approach might be more challenging to apply clinically when compared with the IDSA usage of WBC and Cr from 2010, the ACG's usage of decreased albumin with either abdominal tenderness or elevated WBC in 2013, or the European 2014 recommendations to use all three.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Mesenteric arterial disease — acute intestinal ischemia caused by arterial obstruction is diagnosed and treated as follows: Patients with acute abdominal pain out of proportion to physical findings and a history of cardiovascular disease should be suspected of having acute intestinal ischemia, and those with acute abdominal pain after arterial interventions that traverse the visceral aorta or any proximal arteries or who have arrhythmias (such as atrial fibrillation) or recent MI should also be suspected. In contrast to chronic intestinal ischemia, duplex sonography of the abdomen is not an appropriate diagnostic tool for suspected acute intestinal ischemia. Surgical treatment of acute obstructive intestinal ischemia includes revascularization, resection of necrotic bowel, and, when appropriate, a "second look" operation 24 to 48 hours after the revascularization. Percutaneous interventions (transcatheter lytic therapy, balloon angioplasty, stenting) are appropriate in selected patients with acute intestinal ischemia caused by arterial obstructions, and patients so treated may still require laparotomy.

### Gastrointestinal disorders in elderly patients [^b52df5ca]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal disorders are common in elderly patients, and the clinical presentation, complications, and management may differ from those in younger patient. Most impairment occurs in the proximal and distal tract of the gastrointestinal system. Swallowing abnormalities with a wide span of symptoms and pelvic floor pathologies involving all the pelvic compartments are common. Acute abdomen, often from small bowel obstruction or mesenteric ischemia, can pose a diagnostic challenge, because a mild clinical presentation may hide serious visceral involvement. In this setting, the radiologist often is asked to suggest the appropriate management options and to guide the management.

Case Summary

A healthy 65-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 12-hour history of sudden-onset severe lower abdominal pain. This is her first episode. She reports nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. Her last colonoscopy was at age 60, and was normal, except for diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. Physical examination is significant for fever, tachycardia, and generalized abdominal pain with rebound tenderness. Pertinent laboratory findings include a leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A CT scan is obtained and is consistent with freely perforated diverticulitis, including a thickened sigmoid colon, free fluid in the pelvis, and free air noted near the diaphragm (). The surgeon completes the patient evaluation, recommends initiation of intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotics, and plans to go immediately to the operating room for surgical resection.

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) constitutes a life-threatening problem that can result in death, multiorgan failure, and severe nutritional disability. Although AMI is a rare cause of acute abdominal emergencies, ranging between 1 and 2 individuals per 10,000, the morbidity and mortality rates are high. Arterial embolic etiology composes nearly one-half of AMIs, with a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain considered the most common symptom. Arterial thrombosis is the second most common cause of AMI, which presents similarly to arterial embolic AMI, although often more severe due to anatomic differences. Veno-occlusive causes of AMI are the third most common and are associated with an insidious onset of vague abdominal pain. Each patient is unique, and the treatment plan should be tailored to their individual needs. This may include considering the patient's age, comorbidities, and overall health, as well as their preferences and personal circumstances. A multidisciplinary approach involving specialists from different fields, such as surgeons, interventional radiologists, and intensivists, is recommended for the best possible outcome. Potential challenges in tailoring an optimal treatment plan for AMI may include delayed diagnosis, limited availability of specialized care, or patient factors that make some interventions less feasible. Addressing these challenges requires a proactive and collaborative approach, with regular review and adjustment of the treatment plan as needed to ensure the best possible outcome for each patient.

### Intraperitoneal ampicillin treatment for peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis with Listeria monocytogenes-a case report [^c5745d70]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 72-year-old man with chronic kidney disease stage 5 dialysis (CKDG5D) secondary to hypertension and diabetes was hospitalised in April 2020, reporting abdominal pain and fever after noticing cloudy PD effluent 3 days before hospitalisation.

The initial physical examination showed that the patient's general condition was reduced and that he was obese (body mass index [BMI], 34.5). He had a fever of 38.5 °C. His blood pressure was 116/74 mmHg, his heart rate was 80 beats per minute, his respiratory rate was 14 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation was 96% without supplementation. He reported no vomiting, nausea, or diarrhoea. There were no signs of meningeal irritation. Examination showed strong, diffuse abdominal tenderness with maximal pain in the right lower abdomen. The PD catheter exit site was clean and dry, and there was no tunnel tenderness.

The patien t's medical history included type 2 diabetes (first diagnosed in 2012, insulin-dependent since 2018), hypertension, severe coronary heart disease requiring multiple revascularizing procedures (including bypass surgery), and persistent atrial fibrillation necessitating implantation of a cardiac pacemaker and a left atrial appendage (LAA) occluder. The patient had required continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) since June 2018 and had not experienced any previous dialysis-related infections or other complications.

During the course of this infection, an outpatient analysis of the PD effluent found a leukocyte count of 11,000/nL. At the time of hospital admission, the first PD effluent was cloudy, with a leukocyte count of 7060/nL. Initial blood tests found elevated levels of indicators of inflammation: C-reactive protein (CRP), 17.5 mg/dL (normal, < 0.5 mg/dL); procalcitonin (PCT), 3.22 ng/mL (normal, < 0.5 ng/mL). Blood gas analysis found a serum lactate level of 2.4 mmol/L (normal, < 1.2 mmol/L) but no acidosis or electrolyte disorders. The urine test strip results were negative for leukocytes and nitrites.

### Case report: direct revascularization in acute mesenteric ischemia by an endovascular approach [^87042c23]. CVIR Endovascular (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute mesenteric ischemia is a relatively rare but life-threatening clinical condition. Outcome depends on early diagnosis and prompt intervention.

Case Presentation

A 85-year-old man and a 75-year-old woman developed acute mesenteric ischemia due to cardiac embolism. The first patient received an insufficient dose of anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation and the second patient dicontinued her anticoagulantia to avoid bleeding during a routine colonoscopy. Both patients presented with severe abdominal pain and computed tomography showed thrombus in de superior mesenteric artery. Successfulrevascularization with good clinical outcome was achieved by means of an endovascular first approach.

Conclusion

This case report shows that an endovascular approach - in contrast to open surgery - not only enables to revascularize main trunk lesions but can also facilitate revascularization of side branches. Endovascular treatment used to be limited to a selected group of patients without signs of bowel necrosis, but there is a tendency to initiate endovascular revascularization in all patients because it is associated with a reduced mortality, a reduced laparotomy rate and reduction in the resected length of bowel.

### Ischemic bowel disease in the elderly [^7804cb57]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The ischemic bowel diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders usually seen in elderly individuals. They represent ischemic damage to different portions [figure: see text] of the bowel and produce a variety of clinical syndromes and outcomes. Colonic ischemia is the commonest of these disorders and has a favorable prognosis in most cases. In contrast, acute mesenteric ischemia, most commonly caused by a superior mesenteric artery embolus, is a disease with a poor prognosis. Acute mesenteric ischemia secondary to nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia usually is a [figure: see text] catastrophic complication of other severe medical illnesses, most notably atherosclerosis. Proper diagnosis and management of patients with ischemic bowel disease requires vigilance on the part of the physician and a willingness to embark on an aggressive plan of diagnosis and management in the appropriate setting.

### A rational approach to the patient with hematochezia [^a5bf53cd]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hematochezia is a common clinical presentation, with significant morbidity and economic burden. These patients often require costly interventions including hospitalization, blood transfusions, and radiologic or endoscopic procedures. The purpose of this review is to give a rational, concise approach to the patient with hematochezia, with special consideration of recent advances in the literature.

Recent Findings

Recent studies pertaining to hematochezia have evaluated risk stratification, endoscopic intervention, evaluation of small bowel bleeding, and management of anticoagulation.

Summary

A step-wise approach to hematochezia helps determine the cause and provide the appropriate management of these patients. We propose five steps beginning with hemodynamic assessment and risk stratification, then focused history and physical examination, endoscopic intervention when warranted, and consideration of small bowel bleeding in selected instances.

Nearly 50% of patients presenting with embolic AMI have atrial fibrillation, and approximately one-third of patients have a prior history of arterial embolus with preexisted peripheral vascular disease.

Risk factors for specific phenotypes of AMI are presented in Table 1.
3 Plain X-ray is not recommended in evaluating patients for intestinal ischemia. (Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence 1B)

Table 1
Risk factors for specific types of AMI

AMI Acute mesenteric ischemia; NOMI Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia; MI Myocardial infarction; SMA Superior mesenteric artery; IMA Inferior mesenteric artery; GI Gastrointestinal; and VTE Venous thromboembolism

A radiograph is usually the initial test ordered in patients with acute abdominal pain but has a limited role in the diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia, especially in the early setting. A negative radiograph does not exclude mesenteric ischemia. Plain radiography only becomes positive when bowel infarction has developed and intestinal perforation manifests as free intraperitoneal air.
4 There are no laboratory parameters that are sufficiently accurate to conclusively identify the presence or absence of ischemic or necrotic bowel, although elevated l-lactate, leukocytosis, and D-dimer may assist. (Weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence 2B)

Although laboratory results are not definitive, they may help to corroborate clinical suspicion. More than 90% of patients will have an abnormally elevated leukocyte count. The second most commonly encountered abnormal finding is metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate level, which occurs in 88%.

Patients may present with lactic acidosis due to dehydration and decreased oral intake. Thus, differentiation of early ischemia versus irreversible bowel injury based upon the lactate level alone is not reliable unless accompanied by other clinical evidence. Elevated serum lactate levels > 2 mmol/l is associated with irreversible intestinal ischemia hazard ratio: 4.1 (95% CI: 1.4–11.5; p < 0.01) in case of AMI.

It should be emphasized that the presence of lactic acidosis in combination with abdominal pain when the patient may not otherwise appear clinically ill should lead to consideration of early CTA.

### Secondary peritonitis: principles of diagnosis and intervention [^6f51c2fd]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Secondary peritonitis accounts for 1% of urgent or emergent hospital admissions and is the second leading cause of sepsis in patients in intensive care units globally. Overall mortality is 6%, but mortality rises to 35% in patients who develop severe sepsis. Despite the dramatic growth in the availability and use of imaging and laboratory tests, the rapid diagnosis and early management of peritonitis remains a challenge for physicians in emergency medicine, surgery, and critical care. In this article, we review the pathophysiology of peritonitis and its potential progression to sepsis, discuss the utility and limitations of the physical examination and laboratory and radiographic tests, and present a paradigm for the management of secondary peritonitis.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: a review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^69136c7d]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing diverticulitis requires an approach that considers atypical presentations in older adults (Figure 2). The 2022 European multi‐society guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of diverticulitis in older adults provide recommendations for how to incorporate these differences into clinical practice. They suggest avoiding diagnosis based solely on exam findings or laboratory results, as this may lead to underdiagnosis. Instead, cross‐sectional CT imaging with IV contrast is suggested for all patients older than 65 years with suspected diverticulitis. Obtaining a CT scan in every patient over 65 with abdominal pain and suspected diverticulitis may not be feasible, and this may be omitted in select cases with mild local symptoms and reliable close clinical follow‐up. However, patients with any systemic signs, including atypical symptoms such as fatigue, renal insufficiency, chest pain, or syncope should be evaluated with CT imaging to rule out complicated disease that may require inpatient management or procedural intervention.

Case example part 1: A 78‐year‐old woman with atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, prior stroke, obesity, COPD and one prior episode of diverticulitis presents to clinic with 3 days of left lower quadrant abdominal pain, loose stools, anorexia, and fatigue. Physical exam reveals tachycardia to 105 with an irregular rhythm, fever to 38°C, and focal left lower quadrant tenderness. Her white blood cell count is 13,000 and creatinine is 1.4. Other laboratory values are normal. Given her systemic symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, in addition to her elevated creatinine, a CT scan is obtained which demonstrate acute uncomplicated diverticulitis.

### Non-enhancing bowel dilatation and secondary ileus on CT as a surgical red flag in geriatric patients with atypical presentations [^5db5bc1e]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Colonic pneumatosis intestinalis (CPI), a rare clinical entity pathologically defined by gas-filled cystic structures within the submucosal or subserosal layers of the bowel wall, is generally managed conservatively in hemodynamically stable patients without peritoneal signs or significant laboratory derangements. In contrast, mesenteric ischemia — though accounting For only 0.09–0.2% of acute abdominal emergencies requiring surgical admission — carries grave prognostic implications. Epidemiologically, colonic ischemia predominates among mesenteric vascular pathologies, with computed tomography (CT) angiography and endoscopic biopsy constituting the diagnostic mainstays. Anatomical vulnerability arises from three zones with minimal collateral circulation (splenic flexure, rectosigmoid junction, and ileocecal region), which are predisposed to non-occlusive ischemic injury during systemic hypoperfusion. Mesenteric ischemia has a median age of onset of approximately 70 years, with a mortality rate ranging from 50 to 66%. Even in some studies, the mortality rate is as high as 80%. Despite the advancements in radiology, vascular surgery and critical care medicine, the mortality rate and intestinal resection rate have remained unchanged for decades.

This case exemplifies the treacherous diagnostic landscape of ischemic bowel disease in elderly patients, where confounding factors such as blunted peritoneal signs, nonspecific biomarkers, and comorbidities often delay life-saving interventions. Through multidisciplinary synthesis of imaging findings, surgical exploration, and evidence-based protocols, we demonstrate critical strategies to mitigate mortality in this high-risk demographic.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: mesenteric ischemia [^1d4a474d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mesenteric ischemia is a rare, frequently misdiagnosed, serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of mesenteric ischemia, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Mesenteric ischemia is an abdominal vascular emergency that includes superior mesenteric arterial embolism, arterial thrombosis, venous mesenteric ischemia, and non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia. It is associated with a variety of risk factors including older age, cardiovascular disease, hypercoagulable state, and end-stage renal disease. The presentation depends on the underlying pathophysiology. While arterial embolic disease may present with sudden, severe pain, the early stages of the disease and other forms can present with vague symptoms, including generalized abdominal pain, weight loss, vomiting, and diarrhea. Laboratory testing can suggest the disease with leukocytosis and elevated lactate, but normal values should not be used to exclude the diagnosis. The imaging modality of choice is triple phase computed tomography with non-contrast, arterial, and delayed phases. The initial ED management includes fluid resuscitation, symptomatic therapy, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and anticoagulation. Emergent consultation with a multidisciplinary team including diagnostic and interventional radiologists and cardiovascular and general surgeons is necessary for definitive treatment.

Conclusions

An understanding of mesenteric ischemia can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this disease.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of inflammatory bowel disease in elderly patients: expert review [^3766d4af]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in elderly patients — initial evaluation and differential: When elderly persons present with symptoms such as diarrhea, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and weight loss, providers should have a strong clinical suspicion for IBD, but compared with persons younger than 40 years those older than 60 years are more likely to have mimics including colorectal cancer, ischemic colitis, segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug–induced pathology, radiation enteritis or colitis, or microscopic colitis. The first diagnostic steps should include laboratory investigations that include a complete blood count and serum albumin, serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein levels; liver enzymes and urea and creatinine levels serve to assess comorbidities and provide a baseline for toxicity monitoring. Stool testing for Clostridium difficile in all new presentations of diarrhea, regardless of antibiotic use history, and selective testing of stool for culture and ova and parasites may be appropriate. Cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography is appropriate in elderly persons with acute symptoms, especially when abdominal pain is prominent, and colonoscopy with histologic confirmation remains a cornerstone of diagnosis.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis presenting like acute mesenteric ischemia [^5e024163]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is a rare but serious complication of taking metformin. Making the diagnosis in the emergency department requires vigilance because the presentation can mimic other diseases.

Case Report

We present a case of a patient with diabetes who presented moribund with symptoms and signs consistent with mesenteric ischemia. This diagnosis was seemingly confirmed through computed tomography, and as a result the patient was brought to surgery for emergent exploratory laparotomy. Our patient made a remarkable recovery upon initiation of hemodialysis, demonstrating the need to initiate this life-saving procedure early. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Metformin levels are rarely available in the setting of the emergency department. Clinicians must remain alert, recognize that imaging studies may be misleading, and consider hemodialysis early in addition to surgical interventions.

Case presentation

A 52-year-old man with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease and end-stage renal disease under continuous ambulatory PD treatment for 3 years presented to the PD clinic with cloudy dialysate effluent and diffuse abdominal pain lasting 2 h. Two weeks before this presentation, he was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, which was treated with 400-mg oral moxifloxacin daily for 10 days. However, persistent intractable cough did not seem to improve. Two days before this presentation, he visited the emergent department due to epigastric pain and an intractable cough. He had no nausea, vomiting or fever. Physical examination showed epigastric tenderness without guarding and rebound pain. Laboratory studies indicated a white blood cell (WBC) count 12,000 cells/mm 3 with 87% neutrophils and 8% lymphocytes, hemoglobin 8.0 g/dL, alanine transaminase 35 U/L, amylase 19 U/L, total bilirubin 0.56 mg/dL, creatinine 16.7 mg/dL, sodium concentration 133 mEq/L and potassium concentration 4.2 mEq/L. Chest radiography indicated no signs of pneumonia. PD dialysate effluent analysis revealed WBC 2/μL without polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN). Abdominal ultrasonography only showed a distended gallbladder with sludge. Severe strains of abdominal muscles from persistent and intense cough were impressed. He was discharged with antitussives and analgesics.

### WSES consensus guidelines on sigmoid volvulus management [^a3b98309]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Recommendation 1: Initial evaluation should include a focused history and physical examination. A full panel of blood tests including blood gas and lactate levels are also important to look for suggestions of bowel ischemia. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation, based on low- or very-low-quality evidence, 1C.

Symptoms of sigmoid volvulus include abdominal pain, constipation and vomiting (a late sign). In 30–41% of cases, patients report previous episodes of abdominal distention. This triad is much more common in endemic volvulus, rather than the sporadic kind of volvulus (88% versus 33%).

In the "volvulus belt" countries, the clinical presentation may be acute with peritonitis and shock. In this fulminant clinical presentation, the prognosis is poor because colonic necrosis and perforation would possibly have already occurred, by the time the patient first presents for care. Conversely, in Western countries, the patient usually presents 3 to 4 days after the onset of symptoms. The classic patient is elderly, institutionalized and under psychotropic medications that causes chronic constipation. The history should elicit the above-mentioned risk factors, including a personal history of previous sigmoid volvulus, which is present in 30–40% of cases.

Classically, the clinical examination will identify abdominal distension, diminished bowel sounds and often an empty rectum on digital examination. However, the examination is often difficult due to the presence of abdominal distension, which is the result of colonic obstruction of several days duration; if there are no signs of peritoneal irritation, as is often the case, this may result in a delay in diagnosis. Nonetheless, the absence of peritonitis does not indicate the absence of bowel ischemia. Asymmetric gaseous abdominal distention associated with emptiness of the left iliac fossa is pathognomonic for sigmoid volvulus, though this can be very challenging to detect.

The duration of symptoms lasts from a few hours to several days. As these patients are typically old with comorbidities, any vomiting and dehydration can tip them over into renal insufficiency. Thus, blood testing of electrolytes and renal function is necessary.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation: part I. rate and… [^f61668b9]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia encountered in the primary care setting. Approximately 4 percent of persons in the general U. S. population have permanent or intermittent atrial fibrillation, and the prevalence of the arrhythmia increases to 9 percent in persons older than 60 years. 2 Atrial fibrillation can result in serious complications, including congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and thromboembolism. Recognition and acute management of atrial fibrillation in the physician's office or emergency department are important in preventing adverse consequences. Diagnosis The diagnosis of atrial fibrillation should be considered in elderly patients who present with complaints of shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations. The arrhythmia should also be suspected in patients with acute fatigue or exacerbation of congestive heart failure.

3 In some patients, atrial fibrillation may be identified on the basis of an irregularly irregular pulse or an electrocardiogram obtained for the evaluation of another condition. Cardiac conditions commonly associated with the development of atrial fibrillation include rheumatic mitral valve disease, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and hypertension. Noncardiac conditions that can predispose patients to develop atrial fibrillation include hyperthyroidism, hypoxia, alcohol intoxication, and surgery.
4. The calcium channel blockers diltiazem and verapamil are effective for initial ventricular rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation. These agents are given intravenously in bolus doses until the ventricular rate becomes slower. 7 Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, are not effective for ventricular rate control. 8, 16 A recent review 4 and a meta-analysis 17 concluded that flecainide, ibutilide, and dofetilide were the most efficacious agents for medical conversion of atrial fibrillation, but that propafenone and quinidine were also effective. In the presence of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, procainamide is the drug of choice for converting atrial fibrillation.

Take-home message

A key to improve management of AMI is awareness, allowing adequately raised and communicated suspicion followed by early diagnosis and treatment. CT with intravenous contrast enhancement and imaging in the arterial phase followed by early revascularization in case of arterial occlusion carries the potential to rescue the bowel, whereas early systemic treatment optimizing volume status and organ perfusion is important for all subtypes of AMI, but most crucial for NOMI. Selection of initial management requires a multidisciplinary approach and cannot be based on time alone.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) severity assessment — patients should be evaluated to determine the severity of CDI and for the presence of peritonitis or multisystem organ failure. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Clinical assessment and laboratory testing (complete blood count and renal and liver function) are typically performed to evaluate the patient and to help identify potential organ failure and associated sepsis, and a significant leukocytosis typically raises the suspicion for CDI but is not considered pathognomonic. The stratification of the severity of CDI as mild/nonsevere, severe, or severe-complicated/fulminant is loosely defined; diarrhea, leukocytosis (but less than 15 x 10^3/μL), and abdominal pain with positive testing for C difficile in the absence of hypotension or organ failure such as kidney injury is typically defined as mild disease, whereas severe CDI typically includes an elevated creatinine or leukocytosis over 15 x 10^3/μL.

### Improving clinical suspicion of acute mesenteric ischemia among patients with acute abdomen: a cross-sectional study from an intestinal stroke center [^43830d18]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite constant improvements in diagnostic, interventional, and surgical techniques, AMI remains a life-threatening emergency with high mortality rates. Misdiagnosis or a delayed diagnosis are the most important predictors of patient outcomes. Indeed, no specific clinical or biological signs have proven to be sufficiently sensitive or specific to suggest the diagnosis in the emergency setting. As a result, the early recognition of AMI is still a major clinical challenge and relies on a high index of clinical and radiological suspicion before confirmation on a multiphasic CT scan. Although CT-scan is widely available in the emergency setting and reported to have excellent performance for AMI diagnosis, timely clinical suspicion and the selection of patients requiring a CT scan is still challenging. Furthermore, lower sensitivity of CT scans has been observed in real-life clinical settings when the CT-scan protocol does not include both arterial and venous phases. In underdiagnosed or doubtful cases, explorative laparoscopy can then help confirm the diagnosis, and signs of irreversible transmural intestinal necrosis (organ failure, elevated serum lactate concentrations, small bowel dilatation, or perforation on CT) should prompt laparotomy. Based on observational studies, the recent guidelines recommend that "severe abdominal pain out of proportion to physical examination findings should be assumed to be AMI until disproven". As a reminder of the importance of the clinical exam and clinical suspicion in the diagnosis of AMI, our study provides prospective and comparative evidence further supporting this recommendation, and suggests that suspicion of an AMI diagnosis be raised in the presence of any acute abdominal pain when at least one of these two factors is present: (1) a reported sudden onset or (2) the requirement for morphine. As the discriminative weight of epidemiological and biological factors was insufficient, we suggest the diagnosis be evoked irrespective of the patients' age, prior cardiovascular history, or laboratory values (such as CRP or-lactate levels). In the absence of a validated available diagnostic biomarker of AMI, broad and timely clinical suspicion and subsequent confirmation by an appropriate multiphasic CT scan is currently the only way to achieve an earlier diagnosis and better outcomes.

REVASCULARIZE

Early and effective revascularization can significantly reduce mortality and improve patient outcomes. In most cases, we recommend completing revascularization prior to making decisions on bowel resection; exceptions are discussed hereinafter. Acute mesenteric ischemia generally falls into one of four categories (arterial embolism, arterial thrombosis, NOMI, and MVT), the relative distribution of which depends upon the patient population being served in an individual hospital. The revascularization approach and subsequent steps depend on the type of insult and the patient's physiology. Anticoagulation should be considered at the time of diagnosis unless there is an absolute contraindication.

F. Arterial embolism accounts for roughly 25% of all AMI diagnoses and has been decreasing in recent decades. The source of the embolus is typically the heart or the aorta; approximately 50% of patients have concurrent atrial fibrillation, and 33% have a history of previous emboli. Emboli typically lodge at points of normal anatomic vessel narrowing, and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is commonly involved because of its relatively large diameter and low takeoff angle. More than 20% of SMA emboli are associated with concurrent emboli, most commonly to the kidney and spleen. For arterial embolism, embolectomy is generally preferred. Thrombolytic therapy is an option, but it is not recommended as it may take hours to days to lyse clot and risks progression of bowel ischemia. Postintervention antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy may be beneficial in the setting of small-vessel thrombosis and is recommended as long as the source of potential emboli remains.

G. Arterial thrombosis has increased in recent decades, accounting for about 40% of all cases. The gradual formation of plaque can eventually progress to critical stenosis with thrombosis of mesenteric vessels, and patients with acute on chronic disease will often have concurrent atherosclerosis and stenosis of the celiac artery. Thrombosis typically occurs at the origin of the celiac trunk, SMA, and inferior mesenteric artery. Endovascular treatment options include thrombectomy and angioplasty with or without stenting. Compared with open techniques, endovascular revascularization is associated with lower short -and long-term mortality; however, there is no significant difference in the need for second-look laparoscopy or laparotomy. – If bypass is performed, antegrade is preferred over retrograde because of a lower reintervention rate. If the patient has shock, peritonitis, or evidence of bowel necrosis on CT, then a joint procedure is recommended, including open revascularization, to reduce time to resection of necrotic intestine.
