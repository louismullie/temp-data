Celiac disease

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a synthesis of celiac disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and pathophysiology to anchor the clinical framework. Then, I should verify epidemiology and risk groups to guide screening. Next, I will review clinical manifestations and the differential. After that, I need to examine the diagnostic algorithm, including when biopsy can be omitted. Then, I will outline management, adherence assessment, and follow-up. I should also address nonresponsive and refractory disease, including pharmacotherapy. Finally, I will consider special populations, emerging therapies, and controversies, and close with a concise summary and takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition and pathophysiology. Celiac disease is a permanent, immune-mediated inflammatory enteropathy triggered by gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible individuals, characterized by small-intestinal villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia, with highly disease-specific autoantibodies directed against tissue transglutaminase and endomysium; HLA-DQ2/DQ8 are necessary but not sufficient, and both innate and adaptive immune responses contribute to mucosal injury, which resolves with strict gluten withdrawal [^1133y7Qs] [^1117GLbq] [^111VRmaY].

> I need to check the epidemiology and who warrants screening. Prevalence hovers around 1% globally and in the US, with rising detection over decades; underdiagnosis remains substantial, so case finding in higher-prevalence clinical contexts is favored over mass screening, which is not recommended by major societies due to poor net benefit and WHO screening criteria not being met [^1133y7Qs] [^111VRmaY] [^117ThzDf] [^116Fw8sh]. Hold on, I should verify the high-risk groups: first-degree relatives, autoimmune thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, osteoporosis, chronic diarrhea or malabsorption, dermatitis herpetiformis, and Down or Turner syndromes are key settings where testing should be considered [^113y34Dt] [^11229cKk].

> Next, I will review clinical manifestations, but wait, let me verify the heterogeneity. Typical GI features include diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss, bloating, and abdominal pain, yet many patients present with extra-intestinal findings such as iron deficiency anemia, osteoporosis, abnormal liver tests, neuropathy, infertility, and aphthous ulcers; importantly, some patients are asymptomatic or have subtle symptoms, which contributes to delays in diagnosis [^1117GLbq] [^111VRmaY] [^114R4zd3].

> I will now examine the diagnostic algorithm, and I need to ensure I anchor it to a gluten-containing diet. Serologic screening with high-sensitivity IgA anti–tissue transglutaminase is first-line, with reflex IgA measurement to avoid false negatives in IgA deficiency; positive serology should prompt endoscopy with multiple duodenal biopsies for confirmation in most patients, ideally while continuing gluten to avoid false negatives [^1117GLbq] [^113E41WA]. Hold on, I should verify the no-biopsy pathway: in selected children with very high TTG IgA titers (typically > 10× ULN) plus positive EMA on a separate sample, a no-biopsy diagnosis may be acceptable; in adults, a no-biopsy strategy is not standard but may be considered in exceptional circumstances after shared decision-making and careful exclusion of mimics [^113E41WA] [^1117GLbq]. Let me double-check the role of HLA typing: it is not diagnostic but can be useful when serology is discordant or to exclude disease in low-pretest-probability scenarios, given its high negative predictive value [^112Q81K4].

> Now, I should review management, and I need to confirm the cornerstone. A strict, lifelong gluten-free diet is the only proven therapy and leads to mucosal healing and symptom resolution in most patients; education by a registered dietitian is essential, and oats can be introduced cautiously in most but may be immunogenic in a subset, warranting symptom monitoring [^1117GLbq] [^113QPaj9] [^111HaK1Y]. Wait, let me verify adherence assessment: structured dietitian interviews remain the standard, while gluten immunogenic peptide testing in stool or urine is promising but not yet a substitute for clinical and serologic follow-up, and its impact on outcomes remains under study [^116YxFMy] [^115v5jic].

> Next, I should review follow-up and monitoring, and I need to ensure cadence aligns with guidelines. Initial follow-up at 3–6 months and again at 12 months is reasonable, with periodic serology to document antibody decline and assessment of nutritional status; seronegativity increases the likelihood of mucosal healing but does not guarantee it, and repeat endoscopy with biopsies can be considered after about 2 years in adults to document mucosal recovery, especially if symptoms persist or if shared decision-making favors it [^1169agCp] [^112jf3cr] [^114P83Es] [^111RzP2g]. Hold on, I should verify the care team: multidisciplinary management with gastroenterology and dietetics improves adherence and outcomes, and team-based follow-up is emphasized in contemporary guidance [^1159wRrV] [^112jf3cr].

> I will now examine nonresponsive celiac disease, and I need to ensure a systematic approach. First, confirm the original diagnosis and exclude alternative etiologies of villous atrophy or mimics; then, verify strict adherence with dietitian review and consider gluten immunogenic peptide testing; next, repeat duodenal biopsies to distinguish ongoing injury from alternative pathology; finally, evaluate for common coexisting conditions such as microscopic colitis, IBD, SIBO, lactose/fructose malabsorption, and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, treating accordingly [^112Q81K4] [^116v7sZP] [^114gd22p]. Wait, let me verify the role of colonoscopy in persistent diarrhea: it is indicated to evaluate for microscopic colitis and IBD, which are more frequent in celiac populations and can perpetuate symptoms despite a GFD [^116v7sZP].

> For refractory celiac disease, I should confirm the definition and subtyping. RCD is defined by persistent malabsorption and villous atrophy despite at least 12 months of strict GFD and exclusion of other causes; subtyping into RCD1 (normal IEL phenotype) and RCD2 (clonal aberrant IELs) via flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry is critical because RCD2 carries a worse prognosis and different therapeutic implications [^113f6swB] [^114iadfN]. Let me think about first-line therapy: open-capsule budesonide 3 mg three times daily achieves high clinical and histologic response rates and is preferred over systemic steroids when available; prednisone 40–60 mg daily with a slow taper is an alternative, and immunomodulators such as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine may be added for steroid-dependent or recurrent disease in RCD1 [^113S3NWM] [^113hNFrh]. Hold on, I should verify RCD2 options: cladribine and autologous stem cell transplantation have evidence in small series but carry significant risks and should be managed in specialized centers with multidisciplinary care and consideration of clinical trials [^113hNFrh] [^116Ur2PU].

> I need to ensure special populations are addressed. In children, growth velocity and anthropometrics are key response markers; nonbiopsy diagnosis is acceptable only with stringent serologic criteria and careful clinical correlation, and adolescents are at particular risk for nonadherence, necessitating targeted education and support [^1117GLbq] [^113se28c]. Let me reconsider pregnancy and fertility: untreated celiac disease is associated with infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes, so preconception optimization of the GFD and nutritional status is important [^11229cKk]. For elderly patients, I should double-check that atypical presentations and comorbidities are common, which can delay diagnosis and complicate management [^111Yyytc].

> Next, I should review emerging therapies and future directions, but wait, I must not jump to conclusions. Multiple pharmacologic strategies are in development, including glutenase enzymes, tight junction modulators, transglutaminase inhibitors, and immune tolerance induction; none are approved as replacements for the GFD, and phase 3 trials are needed to define safety, durability, and where they fit alongside diet therapy [^11289Rvf] [^116YcoXt] [^114p5PCw]. I should confirm that current guidance still positions these as adjuncts or for refractory scenarios pending robust outcomes data [^116Aitd6].

> I will now examine controversies and knowledge gaps, and I need to be precise. Mass screening remains unsupported by major societies due to unclear net benefit and limited evidence on long-term outcomes in screen-detected, asymptomatic individuals; case finding in high-prevalence groups is preferred while research continues [^117ThzDf] [^116Fw8sh] [^116e5Znu]. But wait, what if we could personalize gluten thresholds or use novel biomarkers to monitor adherence and healing? These are active research areas, including the role of gluten detection technologies and the optimal cadence of endoscopic reassessment, which still require stronger evidence before routine adoption [^115v5jic].

> Finally, let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency. Celiac disease is a common, immune-mediated enteropathy with protean manifestations; diagnosis hinges on serology plus histology in most adults, with selective no-biopsy pathways in children; lifelong, strict GFD with dietitian-led education is the cornerstone; structured follow-up tracks serologic remission, nutritional recovery, and mucosal healing; nonresponsive disease demands a disciplined search for ongoing gluten exposure and alternative diagnoses; RCD is rare but high risk and requires immunophenotyping and steroid-based therapy in expert centers; emerging drugs may complement, not replace, the GFD as evidence matures [^1133y7Qs] [^1117GLbq] [^1169agCp] [^113S3NWM] [^11289Rvf].

Celiac disease is an **immune-mediated enteropathy** triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals, with a prevalence of about 1% globally [^111VRmaY] [^1133y7Qs]. Diagnosis relies on **serologic testing** (tTG-IgA, EMA, DGP) confirmed by duodenal biopsy [^1117GLbq]; a no-biopsy pathway is accepted in select children with very high tTG-IgA and positive EMA [^113E41WA]. The cornerstone of management is a **strict, lifelong gluten-free diet** [^113QPaj9], with follow-up to assess adherence, serologic response, and nutritional status [^1169agCp]. Nonresponsive cases require evaluation for ongoing gluten exposure, alternative diagnoses, or refractory celiac disease, which may need steroids or immunosuppression [^115WanFE] [^112Q81K4]. Emerging therapies targeting gluten, the immune response, or barrier function are in trials but are not yet approved [^11289Rvf] [^114p5PCw].

---

## Pathophysiology

- **Genetic susceptibility**: HLA-DQ2/DQ8 are necessary but not sufficient; additional non-HLA genes contribute [^111VRmaY] [^113FZBTv].

- **Environmental trigger**: Gluten ingestion initiates innate and adaptive immune responses, causing villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia [^111VRmaY] [^1133y7Qs].

- **Autoimmunity**: Anti-tTG antibodies cross-react with extraintestinal tissues, explaining multisystem features [^111VRmaY] [^113FZBTv].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Gastrointestinal symptoms include diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, bloating, and nausea [^113y34Dt], while **extraintestinal symptoms** include iron-deficiency anemia, osteoporosis, dermatitis herpetiformis, neurological deficits, and infertility [^11229cKk]. Asymptomatic or silent disease is common, especially in **high-risk groups** (e.g. first-degree relatives, autoimmune diseases) [^111VRmaY] [^116Aitd6].

---

## Diagnosis

### Serologic testing

- **First-line**: tTG-IgA (high sensitivity/specificity); total IgA to exclude IgA deficiency [^1117GLbq] [^113FZBTv].

- **Confirmatory**: EMA (high specificity) and DGP (especially in IgA deficiency) [^113FZBTv] [^113E41WA].

- **Genetic testing**: HLA-DQ2/DQ8 supports diagnosis or excludes CD when negative [^112Q81K4] [^113FZBTv].

---

### Histopathology

Histopathology shows **duodenal biopsy** with multiple biopsies demonstrating villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes [^113E41WA]. A **no-biopsy pathway** is accepted in select children with tTG-IgA > 10× ULN and positive EMA [^113E41WA].

---

## Management

### Gluten-free diet (GFD)

A strict, lifelong **gluten-free diet** is the cornerstone, eliminating wheat, barley, and rye [^113QPaj9] [^1117GLbq]. Dietitian-led education and structured follow-up improve adherence and outcomes [^112rcQJX] [^1159wRrV].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

- **Serology**: tTG-IgA every 6–12 months until normalization [^112jf3cr] [^1169agCp].

- **Nutrition**: monitor for deficiencies (iron, B12, vitamin D, calcium, folate) and correct [^1169agCp] [^112zBuVz].

- **Bone health**: DXA as indicated; calcium/vitamin D supplementation [^1114WeBk] [^1169agCp].

- **Persistent symptoms**: evaluate for ongoing gluten exposure, alternative diagnoses, or refractory disease [^1117GLbq] [^116v7sZP].

---

## Complications

Untreated or poorly controlled celiac disease carries significant complications: **malabsorption** with nutrient deficiencies, osteoporosis, and growth failure [^111VRmaY] [^1133y7Qs]; **autoimmune diseases** such as thyroid disease and type 1 diabetes [^111VRmaY] [^11229cKk]; and **malignancy**, including increased risk of enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and small bowel adenocarcinoma [^1133y7Qs].

---

## Refractory celiac disease (RCD)

RCD is defined by persistent symptoms and villous atrophy despite a strict GFD for ≥ 12 months, excluding other causes [^113f6swB] [^116fXNHi]. Type 1 shows normal IELs and a relatively better prognosis, whereas **type 2** shows aberrant IELs and a higher risk of lymphoma and mortality [^116Ur2PU]. Management includes open-capsule budesonide or prednisone as first-line therapy, with immunosuppressants (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine) for steroid dependence or relapse [^113S3NWM] [^115WanFE]. Nutritional support and close monitoring are essential [^115tsRuv] [^1146YJW3].

---

## Emerging therapies

- **Glutenase enzymes**: Modify or degrade gluten to reduce immunogenicity [^112qpyj6] [^114p5PCw].

- **Immune modulation**: Block gluten-specific T-cell activation or restore tolerance [^112qpyj6] [^114p5PCw].

- **Barrier function**: Tight junction modulators to reduce gluten passage [^notfound].

- **Clinical trials**: Multiple agents in phase 2/3; none approved yet [^11289Rvf] [^116Aitd6].

---

Celiac disease is a chronic immune-mediated disorder with a broad clinical spectrum; **accurate diagnosis and strict lifelong GFD** are essential to prevent complications. Persistent symptoms require structured evaluation for nonadherence, alternative diagnoses, or refractory disease, and emerging therapies may expand future options.

### Advances in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of celiac disease [^111VRmaY]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Celiac disease is an immune mediated disorder characterized by the loss of tolerance to ingested gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Celiac disease affects approximately 1% of the global population and is associated with an increased risk of cancer and death. Celiac disease remains underdiagnosed owing to its heterogeneous clinical presentation, which includes intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms in children and adults. People without symptoms who are in high risk groups, such as those with certain autoimmune conditions or first degree relatives with celiac disease, should be considered for screening. Whether the general population should be mass screened for celiac disease remains an area of active debate. Although a strict gluten-free diet is the current treatment for celiac disease, dozens of drug therapies in clinical development may radically shift the current paradigm of patient care. This review will cover the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of celiac disease, with a focus on recent advances in celiac related patient care and research.

### Celiac disease affects 1% of global population: who will manage all these patients? [^112rodJX]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Celiac disease is a common gastrointestinal condition with an estimated global prevalence of up to 1%. Adequate long-term surveillance of patients is imperative to ensure strict adherence to treatment with a gluten-free diet and the ensuing clinical and histologic recovery. Traditionally, this has been accomplished by means of regular on-site attendance at specialist health care facilities, accompanied for most patients by follow-up endoscopic and laboratory tests. However, the rapidly increasing prevalence of celiac disease and the limited health care resources challenge the current centralized and nonindividualized follow-up strategies. The improved noninvasive surveillance tools and online health care services are further changing the landscape of celiac disease management. There is a clear need for more personalized and on-demand follow-up based on early treatment response and patient-related factors associated with long-term prognosis. Additional scientific evidence on the optimal implementation of follow-up for pediatric and adulthood celiac disease is nevertheless called for.

### How future pharmacologic therapies for celiac disease will complement the gluten-free diet [^11289Rvf]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

The only proven treatment for celiac disease is adherence to a strict, lifelong, gluten-free diet. However, complete dietary gluten avoidance is challenging and a substantial number of patients do not respond fully, clinically, or histologically, despite their best efforts. As celiac disease is common and its central pathophysiology is well elucidated, it has become attractive for drug development to address the limitations of dietary treatment. Most efforts address nonresponsive celiac disease, defined as continued symptoms and/or signs of disease activity despite a gluten-free diet, and the more severe forms of refractory celiac disease, types I and II. An increasing spectrum of therapeutic approaches target defined mechanisms in celiac disease pathogenesis and some have advanced to current phase 2 and 3 clinical studies. We discuss these approaches in terms of potential efficiency, practicability, safety, and need, as defined by patients, regulatory authorities, health care providers, and payors.

### ACG clinical guidelines: diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^116Aitd6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

This guideline presents recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with celiac disease. Celiac disease is an immune-based reaction to dietary gluten (storage protein for wheat, barley, and rye) that primarily affects the small intestine in those with a genetic predisposition and resolves with exclusion of gluten from the diet. There has been a substantial increase in the prevalence of celiac disease over the last 50 years and an increase in the rate of diagnosis in the last 10 years. Celiac disease can present with many symptoms, including typical gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss, bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain) and also non-gastrointestinal abnormalities (e.g., abnormal liver function tests, iron deficiency anemia, bone disease, skin disorders, and many other protean manifestations). Indeed, many individuals with celiac disease may have no symptoms at all. Celiac disease is usually detected by serologic testing of celiac-specific antibodies. The diagnosis is confirmed by duodenal mucosal biopsies. Both serology and biopsy should be performed on a gluten-containing diet. The treatment for celiac disease is primarily a gluten-free diet (GFD), which requires significant patient education, motivation, and follow-up. Non-responsive celiac disease occurs frequently, particularly in those diagnosed in adulthood. Persistent or recurring symptoms should lead to a review of the patient's original diagnosis to exclude alternative diagnoses, a review of the GFD to ensure there is no obvious gluten contamination, and serologic testing to confirm adherence with the GFD. In addition, evaluation for disorders associated with celiac disease that could cause persistent symptoms, such as microscopic colitis, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, and complications of celiac disease, such as enteropathy-associated lymphoma or refractory celiac disease, should be entertained. Newer therapeutic modalities are being studied in clinical trials, but are not yet approved for use in practice. Given the incomplete response of many patients to a GFD-free diet as well as the difficulty of adherence to the GFD over the long term, development of new effective therapies for symptom control and reversal of inflammation and organ damage are needed. The prevalence of celiac disease is increasing worldwide and many patients with celiac disease remain undiagnosed, highlighting the need for improved strategies in the future for the optimal detection of patients.

### Celiac disease: fallacies and facts [^115TLuPe]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Our understanding of the pathophysiology of celiac disease has progressed greatly over the past 25 years; however, some fallacies about the clinical characteristics and management persist. Worldwide epidemiologic data are now available showing that celiac disease is ubiquitous. An elevated body mass index is common at the time of the diagnosis. The gluten-free diet (GFD) is an imperfect treatment for celiac disease; not all individuals show a response. This diet is widely used by people without celiac disease, and symptomatic improvement on a GFD is not sufficient for diagnosis. Finally, the GFD is burdensome, difficult to achieve, and thus has an incomplete efficacy, opening exciting opportunities for novel, nondietary treatments.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines update: diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^1117GLbq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

American College of Gastroenterology celiac disease guideline update — scope, definition, and key diagnostic and treatment principles are outlined for children and adults. Celiac disease (CD) is defined as a permanent immune-mediated response to gluten present in wheat, barley, and rye. Detection of CD-specific antibodies (e.g., tissue transglutaminase) in the serum is very helpful for the initial screening of patients with suspicion of CD. Intestinal biopsy is required in most patients to confirm the diagnosis, and a no-biopsy strategy for the diagnosis of CD in selected children is suggested and discussed in detail. Current treatment for CD requires strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and lifelong medical follow-up, and most patients have excellent clinical response to a GFD. Nonresponsive CD is defined by persistent or recurrent symptoms despite being on a GFD; these patients require a systematic workup to rule out specific conditions that may cause persistent or recurrent symptoms, especially unintentional gluten contamination. Refractory CD is a rare cause of nonresponsive CD often associated with poor prognosis. In the United States, CD affects nearly 1% of residents.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines update: diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^1111vWMx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

This guideline presents an update to the 2013 American College of Gastroenterology Guideline on the Diagnosis and Management of Celiac Disease with updated recommendations for the evaluation and management of patients with celiac disease (CD). CD is defined as a permanent immune-mediated response to gluten present in wheat, barley, and rye. CD has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that resemble a multisystemic disorder rather than an isolated intestinal disease, and is characterized by small bowel injury and the presence of specific antibodies. Detection of CD-specific antibodies (e.g., tissue transglutaminase) in the serum is very helpful for the initial screening of patients with suspicion of CD. Intestinal biopsy is required in most patients to confirm the diagnosis. A nonbiopsy strategy for the diagnosis of CD in selected children is suggested and discussed in detail. Current treatment for CD requires strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and lifelong medical follow-up. Most patients have excellent clinical response to a GFD. Nonresponsive CD is defined by persistent or recurrent symptoms despite being on a GFD. These patients require a systematic workup to rule out specific conditions that may cause persistent or recurrent symptoms, especially unintentional gluten contamination. Refractory CD is a rare cause of nonresponsive CD often associated with poor prognosis.

Celiac disease — diet and long-term outcomes clinical question highlights a target for therapy assessment. It asks whether intestinal mucosa healing as clinical and serological remission should be used as a goal of gluten-free diet (GFD) therapy to improve longer-term outcomes, defined as 5 years or more, including mortality, cancer risk, and osteoporosis in adults with CD.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines update: diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^111eVdf6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Probiotics for celiac disease — The guideline asks, in patients with CD, what is the effect of probiotics in addition to GFD on clinical remission and mucosal healing compared with GFD alone. The recommendation states, "There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of probiotics in the treatment of CD (evidence gap in recommendations, very low quality of evidence; dissent: 0)". Key concepts emphasize that "Dysbiosis is a feature of CD, but its role in disease pathogenesis and symptomatology is uncertain" and that "Despite the widespread use of probiotics, a benefit in the management of CD is not established".

INTRODUCTION

Celiac disease is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the small intestine triggered by gluten ingestion in genetically predisposed individuals. It affects approximately 1.4% of the global population, with its prevalence rising worldwide. The disease results from a complex interaction between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, particularly gluten, leading to intestinal inflammation and villous atrophy. CeD could manifest with gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Increasing attention has also been given to its extra-intestinal symptoms, including anemia, osteoporosis, and liver damage.

Since CeD was first described, the only effective treatment for CeD has been a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). However, adhering to this diet is often challenging and may not completely prevent inflammatory responses or associated complications. Moreover, dietary restrictions might impact daily life and negatively affect social interactions and quality of life. In the last years, the treatment landscape for CeD has been expanding. This evolution is driven by a deeper understanding of the disease's pathophysiology and the introduction of promising pharmacological interventions.

This review highlights the emerging therapeutic approaches for CeD, focusing on drugs currently in advanced stages of clinical testing. These therapies target specific signaling pathways implicated in the disease's pathogenesis. Additionally, we explore how these treatments could change CeD management by providing alternatives to the dietary approach in order to improve patient outcomes and enhance their quality of life.

### Society for the study of celiac disease position statement on gaps and opportunities in coeliac disease [^116nsxdn]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Progress has been made in understanding coeliac disease, a relatively frequent and underappreciated immune-mediated condition that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals. However, several gaps remain in knowledge related to diagnosis and management. The gluten-free diet, currently the only available management, is not curative or universally effective (some adherent patients have ongoing duodenal injury). Unprecedented numbers of emerging therapies, including some with novel tolerogenic mechanisms, are currently being investigated in clinical trials. In March 2020, the Celiac Disease Foundation and the Society for the Study of Celiac Disease convened a consensus workshop to identify high-yield areas of research that should be prioritized. Workshop participants included leading experts in clinical practice, academia, government and pharmaceutical development, as well as representatives from patient support groups in North America. This Roadmap summarizes key advances in the field of coeliac disease and provides information on important discussions from the consensus approach to address gaps and opportunities related to the pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of coeliac disease. The morbidity of coeliac disease is often underestimated, which has led to an unmet need to improve the management of these patients. Expanded research funding is needed as coeliac disease is a potentially curable disease.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of refractory celiac disease: expert review [^115WanFE]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — best practice advice 8–10 for refractory celiac disease defines first-line pharmacotherapy and follow-up: For patients with refractory celiac disease, "corticosteroids, most commonly open-capsule budesonide or, if unavailable, prednisone, are the medication of choice and should be used as first-line therapy in either type 1 or type 2 refractory celiac disease". Patients "require regular follow-up by a multidisciplinary team, including gastroenterologists and dietitians, to assess clinical and histologic response to therapy" and clinicians should "identify local experts with expertise in celiac disease to assist with management". "Patients with refractory celiac disease without response to steroids may benefit from referral to a center with expertise for management or evaluation for inclusion in clinical trials".

Celiac disease — indications for testing (Recommendations 7A and 7B) specify that patients with symptoms, signs, or laboratory evidence suggestive of malabsorption, such as chronic diarrhea with weight loss, steatorrhea, abdominal pain, and bloating, should be tested for CD. Patients with symptoms, signs, or laboratory evidence for which CD is a treatable cause should be considered for testing for CD. Patients with a first-degree family member who has a confirmed diagnosis of CD should be tested if they show possible signs, symptoms or laboratory evidence of CD. Consider testing of asymptomatic relatives with a first-degree family member who has a confirmed diagnosis of CD.

### Celiac disease: clinical update [^114JB63P]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review highlights literature from the past year and explores the impact on current understanding of celiac disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management.

Recent Findings

In contrast to earlier clinical trials, recent data suggests that early gluten introduction may protect against the development of celiac disease. Celiac disease is underdiagnosed, associated with high burden of disease and linked to excess mortality risk, yet, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the utility of mass screening in asymptomatic individuals. The gut microbiome is increasingly implicated in celiac disease pathogenesis, although the exact mechanism is undefined. Probiotics have been proposed as a disease-modifying option for celiac disease but most studies assessing efficacy are of low-quality. Patients with celiac disease do not appear to be at increased risk of contracting or developing adverse outcomes from COVID-19. Little is known about the pathogenesis of nonceliac gluten sensitivity; however, recent findings suggest an autoimmune basis for the condition.

Summary

Current understanding of celiac disease continues to advance, though significant knowledge gaps remain. Large, rigorous, prospectively designed studies are needed to further characterize celiac disease pathogenesis, management and therapeutic options.

### Management of celiac disease [^113KXyVe]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Celiac disease (CD) is an enteropathy-induced immune response that occurs on exposure to toxic gluten in the diet and is reversible once gluten is withdrawn. A gluten-free diet is the preferred treatment for CD and leads to reversal of villous atrophy. Counseling, nutritional support, and follow-up are vital aspects in CD management. The pickup rate of CD has improved with the availability of serologic tests, and this has led to a reduction in morbidity in treated CD cases. Managing CD can potentially prevent or cure some of the associated conditions, such as neurologic complications, nutritional deficiencies, and osteoporosis.

### Nondietary therapies for celiac disease [^116LFdU6]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Currently, the only available therapy for celiac disease is strict lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Although safe and effective, the GFD is not ideal. It is frequently expensive, of limited nutritional value, and not readily available in many countries. Consequently, a need exists for novel, nondietary therapies for celiac disease. Based on the current understanding of celiac disease pathogenesis, several potential targets of therapeutic intervention exist. These novel strategies provide promise of alternative, adjunctive treatment options but also raise important questions regarding safety, efficacy, and monitoring of long-term treatment effect.

### New therapies in celiac disease [^112qpyj6]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The management of CeD currently relies on a GFD, which is generally well tolerated. While the GFD remains effective, it poses social, psychological, and practical challenges. Future treatments should improve efficacy while maintaining safety comparable to a GFD. New therapeutic approaches targeting the underlying mechanisms of CeD have emerged in order to ease the burden of dietary restrictions and improve patients' quality of life. These include strategies to modify gluten processing in the gut, block gluten-triggered immune responses, or restore immune tolerance to gluten. This field of research is active, with ongoing and completed trials aiming to validate these methods. ZED1227 (also known as TAK-227), is a therapeutic agent that has garnered significant attention. If successful in the ongoing clinical trials, TAK-227 could represent a valid pharmacological treatment for celiac disease, offering an alternative to the strict GFD. Although phase II trials have shown promise for several therapeutic targets, broader validation through phase III trials is needed. Clinical trials often show discrepancies between symptoms, serological findings, and mucosal biopsy results, emphasizing the need for further research. In many cases, final results and pitfalls had not been published yet. Moreover, the studies conducted so far exhibit several limitations in terms of both study design and methodology. In most cases, the protocols enrolled CeD patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and evidence of duodenal mucosal damage, which often suggests poor adherence to a GFD, likely persisting also during the trial. It would be more beneficial perhaps to enroll patients with strict adherence to a GFD, negative antibody levels, and no mucosal damage, assigning them to either the drug-treated or placebo arm. Alternatively, patients with a recent diagnosis of CeD (e.g. within the past six months), who are following a GFD but have not yet shown clear normalization of duodenal mucosa, could be included. Data currently available regarding the use of these new therapies in patients with refractory CeD are also still limited, and only a few registered trials are currently underway.

Long-term safety, individual variability in response, and cost-effectiveness must also be addressed. In fact, new treatments are likely to be costly, potentially adding to the financial burden already posed by a GFD.

### Celiac disease diagnosis and management: a 46-year-old woman with anemia [^114R4zd3]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Celiac disease is one of the most prevalent autoimmune gastrointestinal disorders, but as the case of Ms J illustrates, diagnosis is often delayed or missed. Based on serologic studies, the prevalence of celiac disease in many populations is estimated to be approximately 1% and has been increasing steadily over the last 50 years. Evaluation for celiac disease is generally straightforward and uses commonly available serologic tests; however, the signs and symptoms of celiac disease are nonspecific and highly heterogeneous, making diagnosis difficult. Although celiac disease is often considered a mild disorder treatable with simple dietary changes, in reality celiac disease imparts considerable risks, including reduced bone mineral density, impaired quality of life, and increased overall mortality. In addition, a gluten-free diet is highly burdensome and can profoundly affect patients and their families. For these reasons, care of individuals with celiac disease requires prompt diagnosis and ongoing multidisciplinary management.

### Evidence-informed expert recommendations for the management of celiac disease in children [^112ToJxj]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Although the need for effective long-term follow-up for patients with celiac disease (CD) has been recognized by many expert groups, published practice guidelines have not provided a clear approach for the optimal management of these patients. In an attempt to provide a thoughtful and practical approach for managing these patients, a group of experts in pediatric CD performed a critical review of the available literature in 6 categories associated with CD to develop a set of best practices by using evidence-based data and expert opinion. The 6 categories included the following: bone health, hematologic issues, endocrine problems, liver disease, nutritional issues, and testing. Evidence was assessed by using standardized criteria for evaluating the quality of the data, grade of evidence, and strength of conclusions. Over 600 publications were reviewed, and 172 were chosen for inclusion. The thorough review of the results demonstrated that the quality of the data available was often insufficient to provide unequivocal best practices. However, using the available data and the clinical experience of the panel, a practical framework for the management of children with CD was created. These recommendations were developed by our expert panel and do not necessarily reflect the policy of the American Academy of Pediatrics. The potential usefulness of these best practices is underscored by the fact that consensus, measured by the outcome of anonymous voting, was reached by the panel for 24 of the 25 questions. We hope that these best practices may be useful to the pediatric gastroenterology and larger general pediatric communities.

### Celiac disease [^113S1FQz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

This review will focus on the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of celiac disease (CD). Given an increasing awareness of gluten-related disorders, medical professionals of all varieties are encountering patients with a diagnosis of CD or who are thought to have food intolerance to gluten. The prevalence of CD among the general population is estimated to be 1% in Western nations, and there is growing evidence for underdiagnosis of the disease, especially in non-Western nations that were traditionally believed to be unaffected. The development of serologic markers specific to CD has revolutionized the ability both to diagnose and monitor patients with the disease. Additionally, understanding of the clinical presentations of CD has undergone a major shift over the past half century. Although it is well understood that CD develops in genetically predisposed subjects exposed to gluten, the extent of other environmental factors in the pathogenesis of the disease is an area of continued research. Currently, the main therapeutic intervention for CD is a gluten-free diet; however, novel nondietary agents are under active investigation. Future areas of research should also help us understand the relationship of CD to other gluten-related disorders.

### Celiac disease in specific populations [^111Yyytc]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent data have highlighted that our prior understanding of the populations at risk for celiac disease (CeD) was narrow and limited. Individuals of all races, sexes, ages, socioeconomic classes, and geographic locations can develop CeD. Furthermore, certain conditions, including autoimmune disorders, immune-mediated diseases, and chromosomal abnormalities, are frequently linked to CeD, highlighting the complexity of its associations. Disease presentation, diagnosis, and management vary among these groups. A deeper understanding of this variation is essential for early detection, as well as for providing the most effective and personalized management strategies for individuals with CeD.

### Celiac disease and nonceliac enteropathies [^111bbJo9]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review highlights recent research in the field of celiac disease.

Recent Findings

Epidemiological studies continue to identify celiac disease-associated diseases such as inflammatory arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. Recently published consensus guidelines provide recommendations for the long-term management and monitoring of patients with celiac disease. There are multiple pharmaceutical therapies for celiac disease under investigation, and recent phase I and phase II trials are reviewed here. Finally, a recent trial of patients with nonceliac gluten sensitivity demonstrates a significant nocebo effect in this condition.

Summary

Recent advances in celiac disease include the development of new clinical guidelines as well as promising new therapeutics. Continued high-quality research is needed to improve the outcomes of patients with celiac disease and nonceliac enteropathies.

Nonresponsive celiac disease — Best Practice Advice 3: For patients with nonresponsive celiac disease, after exclusion of gluten ingestion, perform a systematic evaluation for other potential causes of symptoms, including functional bowel disorders, microscopic colitis, pancreatic insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, lactose or fructose intolerance, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Colonoscopy is indicated in patients with celiac disease and persistent or recurrent diarrhea because of the increased risk of microscopic colitis and inflammatory bowel disease, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth can be detected by means of breath testing. The low FODMAP diet is not indicated in all patients with nonresponsive celiac disease, and pancreatic insufficiency is common in this setting and can be treated with gluten-free pancreatic enzyme supplements. Refractory celiac disease should be strongly considered in patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms or signs of malabsorption after exclusion of other more common causes and malignancy.

### Celiac disease: a comprehensive current review [^113FZBTv]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Celiac disease remains a challenging condition because of a steady increase in knowledge tackling its pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and possible therapeutic options.

Main body

A major milestone in the history of celiac disease was the identification of tissue transglutaminase as the autoantigen, thereby confirming the autoimmune nature of this disorder. A genetic background (HLA-DQ2/DQ8 positivity and non-HLA genes) is a mandatory determinant of the development of the disease, which occurs with the contribution of environmental factors (e.g. viral infections and dysbiosis of gut microbiota). Its prevalence in the general population is of approximately 1%, with female predominance. The disease can occur at any age, with a variety of symptoms/manifestations. This multifaceted clinical presentation leads to several phenotypes, i.e.g.astrointestinal, extraintestinal, subclinical, potential, seronegative, non-responsive, and refractory. Although small intestinal biopsy remains the diagnostic 'gold standard', highly sensitive and specific serological tests, such as tissue transglutaminase, endomysial and deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies, have become gradually more important in the diagnostic work-up of celiac disease. Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease is a life-long, strict gluten-free diet leading to improvement in quality of life, ameliorating symptoms, and preventing the occurrence of refractory celiac disease, ulcerative jejunoileitis, and small intestinal adenocarcinoma and lymphoma.

Conclusions

The present review is timely and provides a thorough appraisal of various aspects characterizing celiac disease. Remaining challenges include obtaining a better understanding of still-unclear phenotypes such as slow-responsive, potential (minimal lesions) and seronegative celiac disease. The identification of alternative or complementary treatments to the gluten-free diet brings hope for patients unavoidably burdened by diet restrictions.

Celiac disease management and follow-up — team-based care, monitoring frequency, and adherence are emphasized. "The management and follow-up of patients with CD is preferentially performed with a team-based approach in which the dietician has an important role in the practical advice on lifestyle and choice of foods", and "Most patients will comply satisfactorily with a GFD and experience relief of their symptoms, as well as decreasing celiac antibody levels". "A reasonable follow-up schedule will be every 12 months", and adherence support options include that "An open access or online service, perhaps aided with short message services, may improve adherence". Markers of response differ by age: "In children and adolescents, a satisfactory increase in weight and height is an essential marker of the success of the GFD, whereas the adult patients may experience more subtle improvement". Despite this, "35% of patients were adherent to follow-up 4 years after diagnosis", and "the frequency of therapy-resistant CD occurs in a significant proportion of adults (20%)".

Research needs and gaps — screening and treatment in asymptomatic persons: Studies that randomly assign participants to screening vs no screening and evaluate clinical outcomes are lacking. Screening studies targeting populations at increased risk for celiac disease are likely to be more informative than trials in the general population because of higher disease prevalence and should be given higher priority. More information is needed about the accuracy of serologic testing in asymptomatic persons, particularly those with disease risk factors. Treatment studies in screen-detected, asymptomatic persons are needed to assess adherence to a gluten-free diet vs no dietary intervention and immediate vs delayed dietary changes, ideally reporting both short-term effects on symptoms and quality of life and long-term outcomes such as osteoporotic fractures, cancer, and mortality. Further research should clarify the natural history of positive serology without histologic changes or with histologic confirmation but no symptoms, and treatment studies should report results stratified by baseline histologic findings given uncertainty about mild histologic abnormalities.

Celiac disease (CD) case finding and dyspepsia — active case finding is described as the favored strategy to increase detection of CD in patients with symptoms or associated conditions, and the frequency of CD in common clinical scenarios varies from modestly elevated, such as irritable bowel syndrome, to substantially elevated, such as unexplained iron deficiency anemia. In dyspepsia specifically, prevalence of biopsy-proven CD in patients with dyspepsia is 1%, which is similar to the general population, and systematic screening for CD is not recommended because the prevalence of the disease is not higher than that in the general population. For dyspepsia workup, endoscopy may be appropriate for patients who continue to have dyspepsia despite initial therapy, those who are 55 years and older, and/or those with alarm symptoms.

### New therapies in celiac disease [^114p5PCw]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Celiac disease (CeD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the small intestine triggered by gluten ingestion in genetically predisposed individuals. The cornerstone of CeD management remains a strict adherence to a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD), although such a dietary restriction can lead to an altered quality of life and may not be easy to follow for many patients. These challenges highlighted the need for alternative therapies. This review aims to explore the latest advancements in these therapeutic avenues, emphasizing mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, and safety profiles of drugs currently in advanced stages of clinical testing.

Recent Findings

Recent advances in the understanding of CeD pathophysiology have catalyzed the development of new therapeutic approaches, which include strategies to modify gluten processing in the gut, block gluten-triggered immune responses, or restore immune tolerance to gluten.

Summary

While these therapies are not poised to take the place of GFD, they represent promising treatment alternatives that could enhance the quality of life and minimize long-term consequences in CeD patients. Further research, as well as phase III clinical trials of those already conducted, are needed to establish the feasibility of integrating these novel drugs in the clinical management of CeD.

### Diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^1133y7Qs]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on celiac disease:

- **Definition**: CD is an immune-mediated inflammatory enteropathy triggered by gluten exposure in genetically susceptible individuals.
- **Pathophysiology**: In patients with CD, the ingestion of gluten triggers an innate and adaptive immune response, leading to tissue inflammation and damage. Characteristically, deamidated gluten and the self-protein TG2 both become targets of highly disease specific B-cell responses.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of CD is estimated at 500–1,000 persons per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: CD may result in disease manifestations related to malabsorption (e.g., electrolyte imbalances, osteoporosis, infertility, neurological disorders), manifestations of extra-intestinal autoimmunity (dermatitis herpetiformis), or manifestations of neoplastic complications (increased risk of enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma and small bowel adenocarcinoma).
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The majority of patients will respond to a lifelong gluten-free diet which is the cornerstone of therapy.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of refractory celiac disease: expert review [^113S3NWM]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Refractory celiac disease pharmacotherapy — first-line corticosteroids (Best Practice Advice 8) states that corticosteroids, most commonly open-capsule budesonide or, if unavailable, prednisone, are the medication of choice and should be used as first-line therapy in either type 1 or type 2 refractory celiac disease. Glucocorticoids are considered first-line therapy, with open-capsule budesonide generally accepted as initial treatment of choice; in an open-label study most patients had clinical response (92%) and histologic improvement (89%). Open-capsule budesonide is given as 3 mg 3 times daily with the first capsule opened and placed into applesauce, the second capsule opened and swallowed with water, and the third capsule swallowed intact. One alternative with proven efficacy but likely higher risk for adverse effects is prednisone, and intravenous methylprednisolone is an alternative for severe disease followed by oral prednisone or open-capsule budesonide. Overall, 80%-90% of refractory celiac disease patients have an adequate clinical response to open-capsule budesonide or prednisone, and patients who do not respond, have an incomplete response, or have recurrent symptoms during the steroid taper may require second-line therapy; addition of an immunosuppressant agent such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and tacrolimus as adjuncts to steroids appears to be effective in RCD1.

### Diagnosis and management of adult coeliac disease: guidelines from the British society of gastroenterology [^117QVihN]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Ultimately, this review should not be regarded as fixed. Instead it represents our understanding of what is best in adult CD management according to current knowledge. It is likely, and indeed we hope, that there will be substantial progress in diagnosis, evaluation and management of CD to reduce the burden on the patient and society. We anticipate that future updated versions of these guidelines will be based on evolving published literature that may have an audit or research base relevant to adult CD. Data in this review were mostly retrieved through searches of PubMed. We acknowledge that there are other medical databases and we cannot rule out that had we searched more than one database we may have identified additional relevant studies that have now been left out of this review.

Areas for future research

The panel of experts recognise that the main challenge in the future is to allocate available resources effectively to reduce the burden of disease from CD.

Future research should focus on the following areas:
how to induce long-term remission without a GFD, that is, novel therapies and vaccine;
better understanding of the disease processes, including genetics and antigen presentation;
prevent and cure extra-intestinal manifestation and complications, including infections;
be able to assess tolerable amount of gluten for individual patients;
define the role of duodenal biopsy, serology and point of care testing at diagnosis and follow-up;
find a robust and valid blood marker for diagnosis and monitoring of the disease;
understand the pathogenesis of RCDI and II.

### Gluten-free diet adherence patterns and health outcomes in celiac disease: a retrospective observational study [^112AMqsN]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Celiac disease (CeD) is an autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, that causes damage to the structure and function of the small intestine. CeD is considered a significant worldwide public health problem due to its global distribution with a prevalence of about 1%. CeD is commonly accompanied by a range of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, bloating, constipation, and weight loss, as well as non-GI symptoms like headaches, skin disorders, neurological disorders, and fatigue. To date, following a strict lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only effective treatment for CeD. While most patients respond well, those with refractory disease, poor dietary adherence, or delayed diagnosis remain at higher risk for complications (e.g. malnutrition, osteoporosis, or lymphoma) that impact their overall well-being.

GFD adherence can be accompanied by some obstacles including the lack of gluten-free products, their high cost, misleading food labeling, lack of information etc. Adolescents with CeD face additional challenges related to the GFD. Participating in events like parties, sleepovers, and dining outside can be tricky for them.

GFD has numerous benefits such as relieving clinical symptoms, addressing nutritional deficiencies, protecting against malignancy, and decreasing the likelihood of developing other autoimmune diseases associated with CeD.

Patients following a GFD, especially those in the early stages of diagnosis, need personalized care and support to help them make informed dietary choices and effectively cope with the challenges of living with CeD. This includes regular follow-up appointments with a gastroenterologist, consultations with general practitioners and physicians, and guidance from a registered celiac dietitian for a supervised GFD plan.

Regular follow-up is crucial to evaluate the progress of the disease, ensure adherence to the strict GFD, and monitor the quality of life of CeD patients, and their ability to manage the condition. By utilizing questionnaires tailored to specific communities, healthcare professionals gain valuable insights into patients' symptoms and overall well-being. This deeper understanding empowers them to provide appropriate treatment and support for patients.

This study employed a structured assessment combining the validated Biagi adherence tool with supplemental questions to evaluate GFD adherence and health outcomes.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — refractory celiac disease (RCD) follow-up and referral states that patients with refractory celiac disease without response to steroids may benefit from referral to a center with expertise for management or evaluation for inclusion in clinical trials. Medical follow-up for patients with RCD is based on expert opinion, with a multidisciplinary approach including gastroenterologists and dietitians. Medical visits every 3 months are reasonable until disease is well controlled; after that, visits every 6 months may be appropriate, with clinical and laboratory parameters assessed during each visit and aggressive correction of nutritional deficiencies. Dietitian follow-up includes malnutrition management (if present), assessment of adherence, and recommendation of continuation of strict gluten-free diet. The use of emerging biomarkers for gluten ingestion may be helpful in RCD1 but do not rule out low-degree, inadvertent gluten ingestion. Hypoalbuminemia is a strong independent predictor of mortality, and monitoring during follow-up visits is advised.

### Celiac disease: a comprehensive current review [^114R78JX]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Although there has been a substantial increase in the number of CD diagnoses over the last 30 years, many patients remain undiagnosed. The flow-chart for identifying CD in adults must always include both serology and intestinal biopsy, whereas genetics should be performed only in selected cases. Diagnostic criteria should help physicians in avoiding misdiagnosis and missing cases of CD (i.e. seronegative patients with classic symptoms not undergoing biopsy) and preserve people from an unjustified GFD. The treatment for CD is still primarily a GFD, which requires significant patient education, motivation, and follow-up. Slow response occurs frequently, particularly in people diagnosed in adulthood. Persistent or recurring symptoms should lead to a review of the patient's original diagnosis, exclude alternative diagnoses, evaluation of GFD quality, and serologic testing as well as histological assessment in order to monitor disease activity. In addition, evaluation for disorders that could cause persistent symptoms and complications of CD, such as refractory CD or lymphoma, should be pursued. The future opens to new therapeutic and preventive strategies, which are expected to improve the patient's quality of life and pave the way to a definitive cure for this old disease.

### Prevention measures and exploratory pharmacological treatments of celiac disease [^1135NGPY]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Increasing prevalence, protean clinical manifestations, and lack of pharmacological therapy make celiac disease (CD) a complex and highly relevant illness in gastroenterology. This chronic inflammatory disorder of the small intestine is caused by the ingestion of gluten containing cereals in genetically susceptible individuals, leading to a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI manifestations. Awareness among physicians is growing due to accessible and highly accurate diagnostic and screening methods. Recent evidence suggests a possible rising incidence of CD. Environmental factors such as early life gluten exposure, intestinal infections, short duration of breast-feeding, and changes in intestinal microbiota have been proposed to have a role in CD pathogenesis. Thus, prevention approaches to diminish the rising prevalence of CD are currently being evaluated. Still, the cornerstone treatment of CD remains a strict gluten-free diet. This nutritional regime is demanding, and non-adherence is common because of social isolation, financial issues, or restriction of food diversity. Allowing patients to occasionally consume small amounts of gluten would greatly improve their quality of life. Owing to recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of CD, different targets have been identified and have motivated the development of several experimental therapeutic strategies. The main goal of this review is to discuss the mechanisms that can be exploited therapeutically to prevent or delay CD, disease associations and its complications. Current treatments for complications of CD, including refractory CD and malignancy, are beyond the scope of this review.

In one trial, "This study (n = 40) reported that after 1 year, a gluten-free diet was associated with improvements in histopathologic findings and small improvements in 3 of 5 gastrointestinal symptoms that were statistically but not clinically significant", and "There was also improvement in anxiety, other measures of health-related quality of life showed improvements, and social functioning was worse in the group being treated with a gluten-free diet". At two years, adherence was high — "After 2 years, more than 90% of participants in the intervention group reported adherence to the gluten-free diet", yet "there were no differences between the 2 groups in serology or subjective perception of health as measured by the visual analog scale".

### The gluten-free diet: how to provide effective education and resources [^115fY1f3]. Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

A strict gluten-free diet (GFD) for life is the only treatment for celiac disease (CD). This article reviews (1) the impact of the GFD on the quality of life of individuals with CD and their families; (2) the causes of poorly controlled CD; (3) the access to and source and quality of information provided by health professionals and other groups; (4) management strategies, including nutritional assessment and education guidelines; (5) a variety of resources available to individuals and health professionals; (6) innovative educational initiatives and partnerships; and (7) specific recommendations to address the increasing numbers of people with CD and the growing need for gluten-free (GF) foods and further education about CD and the GFD. Successful management of CD requires a team approach, including the person with CD and his or her family, physician, dietitian, and celiac support group; an individualized approach; understanding of quality of life issues; use of evidence-based, current information and resources; and regular follow-up to monitor compliance, nutritional status, and additional information and support. The physician must clearly communicate, with a positive attitude, an overview of CD and strongly emphasize the importance of a GFD for life. It is essential that the physician initiate an immediate referral to a dietitian with expertise in CD for nutritional assessment, diet education, meal planning, and assistance with the adaptation to the challenging new gluten-free lifestyle. Good dietary compliance will reduce the risk of further complications and associated health care costs and improve quality of life in patients with CD.

### Rate, risk factors, and outcomes of nonadherence in pediatric patients with celiac disease: a systematic review [^113se28c]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The only treatment for celiac disease is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). We performed a systematic review to investigate the rate of adherence to a GFD in children with celiac disease, risk factors that affect adherence, and outcomes of non-adherence.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, and Scopus for studies through January 2019. We included observational studies of ≥ 50 children diagnosed with celiac disease and recommended for placement on a GFD. We collected data on adherence assessment (self-report, serology tests, structured dietary interview, biopsies, or assays for gluten immunogenic peptides), risk factors, and outcomes related to adherence. Findings were presented with medians, range, and a narrative synthesis.

Results

We identified 703 studies; of these, 167 were eligible for full-text assessment and 49 were included in the final analysis, comprising 7850 children. Rates of adherence to a GFD ranged from 23% to 98%. Comparable rates (median rates of adherence, 75%-87%) were found irrespective of how assessments were performed. Adolescents were at risk of non-adherence and children whose parents had good knowledge about celiac disease adhered more strictly. Non-adherence associated with patient growth, symptoms, and quality of life.

Conclusion

In a systematic review of 49 studies of children with celiac disease, we found substantial variation in adherence to a GFD among patients. Rate of adherence was not associated with method of adherence measurement, so all methods appear to be useful, with lack of consensus on the ideal metric. Studies are needed to determine the best method to ensure adherence and effects on long-term health.

### Survey of the initial management of celiac disease antibody tests by ordering physicians [^114ApTPQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy triggered by ingested gluten in genetically susceptible individuals, and affects approximately 1% of the population. Timely and accurate diagnosis of celiac disease is limited because physicians do not recognize atypical presentations, including chronic abdominal pain or chronic constipation. In addition approximately 60% of children present with extra-intestinal manifestations of celiac disease including fatigue, headaches, growth failure, arthralgias, and iron deficiency anemia. Many physicians are not aware of these atypical presentations of celiac disease that result in delays in diagnosis. Two-thirds of patients consult at least two physicians prior to the diagnosis. Delayed diagnosis and persistent intestinal inflammation lead to complications that include persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, pubertal delay, osteoporosis, autoimmune disorders, and increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. An economic evaluation demonstrated that in the year pre-diagnosis, persistent health concerns were investigated at an estimated cost of $8500 US per capita. Delayed diagnosis taxes both the individual and the health care system.

Celiac disease antibody screening with the tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibody test identifies individuals who require further testing to diagnose celiac disease or alterations in management of those with known celiac disease. Management decisions following a positive celiac screen are influenced by the degree of elevation of the TTG and severity of patient symptoms. In addition, the TTG may be falsely positive in individuals with minimal or no symptoms such as first-degree relatives of patients with celiac disease or individuals who have medical conditions associated with celiac disease. Unfortunately other autoimmune diseases and intercurrent infections can cause false positive TTG results and must be considered when managing patients with minimal symptoms. Thus, many factors influence how celiac serology should be interpreted. "Choosing Wisely" is an initiative to help clinicians to appropriately manage abnormal test results and reduce unnecessary testing. Physicians must understand when a test should be ordered and how to interpret the result. By identifying general errors in management, physicians can improve patient care and reduce health care costs.

Refractory celiac disease type 2 (RCD2) — evidence from studies indicates the best treatment for RCD2 is unknown, with small series reporting variable outcomes. Cladribine was well tolerated in 17 patients with RCD2; 58% had histologic improvement and 35% had a decrease of aberrant intraepithelial lymphocytes, but 41% were diagnosed with EATL and died. In 32 patients treated with cladribine, the 5‑year survival rate among responders was 63% with a risk of EATL of 16%. Autologous stem cell transplantation achieved a clinical response rate of 85% with a 4‑year survival rate of 66%. Anti‑interleukin 15 monoclonal antibody 714 improved symptoms but failed the primary end point of reducing aberrant IELs in 28 patients with RCD2 compared with placebo.

### Celiac disease… [^1114WeBk]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

What is celiac disease. Celiac disease causes your intestines to become swollen and to react badly to a protein called gluten. Gluten is found in wheat, barley, and rye. Other names for celiac disease are celiac sprue and gluten-sensitive enteropathy. What are the symptoms of celiac disease. Babies with celiac disease often have bad diarrhea. They may not grow or gain weight at normal rates. Older children and adults with celiac disease may have diarrhea or greasy stools. Some people have constipation or hard stools. Some have only gas or bloating. Other symptoms of celiac disease are pain in the lower tummy, an upset stomach, tiredness, mouth ulcers, teeth that break easily, and heartburn. Many people with celiac disease have anemia, especially iron deficiency anemia. They often have "thinning of the bones, " or osteoporosis.

Other serious medical problems, such as epilepsy and cancer, are more common in people with celiac disease. How is celiac disease treated. The main treatment for celiac disease is to remove all gluten from your diet. This means that you should not ever eat foods that contain wheat, barley, or rye. Products made with rice, corn, or soy flour are safe to eat if no gluten has been added to them. Because there are many sources of hidden gluten in prepared foods, you might want to talk with a dietitian. The dietitian can help you design a diet that meets your needs. Most people feel much better after they have been on a strict gluten-free diet for a few months. If you stick to this diet, you will probably be able to control all the symptoms of your disease. Staying on this diet can undo most, if not all, of the damage caused by celiac disease. You will have to be on a gluten-free diet for the rest of your life.

If you have the rash with celiac disease, you might need to take a medicine to control the itching. If you stay on a gluten-free diet, you might be able to stop taking that medicine. If you have iron deficiency anemia, you might need to take an iron pill. You might also need to take other supplements, such as calcium and vitamin D. Staying on a strict gluten-free diet will reduce your risk of getting osteoporosis, some cancers, and other problems that sometimes follow celiac disease.

### Celiac disease: what you should know… [^113uMGxq]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

What is celiac disease. Celiac disease causes problems in your intestines when you eat gluten, which is in wheat, rye, barley, and oats. What does gluten do to people with celiac disease. If you have celiac disease, gluten damages your intestines and keeps your body from taking in many of the nutrients in the food you eat. This includes vitamins, calcium, protein, carbohydrates, fats, and other important nutrients. Your body can't work well without these nutrients.
