## Question

Why is aspirin ineffective for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why aspirin is ineffective for DVT prophylaxis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical guideline stance and the evidence base that labeled aspirin as ineffective. Then, I should verify the mechanistic rationale distinguishing venous thrombosis from arterial thrombosis. Next, I will examine which patient populations and clinical contexts still show inferiority of aspirin versus anticoagulants. After that, I need to review newer randomized trials and meta-analyses in orthopedic arthroplasty where aspirin may be comparable. Finally, I should synthesize current guideline recommendations, dosing/duration nuances, and practical patient selection, while double-checking for exceptions in cancer, medical inpatients, and extended-phase secondary prevention of VTE.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because I don't want to jump to conclusions; at first glance, one might say "aspirin is ineffective everywhere", but wait, that is too broad and historically anchored in older guidance rather than current, context-dependent evidence. Historically, major guidelines declared aspirin monotherapy inadequate for thromboprophylaxis across patient groups, but contemporary data show settings where aspirin can be reasonable, particularly in arthroplasty pathways and certain low-risk scenarios, so I should be precise and avoid a blanket statement here [^117Ad1YL] [^112ctz3W].

> I will now examine the historical recommendations that framed the notion of "ineffective". The ACCP 2004 and 2008 CHEST guidelines strongly recommended against aspirin alone for thromboprophylaxis in any patient group, favoring LMWH, LDUH, fondaparinux, or VKAs based on superior efficacy in controlled trials, and this shaped decades of practice and teaching [^111WxCnk] [^117Ad1YL]. Hold on, I should verify comparative efficacy data: a 2019 network meta-analysis for extended VTE treatment found VKAs and DOACs reduce recurrence far more than aspirin, reinforcing that, where anticoagulation is appropriate and safe, it is more protective than aspirin for secondary prevention, albeit with trade-offs for bleeding, which clarifies why guidelines prioritized anticoagulants historically [^117Ad1YL].

> Next, I should review the mechanistic rationale, but I need to ensure I don't overstate it. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1, suppressing platelet thromboxane A2 signaling, which is excellent for arterial, platelet-rich thrombosis; venous thrombosis, however, is classically fibrin-rich and driven by the coagulation cascade, making anticoagulants more logical for prevention and treatment; that pharmacologic mismatch underpinned early recommendations against aspirin as primary VTE prophylaxis in many settings [^1168joFP] [^113xkYT6]. Hmm, wait a minute — platelets still contribute to venous thrombogenesis and embolization in some models, so aspirin can have a signal in certain contexts, but the effect size is generally smaller than anticoagulants, which aligns with clinical trial hierarchies showing anticoagulants outperform aspirin for VTE prevention and recurrence reduction [^1168joFP] [^116L2h36].

> Let me consider the populations where aspirin remains inadequate or not recommended; I should double-check key guidance. In general and many non-orthopedic surgical settings, heparins or fondaparinux are standard, and aspirin is not considered acceptable monotherapy, consistent with regulatory labeling and guideline practice patterns, especially given stronger efficacy of heparins demonstrated in classic perioperative trials and labeling documents [^1152RBbc]. For acutely ill medical inpatients, contemporary recommendations endorse heparins and discourage aspirin for VTE prophylaxis, including in COVID-19 guidance from LMIC contexts where aspirin is explicitly recommended against for inpatient VTE prophylaxis, emphasizing that aspirin should not substitute for anticoagulants in these settings [^111VqFkS] [^114AzfNr].

> Hold on, I should verify extended-phase prevention after unprovoked VTE, where confusion often arises. CHEST 2021 recommends reduced-dose DOACs rather than aspirin for extended-phase anticoagulation; if anticoagulation is stopped, aspirin may be considered to modestly lower recurrence risk compared with nothing, but it is notably less effective than DOACs or VKAs, and ESVS 2021 advises against aspirin for extended therapy in unprovoked DVT, while ASH 2020 similarly prefers ongoing anticoagulation over aspirin for secondary prevention, which confirms a consistent hierarchy favoring anticoagulants when feasible [^115z3V86] [^113udtMh] [^115rbWax] [^114NWYuG] [^116L2h36]. But wait, what if the patient has cancer? ASCO 2023 allows aspirin prophylaxis only in selected lower-risk myeloma patients on immunomodulatory agents, whereas LMWH or DOACs are generally preferred in higher-risk oncology contexts, again reflecting that aspirin's role is limited and niche in cancer-associated thrombosis prevention [^116mH6Cn].

> Now, I should review where the paradigm has shifted — the orthopedic arthroplasty domain. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show that, especially in pathways using an initial short course of an anticoagulant followed by aspirin, or even in some trials comparing aspirin with anticoagulants, the rates of symptomatic VTE and bleeding after total hip or knee arthroplasty can be similar, supporting noninferiority of aspirin-based strategies in appropriately selected patients and within contemporary perioperative care models [^112ctz3W] [^116nA1KN] [^116S4b87] [^114BDcXY]. Let me reconsider a potential pitfall: the NEJM 2018 trial used rivaroxaban for the first 5 postoperative days before switching to aspirin, so its noninferiority applies to a hybrid regimen rather than pure aspirin from day 0; still, several recent RCT syntheses limited to arthroplasty populations support comparable VTE and bleeding outcomes between aspirin and oral anticoagulants in this specific context, which is not easily generalizable to medical inpatients or non-orthopedic surgery [^112ctz3W] [^111dnBnN].

> Next, I should review dosing and duration nuances, because sloppy dosing can confound effectiveness comparisons. Evidence from arthroplasty cohorts suggests low-dose aspirin (81 mg twice daily) performs similarly to higher doses for VTE prevention and may have similar or lower bleeding risk, and observational and trial-derived timing data indicate most post-arthroplasty VTE occurs within 30 days, supporting 30-day prophylaxis windows for TKA and longer durations after THA depending on risk, though protocols vary by center and risk stratification [^114YN2Bf] [^117YGXDa] [^116JV77N]. Wait, let me verify formulation issues: chewable versus enteric-coated 81 mg aspirin showed broadly similar overall VTE and GI complication rates across THA/TKA, with a signal difference in TKA-only analyses, underscoring that local practice should standardize formulation and ensure adherence rather than assume major efficacy differences by coating alone [^1153Apna].

> I need to ensure patient selection and risk stratification are front and center, because this is where misuse leads to failure. Contemporary orthopedic consensus statements and large database studies report increasing reliance on low-dose aspirin across risk strata in TKA, but I should be cautious and confirm that real-world selection and enhanced recovery pathways drive these outcomes; importantly, European guidance acknowledges aspirin as an option in arthroplasty with caveats, but not for general surgery, reinforcing that setting matters and that individualized protocols improve safety [^11398cT2] [^1136D5sG]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions for other hospitalized patients: broad quality literature emphasizes tailoring thromboprophylaxis to individual VTE and bleeding risks rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all aspirin approach, which would risk under-prophylaxis in medical inpatients and high-risk surgical patients [^112SNedU].

> I should confirm safety interactions, because concomitant antithrombotic therapy can change the calculus. ASH 2020 recommends suspending background aspirin in stable cardiovascular patients when initiating anticoagulation for VTE to minimize bleeding risk, which means that "adding aspirin" to a full-dose anticoagulant for VTE treatment or extended prevention is generally harmful unless there is a separate, compelling arterial indication; arthroplasty prophylaxis studies also show no major bleeding difference between aspirin and LMWH/DOACs in selected patients, but that equivalence does not justify dual therapy without indication [^114CKvGa] [^112o5cXP]. Let me double-check: the extended-treatment network meta-analysis further underscores that while anticoagulants are more effective than aspirin for recurrence prevention, VKAs at standard intensity have higher major bleeding than DOACs, supporting DOAC dose-optimization rather than aspirin substitution for most extended-phase patients at acceptable bleeding risk [^116L2h36].

> So, why was aspirin considered "ineffective", and what is the accurate answer now? Mechanistically, aspirin targets platelets, whereas venous thrombosis is primarily coagulation-driven; historically, trials showed inferior VTE prevention versus heparins and VKAs, leading to strong recommendations against aspirin monotherapy across most inpatient and surgical settings, particularly outside orthopedics, which remains appropriate for medical inpatients and many surgeries today [^1168joFP] [^117Ad1YL]. But wait, here is the self-correction: in modern arthroplasty care pathways, especially with short initial anticoagulation run-in or in carefully selected patients, randomized and meta-analytic data support that aspirin can be as effective and safe as oral anticoagulants for symptomatic VTE prevention, so the statement "aspirin is ineffective for DVT prophylaxis" is no longer universally true and must be applied contextually with explicit attention to setting, regimen, and patient risk [^112ctz3W] [^116nA1KN] [^116S4b87].

Aspirin is **not recommended for DVT prophylaxis** because it only inhibits platelet aggregation and does not adequately suppress the coagulation cascade, which is the primary driver of venous thrombosis [^1168joFP]. Clinical trials show aspirin is **less effective than anticoagulants** (LMWH, DOACs) for DVT prevention, especially in high-risk patients [^116L2h36], and guidelines recommend anticoagulants over aspirin for primary prophylaxis [^117Ad1YL] [^111WxCnk]. Aspirin may be considered for low-risk orthopedic patients [^112ctz3W] or for secondary prevention after stopping anticoagulation [^113udtMh] [^113snL8X], but it is **not sufficient for primary DVT prevention** in most clinical settings [^117Ad1YL].

---

## Mechanism of action and limitations

For the **mechanism of action**, aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1, reducing thromboxane A2–mediated platelet aggregation [^1168joFP]. Regarding **limitations**, venous thrombosis is driven by activation of the coagulation cascade (fibrin formation), not platelets; aspirin does not significantly inhibit thrombin or fibrin and therefore does not address the main pathophysiology of DVT [^113xkYT6].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

In **clinical trials**, aspirin is less effective than anticoagulants (LMWH, DOACs) for DVT prevention, particularly in high-risk patients [^116L2h36]. Guidelines from **ACCP and ASH** recommend anticoagulants over aspirin for primary DVT prophylaxis [^117Ad1YL]; aspirin may be considered for secondary prevention after stopping anticoagulation in selected patients [^113udtMh] [^113snL8X].

---

## Specific clinical scenarios

In **orthopedic surgery**, aspirin may be considered for low-risk patients after joint arthroplasty [^112ctz3W], but anticoagulants are preferred for high-risk patients [^1136D5sG]. In **medical patients**, aspirin is **not recommended for primary DVT prophylaxis** in hospitalized patients [^114AzfNr]; anticoagulants are preferred [^117Ad1YL].

---

## Conclusion

Aspirin is not recommended for **primary DVT prophylaxis** because it does not adequately inhibit the coagulation cascade [^1168joFP] and is less effective than anticoagulants in clinical studies [^116L2h36]. It may be considered for secondary prevention after stopping anticoagulation in selected patients [^113udtMh], but **anticoagulants remain the preferred option for primary prophylaxis** [^117Ad1YL].

### Extended treatment of venous thromboembolism: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116L2h36]. Heart (2019). High credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral anticoagulant regimens and aspirin for extended venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment, we conducted a thorough search of MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and conference proceedings. The search focused on randomized controlled trials studying vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), or aspirin for secondary prevention of VTE beyond three months. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% credible intervals between treatments were estimated using a random-effects Bayesian network meta-analysis.

A total of sixteen studies, including more than 22,000 patients, were incorporated in the analysis.

- **Results**: Compared with placebo or observation and with aspirin, the risk of recurrent VTE was lower with the following:
	- **Standard-intensity VKAs**: OR 0.15 (0.08 to 0.24) and 0.23 (0.09 to 0.54)
	- **Low-dose factor Xa inhibitors**: OR 0.16 (0.06 to 0.38) and 0.25 (0.09 to 0.66)
	- **Standard-dose factor Xa inhibitors**: OR 0.17 (0.08 to 0.33) and 0.27 (0.11 to 0.65)
	- **Direct thrombin inhibitor**: OR 0.15 (0.04 to 0.37) and 0.23 (0.06 to 0.74)

	- **However, the risk of major bleeding was higher with standard-intensity VKAs**: OR 4.42 (1.99 to 12.24) and 4.14 (1.17 to 18.86). The effect estimates were consistent across male patients, those with index pulmonary embolism, unprovoked VTE, and sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, compared with placebo or observation, the risk of all-cause mortality was reduced with standard-intensity VKAs (OR 0.44 (0.20 to 0.87)) and low-dose factor Xa inhibitors (OR 0.38 (0.12 to 0.995)).

- **Conclusions**: Standard-intensity VKAs and DOACs are more efficacious than aspirin for extended VTE treatment, despite a higher risk of major bleeding.

- **Aspirin use**: We recommend against the use of aspirin alone as thromboprophylaxis for any patient group (Grade 1A).

- **Mechanical methods**: Mechanical methods of thromboprophylaxis should be used primarily for patients at high bleeding risk (Grade 1A) or possibly as an adjunct to anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis (Grade 2A).

- **Major surgery**: For patients undergoing major general surgery, we recommend thromboprophylaxis with a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH), or fondaparinux (each Grade 1A).

- **Gynecologic and urologic procedures**: We recommend routine thromboprophylaxis for all patients undergoing major gynecologic surgery or major, open urologic procedures (Grade 1A for both groups), with options including LMWH, LDUH, fondaparinux, or intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC).

- **Elective hip or knee arthroplasty**: For these patients, we recommend one of the following anticoagulant agents: LMWH, fondaparinux, or a vitamin K antagonist.

### No increased risk of venous thromboembolism in high-risk patients continuing their dose of 75 mg aspirin compared to healthier patients given low-molecular-weight heparin [^117Mnb1i]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Low credibility.

Optimum venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis for patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty remains undefined. The purpose of this study is to compare complication rates among total joint arthroplasty patients using either low-dose aspirin (75 mg once daily) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH; Fragmin/dalteparin 5000 U) for VTE prophylaxis.

- **Methods**: This is a prospective observational study. All total hip or knee arthroplasties from 2014 to 2020 were included. One thousand eighty-four patients already taking aspirin 75 mg as primary or secondary prophylaxis for cardiovascular disease continued their daily aspirin dose throughout their hospital stay and after discharge without any other kind of thromboprophylaxis. Five thousand ten patients not already taking aspirin were given LMWH for 12–14 days starting the day of surgery. Both groups consisted of patients undergoing either primary or revision total hip or knee arthroplasty. The aspirin group was older (73 ± 7.8 vs 66 ± 10.2 years, P < .01, 95% CI -7.6, -6.3) with more comorbidities but otherwise did not differ from the LMWH group. Outcome measures were recorded at 3-month follow-up and included the following complications: clinically deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), deep infection, blood transfusion, and death.

- **Results**: The aspirin group had 0.28% DVT and 0.28% PE, and the LMWH group had 0.24% DVT and 0.16% PE (P = 0.42 and .74, respectively). No difference in deep infection, allogenic blood transfusion, or mortality was found.

### Adjuvant therapeutic efficacy of low-dose aspirin on short-term outcomes of patients with cancer-associated venous thromboembolism [^1158LuUo]. BMC Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The primary outcome, which was VTE recurrence, occurred in 13 of 423 patients (3.1%) in the aspirin group and in 55 of 846 patients (6.5%) in the non-aspirin group (HR 0.546, 95% CI [0.298–0.988], P = 0.011). The isolated PE, PE with DVT, and isolated DVT were 4 (30.8%), 2 (15.4%), and 7 (53.8%) in the aspirin group and 13 (23.6%), 16 (29.1%), and 26 (47.3%) in the non-aspirin group, respectively (P = 0.590). Pairwise comparison demonstrated that there was no statistical difference in the proportion of each type of VTE recurrence between the two groups. The time-dependent occurrence of VTE recurrence is shown in Figure 2 A (log rank P = 0.046).

### Evolution of clinical thinking and practice regarding aspirin: What has changed and why [^112Q278A]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Aspirin (ASA) is the original antiplatelet agent. Its routine use, long unquestioned for both primary and secondary prevention in cardiovascular disease, is under increasing scrutiny as the risk:benefit balance for ASA becomes less clear and other disease- and risk-modifying approaches are validated. It can be viewed as a significant advance in evidence-based medicine that the use of an inexpensive, readily available, long-validated therapy is being questioned in large, rigorous trials.

In this overview, we present the important questions surrounding a more informed approach to ASA therapy: duration of therapy, assessment of net clinical benefit, and timing of start and stop strategies. We also consider potential explanations for "breakthrough" thrombosis when patients are on ASA therapy. Other manuscripts in this Supplement address the specifics of primary prevention, secondary prevention, triple oral antithrombotic therapy, and the future of ASA in cardiovascular medicine.

### Aspirin is as effective as oral anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after knee arthroplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116S4b87]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). High credibility.

The purpose of our study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of aspirin for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis after knee arthroplasty.

- **Methods**: The review process was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Two independent researchers conducted literature searches. Databases such as PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies comparing aspirin and oral anticoagulants (OACs) for VTE prophylaxis after knee arthroplasty. Our meta-analysis included seven randomized controlled trials with 2,323 participants.

- **Results**: The relative risk (RR) of VTE following knee arthroplasty was 1.29 (95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 2.14) when comparing aspirin to OACs. Similar results were observed for deep vein thrombosis (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.71 to 2.50) and pulmonary embolism (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.25 to 4.03). No notable differences were found in bleeding, wound complications, or mortality between the two groups. Analyses of subgroups based on factors like region, publication year, VTE type, VTE events, aspirin dose, comparator types, use of mechanical thrombosis prophylaxis, trial quality, and study support revealed no substantial differences in VTE incidence between the two groups. Overall, the quality of evidence for VTE and deep vein thrombosis outcomes was moderate.

- **Conclusions**: Existing randomized controlled trial evidence suggests that aspirin is equally effective and safe as OACs in providing prophylaxis for VTE after knee arthroplasty.

### Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis: Better living through chemistry — in opposition [^111sK3Bg]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2005). Low credibility.

The best prophylactic regimens for thromboembolic disease continue to be debated despite years of investigation. Surgeons must balance the clinical risks and benefits, which depend on accurate data and the ability to balance the risk of fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) against the risk of bleeding. The risk for fatal PE is 0.1% with most prophylactic regimens. The risk of perioperative bleeding increases from 1.8% to 5.2% with the use of low molecular weight heparins or warfarin and generally is dose-dependent.

Most prophylactic recommendations are based on the presence or absence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). However, the correlation between the presence of DVT and the risk of PE is low and inconsistent. Therefore, DVT may not be an accurate surrogate marker for patients at risk after total joint surgery. Our experience with 2,800 consecutive total knee arthroplasty patients, using aspirin as our principal agent, shows a fatal PE risk of 0.1% and a low risk of bleeding. Based on this, our recommendation is aspirin.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of anticoagulation and venous thrombotic disease for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries [^111VqFkS]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

In the context of COVID-19, another consideration is the frequency of dosing. Unfractionated heparin prophylaxis is often administered twice or thrice daily, whereas low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), especially enoxaparin, is dosed daily. International guidelines also state that once-daily regimens of LMWH may be advantageous over unfractionated heparin (UFH) because missed doses may be associated with worse outcomes, will reduce healthcare worker exposure, and conserve personal protective equipment.

- **Recommendations and suggestions**:
	1. In the absence of contraindications, we recommend prophylactic anticoagulation with either LMWH or UFH for all hospitalized COVID-19 patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (strong recommendation and moderate quality of evidence).
	2. If available, we recommend LMWH over UFH for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis to minimize risk to healthcare workers (UG best practice statement).
	3. We recommend against the use of aspirin for VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 patients in LMICs (strong recommendation and low quality of evidence).
	4. Because of limited evidence, we suggest against the use of "enhanced" or "intermediate" prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients in LMICs (weak recommendation and low quality of evidence).
	5. In hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs, based on available evidence, we recommend against the initiation of empiric therapeutic anticoagulation without clinical suspicion for VTE (strong recommendation and low quality of evidence).
	6. If contraindications exist to chemical prophylaxis, we recommend mechanical prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices or graduated compression stockings (GCS) for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

### The efficacy of aspirin versus low-molecular-weight heparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after knee and hip arthroplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116a2o11]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). High credibility.

The included studies in this meta-analysis consisted of a total of seven trials. Across these studies, there were 12,134 observations, with 54.6% in the aspirin cohort and 45.4% in the low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) cohort. The weighted mean ages for the aspirin and LMWH cohorts were 66.6 years (range 57.6–69.0) and 66.8 years (range 57.9–68.9), respectively. Additionally, the weighted mean BMI values were 30.5 kg/m² (range 25.6–30.75) for the aspirin cohort and 30.3 kg/m² (range 24.9–30.75) for the LMWH cohort.

In terms of gender distribution, females outnumbered males in all studies except one (Anderson) for both cohorts, with female-to-male ratios of 1.27 for the aspirin cohort and 1.33 for the LMWH cohort. Hypertension emerged as the most commonly reported comorbidity in both cohorts. The weighted mean hemoglobin values were 138.9 g/L (range 129.9–141.7) for the aspirin cohort and 138.7 g/L (range 128.7–141.3) for the LMWH cohort. The mean prothrombin time (PT) for both cohorts was noted to be 10.1 seconds.

- **Characteristics of included studies**: Tables 2 and 3 provide details on study characteristics and the specific venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylactic dosages of aspirin and LMWH used in each trial.
- **Meta-analysis outcomes**: A summary of primary and secondary outcomes is available in Table 4.

Overall, this review highlights the key findings and demographic details of the analyzed trials.

### Heparin sodium [^1152RBbc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

A number of well-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that low-dose heparin prophylaxis, given just prior to and after surgery, will reduce the incidence of postoperative deep vein thrombosis in the legs (as measured by the I-125 fibrinogen technique and venography) and of clinical pulmonary embolism.

The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. The heparin is given by deep subcutaneous injection in the arm or abdomen with a fine needle (25 to 26 gauge) to minimize tissue trauma. A concentrated solution of heparin sodium is recommended.

Such prophylaxis should be reserved for patients over the age of 40 who are undergoing major surgery. Patients with bleeding disorders, those having neurosurgery, spinal anesthesia, eye surgery, or potentially sanguineous operations should be excluded, as well as patients receiving oral anticoagulants or platelet-active drugs [see WARNINGS]. The value of such prophylaxis in hip surgery has not been established. The possibility of increased bleeding during surgery or postoperatively should be borne in mind. If such bleeding occurs, discontinuance of heparin and neutralization with protamine sulfate is advisable.

If clinical evidence of thromboembolism develops despite low-dose prophylaxis, full therapeutic doses of anticoagulants should be given unless contraindicated. All patients should be screened prior to heparinization to rule out potential complications.

### Prevention of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism following stroke: A systematic review of published articles [^1169t9zY]. European Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review of the literature on venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis following cerebral infarct (CI) and haemorrhagic stroke. MEDLINE, Cochrane, LILACS, and SciELO databases were scanned, and the abstracts from Brazilian, American, and European Neurology and Stroke Congresses were scrutinized for clinical trials. Moreover, the reference lists of articles and reviews were searched.

A pooled analysis of two large studies with aspirin was conducted. Both unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparins/heparinoids (LMWH) are partially effective for VTE prophylaxis after CI and should be routinely used in patients with motor deficit and reduced mobility with no contraindications. Reduction of deep venous thrombosis is better established than the effect on pulmonary embolism or mortality. Some evidence points to a greater efficacy of LMWH. The available evidence does not support the use of mechanical methods or dextran. Aspirin may have a mild protective effect. Low-dose Warfarin might be useful in the rehabilitation setting.

Strict recommendations cannot be made for patients with haemorrhagic stroke, but intermittent pneumatic compression merits further study. There are important limitations of VTE preventive strategies following stroke. Additional studies on the combination of methods after CI and on low doses of anticoagulants following cerebral haemorrhage are urgently needed.

### Aspirin in the primary and secondary prevention of vascular disease: Collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised trials [^111oBoek]. Lancet (2009). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin is of definite and substantial net benefit for many people who already have occlusive vascular disease; however, we assessed the benefits and risks in primary prevention.

- **Methods**: We undertook meta-analyses of serious vascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death) and major bleeds in six primary prevention trials involving 95,000 individuals at low average risk, accounting for 660,000 person-years and 3,554 serious vascular events. Additionally, we analyzed 16 secondary prevention trials with 17,000 individuals at high average risk, amounting to 43,000 person-years and 3,306 serious vascular events, comparing long-term aspirin versus control. We report intention-to-treat analyses of first events during the scheduled treatment period.

- **Findings**: In the primary prevention trials, aspirin allocation yielded a 12% proportional reduction in serious vascular events (0.51% aspirin vs. 0.57% control per year, p = 0.0001), primarily due to a reduction of about a fifth in non-fatal myocardial infarction (0.18% vs. 0.23% per year, p < 0.0001). The net effect on stroke was not significant (0.20% vs. 0.21% per year, p = 0.4: haemorrhagic stroke 0.04% vs. 0.03%, p = 0.05; other stroke 0.16% vs. 0.18% per year, p = 0.08). Vascular mortality did not differ significantly (0.19% vs. 0.19% per year, p = 0.7). Aspirin allocation increased major gastrointestinal and extracranial bleeds (0.10% vs. 0.07% per year, p < 0.0001), with the main risk factors for coronary disease also serving as risk factors for bleeding. In the secondary prevention trials, aspirin allocation yielded a greater absolute reduction in serious vascular events (6.7% vs. 8.2% per year).

### Aspirin plus rivaroxaban versus rivaroxaban alone for the prevention of venous stent thrombosis among patients with post-thrombotic syndrome: The multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label ARIVA trial [^113ghFw9]. Circulation (2025). Low credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the most common clinical manifestation of venous thromboembolism, affecting approximately 2 per 1000 individuals per year. It causes significant morbidity during its acute phase and leads to functional complications months after the initial diagnosis. Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is the most frequent long-term complication of proximal DVT, occurring in up to 50% of patients with iliofemoral DVT treated with standard anticoagulation and compression stockings. PTS contributes to a substantial individual burden, leading to long-term morbidity, persistent discomfort, and impaired quality of life for affected patients, often resulting in a reduced ability to perform daily activities.

Compression stockings, exercise and physical therapy, wound care, and long-term anticoagulant treatment may relieve the symptoms related to PTS and stabilize the disease. However, no medical treatment has been proven effective to reverse PTS or to lead to a regression of subjective limitations and symptoms. Recanalization of chronically occluded iliac veins with stent placement has been shown in a randomized trial and multiple single-arm studies to restore blood flow and alleviate functional limitations associated with PTS. Several aspects of venous stent placement require further investigation, including the optimal antithrombotic strategy.

Currently, there is no agreement on the optimal antithrombotic strategy to prevent venous stent thrombosis. As a result, existing guidelines and consensus documents remain inconclusive and further research is needed in this area.

### The efficacy of aspirin versus low-molecular-weight heparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after knee and hip arthroplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113Hv5Nx]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The protocol was pre-registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO).

- **Search strategy**: Four online databases (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar) were searched from inception to 15 June 2024 to identify all the studies investigating the outcomes of aspirin versus LMWH following total knee replacement (TKR) and total hip replacement (THR). The following keywords and their derivatives were included: 'Arthroplasty' OR 'replacement' AND 'Hip' OR 'knee' AND 'venous thromboembolism' OR 'VTE' OR 'Deep Venous thrombosis' OR 'DVT' OR 'Pulmonary embolism' OR 'PE' AND 'Aspirin' AND 'LMWH' OR 'Enoxaparin' OR 'Dalteparin' OR 'Anticoagulant'. See Supporting Information S1: Appendix for detailed search strategies.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Studies were considered eligible if they satisfied the following criteria: (1) original RCTs; (2) comparing the outcomes of aspirin to LMWH (enoxaparin or dalteparin); (3) in both knee and hip arthroplasty performed for the treatment of osteoarthritis; (4) no restriction on the type of implants; and (5) published in the English language. Exclusion criteria included (1) studies not reporting any of the outcomes of interest (VTE, bleeding, mortality rate); (2) studies comparing combined thromboprophylaxis agents protocol where the standalone effect of aspirin versus LWMH is confounded; (3) observational studies, review articles, preclinical, cadaveric and anatomical studies, and case reports.

### Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and treatment in patients with cancer: ASCO guideline update [^116mH6Cn]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for cancer-associated thrombosis, particularly thromboprophylaxis, the ASCO 2023 guidelines recommend administering thromboprophylaxis with either aspirin (only in lower-risk patients) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). This is advised for patients with multiple myeloma receiving thalidomide- or lenalidomide-based regimens in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or dexamethasone.

### No difference between low- and regular-dose aspirin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after THA [^114YN2Bf]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Low credibility.

Aspirin is established as an effective prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) after total hip arthroplasty (THA); however, there is no consensus as to whether low- or regular-dose aspirin is more effective at preventing VTE.

- **Questions/purposes**: (1) Is there a difference in the incidence of symptomatic VTE within 90 days of elective THA using low-dose aspirin compared with regular-dose aspirin? (2) Is there a difference in the risk of significant bleeding (gastrointestinal and wound bleeding) and mortality between low- and standard-dose aspirin within 90 days after surgery?

- **Methods**: We retrospectively evaluated 7488 patients in our database who underwent THA between September 2012 and December 2016. A total of 3936 (53%) patients received aspirin alone for VTE prophylaxis after THA. During the study period, aspirin was prescribed as monotherapy for VTE prophylaxis after surgery in low-risk patients (no history of VTE, recent orthopaedic surgery, hypercoagulable state, history of cardiac arrhythmia requiring anticoagulation, or receiving anticoagulation for any other medical conditions before surgery). Patients were excluded if aspirin use was contraindicated because of peptic ulcer disease, intolerance, or other reasons. Patients received aspirin twice daily (BID) for 4 to 6 weeks after surgery and were grouped into two cohorts: a low-dose (81 mg BID) aspirin group (n = 1033) and a standard-dose (325 mg BID) aspirin group (n = 2903). The primary endpoint was symptomatic VTE (deep vein thrombosis [DVT] and pulmonary embolism [PE]). Secondary endpoints included significant bleeding and mortality.

### To prophylax or not, and how much and how long? Controversies in VTE prevention for medical inpatients, including COVID-19 inpatients [^113skEQA]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2022). High credibility.

The field of thromboprophylaxis for acutely ill medical patients, including those hospitalized for COVID-19, is rapidly evolving both in the inpatient setting and the immediate post-hospital discharge period. Recent data reveal the importance of incorporating holistic thromboembolic outcomes that encompass both venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial thromboembolism, as thromboprophylaxis with low-dose direct oral anticoagulants has been shown to reduce major and fatal vascular events, especially against a background of dual pathway inhibition with aspirin.

In addition, recent post hoc analyses from randomized trial data have established five key bleeding-risk factors. If these are removed, they reveal a low-bleeding-risk medically ill population. Conversely, key individual risk factors such as advanced age, a past history of cancer or VTE, an elevated D-dimer, or the use of a validated VTE risk score — like the IMPROVE VTE score using established cutoffs — can predict a high-VTE-risk medically ill population that benefits from extended postdischarge thromboprophylaxis.

Lastly, thromboprophylaxis of a high-thrombotic-risk subset of medically ill patients, particularly those with COVID-19, is rapidly evolving during both hospitalization and post-discharge. This article reviews three controversial topics in the thromboprophylaxis of hospitalized acutely ill medical patients:

- **Clinical relevance**: Key efficacy and safety outcomes incorporated into randomized trials but not incorporated into relevant antithrombotic guidelines on the topic.
- **Use of individual risk factors**: Risk models of low-bleeding-risk and high-thrombotic-risk assessments.

### Thirty days of aspirin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is adequate following total knee arthroplasty, regardless of the dose used [^116JV77N]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Low credibility.

The optimal length of aspirin prophylaxis to minimize venous thromboembolism (VTE) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the timing of VTE after TKA in patients who received low and high dose aspirin, and determine if 30 days of prophylaxis remains adequate.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed records of 9,208 patients undergoing primary TKA between 2010 and 2020 who received either low (81 mg twice daily, n = 4,413) or high (325 mg twice daily, n = 4,795) dose aspirin for VTE prophylaxis. Symptomatic VTEs occurring within 90 days of surgery were identified from medical records and phone call logs. Major bleeding events (MBE) within the first 30 days were also documented. Time to event was recorded.

- **Results**: Overall, 88 patients (1.0%) developed symptomatic VTE, with no significant differences in incidence between the low (n = 40, 0.9%) and high (n = 48, 1.0%) dose groups (P = 0.669). The median time to VTE was 8 days (interquartile range [IQR] 2–15.5), median time to deep vein thrombosis was 12 days (IQR 5–18), and median time to pulmonary embolism was 5 days (IQR 1.5–15). There was a similar distribution in time to VTE in both the low and high dose groups. Aside from a single DVT occurring at day 44, all VTE occurred within 30 days of surgery. During the prophylactic time period, 41 patients (0.4%) developed MBE, which tended to occur more frequently (0.6% vs 0.3%, P = 0.018) and earlier in the high dose group.

- **Conclusion**: Based on the findings, a 30-day low or high dose aspirin regimen remains optimal for prevention.

### Aspirin or rivaroxaban for VTE prophylaxis after hip or knee arthroplasty [^112ctz3W]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Clinical trials and meta-analyses have suggested that aspirin may be effective for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (proximal deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) after total hip or total knee arthroplasty, but comparisons with direct oral anticoagulants are lacking for prophylaxis beyond hospital discharge.

- **Methods**: We performed a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial involving patients who were undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty. All the patients received once-daily oral rivaroxaban (10 mg) until postoperative day 5 and then were randomly assigned to continue rivaroxaban or switch to aspirin (81 mg daily) for an additional 9 days after total knee arthroplasty or for 30 days after total hip arthroplasty. Patients were followed for 90 days for symptomatic venous thromboembolism (the primary effectiveness outcome) and bleeding complications, including major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (the primary safety outcome).

- **Results**: A total of 3424 patients (1804 undergoing total hip arthroplasty and 1620 undergoing total knee arthroplasty) were enrolled in the trial. Venous thromboembolism occurred in 11 of 1707 patients (0.64%) in the aspirin group and in 12 of 1717 patients (0.70%) in the rivaroxaban group (difference, 0.06 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -0.55 to 0.66; P < 0.001 for noninferiority and P = 0.84 for superiority). Major bleeding complications occurred in 8 patients (0.47%) in the aspirin group and in 5 (0.29%) in the rivaroxaban group (difference, 0.18 percentage points; 95% CI, -0.65 to…

### European guidelines on perioperative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis: Aspirin [^1136D5sG]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

There is a good rationale for the use of aspirin in venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in some orthopedic procedures, as already proposed by the 9th American College of Chest Physicians' guidelines (Grade 1C). We recommend using aspirin, considering that it may be less effective than or as effective as low molecular weight heparin for prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, and hip fracture surgery (Grade 1C). Aspirin may be less effective than or as effective as low molecular weight heparins for prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after other orthopedic procedures (Grade 2C).

Aspirin may be associated with a low rate of bleeding after total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, and hip fracture surgery (Grade 1B). Aspirin may also be associated with less bleeding after total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, and hip fracture surgery than other pharmacological agents (Grade 1B). No data are available for other orthopedic procedures. We do not recommend aspirin as thromboprophylaxis in general surgery (Grade 1C). However, this type of prophylaxis could be interesting, especially in low-income countries (Grade 2C), and adequate large-scale trials with proper study designs should be carried out (Grade 1C).

### Aspirin for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism: The INSPIRE collaboration [^115KMU44]. Circulation (2014). Low credibility.

In patients with a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE), the risk of recurrent VTE (reVTE) remains high after anticoagulant treatment is discontinued. The Aspirin for the Prevention of ReVenous Thromboembolism (the Warfarin and Aspirin [WARFASA]) and the Aspirin to Prevent ReVenous Thromboembolism (ASPIRE) trials showed that aspirin reduces this risk, but they were not individually powered to detect treatment effects for particular outcomes or subgroups.

- **Methods and results**: An individual patient data analysis of these trials was planned, before their results were known, to assess the effect of aspirin versus placebo on reVTE, major vascular events (reVTE, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular disease death), and bleeding, both overall and within predefined subgroups. The primary analysis for VTE was by intention to treat using time-to-event data. Of 1,224 patients, 193 experienced reVTE over a median follow-up of 30.4 months. Aspirin reduced reVTE (7.5%/yr versus 5.1%/yr; hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.51–0.90; P = 0.008), including both deep-vein thrombosis (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47–0.92; P = 0.01) and pulmonary embolism (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.41–1.06; P = 0.08). Aspirin also reduced major vascular events (8.7%/yr versus 5.7%/yr; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50–0.86; P = 0.002). The major bleeding rate was low (0.4%/yr for placebo and 0.5%/yr for aspirin). After adjustment for treatment adherence, reVTE was reduced by 42% (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.40–0.85; P = 0.005). Prespecified subgroup analyses indicate similar outcomes.

- **Risk of bleeding**: Across 4 studies and 11,152 observations, there was no significant risk difference between the aspirin and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) cohorts in terms of major bleeding (OR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.40–1.47; p: 0.424). The aforementioned was devoid of heterogeneity at an I² of 0%. Similarly, the risk of minor bleeding, despite being skewed towards the LMWH cohort, is not significantly different compared to the aspirin cohort (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.40–1.04; p: 0.072). An insignificant I² of 3% accompanies the previously mentioned risk value across 5 studies and 2,148 observations.

	- **Figure 6**: Comparison of the major bleeding risk between aspirin and LMWH groups. CI, confidence interval; LMWH, low-molecular-weight heparin; OR, odds ratio.

	- **Figure 7**: Comparison of the minor bleeding risk between aspirin and LMWH groups. CI, confidence interval; LMWH, low-molecular-weight heparin; OR, odds ratio.

- **Risk of mortality**: Due to the limited number of studies reporting mortality (n = 2), only the pooled risk of mortality is reported (OR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.23–4.62; p: 0.968).

### Prevention of venous thromboembolism: The seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^111WxCnk]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This article discusses the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices [for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S].

- **Key recommendations**:
	- We recommend against the use of aspirin alone as thromboprophylaxis for any patient group (Grade 1A).
	- For moderate-risk general surgery patients, we recommend prophylaxis with low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH) (5,000 U bid) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (3,400 U daily) [both Grade 1A].
	- For high-risk general surgery patients with multiple risk factors, we recommend combining pharmacologic methods (LDUH three times daily or LMWH, > 3,400 U daily) with the use of graduated compression stockings and/or intermittent pneumatic compression devices (Grade 1C+).
	- We recommend that thromboprophylaxis be used in all patients undergoing major gynecologic surgery (Grade 1A) or major, open urologic procedures, and we recommend prophylaxis with LDUH two times or three times daily (Grade 1A).
	- For patients undergoing elective total hip or knee arthroplasty, we recommend one…

### Vte prophylaxis for the medical patient: where do we stand? - a focus on cancer patients [^113mZyFL]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

Acutely ill medical patients are at moderate to high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE): approximately 10–30% of general medical patients may develop deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and the latter is a leading contributor to deaths in hospitals. Medical conditions associated with a high risk of VTE include cardiac disease, cancer, respiratory disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatological and infectious diseases.

Pre-disposing risk factors in medical patients include a history of VTE, history of malignancy, complicating infections, increasing age, thrombophilia, prolonged immobility, and obesity. Hence, active cancer and a history of cancer are both strongly related to VTE in medical (non-surgical) patients. Heparins, both unfractionated (UFH) and low molecular weight (LMWH), and fondaparinux have been shown to be effective agents in the prevention of VTE in this setting. However, it has not yet been possible to demonstrate a significant effect on mortality rates in this population.

In medical patients, unfractionated heparin has a higher rate of bleeding complications than low molecular weight heparin. Thromboprophylaxis has been shown to be effective in medical patients with cancer and may have an effect on cancer outcomes. Thromboprophylaxis in patients receiving chemotherapy remains controversial and requires further investigation. There is no evidence for the use of aspirin, warfarin, or mechanical methods. We recommend either low molecular weight heparin or fondaparinux as safe and effective agents in the thromboprophylaxis of medical patients.

### Adjuvant therapeutic efficacy of low-dose aspirin on short-term outcomes of patients with cancer-associated venous thromboembolism [^111pnXVA]. BMC Medicine (2025). High credibility.

In conclusion, this study indicates for the first time that the adjuvant use of low-dose aspirin, based on conventional anticoagulants, reduces short-term VTE recurrence and PE-related mortality rates in patients with cancer-associated VTE compared with using isolated anticoagulants. However, the joint use of low-dose aspirin and conventional anticoagulants cannot improve short-term all-cause mortality rate or net clinical benefit. Adjuvant low-dose aspirin use is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. The findings may provide a new treatment method for adjuvant therapy of patients with cancer-associated VTE. Relevant RCTs could be warranted in the future.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of anticoagulation and venous thrombotic disease for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries [^117ETBic]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

For patients where the use of heparin products is contraindicated, mechanical prevention with intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices or graduated compression stockings (GCS) are non-pharmacologic options for VTE prophylaxis. A systematic review before the era of COVID-19, which included 70 trials (two from Turkey and two from China, both upper middle-income countries) involving 16,164 patients, found that IPC reduced VTE occurrence compared with no IPC prophylaxis, but with a reduced risk of bleeding. The same review demonstrated that the addition of pharmacological prophylaxis to IPC further reduced the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) compared with IPC alone, emphasizing the importance of transitioning to pharmacologic prophylaxis as soon as the bleeding risk is reduced.

However, the opposite approach — adding mechanical prophylaxis to pharmacological prophylaxis — was not found to be beneficial in a recent randomized controlled trial involving non-COVID-19 patients. We were unable to identify any study from either high-income countries (HICs) or low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) that reported on the use of mechanical prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients. Reports around the world also show that mechanical thromboprophylaxis is not widely used.

Although aspirin may be cheap and widely available in LMIC settings, the safety and efficacy of aspirin for VTE prophylaxis remain unknown. In those with cardiovascular disease, a recent cohort study of 412 COVID-19 patients assessed the use of aspirin within 24 hours of hospital admission or in the 7 days before hospital admission, finding that use was independently associated with a lower risk.

### Low-dose enteric-coated and chewable aspirin are not equally effective in preventing venous thromboembolism in total knee and hip arthroplasty [^1153Apna]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2024). High credibility.

Low-dose aspirin is an effective venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylactic medication in primary total joint arthroplasty, but the efficacy and safety of the formulations of chewable and enteric-coated aspirin have not been compared. The purpose of this study was to investigate the VTE and gastrointestinal (GI) complication rates of chewable and enteric-coated 81 mg aspirin bis in die for VTE prophylaxis in primary total joint arthroplasty.

- **Methods**: A retrospective, single-institution cohort study was performed on patients who underwent primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) from 2017 to 2021. Comparisons were made between 4,844 patients who received chewable, noncoated aspirin 81 mg and 4,388 patients who received enteric-coated 81 mg aspirin. Power analysis demonstrated 1,978 and 3,686 patients were needed per group to achieve a power of 80% for 90-day VTE rates (using inferiority testing) and GI complications (using superiority testing), respectively. Patients had similar baseline characteristics. Statistical analyses were done using t-tests and Chi-squared tests, with statistical significance defined as a P value < .05.

- **Results**: There were no significant differences in the incidences of postoperative VTE (0.31% versus 0.55%; p = 0.111) or GI complications (0.14% versus 0.14%; P = 1.000) between patients who received either chewable or enteric-coated 81 mg aspirin bis in die in the overall comparison that included both THA and TKA patients, or THA patients alone. However, the VTE incidence for TKA patients alone was significant.

### The use of aspirin for primary and secondary prevention in venous thromboembolism and other cardiovascular disorders [^112Cxm9A]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) includes conditions such as myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, stroke, and venous thromboembolism. CVD is a leading health problem worldwide and a major cause of mortality, morbidity, and disability; it is also associated with high healthcare costs. The incidence of CVD is predicted to increase in the forthcoming years. Thus, it is crucial that physicians are aware of the benefits and limitations of the available therapies to ensure patients receive optimized treatment.

Clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations on the use of anticoagulants and antiplatelets for both the prevention and treatment of CVD. Aspirin is the most studied antiplatelet agent in this context. The benefits of aspirin are well documented and supported by data from robust clinical trials for CVD conditions, such as acute coronary syndrome and stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, the clinical benefits of aspirin are less clear for other conditions, namely for primary prevention of venous thromboembolism after major orthopaedic surgery, particularly in comparison with newer drugs such as the direct oral anticoagulants.

This article provides an outline of the guidelines and a critical assessment of the efficacy and safety data supporting the recommendations for the use of aspirin in the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism and other cardiovascular disorders.

### Association of aspirin with prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients after total knee arthroplasty compared with other anticoagulants: A noninferiority analysis [^111YCnZv]. JAMA Surgery (2019). High credibility.

There has been significant debate in the surgical and medical communities regarding the appropriateness of using aspirin alone for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study aims to determine the acceptability of aspirin alone versus anticoagulant prophylaxis in reducing the risk of postoperative VTE in patients undergoing TKA.

The study is a noninferiority analysis of a retrospective cohort of TKA cases submitted to the Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Collaborative Quality Initiative at 29 member hospitals. These hospitals range from small community hospitals to large academic and nonacademic medical centers in Michigan. The study includes 41,537 patients who underwent primary TKA between April 1, 2013, and October 31, 2015. Clinical events were monitored for 90 days after surgery, and data analysis was conducted between September and October 2016.

- **Exposures**:
	- The methods of pharmacologic prophylaxis included neither aspirin nor anticoagulants for 668 patients (1.6%), aspirin only for 12,831 patients (30.9%), anticoagulant only (e.g. low-molecular-weight heparin, warfarin, and Xa inhibitors) for 22,620 patients (54.5%), and both aspirin and anticoagulant for 5,418 patients (13.0%). Most patients also used intermittent pneumatic compression stockings.

- **Main outcome and measures**:
	- The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of VTE or death, with the noninferiority margin specified as 0.3. The secondary outcome was bleeding events.

Of the 41,537 patients, 14,966 were men (36%), with a mean age of 65.8 years. A VTE event…

This study followed the principles outlined in the Handbook of the Cochrane Collaboration and the guidelines established by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. The protocol for this meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO.

- **Inclusion criteria**: The inclusion criteria were (1) a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the efficacy and/or safety of aspirin and OACs for preventing VTE in adults (≥ 18 years old) undergoing primary and/or revision hip arthroplasty and/or knee arthroplasty; (2) reporting of outcomes including VTE, DVT, PE, and/or associated complications; (3) use of a combined VTE prevention strategy including aspirin as one of the medications in the aspirin arm (initial treatment with LMWH or an oral anticoagulant followed by a longer course of aspirin) to reflect clinical practice; and (4) administration of the medication for VTE prophylaxis lasting ≥ 14 days.

- **Search strategy**: Two of the authors performed the search in PubMed, Embase, the Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the inception date of each database to May 14, 2024, using the keywords "hip arthroplasty" or "knee arthroplasty", "aspirin" and "anticoagulant", and "venous thromboembolism" or "pulmonary embolism" or "deep vein thrombosis" or "complication" in humans. Detailed search strategies are reported in the Appendix. No language restrictions were applied in the search.

- **Study selection**: After duplicates were removed, two independent researchers reviewed all titles.

### Low-dose aspirin versus placebo in postpartum venous thromboembolism: A multi-national, pilot, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^115NPNFj]. The Lancet Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Despite the morbidity and mortality associated with venous thromboembolism, there is a dearth of evidence to guide postpartum thromboprophylaxis in patients at moderate risk. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of conducting a double-blind, randomised trial of aspirin versus placebo in postpartum individuals with two or more venous thromboembolism risk factors, mild-to-moderate thrombophilia, or both.

- **Methods**: The pilot PARTUM trial was a multi-national, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in seven centres across Canada, France, Ireland, and the Netherlands. Postpartum individuals aged 18 years or older with venous thromboembolism risk factors — including mild-to-moderate inherited thrombophilia, antepartum immobilisation, pre-pregnancy BMI of 30 kg/m² or higher, pre-pregnancy smoking, previous superficial vein thrombosis, and other pregnancy-related conditions — were eligible. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) within 48 hours of delivery to receive either aspirin 81 mg (80 mg in Europe) orally daily (low-dose aspirin group) or placebo once daily (placebo group) for 42 days. Follow-up visits occurred at 6 weeks and 90 days postpartum. The primary outcome was the mean recruitment rate (participants per site per month). Additional feasibility metrics were reported, and clinical outcomes were analysed by intention to treat.

- **Findings**: Between Nov 2, 2020, and June 19, 2023, a total of 10,040 patients were assessed for eligibility, and 808 met all eligibility criteria.

### Aspirin is as effective and safe as oral anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after joint arthroplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^112fX2MS]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). High credibility.

Joint arthroplasty is a definitive treatment for conditions such as late-stage osteoarthritis. It markedly alleviates pain, improves quality of life, and preserves joint function to the greatest extent possible. However, postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a typical complication. Reports indicate that without effective prophylactic measures, the incidence of VTE within 90 days after joint arthroplasty can be as high as 60%. VTE development increases treatment costs, hospital stay, and may lead to potentially life-threatening embolization of vital organs.

Literature confirms the efficacy of factor Xa inhibitors (e.g. rivaroxaban), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and warfarin in preventing postoperative VTE. However, there is no consensus on the optimal chemoprophylactic agent. Existing medications reduce the incidence of VTE; however, excessive intervention may increase the risks of postoperative bleeding, wound infection, and internal hemorrhage. In addition, LMWH requires long-term subcutaneous injections, which are inconvenient for patients after discharge. Oral anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban are expensive, and although warfarin is relatively affordable, patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy require regular monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR).

Previous studies suggest that aspirin alone, as a chemoprophylactic agent for VTE after joint arthroplasty, is not less effective than other chemical prophylactics. Similarly, Matharu et al. revealed no significant differences between aspirin and other agents in the prevention of VTE.

### Low-dose aspirin is the safest prophylaxis for prevention of venous thromboembolism after total knee arthroplasty across all patient risk profiles [^11398cT2]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2024). High credibility.

The International Consensus Meeting on Venous Thromboembolism (ICM-VTE) in 2022 proclaimed low-dose aspirin as the most effective agent in patients across all risk profiles undergoing joint arthroplasty. However, data on large patient populations assessing trends in chemoprophylactic choices and related outcomes following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remain scant. The present study was designed to characterize the clinical use of various chemoprophylactic agents in patients undergoing TKA and to determine the efficacy of aspirin compared with other agents in patient groups stratified by VTE risk profiles.

- **Methods**: This study utilized a national database to determine the proportion of patients undergoing TKA who received low-dose aspirin versus other chemoprophylaxis between 2012 and 2022. VTE risk profiles were determined on the basis of comorbidities established in the ICM-VTE. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between various classes of thromboprophylaxis in patients with high and low risk of VTE were calculated. The odds of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolus (PE), bleeding events, infections, mortality, and hospitalizations were also assessed in the 90-day postoperative period for propensity-matched cohorts receiving low-dose (81 mg) aspirin only versus other prophylaxis, segregating patients by VTE risk profile.

- **Results**: A total of 126,692 patients undergoing TKA across 60 health-care organizations were included. The proportion of patients receiving low-dose aspirin increased from 7.65% to 55.29% between 2012 and 2022.

### Low molecular weight heparin prophylaxis in total knee arthroplasty: The answer [^112jLEbq]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

Venous thrombosis continues to be a major risk after total knee arthroplasty. Without prophylaxis, the prevalence of deep vein thrombosis is as high as 84%, with proximal occurrence as high as 20%. Of more concern is the occurrence of pulmonary embolism, which can be as high as 7%, and fatal cases can reach up to 0.7%. This high prevalence mandates the use of prophylaxis for thromboembolic disease in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.

Low molecular weight heparin has been extensively studied and is proven to be a safe and effective prophylaxis following total knee arthroplasty. It is characterized by a predictable dose response, high bioavailability at low doses, and linear pharmacokinetics. With a half-life of approximately 4.5 hours, it provides effective dosing every 12 to 24 hours with rapid antithrombotic action.

Routine pharmacologic prophylaxis using low molecular weight heparin appears effective in reducing the occurrence of venous thromboembolism. However, the venographic prevalence of deep vein thrombosis among patients receiving prophylaxis remains substantial at 30.6%. Given the trend of decreased hospital stays, prophylaxis beyond hospitalization may be indicated, although studies have not convincingly demonstrated the necessity for extended outpatient prophylaxis beyond 7 to 10 days.

### Is extended-duration (post-hospital discharge) venous thromboembolism chemoprophylaxis safe and efficacious in high-risk surgery patients? A systematic review [^114jgvQt]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). High credibility.

The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) persists beyond hospitalization in surgical patients, yet post-hospital discharge chemoprophylaxis regimens are not common. The purpose of this study is to systematically review the literature regarding extended-duration (post-hospital discharge) venous thromboembolism chemoprophylaxis and to determine whether it is warranted in high-risk surgical patients, as determined by its safety and efficacy.

- **Method**: We searched four online databases for articles evaluating extended-duration (post-hospital discharge) VTE chemoprophylaxis regimens in surgical patients between January 2000 and February 2020. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were used. GRADE methodology and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Randomized Controlled Trials were employed to grade the quality of evidence and assess risk of bias.

- **Results**: Nineteen studies with 10,544 patients were analyzed. The duration for extended-duration VTE chemoprophylaxis ranged from 7 to 42 days. In our study cohort, high-risk patients not prescribed extended-duration VTE chemoprophylaxis had a mean VTE incidence rate of 12.23%, while patients receiving 28–30 days of chemoprophylaxis had a mean VTE incidence rate of 4.37% (p = 0.006). The risk of bleeding events did not correlate with the duration of chemoprophylaxis.

- **Conclusion**: Extended-duration VTE chemoprophylaxis in high-risk surgical patients decreased the incidence of thrombotic complications without increasing the risk of bleeding events. Further research is warranted to solidify these findings and establish comprehensive guidelines.

### Practices to prevent venous thromboembolism: A brief review [^112SNedU]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprised of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE), is estimated to account for 5–10% of all deaths among hospitalized patients. In addition, non-fatal VTE events are associated with significant morbidities. In 2008, the US Surgeon General issued a Call to Action to Prevent DVT and PE. The report highlights the large number of patients afflicted by DVT (350,000–600,000) and those killed by PE (> 100,000) every year in the United States.

Both pharmacological and mechanical prophylactic interventions have been demonstrated to be highly effective in preventing many, but not all, VTE events. It has been estimated that best practice prophylaxis may reduce the incidence of DVT by up to 70%. The underlying pharmacological mechanism of all prophylaxis medications is to decrease clotting, potentially increasing the risk of bleeding. The balance between bleeding and clotting must be considered, and the harms and benefits must be weighed before administering these drugs. Blanket approaches that apply the same medication at the same dose and frequency to all patients may not be beneficial and can cause more harm than good. Therefore, individual patient risk assessment is paramount to ensure that all patients receive optimal prophylaxis.

Most hospitalized patients have one or more risk factors for VTE. Evidence-based, best practice prophylaxis varies according to individual patient risk factors (e.g. cancer, advanced age, immobility, history of VTE) and primary clinical service (e.g. medicine, surgery, trauma, orthopedics). Specialty-specific practices should be considered to ensure efficacy.

### Practices to prevent venous thromboembolism: A brief review [^116pJKpW]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Low credibility.

Strong evidence from numerous high-quality trials supports the effectiveness of VTE prophylaxis for specific populations. However, there are significant potential harms, and risk stratification is necessary to ensure that prophylaxis is targeted to appropriate patients. Unfortunately, rates of VTE prophylaxis remain suboptimal, and VTE continues to be a difficult and elusive crisis in patient safety. Relatively little evidence exists on which specific interventions are effective for increasing rates of VTE prophylaxis in appropriate populations.

As with other patient safety interventions, educating providers on the benefits of appropriate VTE prophylaxis alone is not an effective strategy to improve the use of appropriate VTE prophylaxis. Evidence, although mostly low quality (non-randomized studies without controls), supports that education combined with other quality improvement strategies and information technology approaches, such as alerts and mandatory computerized clinical decision support, appear to offer the most effective approaches to promote best practice prophylaxis use and prevent patient harm resulting from VTE.

### Low-dose aspirin is safe and effective for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis following total knee arthroplasty [^117YGXDa]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2018). High credibility.

Aspirin is an effective prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The optimal prophylactic aspirin dose has not been established. The study aims to compare two aspirin regimens with regard to the incidence of: (1) symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT), (2) pulmonary embolism (PE), (3) bleeding, and (4) mortality within 90 days after TKA.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively identified 5666 patients who received aspirin twice daily for 4 to 6 weeks after TKA. A total of 1327 patients received 81-mg BID and 4339 patients received 325-mg BID aspirin. Postoperative complications collected were VTEs (DVT and PE), bleeding (gastrointestinal or wound bleeding), and mortality.

- **Results**: The incidence of VTE was 1.5% in the 325-mg group and 0.7% in the 81-mg group (P = 0.02). Symptomatic DVT was 1.4% in the 325-mg aspirin compared with 0.3% for the 81-mg aspirin (P = 0.0009). Regression model showed no correlation between aspirin dose and VTE incidence (odds ratio [OR] = 1.03; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.45–2.36; p = 0.94) or DVT (OR = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.16–1.55; p = 0.20). The incidence of PE was 0.2% in the high-aspirin group compared with 0.4% in the low-aspirin group (P = 0.13). Bleeding was 0.2% in the 325-mg aspirin group and 0.2% in the 81-mg aspirin group (P = 0.62), and 90-day mortality was similar (0.1%) between the groups (P = 0.56).

- **Conclusion**: Low-dose aspirin was not inferior to high-dose aspirin for the prevention of VTE after TKA. Low-dose aspirin can be considered a safe and effective agent in the prevention of VTE after TKA.

### Aspirin as thromboprophylaxis in hip and knee arthroplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^11728AMZ]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) comprises pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis and is a complication of particular concern in lower limb arthroplasty. In recent years, aspirin has emerged as a potential alternative thromboprophylactic agent, particularly after its acceptance as a recommended agent by the American College of Chest Physicians. Aspirin is favorable due to its relative cost-effectiveness and convenience compared to novel oral anticoagulants and warfarin. However, its efficacy since its inclusion in the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines remains unclear. The present systematic review aimed to establish the efficacy of aspirin in preventing VTE in total hip and knee arthroplasty.

- **Methods**: Electronic searches were performed using six databases from up to June 2015, identifying all relevant studies. Data were extracted and meta-analyzed.

- **Results**: Eleven relevant studies were identified for inclusion in the present meta-analysis. The overall rate of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in both hip and knee arthroplasty was 1.2% and 0.6%, respectively. The rate of major bleeding was 0.3%. The pooled mortality rate was 0.2%. All findings demonstrated a high and significant degree of heterogeneity.

- **Conclusion**: Aspirin, both alone and in multimodal approaches to thromboprophylaxis, confers a low rate of VTE, with a low risk of major bleeding complications. However, the evidence for its use is limited by the low quality of studies and variation in dosing regimes. Future randomized controlled trials should investigate the efficacy…

### Low-dose aspirin is safe and effective for prevention of venous thromboembolism after femoral neck fracture [^114K1Vch]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). High credibility.

Although patients who undergo arthroplasty for hip fractures are at high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), guidelines do not specify the optimal VTE prophylactic agent. Recent evidence demonstrates that aspirin (ASA) may be safe and effective for VTE prevention in these patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of low-dose ASA (81 mg) compared to non-ASA agents after arthroplasty for femoral neck fracture.

- **Methods**: A total of 36,576 patients who underwent arthroplasty for femoral neck fracture from January 2012 through December 2023 were identified in a national database. Patients were stratified by baseline VTE risk into high-risk and standard-risk groups and further categorized based on the type of VTE prophylaxis received — low-dose ASA only or non-ASA prophylaxis only. Rates and odds of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism (PE), and adverse events, including bleeding, blood transfusion requirements, and emergency department visits, were assessed in the 90-days postoperative period for propensity-matched cohorts.

- **Results**: Compared to non-ASA prophylaxis, use of low-dose ASA only was associated with significantly lower odds of deep vein thrombosis in both high-risk (odds ratio [OR]: 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.30 to 0.69) and standard-risk (OR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.76) groups, and lower odds of PE in high-risk patients (OR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.55). There were no significant differences in odds of PE in standard-risk patients (OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.32 to 1.61). Low-dose ASA was associated with…

### Does aspirin prevent venous thromboembolism [^1168joFP]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2020). High credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism, is a well-established cause of morbidity and mortality in both medical and surgical patient populations. Clinical research on the prevention and treatment of VTE has been a dynamic field of study, focusing on various treatment modalities ranging from mechanical prophylaxis to direct oral anticoagulants. Aspirin has long been an inexpensive cornerstone of arterial vascular disease therapy; however, its role in the primary or secondary prophylaxis of VTE has been debated.

Risk-benefit tradeoffs between aspirin and anticoagulants have evolved due to advances in surgical techniques and postoperative care, as well as the development of safe, easy-to-use oral anticoagulants. This paper reviews the proposed mechanisms by which aspirin may act on venous thrombosis, examines the evidence for aspirin use in the primary and secondary prophylaxis of VTE, and discusses the risk of bleeding with aspirin as compared to anticoagulation.

### Low-dose vs regular-dose aspirin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in primary total joint arthroplasty [^112AG9to]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Low credibility.

Consensus has not been reached on whether low-dose (81 mg) or regular-dose (325 mg) aspirin (ASA) is more effective for venous thromboembolism (VTE) chemoprophylaxis in primary total joint arthroplasties (TJAs). This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose and regular-dose ASA for VTE chemoprophylaxis in primary total hip arthroplasties and total knee arthroplasties.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively identified 3512 primary TJAs (2344 total hip arthroplasties and 1168 total knee arthroplasties) with ASA used as VTE chemoprophylaxis between 2000 and 2019. Patients received ASA twice daily for 4–6 weeks after surgery, with 961 (27%) receiving low-dose ASA and 2551 (73%) receiving regular-dose ASA. The primary endpoint was the 90-day incidence of symptomatic VTEs. Secondary outcomes were gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding events and mortality. The mean age at index TJA was 66 years, 54% were female, and the mean body mass index was 31 kg/m². The mean Charlson Comorbidity Index was 3.5, and the mean follow-up period was 3 years.

- **Results**: There was no difference in the 90-day incidence of symptomatic VTEs between low-dose and regular-dose ASA (0% vs. 0.1%, respectively; p = 0.79). There were no GI bleeding events in either group. Additionally, there was no difference in the 90-day mortality between low-dose and regular-dose ASA (0.3% vs. 0.1%, respectively; p = 0.24).

- **Conclusion**: In 3512 primary TJA patients treated with ASA, we found a cumulative incidence of VTE of less than 1% at 90 days. Although this study is underpowered, it appears that twice-daily low-dose ASA was equally effective as twice-daily regular-dose ASA.

### Aspirin is as effective and safe as oral anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after joint arthroplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^111dnBnN]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). High credibility.

Previous studies have been conducted on the use of aspirin for preventing VTE, including comparisons of LMWH with aspirin and aspirin with a placebo. However, no meta-analyses have compared aspirin with OACs. Our pooled results showed essentially no heterogeneity, with the highest I² value being 4.4%, and the conclusions were robust in all sensitivity analyses and subanalyses. The GRADE evidence level was high, indicating that it provides meaningful guidance for clinical practice. We used a thorough and rigorous search strategy encompassing multiple databases without language restrictions. By exclusively including RCTs, we eliminated the selection bias associated with observational studies. We also performed a thorough evaluation of the methodological quality of the included studies. We conducted a thorough analysis by systematically investigating the potential sources of heterogeneity across various study-level characteristics and testing for evidence of effect modification. Notably, our analyses included only patients undergoing joint arthroplasty, addressing the limitations we have noted in previous trials and systematic reviews.

Despite the high level of evidence, however, this study has some limitations, most of which are inherent to meta-analyses. First, only 2 of the included studies reported blinding of both participants and outcome assessors, 5 did not specify the blinding status of at least 1 of these, and the remaining 4 failed to blind at least 1 of these, resulting in a notable risk of bias.

### Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in the medical patient: controversies and perspectives [^111NDS8A]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Despite the high morbidity and mortality associated with venous thromboembolism in hospitalized at-risk medical patients, the publication of large-scale studies shows that prophylaxis is effective in this patient group, and international guidelines highlight its importance. However, prophylaxis rates in medically ill patients remain suboptimal. Studies indicate that low-molecular-weight heparins, administered once daily, are at least as effective as unfractionated heparin usually given three times daily, with equivalent or improved safety profiles. Additionally, thrice-daily dosing of unfractionated heparin might be more effective than twice-daily dosing.

The most recent American College of Chest Physicians guidelines do not differentiate between these regimens, and twice-daily unfractionated heparin is still commonly used in the United States. Moreover, the optimal duration for out-of-hospital and extended prophylaxis for specific patient groups is not clearly established. There is a paucity of data on the use of mechanical methods in this patient group, and no established standard of care for special patient populations, such as obese patients or those with renal insufficiency. Although prophylaxis entails additional acquisition costs, it can reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism, thereby improving care and decreasing overall costs.

### Aspirin in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism [^113xkYT6]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2006). Low credibility.

This review summarizes the available evidence on the effects of aspirin on the incidence and outcomes of venous thromboembolism (VTE). From a pathophysiological perspective, inhibition of platelet aggregation is associated with impaired thrombus formation both in experimental models of venous thrombosis and in vivo. Epidemiological evidence supporting a beneficial effect of acetylsalicylic acid on VTE incidence is provided by the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of studies on antiplatelet agents in cardiovascular risk reduction, which shows a significant 25% risk reduction of pulmonary embolism. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of older trials on antiplatelet agents for postsurgical VTE prevention, along with the large Pulmonary Embolism Prevention trial, demonstrates a protective effect of the same magnitude: 25–30%.

However, low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) have shown superior efficacy and safety profiles. No direct comparisons have been made between aspirin, LMWH, and VKA for prolonged use. Consequently, the most recent guidelines advise against aspirin monotherapy for thromboprophylaxis in surgical patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of aspirin for air travel-related VTE. Regarding the prevention of recurrent VTE (reVTE), studies are ongoing to determine the potential role of aspirin following a first unprovoked VTE.

### Low-dose aspirin is effective chemoprophylaxis against clinically important venous thromboembolism following total joint arthroplasty: A preliminary analysis [^11548fEi]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2017). Low credibility.

Aspirin is a safe and effective prophylaxis for the prevention of venous thromboembolism following total joint arthroplasty. The optimal dose of aspirin prophylaxis is unknown. Our hypothesis was that lower-dose aspirin is as effective as higher-dose aspirin for the prevention of venous thromboembolism and is associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects.

- **Methods**: In a prospective, crossover study, we analyzed 4,651 primary total joint arthroplasty cases performed from July 2013 to June 2015. For 4 weeks, 3,192 patients received enteric-coated 325-mg aspirin twice daily (the 325-mg aspirin group) and 1,459 patients received 81-mg aspirin twice daily (the 81-mg aspirin group). There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in sex, body mass index, or Charlson Comorbidity Index between the two patient populations. Recorded complications occurring within 90 days postoperatively included symptomatic venous thromboembolism (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), gastrointestinal complications, acute periprosthetic joint infection, and death.

- **Results**: The incidence of venous thromboembolism of 0.1% (95% confidence interval, 0% to 0.3%) in the 81-mg aspirin group (1 with deep venous thrombosis and 1 with pulmonary embolism) was not significantly different (p = 0.345) from 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1% to 0.6%) in the 325-mg aspirin group (7 with deep venous thrombosis and 5 with pulmonary embolism). The incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration of 0.3% (95% CI, 0% to 0.5%) in the 81-mg aspirin group was slightly, but not significantly (p = 0.66).

### Thromboprophylaxis in nonsurgical patients [^114AzfNr]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in medically ill patients. Randomized controlled trials indicate that pharmacologic prophylaxis reduces deep venous thrombosis (relative risk [RR] = 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.36–0.59) and pulmonary embolism (RR = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.33–0.72), with a nonsignificant trend toward more bleeding (RR = 1.36; 95% CI, 0.80–2.33). Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin are equally efficacious in preventing deep venous thrombosis (RR = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.69–1.06) and pulmonary embolism (RR = 1.05; 95% CI, 0.47–2.38), but LMWH is associated with significantly less major bleeding (RR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.23–0.85). LMWH is favored for VTE prophylaxis in critically ill patients.

New VTE and bleeding risk stratification tools offer the potential to improve the risk-benefit ratio for VTE prophylaxis in medically ill patients. Intermittent pneumatic compression devices should be used for VTE prophylaxis in patients with contraindications to pharmacologic prophylaxis. Graduated compression stockings should be used with caution. VTE prevention in medically ill patients using extended-duration VTE prophylaxis and new oral anticoagulants warrant further investigation. VTE prophylaxis prescription and administration rates are suboptimal and warrant multidisciplinary performance improvement strategies.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: Treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^114NWYuG]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of deep vein thrombosis, and specifically concerning the use of aspirin for extended treatment, the ASH 2020 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of anticoagulation over aspirin in patients with DVT and/or PE who have completed primary treatment and are continuing to receive secondary prevention.
