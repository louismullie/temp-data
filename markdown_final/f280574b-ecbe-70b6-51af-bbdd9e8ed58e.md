## Question

NSTEMI initial management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the initial management of NSTEMI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and diagnostic confirmation. Then, I should verify risk stratification and how it drives strategy. Next, I will examine antithrombotic therapy choices and timing. After that, I need to decide on invasive versus conservative strategy and the timing of angiography. Finally, I should consider special populations, secondary prevention, and how to address the risk–treatment paradox, while continuously checking for internal consistency and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the essentials of immediate stabilization and diagnostic confirmation, because missing STEMI or delaying troponin changes everything. I should obtain a 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes, start continuous monitoring, establish IV access, give aspirin 150–325 mg chewed if not contraindicated, and order high-sensitivity troponin with serial measurements at 0 and 1–2 hours or conventional troponin at 0 and 3–6 hours, while excluding STEMI and applying a validated clinical decision pathway to classify risk and likelihood of NSTEMI [^111NfajK] [^116f1Uy6].

> Wait, let me verify the risk stratification step, since it determines whether we pursue an early invasive strategy. I should calculate GRACE and consider TIMI, recognizing that GRACE predicts mortality and is preferred for timing decisions; high-risk features include GRACE > 140, dynamic ST-T changes, transient ST elevation, ongoing chest pain, hemodynamic or electrical instability, and elevated troponin, and I need to ensure I do not conflate type 1 and type 2 MI because type 2 MI often carries higher comorbidity and may alter the balance of benefit for invasive therapy [^111k4V6v] [^116BLE1J] [^114VLWoq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antithrombotic therapy; I should confirm choices and timing. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor is indicated for 12 months unless bleeding risk is high, with ticagrelor or prasugrel preferred over clopidogrel when PCI is planned or when a potent agent is acceptable; prasugrel should be avoided in patients ≥ 75 years, < 60 kg, or with prior stroke/TIA, and I should consider pretreatment with a P2Y12 inhibitor if an early invasive strategy is not expected within 24 hours and bleeding risk is not high [^111KzuSz] [^114zrV3R] [^113nkFZC]. I need to check anticoagulation: parenteral anticoagulation is indicated in all ACS patients at diagnosis, with fondaparinux favored when a conservative strategy is chosen and bivalirudin or unfractionated heparin considered when an early invasive strategy is pursued, balancing ischemic benefit against bleeding risk [^115V9Jju] [^112BC7Qz].

> I will now examine the invasive versus conservative decision, and I should double-check that I align with contemporary guidance. For high-risk patients, an early invasive strategy with angiography within 24 hours is recommended to reduce MACE; for intermediate risk, an invasive approach during hospitalization is advised; for low risk, either a routine invasive or selective ischemia-guided strategy is acceptable, with angiography before discharge if an invasive approach is chosen; immediate invasive evaluation is indicated for refractory angina, hemodynamic or electrical instability, or very high-risk features [^117R44fA] [^113eUGrP] [^111k4V6v]. But wait, what if the patient is frail, very elderly, or has limited life expectancy? In that case, a conservative strategy may be reasonable after shared decision-making, acknowledging that routine invasive therapy may not improve survival in such patients despite reducing ischemic events [^1157fqzC].

> Let me think about timing more precisely, because I initially thought "within 12 hours" was the universal target; hmm, wait a minute, I should correct that. The strongest evidence-supported benchmark is within 24 hours for high-risk NSTEMI, with some trials exploring very early strategies (< 12 hours) showing mixed results; TIMACS suggested benefit of early invasive therapy primarily in GRACE > 140, and RIDDLE-NSTEMI showed fewer early MIs with immediate intervention but no long-term mortality difference, while RAPID-NSTEMI was underpowered and did not show outcome differences, so I should individualize timing to risk, logistics, and bleeding risk rather than fixate on a single threshold [^111k4V6v] [^111fUGdi] [^117W7B4X] [^111J94Ak] [^115AvMci].

> Next, I should review special populations, because the balance of benefit and risk shifts. In patients ≥ 75 years, an invasive strategy reduces reinfarction and urgent revascularization without increasing bleeding in meta-analyses, but frailty, cognitive impairment, or limited life expectancy may tilt toward conservative care; in prior CABG, evidence is mixed and observational, so I should avoid assuming equivalent benefit and consider anatomy, symptoms, and graft patency; in type 2 MI, I need to treat the precipitating supply–demand imbalance rather than default to antithrombotics and invasive therapy, which may not address the underlying cause [^1157fqzC] [^112a2tD9] [^114VLWoq].

> I should confirm secondary prevention elements that start during hospitalization and continue long term, because they materially affect outcomes. High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated regardless of baseline LDL, dual antiplatelet therapy continued for 12 months if bleeding risk allows, beta-blocker started and titrated if no contraindications, ACE inhibitor or ARB for LV dysfunction, diabetes, or hypertension, and risk factor modification including blood pressure, diabetes, smoking cessation, and cardiac rehabilitation referral; in patients at high bleeding risk, ESC allows DAPT de-escalation to monotherapy after 1 month, which I should consider in shared decision-making [^113sFaWM] [^111KzuSz] [^115nrKt4].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am addressing the risk–treatment paradox, because undertreatment of high-risk patients is common. High-risk NSTEMI patients frequently receive less guideline-directed therapy and fewer invasive procedures despite greater absolute benefit, and observational data show that optimal, guideline-indicated care yields larger survival gains in higher-risk patients; therefore, I need to actively counteract risk underestimation and system barriers to ensure equitable, risk-aligned care [^114MNqKw] [^114MzwMx] [^116ZCyb2].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency: stabilize and confirm diagnosis with ECG and serial troponin, apply GRACE-based risk stratification, initiate aspirin and anticoagulation promptly, add a P2Y12 inhibitor with timing tailored to invasive strategy and bleeding risk, choose an early invasive approach for high and intermediate risk with angiography within 24 hours when indicated, individualize timing and strategy for special populations, and implement comprehensive secondary prevention with attention to bleeding risk and patient preferences; this aligns with contemporary ACC/AHA/ACEP and ESC guidance and integrates the best available evidence on timing and risk stratification [^111NfajK] [^117R44fA] [^111k4V6v].

Initial management of NSTEMI centers on **immediate ECG and serial high-sensitivity troponin** to confirm diagnosis and risk-stratify, with ECG within 10 minutes and troponin at 0 and 1–2 hours [^111NfajK] [^116f1Uy6]. Start **aspirin 150–325 mg** [^113CjF7p] and a **P2Y12 inhibitor** (ticagrelor 180 mg or clopidogrel 300–600 mg) [^111KzuSz] if no contraindications, and initiate parenteral anticoagulation (fondaparinux or enoxaparin) [^115V9Jju] [^112BC7Qz]. Use GRACE or TIMI to guide strategy: high-risk patients (GRACE > 140, dynamic ST-T changes, or ongoing ischemia) should have **early invasive angiography within 24 hours** [^111k4V6v] [^117R44fA]; intermediate-risk patients should have angiography during hospitalization; low-risk patients may have a selective strategy with noninvasive testing [^113eUGrP]. Add beta-blocker, nitrate, and high-dose statin unless contraindicated, and monitor for arrhythmias, recurrent ischemia, and bleeding [^113CjF7p] [^113sFaWM].

---

## Initial evaluation and diagnosis

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Obtain within 10 minutes of presentation; look for ST depression, T-wave inversion, or nonspecific changes [^111NfajK].

- **Cardiac troponin**: Use high-sensitivity assays at presentation and repeat at 1–2 hours; a significant rise confirms myocardial injury [^111NfajK] [^116f1Uy6].

- **Risk stratification**: Apply GRACE or TIMI to estimate 30-day mortality and guide therapy intensity [^111S5BwM] [^116BLE1J].

## Risk-stratified invasive strategy

- **High-risk patients**: Early invasive strategy with coronary angiography within 24 hours (GRACE > 140, dynamic ST-T changes, or ongoing ischemia) [^111k4V6v] [^117R44fA].

- **Intermediate-risk patients**: Invasive evaluation during hospitalization [^113eUGrP].

- **Low-risk patients**: Selective strategy with noninvasive testing (stress imaging or CT angiography) before deciding on angiography [^113eUGrP].

---

## Monitoring and complications

Continuous monitoring should include telemetry for **arrhythmias and recurrent ischemia**. Complications to anticipate include arrhythmias, recurrent ischemia, heart failure, and bleeding from antithrombotic therapy.

---

## Summary of initial management steps

- **Immediate ECG and serial troponin**: Confirm diagnosis and risk-stratify [^111NfajK].

- **Antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy**: Aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor, and parenteral anticoagulation [^111KzuSz] [^115V9Jju].

- **Risk-stratified invasive strategy**: Early angiography for high-risk; selective strategy for low-risk [^111k4V6v] [^113eUGrP].

- **Supportive therapy**: Beta-blocker, nitrate, and high-dose statin unless contraindicated [^113CjF7p] [^113sFaWM].

- **Continuous monitoring**: Watch for arrhythmias, ischemia, and bleeding.

Introduction

Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is the most common acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Options for management of these patients include a default invasive management strategy (coronary angiography with or without revascularisation (percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)) as required during admission, or a conservative strategy, whereby non-invasive assessment of coronary ischaemia coupled with an initial attempt at medical therapy is adopted to control symptoms and invasive management applied if this fails.

Early randomised controlled trialsdirectly compared a routine invasive strategy with a conservative management strategy, these studies yielded mixed outcomes when describing management strategy effect on incidence of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction and refractory angina. A subsequent meta-analysis of eight randomised controlled clinical trials, inclusive of the aforementioned conducted from 1999 to 2012 including 8915 patients diagnosed with NSTEMI, compared invasive management with conservative management strategies and reported no statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality at 6 to 12-month follow-up. However, these studies tested a strategy, not an intervention, with many patients in the conservative arm undergoing subsequent coronary revascularisation, which may itself have had a salutary effect on mortality and accounted for the lack of differences observed. Indeed, several large observational cohort studies from a number of countries have reported decreasing in-hospital and overall long-term mortality rates following NSTEMI diagnosis over time all strongly associated with increasing use of invasive management.

Coronary revascularisation impacts on mortality primarily through a reduction in cardiovascular modes of death. Studies evaluating new treatments of ACS recognise this, with most recent trials prioritising cardiovascular rather than all-cause mortality for inclusion in their primary outcomes. However, a reduction in total mortality is a more meaningful and robust outcome when applying therapies in clinical practice, and it is likely that not all patients with NSTEMI benefit from invasive management. Indeed, recent trials show a suggestion of harm when a routine invasive strategy is implemented in NSTEMI patients with clinical evidence of frailty. In these and similarly comorbid patients, concomitant conditions can give rise to competing mortality risks, which might neutralise the potential benefit of a coronary revascularisation procedure on overall mortality. If this was the case, we might expect to see a plateauing of mortality benefit as invasive management rates increase across NSTEMI populations.

### Unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: part I. initial evaluation and management, and hospital care [^111d5Tt4]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Each year, more than 1 million patients are admitted to U.S. hospitals because of unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI). To help standardize the assessment and treatment of these patients, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association convened a task force to formulate a management guideline. This guideline, which was published in 2000 and updated in 2002, highlights recent medical advances and is a practical tool to help physicians provide medical care for patients with UA/NSTEMI. Management of suspected UA/NSTEMI has four components: initial evaluation and management; hospital care; coronary revascularization; and hospital discharge and post-hospital care. Part I of this two-part article discusses the first two components of management. During the initial evaluation, the history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and cardiac biomarkers are used to determine the likelihood that the patient has UA/NSTEMI and to aid in risk assessment when the diagnosis is established. Hospital care consists of appropriate initial triage and monitoring. Medical treatment includes anti-ischemic therapy (oxygen, nitroglycerin, beta blocker), antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel, platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor), and antithrombotic therapy (heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin).

### Early invasive management of acute coronary syndromes… [^115G4rET]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Details for This Review Study Population: Patients with unstable angina or acute non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction Efficacy End Points: Death, myocardial infarction, angina symptoms, and rehospitalization at six- to 12-month follow-up Harm End Points: Bleeding, periprocedural myocardial infarction, death. Narrative: Reperfusion therapy for acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction has been shown to be beneficial. However, there is controversy regarding the management of unstable angina and NSTEMI. Fowler and Conti coined the term unstable angina in 1971 for patients who did not meet the criteria for acute myocardial infarction or stable angina. 1, 2 The term may be outdated now with the increased sensitivity of cardiac troponins. Patients with unstable angina or patients in the "gray zone" of symptomatic ischemia can now be diagnosed as having NSTEMI.

3 This Cochrane review 4 updates the 2010 review 5 of early invasive management for acute coronary syndrome that identifed five trials. That systematic review found a statistically significant reduction in myocardial infarction with the invasive strategy and concluded that an early invasive strategy was superior to a noninvasive strategy.
5. In this updated Cochrane review, 4 the authors added three new trials with a total of 1, 099 participants to the meta-analysis. Therefore, the updated Cochrane review represents eight randomized controlled trials with a total of 8, 915 participants randomized to an invasive strategy, whereby all patients undergo coronary angiography and revascularization, or a conservative strategy in which medical therapy is used initially and patients are selected for cardiac catheterization only if there is evidence of persistent myocardial ischemia.

The authors of the systematic review deemed the trials to have a high risk of performance-blinding bias. All studies were deemed to have low risk of attrition bias. The updated Cochrane review. 6, 7 The LIPSIA-NSTEMI trial included participants who already had elevated troponin levels, and routine use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors may have contributed to increased adverse events with the invasive strategy. 8 Inclusion of these high-risk populations may have caused the overall outcomes to be less favorable in both groups.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: sorting through type 1 vs other types [^114r5UAu]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The objective of current NSTEMI management guidelines is to provide recommendations for the relief of ischemia during hospitalization and, in the longer term, to prevent secondary events such as recurrent MI, events in other vascular beds, and death. 1, 3 All NSTEMI events should initially be diagnosed and managed in accordance with these guidelines regardless of MI type. However, current NSTEMI guidelines are more suited to type 1 NSTEMI than type 2 NSTEMI. Recent guidelines for MI classification have attempted to address this by providing an algorithmic approach to understanding the mechanistic basis for the occurrence of type 2 NSTEMI to facilitate appropriate treatment. Further studies are needed to address this unmet need in the treatment of the older, sicker patient with a type 2 NSTEMI. Meanwhile, given the preponderance of type 1 MI over type 2 MI in patients presenting with NSTEMI, and given the increased intermediate‐ and long‐term risk of major adverse CV events relative to STEMI, aggressive strategies need to be adopted in treating these patients. These include the appropriate use of early invasive approaches, antithrombotic agents that yield the best benefit‐risk outcomes, and other guideline‐directed therapies. On the other side, algorithms that address the multiple possible underlying causes for the myocardial oxygen supply‐demand imbalance in individual patients may be preferable for managing patients with type 2 NSTEMI. Future guidelines should include appropriate evidence‐based recommendations for the management of type 2 NSTEMI.

### Updates and current recommendations for the management of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: what it means for clinical practice [^116b9UiC]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) have recently updated their joint guidelines for the management of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS, including unstable angina [UA] and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]). These guidelines replace the 2007 guidelines and the focused updates from 2011 and 2012 and now combine UA and NSTEMI into a new classification, NSTE-ACS, and updating the terminology around noninvasive management to ischemia-guided strategy. The latest guidelines include updated recommendations for the use of the oral antiplatelet agents (P2Y12 inhibitors) prasugrel and ticagrelor as part of dual-antiplatelet therapy-the cornerstone of treatment for these patients. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the new and modified recommendations for the management of patients with NSTE-ACS and the evidence supporting them. Also, where appropriate, similarities and differences between the current recommendations of the AHA/ACC and those of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) are highlighted. For example, the AHA/ACC recommends the P2Y12 inhibitor ticagrelor over clopidogrel in all patients with NSTE-ACS and clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor for patients in whom percutaneous coronary intervention is planned, whereas the ESC guidelines specifically recommend individual P2Y12 inhibitors for particular patient subgroups.

### Contemporary approach to the diagnosis and management of non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes [^117PqKFi]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The management of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) has evolved dramatically over the past decade and, in many respects, represents a rapidly moving target for the cardiologist and internist who seek to integrate these recent advances into contemporary clinical practice. Unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) comprise a growing percentage of patients with ACS and is emerging as a major public health problem worldwide, especially in Western countries, despite significant improvements and refinements in management over the past 20 years. Against this backdrop of a multitude of randomized, controlled clinical trials that have established the scientific foundation upon which evidence-based treatment strategies have emerged and become increasingly refined, the clinician is frequently confronted with panoply of choices that can create uncertainty or confusion regarding "optimal management". While the debate about the ideal approach to the management of non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE) ACS (i.e., routine "early invasive strategy" versus an "ischemia-guided", or "conservative", strategy) has been ongoing for over a decade, clinical trials results provide compelling evidence that intermediate- and high-risk ACS patients derived significant reductions in both morbidity and mortality with mechanical or surgical intervention, especially when revascularization is coupled with aggressive, multifaceted (anti-platelet, antithrombin, anti-ischemic and anti-atherogenic) medical therapy along with risk factor modification. For these reasons, it seems especially timely and appropriate to present a state-of-the-art paper that reviews the latest advances in the management of NSTE ACS, mindful of the fact that even this noble effort to synthesize and integrate a prodigious amount of scientific information and cardiovascular therapeutics is destined to evolve still further as our full-scale assault on optimizing clinical outcomes by harmonizing the advances in mechanical and pharmacologic interventions continues unabated.

Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) guideline application — scope and potential harm is clarified: If these guidelines are erroneously applied to patients with ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (ACS), there is the potential for increased mortality, and clinicians should recognize that this recommendation applies only to those patients with a diagnosis of NSTEMI.

### Noninvasive, medical management for non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^112c1SUf]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Despite emphasis on the use of invasive management strategies for patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS) in recent practice guidelines, 27% to 56% of NSTE ACS patients do not undergo diagnostic angiography, and a further 45% to 78% do not undergo revascularization procedures during the initial hospitalization. These medically managed patients (also termed noninvasive management) have a greater frequency of medical comorbidities and high-risk clinical characteristics and are less likely to receive guideline-recommended medications, compared with patients who undergo revascularization procedures. The rates of short and long-term adverse outcomes are also substantially higher in medically managed NSTE ACS patients, but more widespread implementation of contemporary medical therapies in this population is limited by exclusion of medically managed patients from many randomized clinical trials.

### Early invasive strategy [^111fDfTh]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

The recent 2020 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation (NSTE) recommend an early (< 24 hours) invasive strategy with class of recommendation I, level of evidence A for the following groups of patients: all patients with NSTE myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) according to the diagnostic algorithm proposed by the guidelines, patients with dynamic or presumably new contiguous ST/T-segment changes suggesting ongoing ischaemia, patients with transient ST-segment elevation and patients with a Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score > 140.

This recommendation thus comprises a heterogeneous population including patients at very high risk, such as those with a GRACE score > 140, as well as those with a less defined risk profile, such as the whole population of patients with NSTEMI.

Does the evidence support an early invasive approach for all patients with NSTEMI?

There have been several randomised controlled trials and at least four meta-analyses investigating the optimal timing of an invasive strategy in patients with NSTE-ACS and the summary of the general evidence suggests that compared with a delayed invasive strategy, an early invasive strategy does not reduce the overall risk of death, myocardial infarction or stroke, but it may reduce the risk of recurrent/refractory ischaemia.

The findings on high-risk patients have been controversial, some studies reporting lower rates of mortality with an early invasive strategy, but with inconclusive interaction tests.

In addition, the reduction in recurrent ischaemia reported in two meta-analyses was associated with moderated-to-severe heterogeneity of treatment effect, suggesting caution on data interpretation.

### Acute coronary syndromes: selective vs early invasive strategies [^115Uac7H]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Recommendations in the 2007 update of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) provide considerable latitude regarding treatment choices and care pathways. Nevertheless, as accumulating evidence leads to increased recommendations for early invasive strategies, more patients are likely to receive care that falls short of recommendations. While tailoring pharmacotherapy to optimize the risk/benefit ratio for individual patients remains essential, it becomes increasingly important that care paradigms be prospectively defined. To facilitate this goal, we examined key differences between the 2002 and 2007 guidelines and explored data underlying changed recommendations for periprocedural pharmacotherapy.

### Observational analysis of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction invasive management and mortality over the decades [^113MqbWC]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

For patients diagnosed with NSTEMI in NSW, there were significant improvements in both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality between 2003 and 2020. These improvements were observed alongside the increased use of invasive management strategies over the same time period. The benefit appears greatest in patients managed invasively and our data suggest that a plateau on mortality benefit among invasively managed patients has not yet been reached. These data suggest we should continue to expand the provision of invasive management to NSTEMI patients with the expectation that further implementation of invasive strategies among patients who are currently managed conservatively will continue to impact favourably on mortality in patients presenting with NSTEMI in NSW.

3.4.2 Antiplatelet therapy

Antiplatelet therapy is an essential first‐line component of guideline‐recommended type 1 NSTEMI treatment, to inhibit platelet activation and thus reduce acute ischemic complications and prevent further atherothrombotic events. 1, 3 Dual antiplatelet therapy, consisting of a P2Y 12 inhibitor plus aspirin, is indicated for patients who are initially treated with either an early invasive or medical management strategy. 1, 2, 37, 38 Dual antiplatelet therapy guidelines support the use of the P2Y 12 inhibitor ticagrelor rather than clopidogrel in type 1 NSTEMI, regardless of whether early revascularization is performed, based on the results of the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) study. 37, 38, 39

Following successful recovery from the acute phase of an NSTEMI, patients remain at an increased risk of subsequent CV events and premature death. 40, 41, 42, 43 Current NSTEMI guidelines therefore recommend that dual antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y 12 inhibitor plus aspirin be continued for ≥ 12 months after the index date, after an assessment of the individual patient's ischemic and bleeding risk. 1, 3, 37, 38

Recommendations for antiplatelet therapy are more applicable to patients with type 1 NSTEMI, as intracoronary thrombosis is absent in patients with type 2 MI. 5 Furthermore, there is a lack of data on the use of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with type 2 NSTEMI from either randomized controlled trials or observational studies. 44

3.4.3 Anticoagulant therapy

As with antiplatelet therapy, recommendations for anticoagulant treatment apply primarily to patients with type 1 MI because of the lack of atherothrombotic plaque rupture in type 2 MI. Administration of anticoagulants during the initial treatment of type 1 NSTEMI is effective in reducing ischemic events, and the combination of an anticoagulant and dual antiplatelet therapy during the acute phase is more effective for this than either treatment alone. 3 Treatment with an anticoagulant during the acute phase is therefore recommended for all patients with a type 1 NSTEMI, regardless of the initial management strategy. 1, 3 Unlike dual antiplatelet therapy, discontinuation of anticoagulants beyond the acute phase, for example, after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), should be considered in type 1 NSTEMI unless there is a compelling reason to continue. 1, 3 For information on the management of patients who have another condition prompting continuation of anticoagulation, please refer to recent studies such as PIONEER AF‐PCI, RE‐DUAL PCI, and AUGUSTUS. 45, 46, 47

### Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the United States: contemporary trends in incidence, utilization of the early invasive strategy, and in-hospital outcomes [^1178kyA6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Data from the United States and Europe have reported a decrease in the incidence of ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with an increase in non‐ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the past decade. – Current 2012 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend early invasive strategy (EIS) for management of patients with NSTEMI and refractory angina or electrical or hemodynamic insufficiency (class IB), initially stabilized patients with NSTEMI, and high risk of clinical events (class IA). The early invasive approach (within 12 to 24 hours of presentation) to reduce ischemic complications is also recommended in initially stabilized high‐risk patients with NSTEMI (class IIA). The optimal timing of EIS has been debated and undergone a paradigm shift in the last decade. The transition from 48 hours to within 24 hours occurred after the publication of the Timing of Intervention in Acute Coronary Syndromes (TIMACS) trial in 2009. – However, there is a paucity of information with regard to the secular trends in utilization of EIS in patients with NSTEMI and how this may vary among different NSTEMI patient populations. Using a large nationwide administrative database, the present study aimed to analyze and describe age‐, sex‐, and race/ethnicity‐specific trends in the incidence, utilization of EIS, and in‐hospital outcomes for NSTEMI in the United States from 2002 to 2011.

Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS) in adult emergency department (ED) patients — initial risk stratification recommendations state: Level A recommendations: None specified. Level B recommendations: In adult patients without evidence of ST-elevation ACS, the History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, Troponin (HEART) score can be used as a clinical prediction instrument for risk stratification, and a low score (≤ 3) predicts 30-day MACE miss rate within a range of 0% to 2%. Level C recommendations: In adult patients without evidence of ST-elevation ACS, other risk-stratification tools, such as Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI), can be used to predict rate of 30-day MACE. Potential Benefit of Implementing the Recommendations includes decreased use of limited resources, and Potential Harm of Implementing the Recommendations is the potential for missed cases of preventable MI or death.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Patients with NSTEMI have a higher long‐term mortality risk than patients with STEMI but are often treated less aggressively, with those who have the highest ischemic risk often receiving the least aggressive treatment (the "treatment‐risk paradox"). The suboptimal treatment of patients with NSTEMI can be explained by the heterogeneity of patient characteristics, an underestimation of the high ischemic risk compared with bleeding risk by physicians, procedure availability, and policy. To address these challenges, potential approaches include: developing guidelines and protocols that include rigorous definitions of NSTEMI, risk assessment, and integrated quality assessment measures; providing education to physicians on the management of long‐term cardiovascular risk in patients with NSTEMI; and making stents and antiplatelet therapies more accessible to patients.

1 INTRODUCTION

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) includes a spectrum spanning unstable angina, non ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). 1, 2, 3

Typically, ACS results from an abrupt total (STEMI and some NSTEMI) or subtotal (NSTEMI only) interruption of coronary artery blood flow, and therefore oxygen supply, to cardiac tissues. 1, 4 This occurs as a result of coronary artery occlusion following atherosclerotic plaque disruption, where the rupture or erosion of an atherosclerotic plaque leads to the formation of an intraluminal thrombus in one or more coronary arteries. 1, 3 Myocardial infarction (MI) can also result from distal thrombotic embolization. 1, 5 Evaluation of the clinical presentation and determining the underlying pathophysiology of an MI are crucial for the development of an appropriate management plan. 1, 5

STEMI is usually characterized by severe and/or total coronary flow obstruction with transmural ischemia, which predisposes to myocardial necrosis and pump dysfunction. 6 The pathogenesis of NSTEMI differs from that of STEMI in that it usually results from a flow‐limiting coronary stenosis with resultant downstream myocardial ischemia. 1, 3, 4 Total coronary artery occlusion is present in approximately one‐quarter of patients with NSTEMI. 4 STEMI and NSTEMI require different approaches to their acute and long‐term management. 1, 2, 3 In this article, we focus on the epidemiology, prognosis, and management of NSTEMI according to its underlying pathophysiology.

Non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) — evidence on the immediacy of nonaspirin antiplatelet administration is limited because few studies isolate a single agent and most included aspirin and heparin; although 3 Class I studies 99–101 were included, a recommendation higher than level C was not made because none directly addressed immediacy, and as for the 2 Class II studies,102,103 neither showed a benefit from early intervention. Drug selection and route often hinges on the need for urgent cardiac catheterization and the potential for emergency cardiac bypass; it is not always apparent whether a diagnosed NSTEMI patient will proceed to catheterization, and the decision about selection and timing should be made in collaboration with local cardiovascular specialists. Future research focusing on nonaspirin antiplatelet agents in highest-risk NSTEMI — patients with ongoing chest pain, significant ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, or candidates for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — may help identify a subset in whom immediate administration in the emergency department (ED) improves patient-important outcomes. Disclosure notes state there were no relevant industry relationships disclosed by the subcommittee members for this topic.

On trend analysis of baseline characteristics, we report an increase in the proportion of patients in the 40 to 64 years of age group. This is in concordance with the analysis of Get With The Guidelines Coronary Artery Disease Registry from 2003 to 2008, with that age group representing the fastest‐growing segment of our population over the years.

Importantly, there was a temporal increase in utilization of the EIS in the NSTEMI patient population. Meta‐analysis of randomized, control trials has consistently shown a benefit of EIS in the setting of NSTEMI, especially in the high‐risk patient population. – Definition of optimal timing of invasive management has undergone a paradigm shift in the last decade. The 2002 ACC/AHA guidelines for management of NSTEMIand the 2007 ACC/AHA guidelinesfor management of NSTEMI in the elderly patient population defined the EIS as routine cardiac catheterization within 48 hours of presentation. The more recent TIMACS trialcompared the routine early intervention (≤ 24 hours of presentation; median time, 14 hours) to delayed intervention (≥ 36 hours after presentation; median time, 50 hours). There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint, other than in the prespecified subgroup with high Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events scores. After 6 months, they reported a 28% relative reduction in secondary outcome of death, MI, and refractory ischemia in the early intervention group (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.89; P = 0.003).

3.4 Management of type 1 and type 2 NSTEMI

All NSTEMI events should be diagnosed and managed in accordance with current treatment guidelines, with the aim of providing immediate relief of ischemia and preventing recurrent MI and/or death during the early hospitalization period, followed by long‐term prevention of secondary ischemic events. 1, 3 After initial examination, stabilization, and risk assessment, an ischemia‐guided medical management strategy or an early invasive (angiography within 24 hours) strategy should be selected on the basis of individual patients' characteristics and risk level (Figure 2). 1, 3

1.2 Guideline recommendations for invasive and antiplatelet treatment of patients with NSTEMI

The standard of care for patients with NSTEMI at high ischemic risk is an early invasive strategy with cardiac catheterization within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms, with prompt revascularization using PCI or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery as clinically indicated. 13, 14, 15 Major international guidelines also recommend initiation of at least 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y 12 inhibitor (ticagrelor, prasugrel, or clopidogrel) in patients with NSTEMI who are managed with medical therapy and/or who are treated with revascularization (ie, irrespective of initial treatment strategy), unless there are previous or ongoing contraindications. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Ticagrelor is recommended over clopidogrel for patients with NSTEMI, including those pretreated with clopidogrel (which should be discontinued when ticagrelor is started). Ticagrelor is contraindicated in patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage or ongoing bleeds. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Prasugrel is recommended for patients with NSTEMI who have received angiography and are undergoing PCI. However, prasugrel is not recommended for patients in whom coronary anatomy is unknown and an indication for PCI is not clearly established; patients who are 75 years of age or older; or patients with a body weight of less than 60 kg. Prasugrel is contraindicated in patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, or ongoing bleeds. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Clopidogrel is a less potent P2Y 12 inhibitor than ticagrelor and prasugrel; it is recommended for patients who cannot receive ticagrelor or prasugrel, or who require oral anticoagulation. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18

Clinical risk scores, such as the DAPT score, can help guide decisions around whether to continue antiplatelet therapy beyond 1 year, by providing a risk‐benefit ratio based on age, smoking status, comorbidity, and medical history. 19 For patients with NSTEMI who are elderly and have a high comorbidity burden, conservative treatment could be a reasonable approach. 16, 19

### Practical implementation of the guidelines for unstable angina / non-ST-Segment elevation myocardial infarction in the emergency department [^117KypqM]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

In the United States each year, > 5.3 million patients present to emergency departments with chest discomfort and related symptoms. Ultimately, > 1.4 million individuals are hospitalized for unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. For emergency physicians and cardiologists alike, these patients represent an enormous challenge to accurately diagnose and appropriately treat. This update of the 2002 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Unstable Angina and Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (UA/NSTEMI) provides an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and treatment of these patients in the emergency department, in-hospital, and after hospital discharge. Despite publication of the guidelines several years ago, many patients with UA/NSTEMI still do not receive guidelines-indicated therapy.

### Immediate and early percutaneous coronary intervention in very high-risk and high-risk non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction patients [^1137QTgv]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is the acute form of ischemic heart disease, which is the leading cause of death globally. This definition of ACS ranges from ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) to non‐STEMI (NSTEMI) and unstable angina (UA). Immediate primary percutaneous intervention (PCI) is the gold standard for the treatment of STEMI. By contrast, routine use of coronary angiography, and its timing, in NSTEMI patients is still debatable. Several meta‐analyses support the role of a routine early (< 24 h) PCI in reducing the risk of composite ischemic outcomes, particularly in high‐risk patients. Moreover, randomized controlled trials have shown that very high‐risk and high‐risk NSTEMI patients may benefit from an early invasive strategy. Accordingly, the last two European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines (2015, 2020) for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST‐segment elevation (NSTEMI) recommend an immediate and early routine PCI in very high‐risk and high‐risk NSTEMI patients, respectively. We aim to examine adherence to these recommendations in a nationwide survey.

### Unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: part II. coronary revascularization, hospital discharge, and post-hospital care [^111bH9gS]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

In the guideline developed by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, the management of suspected unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) has four components: initial evaluation and management; hospital care; coronary revascularization; and hospital discharge and post-hospital care. Part II of this two-part article discusses coronary revascularization, hospital discharge, and post-hospital care. Decisions must be made about the use of coronary angiography and coronary revascularization in patients hospitalized with UA/NSTEMI. With an early conservative strategy, medical management is employed. Coronary angiography and revascularization are reserved for use in patients with evidence of ischemia at rest (or with minimal activity) and patients with a strongly positive stress test. With an early invasive strategy, coronary angiography and revascularization are recommended within 48 hours in patients without contraindications. Hospital discharge planning involves coordination of medical care, preparation of the patient for resumption of normal activities, and evaluation of the need for long-term risk factor reduction. Discharge medications should be continued to control ongoing symptoms (anti-ischemic agents) and prevent recurrent events (aspirin, clopidogrel, beta blocker, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or statins in selected patients).

The policy question asked whether adult patients with acute NSTEMI should receive immediate antiplatelet therapy in addition to aspirin to reduce 30-day MACE, and the document notes that beyond aspirin the emergency physician does not need to make an immediate decision on these agents and can defer to local cardiologists, which may help avoid delays in transitions of care and increased costs and potential adverse effects from excessive ED use.

3.4.1 Initial assessment

Risk categorization tools such as the Global Registry of Acute Cardiac Events (GRACE) risk score and the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score can be utilized to assess both the acute and long‐term likelihood of a further ischemic event following an NSTEMI. 35, 36 Ischemic risk scores have been found to be superior to clinical assessment alone for this purpose. 3 The results of these risk assessments can thus be useful in patient management. 1 Assessment of acute risk guides initial evaluation and selection of care facility, such as a coronary care unit, and the choice of appropriate pharmacotherapy, and guides decision‐making regarding invasive revascularization procedures. 3

The TIMI and GRACE risk scores do not differentiate between type 1 and type 2 MI; however, patients with type 2 MI could be expected to have higher risk scores based on characteristics included in these risk scores such as older age, comorbidities, and prior history of MI. 35, 36 An analysis comparing the characteristics of patients with type 1 and type 2 MI found that those with type 2 MI had a significantly higher mean GRACE score. 34

Conclusions

In this large, nationwide analysis of patients with MI, we report an increase in proportion of NSTEMI with increasing utilization of EIS in the United States. We also report a decrease in in‐hospital mortality and decrease in length of stay during the study period. The improved outcomes may reflect greater adherence to the evolving guideline‐recommended therapies. Nevertheless, age‐, sex‐, and race/ethnicity‐specific differences in the management and outcomes of NSTEMI were observed, and further studies are needed to develop strategies to ensure more equitable care for NSTEMI.

### Non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction: when is rapid revascularization critical? [^115B8ADs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains a devastating event in patients with cardiovascular disease worldwide. Among patients suffering an AMI, non–ST‐segment–elevation MI (NSTEMI) is approximately twice as common as ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The efficacy of immediate reperfusion in the setting of STEMI is well established, consistent with the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic plaque rupture/erosion and thrombosis. In patients with NSTEMI, the efficacy of an invasive strategy with revascularization in appropriate patients is also well established. However, in contrast to STEMI, the optimal timing of invasive coronary angiography and revascularization in NSTEMI is controversial, with some evidence that high‐risk patients benefit from an early invasive strategy. Thus, current guidelines recommend an early invasive strategy within 24 hours of hospital admission in patients with NSTEMI and a high‐risk profile, in particular a GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) risk score > 140. However, the recent 2020 European Society of Cardiology guidelines acknowledge that there is a gap in evidence of NSTEMI care concerning the optimal timing of angiography and revascularization and further research is needed.

The original VERDICT (Very Early Versus Deferred Invasive Evaluation Using Computerized Tomography) trial, which was a multicenter, open‐label, parallel‐group, randomized controlled trial, evaluated the optimal timing of invasive coronary angiography in patients with non–ST‐segment–elevation acute coronary syndromes (n = 2147). The majority, but not all, of the patients in VERDICT would qualify as having an NSTEMI. The principal finding was a very early strategy (< 12 hours), as compared with standard invasive strategy (48–72 hours), did not reduce the risk of the composite end point of all‐cause mortality, nonfatal AMI, or hospital admission for refractory myocardial ischemia or heart failure, except for those with a GRACE risk score > 140. In the present study in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Butt et al sought to perform a predefined subgroup analysis of the VERDICT trial to determine the efficacy of early invasive therapy compared with a standard care and its impact on all‐cause mortality according to the GRACE risk score overall and according to its components.

### Treatment of patients with unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction [^112P14SA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Emergency department (ED) management of patients who present with suspected unstable angina (UA) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is especially challenging. Therapies that demonstrate benefit in patients who experience proven disease may not be indicated in patients who present with suspected disease. The emergency practitioner must have a clear understanding of the benefit and harm of each therapy, allowing formulation of a simple approach to treatment selection based on disease presentation. This article reviews current literature and discusses the treatment recommendations from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) for patients who experience UA and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

### Early invasive versus conservative strategies for unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in the stent era [^116JKvyB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) two strategies are possible, either a routine invasive strategy where all patients undergo coronary angiography shortly after admission and, if indicated, coronary revascularization; or a conservative strategy where medical therapy alone is used initially, with selection of patients for angiography based on clinical symptoms or investigational evidence of persistent myocardial ischemia.

Objectives

To determine the benefits of an invasive compared to conservative strategy for treating UA/NSTEMI in the stent era.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched (1996 to February 2008) with no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Included studies were prospective trials comparing invasive with conservative strategies in UA/NSTEMI.

Data Collection and Analysis

We identified five studies (7818 participants). Using intention-to-treat analysis with random-effects models, summary estimates of relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were determined for primary end-points of all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, all-cause death or non-fatal myocardial infarction, and refractory angina. Further analysis of included studies was undertaken based on whether glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists were used routinely. Heterogeneity was assessed using Chi(2) and variance (I(2) statistic) methods.

Main Results

In the all-study analysis, mortality during initial hospitalization showed a trend to hazard with an invasive strategy (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.64). The invasive strategy did not reduce death on longer-term follow up. Myocardial infarction rates assessed at 6 to 12 months (5 trials) and 3 to 5 years (3 trials) were significantly decreased by an invasive strategy (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.86; and RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.92 respectively). The incidence of early (< 4 month) and intermediate (6 to 12 month) refractory angina were both significantly decreased by an invasive strategy (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.68; and RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.83 respectively), as were early and intermediate rehospitalization rates (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41to 0.88; and RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.74 respectively). The invasive strategy was associated with a two-fold increase in the RR of peri-procedural myocardial infarction (as variably defined) and a 1.7-fold increase in the RR of (minor) bleeding with no hazard of stroke.

Authors' Conclusions

Compared to a conservative strategy for UA/NSTEMI, an invasive strategy is associated with reduced rates of refractory angina and rehospitalization in the shorter term and myocardial infarction in the longer term. However, the invasive strategy is associated with a doubled risk of procedure-related heart attack and increased risk of bleeding and procedural biomarker leaks. Available data suggest that an invasive strategy may be particularly useful in those at high risk for recurrent events.

### Relation of age and health-related quality of life to invasive versus ischemia-guided management of patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction [^112Va7xk]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

In older patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, an initial invasive strategy reduces cardiovascular events compared with an ischemia-guided approach; however its association with health status outcomes is unknown. Among patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction from 2 multicenter US acute myocardial infarction (AMI) registries, health status was assessed at baseline and at 1, 6, and 12 months after AMI using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) and the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). Routine invasive management was defined as coronary angiography within 72 hours of admission without a preceding stress test. Among 3,559 patients with NSTEMI, 2,455 (69.0%) were treated with routine invasive treatment, which was more common in younger patients. In propensity-adjusted analyses, invasive treatment was associated with higher SAQ physical limitation, angina frequency, and summary scores over the year after AMI; however, the differences were small (< 5 points, all p < 0.05). Although there was a trend toward worse health status in patients aged ≥ 85 years treated with an initial invasive treatment, the interaction between age and treatment for any health status measure (all p ≥ 0.09) was not significant, except for SF-12 physical component score (p = 0.02), where worse scores were observed with invasive treatment in patients 85 years or older. In conclusion, an initial invasive treatment for patients with NSTEMI is associated with a small benefit in health status of marginal clinical significance, mainly in younger patients. The oldest old group trended toward less health status benefit from a routine invasive strategy-results that will need to be confirmed in a larger study.

### Routine vs selective invasive strategies in patients with acute coronary syndromes: a collaborative meta-analysis of randomized trials [^1136JgV2]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Patients with unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) can be cared for with a routine invasive strategy involving coronary angiography and revascularization or more conservatively with a selective invasive strategy in which only those with recurrent or inducible ischemia are referred for acute intervention.

Objective

To conduct a meta-analysis that compares benefits and risks of routine invasive vs selective invasive strategies.

Data Sources

Randomized controlled trials identified through search of MEDLINE and the Cochrane databases (1970 through June 2004) and hand searching of cross-references from original articles and reviews.

Study Selection

Trials were included that involved patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI who received a routine invasive or a selective invasive strategy.

Data Extraction

Major outcomes of death and myocardial infarction (MI) occurring from initial hospitalization to the end of follow-up were extracted from published results of eligible trials.

Data Synthesis

A total of 7 trials (N = 9212 patients) were eligible. Overall, death or MI was reduced from 663 (14.4%) of 4604 patients in the selective invasive group to 561 (12.2%) of 4608 patients in the routine invasive group (odds ratio [OR], 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–0.93; P = 0.001). There was a nonsignificant trend toward fewer deaths (6.0% vs 5.5%; OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.77–1.09; P = 0.33) and a significant reduction in MI alone (9.4% vs 7.3%; OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65–0.88; P < .001). Higher-risk patients with elevated cardiac biomarker levels at baseline benefited more from routine intervention, with no significant benefit observed in lower-risk patients with negative baseline marker levels. During the initial hospitalization, a routine invasive strategy was associated with a significantly higher early mortality (1.1% vs 1.8% for selective vs routine, respectively; OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.14–2.25; P = 0.007) and the composite of death or MI (3.8% vs 5.2%; OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.12–1.66; P = 0.002). But after discharge, the routine invasive strategy was associated with fewer subsequent deaths (4.9% vs 3.8%; OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62–0.94; P = 0.01) and the composite of death or MI (11.0% vs 7.4%; OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.56–0.75; P < .001). At the end of follow-up, there was a 33% reduction in severe angina (14.0% vs 11.2%; OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68–0.87; P < .001) and a 34% reduction in rehospitalization (41.3% vs 32.5%; OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.60–0.72; P < .001) with a routine invasive strategy.

Conclusions

A routine invasive strategy exceeded a selective invasive strategy in reducing MI, severe angina, and rehospitalization over a mean follow-up of 17 months. But routine intervention was associated with a higher early mortality hazard and a trend toward a mortality reduction at follow-up. Future strategies should explore ways to minimize the early hazard and enhance later benefits by focusing on higher-risk patients and optimizing timing of intervention and use of proven therapies.

### Early invasive versus conservative strategies for unstable angina&non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the stent era [^112sTKHN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with unstable angina and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) two strategies are possible: a routine invasive strategy where all patients undergo coronary angiography shortly after admission and, if indicated, coronary revascularization; or a conservative strategy where medical therapy alone is used initially with selection of patients for angiography based on clinical symptoms or investigational evidence of persistent myocardial ischemia.

Objectives

To determine the benefits of an invasive compared to a conservative strategy for treating UA/NSTEMI in the stent era.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 3 2005), MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 1996 to September 2005 with no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Included studies were prospective trials comparing invasive with conservative strategies in UA/NSTEMI.

Data Collection and Analysis

We identified 5 studies (7818 participants). Using intention-to-treat analysis with random effects models, summary estimates of relative risk (95% confidence interval [CI]) were determined for primary end-points of all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction; all-cause death or non-fatal myocardial infarction; and refractory angina. Further analysis of included studies was undertaken based on whether glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists were used routinely. Heterogeneity was assessed using chi-square and variance (I(2)) methods.

Main Results

In the all-study analysis, mortality during initial hospitalization showed a trend to hazard with an invasive strategy; relative risk 1.59 (95% CI 0.96 to 2.64). Mortality and myocardial infarction assessed at 2–5 years in two trials were significantly decreased by an invasive strategy with relative risk of 0.75 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.92) and 0.75 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.91) respectively. The composite end-point of death or non-fatal myocardial infarction was significantly decreased by an invasive strategy at several time points after initial hospitalization. The incidence of early (< 4 months) and intermediate (6–12 months) refractory angina were both significantly decreased by an invasive strategy; relative risk 0.47 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.68) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.83) respectively, as were early and intermediate rehospitalization rates with relative risk 0.60 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.88) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.74) respectively. The invasive strategy was associated with a two-fold increase in the relative risk of peri-procedural myocardial infarction (as variably defined) and a 1.7-fold increase in the relative risk of bleeding.

Authors' Conclusions

An early invasive strategy is preferable to a conservative strategy in the treatment of UA/NSTEMI.

Emergency department non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS) after exclusion of acute myocardial infarction (MI) — testing and disposition: Level B recommendations state, "Do not routinely use further diagnostic testing (coronary CT angiography, stress testing, myocardial perfusion imaging) prior to discharge in low-risk patients in whom acute MI has been ruled out to reduce 30-day MACE". Level C recommendations state, "Arrange follow-up in 1 to 2 weeks for low-risk patients in whom MI has been ruled out. If no follow-up is available, consider further testing or observation prior to discharge (Consensus recommendation)". Level A recommendations are "None specified". Context includes 2014 AHA/ACC guidance that "It is reasonable for patients with possible ACS who have normal serial ECGs and cardiac troponins to have a treadmill ECG… or stress echocardiography before discharge or within 72 hours after discharge", and a randomized trial in which "all patients underwent 6-hour serial cardiac troponin T ruleout testing", showing 30-day major adverse cardiac events of "0.4%" with stress myocardial perfusion imaging versus "0.8%" with standard management (relative risk "0.50; 95% CI 0.13 to 2.00") and that imaging "did not significantly reduce 30-day MACE".

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) definition and classification — ACS are typically caused by the disruption (rupture or erosion) of an unstable coronary artery atherosclerotic plaque with associated partial or complete coronary artery thrombosis and/or microemboli, resulting in diminished blood flow to the myocardium and subsequent myocardial ischemia. ACS includes 3 related clinical conditions that exist along a continuum of severity: (1) unstable angina, (2) non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and (3) STEMI. The initial diagnosis and classification of ACS should be based on the clinical history and symptomatology, interpretation of the ECG, and assessment of cardiac troponin (cTn). Unstable angina is defined by transient myocardial ischemia leading to diminished flow in the absence of significant myonecrosis detected by circulating troponin, whereas more prolonged or severe myocardial ischemia is diagnosed as MI with elevated biomarkers of myonecrosis. Patients with NSTEMI may have a partially occluded coronary artery leading to subendocardial ischemia, while those with STEMI typically have a completely occluded vessel leading to transmural myocardial ischemia and infarction. ACS can be dynamic, with rapid progression between unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI during presentation and initial evaluation and treatment. Other, less common causes of myocardial ischemia include coronary artery spasm, embolism, and dissection. This guideline will focus on the acute management of ACS, including unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI, presumed to result from atherosclerotic plaque rupture or plaque erosion and subsequent thrombosis, which under the Universal Definition would be classified as type 1 MI events.

3.4.5 Managing type 1 vs type 2 NSTEMI

Type 2 NSTEMI is often classified under a general NSTEMI diagnosis or misclassified as type 1, despite its presentation and underlying pathophysiology being different from those of type 1 NSTEMI. 26 It is essential that NSTEMI be classified as type 1 or type 2, based on clinical presentation, Cardiac troponin, ECG, and imaging findings, so that it can be managed appropriately. 5 Type 2 MI has heterogeneous underlying causes, often atypical features, a lack of a clear precipitating cause of the oxygen supply‐demand imbalance in some patients (eg, absence of discernible CAD), and does not usually involve atherothrombotic plaque disruption. 5 As a result, current NSTEMI guidelines may be challenging — or in some cases inappropriate — to apply in patients who are experiencing a type 2 NSTEMI, and no formal guidelines for type 2 NSTEMI are available. 21 Studies have found that compared with patients with type 1 NSTEMI, patients with type 2 NSTEMI were less likely to undergo catheterization and revascularization procedures or receive recommended secondary prevention medications at discharge, and they had higher mortality rates. 20, 26 There is therefore a need for evidence‐based diagnosis and management guidelines for NSTEMI that acknowledge the complexities of type 2 MI. 16, 20, 21, 22, 28 Consequently, a phenotype‐based approach to type 2 MI diagnosis and management across different clinical settings has been proposed (Figure 3). 50 This approach considers both the context and multiple possible underlying mechanisms of type 2 MI and recommends treatment of the cause of the oxygen supply‐demand imbalance for each patient. 50

Conclusion

The opportunity to intervene in patients with prior CABG presenting with NSTEMI is often low. Initial medical management may be a reasonable option in carefully selected patients particularly in the absence of ongoing symptoms, ECG changes or very high GRACE scores. Further studies are required to evaluate the safety of initial non-invasive strategies in managing this population.

### Very early invasive strategy in higher risk non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome: the RAPID NSTEMI trial [^113YGKqa]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The optimal timing of an invasive strategy (IS) in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) remains uncertain. When randomised data are evaluated in totality, no difference in hard clinical outcomes between an early IS (defined as < 24 hours) and delayed IS in NSTE-ACS all-comers has been demonstrated. However, uncertainty persists regarding those at highest baseline risk for future events. Subgroup analyses of patients from the Timing of Intervention in Acute Coronary Syndromes (TIMACS) and Very Early Versus Deferred Invasive Evaluation Using Computerised Tomography (VERDICT) trials with a Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score of > 140 suggest a reduction in composite ischaemic outcomes following an early IS.

The proposed benefits of an early IS are that rapid identification and stabilisation of plaque rupture with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) will mitigate the risk of acute vessel occlusion, recurrent ischaemic events and extension of myocardial infarction (MI). Given the uncertainty regarding optimal timing of IS in higher risk NSTE-ACS, we designed the RAPID NSTEMI trial, a multicentre randomised controlled trial to determine if a very early IS was superior to standard care timing IS.

### Non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction: when is rapid revascularization critical? [^111KpyMC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

More recently, there have been clinical trials considering a very early approach for higher risk patients. For example, the RIDDLE‐NSTEMI (Randomized Study of Immediate Versus Delayed Invasive Intervention in Patients With Non–ST‐Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction)trial showed a decrease in the composite of death plus MI at 30 days and 1 year in patients treated with immediate (≤ 2 [median 1.4] hours) rather than delayed (≤ 72 [median 61] hours) intervention. Alternatively, the LIPSIA‐NSTEMI (Leipzig Immediate Versus Early and Late Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Trial in NSTEMI) trial found no benefit to immediate revascularization (< 2 hours versus 10–48 hours) but was underpowered for cardiovascular events. In the Early or Delayed Revascularization for Intermediate and High‐Risk Non ST‐Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome trial, 709 patients were randomized to a very early (< 2 hours) or delayed (12–72 hours) invasive strategy. The primary outcome at 30 days of cardiovascular death or recurrent ischemia was 4.4% with the early and 21.3% with the delayed strategy (P < 0.001), mostly because of recurrent ischemia. However, the incidence of cardiovascular death was 0.6% and 1.1% (P = 0.69) and of MI 1.2% and 0.8% (P = 0.72) with the early and delayed strategies, respectively.

Guideline scope — population and exclusions specify that this guideline is intended for adult patients (> 18 years) presenting to the ED with undifferentiated chest pain or other complaints or conditions that are suspicious for NSTE ACS, and that MI (ie, ST-elevation ACS) diagnosed on arrival to the ED is excluded; atypical presentations such as only dyspnea or altered mental status are generally excluded from this scope.

Conclusion

In this community‐based surveillance of black and white patients hospitalized with NSTEMI from 2000 to 2014, black patients were younger, had more medical comorbidities, and were less likely to undergo revascularization or be discharged on evidence‐based medications. Despite measures to standardize NSTEMI care, differences have persisted between black and white patients during this time interval. Overall reduction in comorbidity burden and consistent implementation of guideline‐directed strategies are crucial to mitigate racial disparities in NSTEMI management.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) — definition and classification — are described as typically caused by the disruption (rupture or erosion) of an unstable coronary artery atherosclerotic plaque with associated partial or complete thrombosis and/or microembolism resulting in myocardial ischemia. ACS includes 3 related clinical conditions that exist along a continuum of severity: unstable angina, non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The initial diagnosis and classification of ACS should be based on the clinical history and symptomatology, interpretation of the ECG, and assessment of cardiac troponin (cTn). Unstable angina is defined by transient myocardial ischemia leading to diminished flow in the absence of significant myonecrosis detected by circulating troponin, whereas patients with NSTEMI may have a partially occluded coronary artery leading to subendocardial ischemia and those with STEMI typically have a completely occluded vessel leading to transmural myocardial ischemia and infarction. The pathophysiology of ACS can be dynamic and patients can rapidly progress from one clinical condition to another during the course of their presentation and initial evaluation and treatment. This guideline will focus on the acute management of ACS presumed to result from atherosclerotic plaque rupture or plaque erosion and subsequent thrombosis, and under the Universal Definition of myocardial infarction these will be classified as type 1 MI events, while diagnostic evaluation of chest pain and the management of type 2 MI, spontaneous coronary artery dissection, and MINOCA are covered in separate documents.

1.3 Invasive strategy and P2Y 12 inhibitor treatment evidence for NSTEMI

An early invasive strategy of cardiac catheterization has a central role in the management of patients with NSTEMI because it facilitates: confirmation of the diagnosis of ACS related to obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease; identification of the culprit lesion(s); the establishment of the indication for revascularization using PCI or CABG; the stratification of the patient's short‐ and long‐term ischemic risk. 15 Compared with a more conservative strategy, an early invasive strategy has been shown to improve clinical outcomes and reduce recurrent ACS episodes, subsequent rehospitalization, and revascularization. 15 A meta‐analysis of seven randomized clinical trials including 8375 patients with NSTEMI showed that, vs. a conservative strategy, an early invasive strategy was associated with lower incidences of 2‐year all‐cause mortality (4.9% vs. 6.5%; risk ratio [RR]: 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63‐0.90; P = 0.001), 2‐year nonfatal MI (7.6% vs. 9.1%; RR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.72‐0.96; P = 0.012), and 13‐month rehospitalization for recurrent ACS (19.9% vs. 28.7%; RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.65‐0.74; P = 0.0001). 20 A separate meta‐analysis of individual patient data from 5467 patients across three randomized controlled trials with a 5‐year follow‐up period showed that, vs. a selective invasive strategy, a routine invasive strategy was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular death or nonfatal MI (14.7% vs. 17.9%; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.71‐0.93; P = 0.002) and lower risk of MI (10.0% vs. 12.9%; HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.65‐0.90; P = 0.001). 21 There was an absolute risk reduction of 2.0%, 3.8%, and 11.1% in low‐, intermediate‐, and high‐risk patients receiving a routine invasive strategy, respectively. 21 Registry data from six Arabian Gulf countries showed that patients with NSTEMI managed with PCI and CABG had better outcomes than those treated conservatively. 22

### Decade-long trends in the magnitude, treatment, and outcomes of patients aged 30 to 54 years hospitalized with ST-segment elevation and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^117HVHb6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Although acute myocardial infarction (AMI) occurs primarily in the elderly, this disease also affects young adults. Few studies have, however, presented data on relatively young patients hospitalized with AMI. The objectives of this population-based study were to examine recent trends in the magnitude, clinical characteristics, management, and in-hospital and long-term outcomes associated with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in patients aged 30 to 54 years. We reviewed the medical records of 955 residents of the Worcester (Massachusetts) metropolitan area aged 30 to 54 years who were hospitalized for an initial STEMI or NSTEMI in 6 biennial periods from 1999 to 2009 at 11 greater Worcester medical centers. From 1999 to 2009, the proportion of young adults hospitalized with an STEMI decreased from approximately 2/3 to 2/5 of all patients with an initial AMI. Patients with STEMI were less likely to have a history of heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and kidney disease than those with NSTEMI. Both groups received similar effective medical therapies during their acute hospitalization. In-hospital clinical complications and mortality were low and no significant differences in these end points were observed between patients with STEMI and NSTEMI or with regard to 1-year postdischarge death rates (1.9% vs 2.8%). The present results demonstrate recent decreases in the proportion of relatively young patients diagnosed with an initial STEMI. Patients with STEMI and NSTEMI had similar in-hospital outcomes and long-term survival. Trends in these and other important outcomes warrant continued monitoring.

### Guideline-indicated treatments and diagnostics, GRACE risk score, and survival for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction [^114MzwMx]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective observational cohort study of 389 057 patients with NSTEMI using data for all acute hospitals in a single health care system, optimal use of guideline-indicated care for NSTEMI was associated with greater survival gains with increasing GRACE risk, but its use decreased with increasing GRACE risk. Of note, is that the mortality benefit associated with optimal care found in high-risk NSTEMI persisted for over eight years from the time of discharge from hospital. Whilst there was a preponderance of low-risk NSTEMI patients who had high rates of survival, these patients proportionally received more evidence-based care compared with intermediate and high-risk NSTEMI. Moreover, a pattern of early death was evident across the NSTEMI risk spectrum, which was accentuated for those with the highest GRACE risk scores. Taken together, these findings suggest that providing all eligible care opportunities to NSTEMI patients has the potential to improve survival, and that those at highest risk will derive greater and more sustained benefit.

Non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) — routine invasive or selective invasive initial approach is summarized as follows: In patients with NSTE-ACS who are at intermediate or high risk of ischemic events and are appropriate candidates for revascularization, an invasive approach with the intent to proceed with revascularization is recommended during hospitalization to reduce MACE. In patients with NSTE-ACS who are at low risk of ischemic events, either a routine invasive or selective invasive approach is recommended to help identify those who may require revascularization and to reduce MACE. In patients with NSTE-ACS who have refractory angina or hemodynamic or electrical instability, an immediate invasive strategy with intent to perform revascularization is indicated to reduce MACE. In patients with NSTE-ACS who are at high risk of ischemic events, it is reasonable to choose an early invasive strategy (within 24 hours) to reduce MACE. In patients with NSTE-ACS who are not at high risk and are intended for an invasive strategy, it is reasonable to perform angiography before hospital discharge to reduce MACE.

The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association last published evidence-based guidelines for the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in 1999. In mid-2004, in recognition of the evolution and improvement of many of the most basic tenets of clinical management of STEMI since that time, an updated edition of the STEMI guidelines has been published. These guidelines offer many evidence-based recommendations that are pertinent to the out-of-hospital and emergency department care of STEMI patients, including initial evaluation, risk stratification, stabilizing management, and the choice between pharmacologic and mechanical revascularization. These are presented and discussed here.

### Optimal timing of coronary invasive strategy in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Qgsrd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal timing of coronary intervention in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACSs) is a matter of debate. Conflicting results among published studies partly relate to different risk profiles of the studied populations.

Purpose

To do the most comprehensive meta-analysis of current evidence on early versus delayed invasive treatment in NSTE-ACS.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar databases; conference proceedings; ClinicalTrials.gov registry; and Current Controlled Trials registry through May 2012.

Study Selection

Available randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing early versus delayed intervention in the NSTE-ACS population.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted for populations, interventions, outcomes, and risk of bias. All-cause mortality was the prespecified primary end point. The longest follow-up available in each study was chosen. The odds ratio with 95% CI was the effect measure.

Data Synthesis

Seven RCTs (5370 patients) and 4 observational studies (77 499 patients) were included. Early intervention was less than 20 hours after hospitalization or randomization for RCTs and 24 hours or less for observational studies. Meta-analysis of the RCTs was inconclusive for a survival benefit associated with the early invasive strategy (odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.64 to 1.09]; P = 0.180); a similar result emerged from the observational studies. With early versus late intervention, the odds ratios in the RCTs were 1.15 (CI, 0.65 to 2.01; P = 0.63) and 0.76 (CI, 0.56 to 1.04; P = 0.090) for myocardial infarction and major bleeding during follow-up, respectively.

Limitation

Current evidence from RCTs is limited by the small overall sample size, low numbers of events in some trials, and heterogeneity in the timing of intervention and in patient risk profiles.

Conclusion

At present, there is insufficient evidence either in favor of or against an early invasive approach in the NSTE-ACS population. A more definitive RCT is warranted to guide clinical practice.

### Guideline adherence after ST-segment elevation versus non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [^117JLTpY]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical guidelines recommend similar medical therapy for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI).

Methods and Results

Using the Get with the Guidelines-Coronary Artery Disease registry (GWTG-CAD), we analyzed data including 72 352 patients (48 966, NSTEMI; 23 386, STEMI) from 237 US sites between May 1, 2006 and March 21, 2010. Performance and quality measures were compared between NSTEMI and STEMI patients. NSTEMI patients were older and had a higher rate of medical comorbidities compared with STEMI patients, including prior coronary artery disease (38.5% versus 24.7%; P < 0.0001), heart failure (17.5% versus 6.2%; P < 0.0001), hypertension (70.8% versus 59.1%; P < 0.0001) and diabetes mellitus (34.9 versus 23.3%; P < 0.0001). Adjusting for confounding variables, STEMI patients were more likely to receive aspirin within 24 hours 98.5% versus 97.1% (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32–2.02), be discharged on aspirin 98.5% versus 97.3% (AOR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.19–1.49), β-blockers 98.2% versus 96.9% (AOR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.35–1.63), or lipid-lowering medication for low-density lipoprotein level > 100 mg/dL 96.8% versus 91.0% (AOR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.61–2.13). STEMI patients were also more likely to receive β-blockers within 24 hours of hospital arrival 93.9% versus 90.8% (AOR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.37–1.79) and the following discharge medications: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocking agents 85.3% versus 77.4% (AOR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.51–1.75), clopidogrel 85.6% versus 67.0% (AOR, 2.42; 95% CI, 2.23–2.61) or lipid-lowering medications 94.8% versus 88.0% (AOR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.56–1.86).

Conclusions

Among hospitals participating in GWTG-CAD, adherence with guideline-based medical therapy was high for patients with both STEMI and NSTEMI. Yet, there is still room for further improvement, particularly in the care of NSTEMI patients.

Conclusion

For nearly 400 000 NSTEMI hospital survivors in England and Wales, guideline-indicated treatment was less frequent among the high-risk NSTEMI, but when provided was significantly associated with improved survival which persisted over the longer-term. There was benefit seen in those at lower risk, though this was not significant over the whole study period. The provision of 'up to standard' guideline-indicated care for high-risk NSTEMI has the potential to improve their longer-term survival.

Acute coronary syndromes — revascularization strategy in multivessel disease highlights evidence gaps: in patients with non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), the role of multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus culprit-only PCI needs further supportive data, and whether multivessel PCI should be guided by angiography or physiology is still a matter of debate; it also clarifies that recommendations for PCI of nonculprit arteries in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are for patients who are not intended for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and that the optimal strategy for those with more complex anatomy is less clear.

NSTE-ACS initial invasive strategy and timing — For patients with non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) at intermediate or high risk of ischemic events who are appropriate candidates for revascularization, an invasive approach with the intent to proceed with revascularization is recommended during hospitalization to reduce MACE. In patients at low risk of ischemic events, either a routine invasive or selective invasive approach is recommended to help identify those who may require revascularization and to reduce MACE. For those with refractory angina or hemodynamic or electrical instability, an immediate invasive strategy with intent to perform revascularization is indicated to reduce MACE. In high-risk patients, it is reasonable to choose an early invasive strategy (within 24 hours) to reduce MACE. In patients who are not at high risk and are intended for an invasive strategy, it is reasonable to perform angiography before hospital discharge to reduce MACE.

### Early invasive versus non-invasive assessment in patients with suspected non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome [^112Gdjj3]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) comprises a broad spectrum of disease ranging from unstable angina to myocardial infarction. International guidelines recommend a routine invasive strategy for managing patients with NSTE-ACS at high to very high-risk, supported by evidence of improved composite ischaemic outcomes as compared with a selective invasive strategy. However, accurate diagnosis of NSTE-ACS in the acute setting is challenging due to the spectrum of non-coronary disease that can manifest with similar symptoms. Heterogeneous clinical presentations and limited uptake of risk prediction tools can confound physician decision-making regarding the use and timing of invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Large proportions of patients with suspected NSTE-ACS do not require revascularisation but may unnecessarily undergo ICA with its attendant risks and associated costs. Advances in coronary CT angiography and cardiac MRI have prompted evaluation of whether non-invasive strategies may improve patient selection, or whether tailored approaches are better suited to specific subgroups. Future directions include (1) better understanding of risk stratification as a guide to investigation and therapy in suspected NSTE-ACS, (2) randomised clinical trials of non-invasive imaging versus standard of care approaches prior to ICA and (3) defining the optimal timing of very early ICA in high-risk NSTE-ACS.

### Unstable angina and non-ST-Segment elevation myocardial infarction: – part I. initial evaluation and management, and hospital care… [^115UZmRb]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

The term "acute coronary syndrome" encompasses unstable angina and non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. UA/NSTEMI is the combination of two closely related clinical entities, whereas STEMI is a distinct clinical entity. 1 Approximately 1. 4 million of these patients are admitted for management of UA/NSTEMI. 1 Because of the scope of the problem, it is important for family physicians to understand the diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment of this syndrome. To help standardize the assessment and treatment of patients with UA/NSTEMI, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association convened a task force to produce a management guideline. The ACC/AHA guideline, which was published in 2000.

1 and updated in 2002, 2, 3 divides the management of suspected UA/NSTEMI into four components: initial evaluation and management; hospital care; coronary revascularization; and hospital discharge and post-hospital care. This two-part article focuses on the major management recommendations in the guideline, using the ACC/AHA classification of recommendations. 3 Recent advances in management are highlighted. Part I reviews the first two components of management, and part II 4 reviews the other two components. RISK PREDICTION RULE The 2002 ACC/AHA guideline 2, 3 includes the use of a risk prediction rule for early assessment. Multiple risk scores have been developed to predict the likelihood of adverse outcomes in patients presenting with UA/NSTEMI. 6–8 One example is the seven-point Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction risk score for UA/NSTEMI.
6.

Hospital Care Patients with UA/NSTEMI should be admitted to an inpatient unit, where they should undergo continuous monitoring for arrhythmias and recurrent ischemia. Patients with high-risk indicators, such as recurrent pain or hemodynamic disturbance, 3 should be admitted to a coronary care or intensive care unit capable of more extensive monitoring. Therapy should include anti-ischemic, antiplatelet, and antithrombotic agents, as well as a care plan that includes consideration of an early invasive strategy. 3.

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1157fqzC]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Non–ST-segment–elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) in adults ≥ 75 years — evidence synthesis indicates that a routine invasive strategy reduced reinfarction and urgent revascularization without significantly affecting all-cause mortality or the combined end point of death and MI at 1 year, and meta-analyses in patients ≥ 75 years found early invasive management reduced the composite of death or MI and reduced repeat revascularization and MI without increasing bleeding risk. Nonrandomized data suggested a survival benefit for patients > 80 years of age managed invasively. Given heterogeneity in older adults with NSTEMI, an early invasive strategy may be preferred in patients with recurrent angina, hemodynamic or electrical instability, elevated troponin, or high-risk anatomy, whereas a conservative approach may be appropriate in those with advanced frailty, cognitive impairment, or limited life expectancy, or when the likelihood of benefit is outweighed by procedural risk or patient preference.

### Clinical characteristics, management strategies, and outcomes of non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients with and without prior coronary artery bypass grafting [^112a2tD9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a commonly used revascularization strategy for the management of advanced coronary artery disease. Graft failure is not uncommon, with occlusive disease of saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) affecting approximately two‐thirds of patients within 10 years of surgery. Bypass grafting accentuates the development of atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and calcification in native coronary arteries. Consequently, occlusion of SVG and progression of native coronary artery disease are associated with the medium‐ and long‐term risk of recurrent ischemic events, including myocardial infarction (MI).

Current European and American guidelines provide a class 1 recommendation for an early invasive approach in high‐risk patients with non–ST segment elevation MI (NSTEMI) based on the results of 10 randomized trials, which compared invasive versus medical management. However, many of these key trials, did not include patients with prior CABG or only recruited small numbers of such patients. Previous evidence derived from observational data has revealed that an invasive strategy is less likely to be adopted in patients with NSTEMI with prior CABG, and when coronary angiography is undertaken, these patients are less likely to receive revascularization. Clinical outcome data in this cohort are inconsistent. For example, in a post hoc analysis of the ACUITY (Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy) trial, adjusted 30‐day and 1‐year risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) was higher in patients with prior CABG who underwent revascularization compared with those who were treated conservatively. In contrast, in a Swedish registry of 10 837 patients with prior CABG, 1‐year adjusted mortality was 50% lower in those who received revascularization compared with those who received medical management. No randomized controlled trial has exclusively examined the outcomes of this patient cohort in NSTEMI, although in a pilot trial of 60 patients, medically stabilized patients with NSTEMI with a prior history of CABG were randomly assigned to invasive or medical management. Similar clinical outcomes were reported in the 2 treatment strategies, although the sample size was inadequate to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of an invasive strategy. Therefore, the optimal management strategy in patients with prior CABG who present with NSTEMI is not clearly defined. Hence, this study aimed to (1) investigate management strategies and clinical outcomes of patients presenting with NSTEMI with a history of prior CABG in contemporary clinical practice and (b) analyze the association of an invasive approach to in‐hospital clinical outcomes using the data from the Myocardial Infarction National Audit Project (MINAP) in the United Kingdom.

The Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes with Early Implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines (CRUSADE) initiative is a prospective, rapid-cycle quality-improvement initiative that focuses on improving both the diagnostic evaluation of patients with non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE) acute coronary syndromes (ACS; defined as ischemic ST-segment changes and/or positive cardiac markers) and the use of treatments recommended by the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for management of NSTE ACS. The ultimate goal of the CRUSADE initiative is to improve the quality of care among high-risk patients with NSTE ACS. At the same time, the CRUSADE initiative provides the unique opportunity to evaluate the pattern of NSTE ACS management in a large-scale, routine practice setting in the United States. Cumulatively, the CRUSADE initiative has collected data from > 165,000 patients with NSTE ACS admitted at > 400 US hospitals since 2001. This article reviews the major results from the CRUSADE initiative on risk stratification, gaps in guidelines adherence, paradoxical care, and the association of guideline adherence with outcomes.

### What US cardiology can learn from the 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes [^112u5HJM]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Recognizing that acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) constitute a spectrum encompassing unstable angina, non‐ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the 2023 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the management of ACSs addressed all three. This differs from the prior US guidelines that individually addressed unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI. The 2023 ESCACS Guidelines thus encompass comprehensive patient management from admission to long‐term care, again including what in prior US guidelines would have been a secondary prevention guideline. In addition, the task force included a patient member who provided a patient perspective that is highlighted in the European publication.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: sorting through type 1 vs other types [^114CkEBa]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

4 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Type 1 and type 2 MI have different etiologies. Type 1 is characterized primarily by CAD with atherosclerotic plaque rupture or erosion that leads to formation of an occlusive or partially occlusive thrombus, whereas the key feature of a type 2 MI is an oxygen supply‐demand imbalance, which can occur with or without an atherosclerotic component. 5 Both type 1 and type 2 MI can present as NSTEMI or STEMI, although NSTEMI is more common for both types. 16, 17, 18 Most NSTEMI pathophysiologically are consistent with type 1 MI, but the relative proportions of type 1 NSTEMI and type 2 NSTEMI vary between clinical settings. 16, 18, 19, 20, 27, 29

Prognosis, in terms of short‐ and longer‐term mortality risks following NSTEMI, has improved in recent years, with fewer deaths after 30 days and more of the deaths that do occur being attributed to non‐CV causes. 11, 12, 13, 14 However, the risk of in‐hospital and post‐discharge mortality following NSTEMI is higher in patients with type 2 NSTEMI than in those with type 1 NSTEMI. 20, 26 This is not surprising and can be explained by the sicker and older age demographic of patients with type 2 NSTEMI compared with those with type 1 NSTEMI. 20, 33, 34

### Timing and completeness of revascularisation in acute coronary syndromes [^113PVei7]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Against this background, a routine invasive strategy is recommended in patients with an established diagnosis of NSTEACS with a timing based on individual risk stratification, as summarised in figure 2 and table 1. Whereas, a selective invasive strategy or non-invasive imaging to guide invasive coronary angiography should be limited to low-risk patients (ie, patients with low-to-intermediate likelihood of coronary artery disease, normal or inconclusive cardiac troponin and/or ECG) (figure 2).

Figure 2
Timing and revascularisation strategy in patients presenting with NSTEACS. *It is reasonable to consider a physiology-guided strategy to complete revascularisation in patients with NSTEACS with multivessel disease. NSTEACS, non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome; NSTEMI, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention.

Table 1
Risk stratification of patients presenting with NSTEACS

The recently published European Guidelines for the management of patients with NSTEACS have established a class I level A indication to undergo coronary angiography within 24 hours of hospital admission to high-risk patients presenting with NSTEACS. Despite the 24-hour benchmark might seem arbitrary (as different studies have included a different interval time to define early invasive strategy), when assessing the relationship between median difference in time to angiography and clinical outcomes, a significant association in post hoc metaregression with regard to non-fatal myocardial infarction was found in the individual patient data meta-analysis performed by Jobs et al. This might imply that an early-as-possible rather than a < 24-hour approach could represent the best strategy, easing the pressure on the infrastructure. However, baseline risk assessment remains the key, as benefit with an early invasive strategy is strongly associated with patient′s risk profile.

### Guideline-indicated treatments and diagnostics, GRACE risk score, and survival for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction [^115PbAyj]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate how long the impact of the pathway of guideline-indicated care according to baseline ischaemic risk among eligible patients with NSTEMI persists. Previous work has demonstrated that guideline-directed therapy results in improved outcomes at 30 days and 3 years, yet is limited because it focuses on the performance of finite quality indicators or interventions rather than cumulative care. This is important because the treatment of NSTEMI follows a journey of care and defined by evidence from randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Whilst earlier studies have demonstrated excess mortality associated with the non-receipt of guideline indicated interventions along the pathway of care, the potential persistence of effect sizes was not studied.

Low-risk NSTEMI who received all eligible care interventions did not have a significant survival advantage compared with their counterparts who received some or none of the eligible care interventions. Whilst this seems counterintuitive, especially when randomized data have demonstrated clinical benefit from evidence — based treatments for NSTEMI, there are a number of possible explanations. First, the low GRACE risk score comparator group had high rates of receipt of many care interventions; therefore, although care was not optimal for 54 566 patients in this group, it was still high overall (median receipt of care 83.3%), and indeed, those with a low GRACE risk score comprised the greatest proportion of patients with the highest receipt of care. Second, the low rates of death in the low GRACE risk score group created a 'floor effect' whereby the discrimination of differences between optimal and suboptimal care was not possible.

### Three-year impact of immediate invasive strategy in patients with non-ST-Segment elevation myocardial infarction (from the RIDDLE-NSTEMI study) [^117W7B4X]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Previous studies compared clinical outcomes of early versus delayed invasive strategy in patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome up to 1-year follow-up, but long-term data remain scarce. Our aim was to evaluate the long-term effects of immediate invasive intervention in patients with Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI). The Randomized Study of Immediate Versus Delayed Invasive Intervention in Patients With Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (RIDDLE-NSTEMI) was a randomized, investigator-initiated, parallel-group trial that assigned 323 patients with NSTEMI (1:1) to either immediate (median time to intervention 1.4 hours) or delayed invasive strategy (61.0hours). The primary end point was the composite of death or new myocardial infarction (MI). At 3 years, immediate invasive intervention was associated with a lower rate of death or new MI, compared with a delayed invasive strategy (12.3% vs 22.5%, hazard ratio0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.29 to 0.87, p = 0.014). The observed benefit of immediate intervention was mainly driven by an increased early reinfarction risk in delayed strategy, with similar new MI rates beyond 30 days (4.4% in the immediate and 5.6% in the delayed group, p = 0.61). Three-year mortality was 9.3% in the immediate invasive strategy, and 10.0% in the delayed strategy (p = 0.83). High baseline Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events score (> 140) was associated with a significant increase in long-term mortality, regardless of the timing of invasive intervention. In conclusion, whereas immediate invasive intervention significantly reduced the early risk of new MI, the timing of invasive intervention appears to have no significant impact on clinical outcomes beyond 30 days, which seem to mostly be related to the baseline clinical risk profile.

### 2007 guideline update for unstable angina / non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: focus on antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies [^112BC7Qz]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize key changes in the 2007 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline recommendations for pharmacologic therapy as they relate to antiplatelets and anticoagulants, and to evaluate the evidence from several landmark trials that was used to support the guideline updates for these agents.

Data Sources

Literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1950-January 2008) using the search terms acute coronary syndromes, unstable angina (UA), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), antiplatelet, and anticoagulant. All papers were cross-referenced to identify additional studies.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

ACC/AHA guidelines, relevant original research articles, and review articles were evaluated. Studies with more than 1000 patients were the focus of the review.

Data Synthesis

UA and NSTEMI are the most common presentations of acute coronary syndrome. The recently updated ACC/AHA guidelines for management of this condition were based on significant advances in pharmacotherapy including expanded use of drug-eluting stents, pretreatment with clopidogrel, and newer anticoagulants such as bivalirudin and fondaparinux. Landmark trials have been published that describe advances in the use of antiplatelets and anticoagulants. According to the guidelines, unfractionated heparin (UFH) and enoxaparin are preferred options for both invasive and conservative management. Enoxaparin was noninferior to UFH for invasive management in the SYNERGY trial, although it was associated with a higher incidence of bleeding. Other alternatives for an invasive strategy per the guidelines include bivalirudin and fondaparinux. Bivalirudin (alone or with glycoprotein [GP] IIb/IIIa inhibitor) was compared with heparin plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor in the ACUITY trial of patients undergoing early invasive management. The bivalirudin groups were noninferior to standard of care, although bivalirudin alone was associated with less bleeding. Fondaparinux was found to be noninferior to enoxaparin and was associated with fewer bleeding events in the OASIS-5 study of patients who were not treated with an early invasive approach. Accordingly, the guidelines 1list fondaparinux as an alternative for a conservative strategy or in patients at increased risk of bleeding.

Conclusions

Clinicians should be familiar with the updated 2007 ACC/AHA guidelines and the clinical trial evidence that serves as the basis for these recommendations. It is paramount for institutions to outline a preferred and consistent treatment approach. These decisions should involve a review of established efficacy, bleeding risk, need for anticoagulant reversal, costs, and clinician familiarity with different treatment regimens.

### Anticoagulants in ischemia-guided management of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^116w4KAT]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The most recent joint guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) on the management of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) are a result of a substantial and considered undertaking, and those involved deserve much recognition for their efforts. However, the handling of anticoagulants seems somewhat inadequate, and this is a highly-relevant matter when managing NSTE-ACS.

Objective Of The Review

Among areas of potential uncertainty, emergency medicine professionals might still be left wondering about the particulars of anticoagulant therapy when pursuing ischemia-guided management of NSTE-ACS (that is, managing NSTE-ACS without an intent for early invasive measures, such as coronary angiography and revascularization). This review seeks to provide insight into this question.

Discussion

Relevant clinical trials are appraised and translated into clinical context for emergency medicine professionals, including the implications of noteworthy advancements in the management of NSTE-ACS.

Conclusions

Although current guidelines from the AHA and ACC suggest enoxaparin has better evidence than other anticoagulants in the setting of NSTE-ACS management, careful review of the evidence shows this is not actually clearly supported by the available evidence in the era of contemporary management. Unless and until better contemporary data emerge, emergency medicine professionals must carefully weigh the available evidence, its limitations, and the possible clinical implications of the various anticoagulant options when managing NSTE-ACS.

### Very early invasive strategy in higher risk non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome: the RAPID NSTEMI trial [^111J94Ak]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations of RAPID NSTEMI should be considered. First, the trial was prematurely terminated due to slow enrolment having reached 18% of its original recruitment target. The trial is therefore markedly underpowered to detect a difference in the primary endpoint. Second, a mean GRACE 2.0 score of 116 suggests that a larger proportion of intermediate-risk patients with higher risk features were enrolled and, in part, explains the low event rate. Third, a high ratio of screened to randomised patients was observed. This was due to restrictive trial inclusion criteria and may impact external validity of RAPID NSTEMI; however, our aim was to enrich the trial population with higher risk patients, a group that would be expected to benefit most from a very early IS and subsequent revascularisation. Use of the selected GRACE 2.0 risk score thresholds for trial inclusion excludes between 50% and 70% of lower risk patients with NSTE-ACS and largely explains this ratio. Fourth, a higher than expected proportion of patients with non-obstructive coronary arteries (22%) were enrolled in the trial. This is likely due to basing the diagnosis of NSTE-ACS on a single hs-Tn elevation. This cohort likely represents patients with type 2 MI and therefore dilutes any possible treatment effect associated with an early IS.

Diagnosis of NSTEMI is also less straightforward than that of STEMI, which can be identified rapidly based on an electrocardiogram (ECG) measurement. The identification of patients with NSTEMI is often delayed owing to the frequent lack of definitive ECG changes and uncertainty about the definition of NSTEMI with regard to elevated cardiac troponin levels. 42 Implementation of high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin assays will lead to an increase in the diagnosis of NSTEMI. 44 Age, sex, comorbidities, and in‐hospital management strategies (eg, PCI or medical management) may also influence decisions in patients with NSTEMI regarding prescription at discharge. 28, 45

2.2 Physician guideline implementation

Another challenge for the treatment of patients with NSTEMI is the underestimation of the high ischemic risk compared with bleeding risk in these patients, which contributes to the suboptimal use of treatments and is suggestive of barriers to guideline implementation. 31, 41

In the ACS II Canadian registry, the most common reason for not choosing an invasive treatment strategy in patients with NSTEMI was an underestimation of ischemic risk by physicians, even though a large proportion of these patients were at intermediate to high risk according to their Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score. 46, 47 Results from the registry also showed weak correlations between risk assessment by physicians and TIMI and Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk scores, 48 which are recommended for guiding treatment decisions for patients with NSTEMI in international guidelines. 13, 15

In summary, the highlights of the ECS‐ACS Guidelines include the concept that ACS encompasses a spectrum from unstable angina to NSTEMI to STEMI. The serial approach involves thinking A.C.S. at initial assessment; thinking invasive management; thinking antithrombotic therapy; thinking revascularization; and thinking secondary prevention.

### Predictors and outcomes of early coronary angiography in patients with prior coronary artery bypass surgery presenting with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction [^1165jqbV]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Key messages

Population of people with prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) who present with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is growing and pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in interventional cardiology.
Application of Global Registry of Acute Cardiac Events (GRACE) score in this very high risk population is difficult as it has been under represented in major trials.
The opportunity to intervene in this group is often low and an initial medical management may be reasonable in carefully selected patients, particularly in the absence of ongoing symptoms, ECG changes, or very high GRACE scores.

CONCLUSIONS

We found that STEMI regionalization policies were not associated with changes in angiography, PCI, or 1‐year mortality of patients presenting with NSTEMI. Mortality from NSTEMI is decreasing, and early invasive therapy is becoming increasingly common, but these trends are not attributable to STEMI regionalization policies and nearly half of patients with NSTEMIs still do not receive guideline‐directed timely angiography. Policy makers should not expect STEMI regionalization programs to have either positive or negative unintended consequences for patients presenting with NSTEMIs.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^111EEK9W]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians addresses key issues in the evaluation and management of patients with suspected non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes. A writing subcommittee conducted a systematic review of the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to answer the following clinical questions: (1) In adult patients without evidence of ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, can initial risk stratification be used to predict a low rate of 30-day major adverse cardiac events? (2) In adult patients with suspected acute non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, can troponin testing within 3 hours of emergency department presentation be used to predict a low rate of 30-day major adverse cardiac events? (3) In adult patients with suspected non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome in whom acute myocardial infarction has been excluded, does further diagnostic testing (eg, provocative, stress test, computed tomography angiography) for acute coronary syndrome prior to discharge reduce 30-day major adverse cardiac events? (4) Should adult patients with acute non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction receive immediate antiplatelet therapy in addition to aspirin to reduce 30-day major adverse cardiac events? Evidence was graded and recommendations were made based on the strength of the available data.

### Preinfarct health status and the use of early invasive versus ischemia-guided management in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome [^116HcZws]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Early invasive management improves outcomes in non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The association between preinfarct health status and the selecting patients for early invasive management is unknown. The Prospective Registry Evaluating outcomes after Myocardial Infarctions: Events and Recovery and Translational Research Investigating Underlying disparities in acute Myocardial infarction Patients' Health status are consecutive US multicenter registries, in which the associations between preinfarct angina frequency and quality of life (both assessed by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire on admission) and the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score and referral to early invasive management (coronary angiography within 48 hours) were evaluated using Poisson regression, after adjusting for site, demographics, and clinical and psychosocial variables. Of 3,768 patients with NSTEMI, 2,182 (57.9%) patients were referred for early invasive treatment. Patients with excellent, good, or very good baseline angina-specific quality of life, respectively, were more likely to receive early angiography, even after adjustment, as compared with patients reporting poor baseline quality of life because of angina (62.1.0%, 60.9%, 59.6%, vs 51.2%; adjusted relative risk [RR] = 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.16; RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.27; RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.31, respectively). Finally, patients with a GRACE score in the highest risk decile (199.5 to < 321.4) had significantly lower rates of early invasive treatment (42.7%) than patients in the lowest decile of risk (67.6%; adjusted RR for continuous GRACE score per SD [1 SD = 40 points], 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.99, p = 0.019). In conclusion, in this real-world NSTEMI cohort, patients with the highest mortality risk and worst health status were less likely to be referred for early invasive management. Further work is needed to understand the role of preinfarct health status and in-hospital treatment strategy.

Regarding medical management for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to antiplatelet therapy, P2Y12 inhibitors, maintenance and de-escalation, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to consider switching to aspirin or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor monotherapy after 1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with high bleeding risk.

Initial assessment for suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS) begins with ECG within 10 min (Class 1) and obtain cTn (Class 1). If ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is present, evaluate for reperfusion therapy (Section 5). If not STEMI, perform serial ECG to detect ischemia (Class 1) and serial cTn hs-cTn at 1–2 h or conventional cTn at 3–6 h (Class 1). A clinical decision pathway (CDP) is used to define risk, with categories including low risk, intermediate risk, and criteria met for NSTEMI or high risk; for the latter, initiate medical therapy (Section 4) and assess for invasive evaluation (Section 6.1).

### Myocardial infarction: contemporary management strategies [^117TefNj]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Myocardial infarction (MI) is a common clinical diagnosis, associated with significant morbidity and mortality, not only in the short term, but also years following the index event. A more complete understanding of the pathophysiology of MI has ushered the era of multipronged treatment approach, with a combination of goal-directed revascularization, a broad adjunctive pharmacological therapy and aggressive secondary prevention measures. The goals of this article are to review the basic pathophysiological processes, which lead up to a clinical diagnosis of MI, to highlight the essential elements of clinical presentation and to summarize the evidence for comprehensive therapy. Emphasis has been placed on the choice of primary reperfusion therapy for ST-elevation MI, on risk-stratification of patients with non-ST elevation MI, and on rationale behind the selection of anti-ischaemic and antithrombotic therapy. Finally, evidence-based approach to secondary prevention is outlined.

### Immediate versus delayed invasive intervention for non-STEMI patients: the RIDDLE-NSTEMI study [^111fUGdi]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to assess the clinical impact of immediate versus delayed invasive intervention in patients with non-ST-segment myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Background

Previous studies found conflicting results on the effects of earlier invasive intervention in a heterogeneous population of acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation.

Methods

We randomized 323 NSTEMI patients to an immediate-intervention group (< 2 h after randomization, n = 162) and a delayed-intervention group (2 to 72 h, n = 161). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of death or new myocardial infarction (MI) at 30-day follow-up.

Results

Median time from randomization to angiography was 1.4 h and 61.0 h in the immediate-intervention group and the delayed-intervention group, respectively (p < 0.001). At 30 days, the primary endpoint was achieved less frequently in patients undergoing immediate intervention (4.3% vs. 13%, hazard ratio: 0.32, 95% confidence interval: 0.13 to 0.74; p = 0.008). At 1 year, this difference persisted (6.8% in the immediate-intervention group vs. 18.8% in delayed-intervention group; hazard ratio: 0.34, 95% confidence interval: 0.17 to 0.67; p = 0.002). The observed results were mainly attributable to the occurrence of new MI in the pre-catheterization period (0 deaths + 0 MIs in the immediate-intervention group vs. 1 death + 10 MIs in the delayed-intervention group). The rate of deaths, new MI, or recurrent ischemia was lower in the immediate-intervention group at both 30 days (6.8% vs. 26.7%; p < 0.001) and 1 year (15.4% vs. 33.1%; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Immediate invasive strategy in NSTEMI patients is associated with lower rates of death or new MI compared with the delayed invasive strategy at early and midterm follow-up, mainly due to a decrease in the risk of new MI in the pre-catheterization period.

Intermediate- or low-risk NSTE-ACS with planned angiography — timing: In intermediate- or low-risk patients for whom angiography is planned in NSTE-ACS, timing does not appear to be critical, and a delayed invasive strategy within 48 to 72 hours does not appear to increase future risk of MACE, and randomized trial data have not demonstrated an overall significant difference in death or MI between an earlier versus delayed invasive approach in nonselected patients with NSTEMI.
