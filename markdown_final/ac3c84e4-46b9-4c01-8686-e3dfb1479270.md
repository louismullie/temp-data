## Question

What is the clinical significance of epithelial cells on urinalysis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the clinical significance of epithelial cells on urinalysis is and how to interpret their presence by cell type, thresholds, and guideline context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the types of epithelial cells seen in urine and their anatomic origins. Then, I should verify the traditional contamination paradigm and where it fails. Next, I will examine cell-specific clinical implications, including squamous cells, urothelial "clue cells", and renal tubular epithelial cells. After that, I should assess how epithelial cells affect urinalysis performance and automation limits. Then, I need to integrate relevant guidelines to anchor practice. Finally, I will synthesize an interpretation framework and practical recommendations, and I should not forget advanced applications like urinary single-cell transcriptomics and cytology in malignancy surveillance.

> Let me first confirm the taxonomy of epithelial cells in urine because misclassification can derail interpretation early. Squamous epithelial cells derive from distal urethra and external genitalia, transitional or urothelial cells line the renal pelvis, ureter, and bladder, and renal tubular epithelial cells are shed from the nephron; atypical epithelial findings like "clue cells" (urothelial cells bacteria-adherent) and "decoy cells" (polyomavirus-infected) represent pathobiology rather than mere contamination, so I need to keep these distinctions explicit when inferring clinical meaning [^116K6kvL] [^1112a3zY] [^1116uWSQ] [^113XzvuW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about contamination just because epithelial cells are present; I should verify whether the old dogma holds. Traditional teaching equated epithelial cells — especially squamous cells — with a contaminated clean-catch, but immunofluorescent staining for the urothelial marker uroplakin III shows most epithelial cells in both midstream and catheter specimens are urothelial, not vulvo-vaginal, challenging the contamination assumption; this dovetails with emerging recognition that adult urine is not sterile, which further complicates blanket "contamination" labels [^1112a3zY] [^112Twgzj] [^notfound] [^116SCaSd].

> I need to check how well squamous epithelial cells actually predict contamination and whether thresholds matter; the data suggest SECs are a poor standalone contamination marker, yet quantitative cutoffs can inform specimen quality and downstream test performance. Specifically, SEC count poorly predicts contaminated cultures overall, but the absence or low numbers of SECs strengthens the predictive value of UA for bacteriuria, and in hematuria workups a threshold of fewer than 2 SECs per high-power field improved the positive predictive value of referral urinalyses substantially, so I should document SEC burden and consider repeating high-SEC specimens when the stakes are high [^116iG1BJ] [^113VpByz] [^114JkbXq].

> Next, I will examine urothelial cells with adherent bacteria — "clue cells" — because they may indicate true infection rather than contamination; wait, let me verify this against paired sampling studies. In term pregnancy, midstream samples contained a higher proportion of clue cells than catheter specimens despite similar proportions of uroplakin-positive cells, suggesting that voided sampling captures exfoliated infected urothelial cells; importantly, clue cells can align with sediment culture positivity even when routine culture thresholds miss infection, implying intracellular or biofilm-associated bacteria may be underdetected by standard methods and outdated thresholds [^112bARdm] [^1112a3zY] [^111GhprH] [^116tERmz].

> Let me think about renal tubular epithelial cells next, because their presence usually flags intrinsic kidney injury rather than collection issues; I should confirm the classic patterns. Renal tubular epithelial cells and epithelial cell casts, along with muddy brown granular casts, are characteristic of acute tubular necrosis — commonly ischemic or nephrotoxic such as with cisplatin — and their detection should cue an AKI evaluation; in addition, reversible tubular epithelial cell shedding has been documented with calcitonin salmon exposure, and in kidney transplantation, epithelial injury signatures predict adverse allograft outcomes even though they are not yet standardly monitored clinically [^113XzvuW] [^1157ciAz] [^112PvbxL] [^notfound].

> I should confirm how epithelial cells affect the diagnostic performance of routine urinalysis and the reliability of automation, and I need to be careful not to overstate accuracy; analysis shows that SEC contamination diminishes AUCs for pyuria, bacteriuria, and leukocyte esterase in predicting positive cultures, and automated microscopy shows variable agreement with reference manual microscopy for key sediment elements. Hmm, wait a minute — one report describes "low (98%)" sensitivity for renal tubular epithelial cells, which sounds contradictory; hold on, I should verify the original metrics: overall agreement was modest, with intermediate accuracy for hyaline casts and dysmorphic RBCs, so the "98%" appears discordant with "low sensitivity", and the safe takeaway is that automated systems can misclassify complex elements and warrant manual review when clinical stakes are high or findings are discordant, especially for renal tubular cells and casts [^113VpByz] [^112dQZxE].

> Next, I should review guideline touchpoints to anchor practice and avoid overinterpreting sediment in isolation. For suspected or detected AKI, obtain urine dipsticks for blood, protein, leukocytes, nitrite, and glucose promptly; in acute pyelonephritis and nephrolithiasis evaluation, urinalysis (WBCs, RBCs, nitrite) is recommended, and for suspected urethritis or epididymitis, first-void urine with leukocyte esterase or microscopic sediment demonstrating at least 10 WBCs per high-power field supports urethral inflammation; in catheter-associated UTI, obtain culture from a freshly replaced catheter before antibiotics to minimize confounding, all while recognizing that epithelial cells per se are not part of these diagnostic thresholds [^111uSGTg] [^114gFrrY] [^111hMgPh] [^113noQG3] [^116gHYk5].

> But wait, what if epithelial cells represent viral cytopathy rather than bacterial contamination or tubular injury; I should remember BK virus "decoy cells". The presence of decoy cells in urine cytology is a sensitive screen for BK replication (high negative predictive value), but because the positive predictive value for BK nephropathy is low, plasma and urine BK PCR quantification is needed to confirm clinically significant infection and to localize disease, particularly in transplant populations where decoy cells often precede viremia by weeks [^1116uWSQ].

> I will now synthesize an interpretation framework in prose to keep it clinically actionable: if squamous cells are numerous in a voided specimen, the sample quality is likely suboptimal and UA performance degrades, so I should consider a repeat clean-catch or catheter specimen for critical decisions; conversely, an absence or very low SEC count strengthens the predictive value of UA markers and can be used as a quality criterion in hematuria evaluations. If urothelial cells with adherent bacteria are seen, especially alongside symptoms, I should consider true infection even if routine culture is negative at high thresholds and correlate with sediment culture or enhanced methods when available. If renal tubular epithelial cells or epithelial cell casts are present, I should pivot toward intrinsic renal injury evaluation, review nephrotoxin exposures, assess hemodynamics, and monitor renal function. If decoy cells are identified, I should order BK PCR and adjust immunosuppression as appropriate in the right context while avoiding overdiagnosis based on cytology alone [^116iG1BJ] [^114JkbXq] [^112bARdm] [^113XzvuW] [^1116uWSQ].

> Next, I should review emerging and advanced applications because they reshape how we can use urinary epithelial cells diagnostically; urinary single-cell RNA sequencing captures tubular epithelial injury and repair programs and mirrors biopsy-level pathology in AKI, opening doors to noninvasive subtyping and target discovery, while urine-derived renal epithelial cell cultures enable assessment of kidney-specific transcripts and splicing events not visible in blood, and transcriptomic injury states in urine can forecast allograft outcomes, suggesting a future where urinary epithelial cells provide real-time biopsy surrogates [^117Y12Ad] [^1122TEv9] [^1179giHs] [^111a2xBt] [^116o3YXe].

> Hold on, I should not overlook the role of epithelial cells in urothelial cancer workflows; voided urinary cytology is recommended when upper tract tumors are suspected and, though highly specific, has limited sensitivity, especially for low-grade disease, with test performance influenced by cellular yield and tumor characteristics, which means epithelial cell shedding into urine can both enable and limit detection and complementary assays may be warranted in selected risk groups and surveillance settings [^111uNcQE] [^115raSWN] [^1151eXb6].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical recommendations align with both evidence and guidelines: in routine urinalysis, I should document squamous cell burden and, when there are more than a few per field in voided specimens and clinical decisions hinge on the result, repeat collection or obtain a catheter specimen to improve interpretability; when fewer than 2 squamous cells per high-power field accompany microscopic hematuria, the likelihood that hematuria is real increases, and the UA can be trusted more. When clue cells are present with symptoms, I should not dismiss the sample as contaminated, and when renal tubular epithelial cells or casts are identified, I should evaluate for AKI or nephrotoxic injury. If a catheter is in place and infection is suspected, I should culture from a freshly replaced catheter before antibiotics to reduce confounding, and throughout, I must interpret epithelial findings in the context of the entire urinalysis, clinical presentation, and pretest probability rather than in isolation [^114JkbXq] [^116iG1BJ] [^112bARdm] [^116gHYk5].

The presence of epithelial cells on urinalysis helps distinguish **contamination from true pathology**: squamous cells usually indicate external contamination [^117XeZs7] and should prompt a repeat clean-catch or catheterized sample [^114JkbXq], whereas transitional and renal tubular cells indicate **urothelial or tubular injury** [^116o3YXe] and warrant further evaluation [^113XzvuW]. High squamous counts reduce urinalysis accuracy for bacteriuria, so results must be interpreted in clinical context [^113VpByz] [^116iG1BJ].

## Types of epithelial cells in urinalysis

| **Cell type** | **Origin** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Squamous epithelial cells | - Distal urethra <br/> - External genitalia | - Usually contamination <br/> - Poor collection technique [^117XeZs7] [^114JkbXq] |
| Transitional epithelial cells | - Renal pelvis <br/> - Ureters <br/> - Bladder <br/> - Proximal urethra | - Urothelial injury <br/> - Infection <br/> - Inflammation <br/> - Neoplasia [^117XeZs7] [^116o3YXe] [^114gFrrY] [^111uNcQE] |
| Renal tubular epithelial cells | - Renal tubules | - Tubular injury <br/> - ATN <br/> - Interstitial nephritis <br/> - Glomerulonephritis [^113XzvuW] [^1122TEv9] [^116o3YXe] |

## Clinical significance of epithelial cells in urinalysis

### Squamous epithelial cells

- **Contamination indicator**: High squamous counts (> 5/HPF) typically reflect external contamination from poor collection technique [^117XeZs7] [^114JkbXq].
- **Diagnostic accuracy**: Their presence reduces urinalysis accuracy for bacteriuria, so results should be interpreted cautiously [^113VpByz] [^116iG1BJ].
- **Clinical action**: Repeat urinalysis with improved collection (clean-catch or catheterized) is recommended when squamous cells are abundant [^114JkbXq].

---

### Transitional epithelial cells

- **Urothelial injury**: Transitional cells suggest urothelial injury from infection, inflammation, or neoplasia [^117XeZs7] [^116o3YXe].
- **Infection marker**: They can indicate UTIs, including cystitis and pyelonephritis.
- **Neoplastic potential**: Atypical or malignant-appearing cells may signal urothelial carcinoma and require further evaluation.

---

### Renal tubular epithelial cells

- **Tubular injury marker**: Renal tubular cells indicate tubular injury, such as ATN, interstitial nephritis, or glomerulonephritis [^113XzvuW] [^1122TEv9] [^116o3YXe].
- **Acute kidney injury**: Their presence is associated with AKI and can help differentiate intrinsic renal injury from prerenal causes.
- **Drug toxicity**: They may appear with nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. cisplatin, ifosfamide) [^113XzvuW] [^112PvbxL].

## Clinical conditions associated with epithelial cells in urinalysis

| **Clinical condition** | **Associated epithelial cells** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|-|
| Urinary tract infection (UTI) | - Transitional <br/> - Squamous | - Infection <br/> - Inflammation <br/> - Contamination [^117XeZs7] [^114gFrrY] [^113VpByz] |
| Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) | Renal tubular | - Tubular injury <br/> - AKI [^113XzvuW] [^116o3YXe] [^1122TEv9] |
| Interstitial nephritis | Renal tubular | - Tubular injury <br/> - Inflammation [^113XzvuW] [^116o3YXe] |
| Glomerulonephritis | Renal tubular | - Glomerular injury <br/> - Inflammation [^113XzvuW] [^116o3YXe] |
| Urothelial carcinoma | Transitional | - Neoplasia <br/> - Malignancy [^117XeZs7] [^111uNcQE] [^112sCFeZ] |
| Contamination | Squamous | - Poor collection technique <br/> - External contamination [^117XeZs7] [^114JkbXq] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Contamination with high squamous counts warrants **repeat urinalysis** with improved collection technique [^114JkbXq]. Transitional cells accompanied by pyuria and bacteriuria support a UTI diagnosis and antibiotic initiation [^114gFrrY]. Detection of renal tubular cells should prompt evaluation for AKI, assessment for nephrotoxin exposure, and monitoring of renal function [^111uSGTg]. Atypical transitional cells necessitate cystoscopy, imaging, and urine cytology [^111uNcQE].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Interpretation depends on **collection quality**, as poor technique can increase contamination and lead to misinterpretation [^114JkbXq]. Patient factors such as age, sex, and BMI influence epithelial cell presence and interpretation [^113VpByz]. Automated systems can misclassify cells, so **manual review** is often required [^112dQZxE] [^1172hoyA].

---

The presence of epithelial cells on urinalysis helps **distinguish contamination from true pathology**: squamous cells typically indicate contamination [^117XeZs7], whereas transitional and renal tubular cells indicate **urothelial or tubular injury** [^116o3YXe]. Accurate interpretation requires consideration of collection technique, patient factors, and clinical context [^114JkbXq].

### Urinalysis: A comprehensive review [^117XeZs7]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A complete urinalysis includes physical, chemical, and microscopic examinations. Midstream clean collection is acceptable in most situations, but the specimen should be examined within two hours of collection. Cloudy urine often results from precipitated phosphate crystals in alkaline urine; however, pyuria can also be the cause. A strong odor may result from a concentrated specimen rather than a urinary tract infection. Although dipstick urinalysis is convenient, false-positive and false-negative results can occur. Specific gravity provides a reliable assessment of the patient's hydration status. Microhematuria has a range of causes, from benign to life-threatening. Glomerular, renal, and urologic causes of microhematuria often can be differentiated by other elements of the urinalysis. Although transient proteinuria typically is a benign condition, persistent proteinuria requires further work-up. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections, diagnosed by positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests, can be treated without culture.

### Squamous epithelial cell presence reduces accuracy of urinalysis for prediction of positive urine cultures [^113VpByz]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The diagnostic value of urinalysis specimens contaminated with squamous epithelial cells (SECs) from genital surfaces is assumed to be limited compared to clean-catch samples. However, no studies have quantified the change in predictive value in the presence of SECs for individual urinalysis markers.

- **Methods**: In a retrospective, single-center cohort study, we analyzed all urine cultures sent from the ED over a 26-month period with corresponding urinalysis results. Cultures were classified as positive with growth of > 10⁴ colony-forming units of pathogenic bacteria, negative if no growth, or contaminated for all other results. UA specimens were classified as contaminated or clean based on SEC presence. The accuracy of urinalysis markers for prediction of positive cultures was calculated as an area under the curve (AUC) and was compared between contaminated and clean UA specimens.

- **Results**: A total of 6,490 paired UA and urine cultures were analyzed, consisting of 3,949 clean and 2,541 contaminated samples. SEC presence was less common with male gender, older age, and smaller BMI. Urine cultures were 19.2% positive overall, and SECs were more common in contaminated cultures. AUCs for individual markers ranged from 0.557 to 0.796, with pyuria, bacteriuria, and leukocyte esterase having higher AUC in clean samples over contaminated.

- **Conclusion**: Analysis of AUC for individual urinalysis markers showed reduced diagnostic accuracy in the presence of SECs. SEC presence also reflected much higher rates of contaminated cultures. These results support the reduced reliance on contaminated urinalysis specimens for predicting positive urine cultures.

### Chemotherapy-related complications in the kidneys and collecting system: An imaging perspective [^113XzvuW]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) refers to acute renal failure caused by an ischemic or toxic insult to the tubular epithelial cells. This results in epithelial cell detachment from the basement membrane, causing tubular dysfunction. It presents with a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urine osmolality, and urine/plasma creatinine ratio. Urine sediment is characterized by renal tubular epithelial cells, epithelial cell casts, and muddy brown granular casts. ATN is associated with cisplatin and ifosfamide treatment. Patients may return to baseline kidney function following ATN; however, some patients develop an irreversible decline in function. Risk factors for permanent injury include age over 65 years, atheroembolic disease, and preexisting chronic kidney disease. ATN that develops in the hospital setting is associated with a high mortality rate.

- **Imaging findings**: On urography, acute tubular necrosis appears as renal enlargement with prolonged opacification of the renal parenchyma and an increase in density of the pyramids. On sonography, ATN presents as increased cortical echogenicity. Inadequacy of perfusion can also be detected as abnormal Doppler velocity waveforms. On CT imaging, ATN presents with contrast retention in the parenchyma (Fig. 6a, b). The "rim sign" can also be used to characterize ATN and is a valuable factor distinguishing infarction from pyelonephritis.

### Analysis of human urinary extracellular vesicles reveals disordered renal metabolism in myotonic dystrophy type 1 [^116K6kvL]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

Urine contains a mixture of epithelial cells, red blood cells, and white blood cells that may contribute to the urinary EV pool. Epithelial cell types found in the urine include (1) renal tubular, (2) transitional, arising from the renal pelvis, ureters, or bladder, and (3) squamous, arising from the urethra during the process of micturition. To explore the possibility that a mixed population of urinary cells may be useful as gene expression biomarkers of DM1, we performed ddPCR to quantify gene expression. Genes that are downregulated in DM1 urinary EVs tended to be expressed at lower levels in mixed urine cells of DM1 compared to UA, although to a lesser degree and with statistically non-significant differences (Supplementary Fig. 11). Of the transcripts upregulated in DM1 exRNA, KRT20 was significantly increased in mixed urine cells of DM1 versus UA controls, while HPGD appeared similar in both groups. These findings are consistent with a prior study suggesting that alternative splice events in urine exRNA are more reliable indicators of DM1 molecular pathogenesis than those found in a mixed population of urine cells.

Ultracentrifugation isolates a pellet consisting of EVs and non-EV-associated high molecular weight protein and protein complexes, some of which bind RNA. To determine whether the mRNAs we are measuring are localized to EV cargo, we used size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to separate EVs from non-EV-associated proteins and RNAs. Using ddPCR, we found that the purified EV fraction is enriched for mRNAs compared to the non-EV fractions.

### Epithelial cell states associated with kidney and allograft injury [^116o3YXe]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

The kidney epithelium, with its intricate arrangement of highly specialized cell types, constitutes the functional core of the organ. Loss of kidney epithelium is linked to the loss of functional nephrons and a subsequent decline in kidney function. In kidney transplantation, epithelial injury signatures observed during post-transplantation surveillance are strong predictors of adverse kidney allograft outcomes. However, epithelial injury is currently neither monitored clinically nor addressed therapeutically after kidney transplantation.

Several factors can contribute to allograft epithelial injury, including allograft rejection, drug toxicity, reinfections, and postrenal obstruction. The injury mechanisms that underlie allograft injury partially overlap with those associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the native kidney. Studies using advanced transcriptomic analyses of single cells from kidney or urine have identified a role for kidney injury-induced epithelial cell states in exacerbating and sustaining damage in AKI and CKD. These epithelial cell states and their associated expression signatures are also observed in transplanted kidney allografts, suggesting that the identification and characterization of transcriptomic epithelial cell states in kidney allografts may have potential clinical implications for diagnosis and therapy.

### Human urine-derived renal epithelial cells provide insights into kidney-specific alternate splicing variants [^111a2xBt]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

All patients consented to this study. Ethical approval was obtained from the UK National Research Ethics Service Committee Northern and Yorkshire (09/H0903/36). Following informed and written consent, blood samples were obtained from affected patients, their relatives, and healthy gender and age-matched controls. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed as previously described, and targeted sequence analysis was conducted using a customized sequence capture library. Human urine-derived renal epithelial cells (hURECs) were isolated from urine collected from the father of family 2 and healthy age-matched donors and cultured as previously described. Gene variants have been submitted to patient IDs 00164069, 00164068, and 00164805. Full details of the methodology are provided in Supplementary Data.

### Calcitonin salmon [^1157ciAz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

**Urine sediment abnormalities**: Coarse granular casts and casts containing renal tubular epithelial cells were reported in young adult volunteers at bed rest who were given injectable calcitonin salmon to study the effect of immobilization on osteoporosis. There was no other evidence of renal abnormality, and the urine sediment normalized after calcitonin salmon was stopped. Periodic examinations of urine sediment should be considered.

### Unique transcriptional programs identify subtypes of AKI [^114ekPYC]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Two metrics, a rise in serum creatinine concentration and a decrease in urine output, are considered tantamount to the injury of the kidney tubule and the epithelial cells thereof (AKI). Yet neither criterion emphasizes the etiology or the pathogenetic heterogeneity of acute decreases in kidney excretory function. In fact, whether decreased excretory function due to contraction of the extracellular fluid volume (vAKI) or due to intrinsic kidney injury (iAKI) actually share pathogenesis and should be aggregated in the same diagnostic group remains an open question.

To examine this possibility, we created mouse models of iAKI and vAKI that induced a similar increase in serum creatinine concentration. Using laser microdissection to isolate specific domains of the kidney, followed by RNA sequencing, we found that thousands of genes responded specifically to iAKI or to vAKI, but very few responded to both stimuli. In fact, the activated gene sets comprised different, functionally unrelated signal transduction pathways and were expressed in different regions of the kidney.

Moreover, we identified distinctive gene expression patterns in human urine as potential biomarkers of either iAKI or vAKI, but not both. Hence, iAKI and vAKI are biologically unrelated, suggesting that molecular analysis should clarify our definitions of acute changes in kidney excretory function.

### Noninvasive diagnosis of the 3243a > g mitochondrial DNA mutation using urinary epithelial cells [^112GTLwi]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2004). Low credibility.

The 3243A > G mutation is one of the most frequently observed mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and is associated with numerous clinical presentations, including mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), and diabetes and deafness. The routine diagnosis of the 3243A > G mutation in blood is difficult as mutation levels are known to decrease in this tissue over time, while in some patients it may be absent. We have directly compared the levels of the 3243A > G mutation in skeletal muscle, blood, and urinary epithelial cells in 18 patients and observed a striking correlation between the mutation load in postmitotic muscle and urinary epithelium, a mitotic tissue. These data strongly support the use of urinary epithelial cells as the tissue of choice in the noninvasive diagnosis of the 3243A > G mutation.

### Review article: BK virus in systemic lupus erythematosus [^1116uWSQ]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Both qualitative and quantitative assessments for BKV are available for diagnosis and management. Since viruria often precedes viremia by several weeks, urine cytology was first utilized to detect the presence of epithelial cells containing BK viral inclusions, which are called "decoy cells". Decoy cells are a morphological marker for BKV replication. Detection of decoy cells has a positive predictive value (PPV) of 27% to indicate BKVN and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%. However, the presence of decoy cells does not discriminate between lower urinary tract versus renal parenchymal infection.

A more specific test to quantify the BK viral load from the urine and blood is via PCR. If the urinary BK virus PCR is negative, it is more sensitive for excluding BKV as a cause of disease. A positive serum BK virus PCR has a PPV of 50–85% for BKVN and an NPV of 100%. Based on the transplant literature, when the urine BKV DNA is > 1×10⁷ copies/ml and/or plasma BKV DNA > 1×10⁴ copies/ml, a diagnosis of "presumptive BKVN" is made, even in the absence of demonstrable BKV replication in renal biopsies. However, there is no established cutoff value for the level of viruria and viremia associated with BKVN in non-renal transplant patients.

A renal biopsy, to identify the typical intranuclear viral inclusion bodies in the renal tubular epithelial cells, remains the gold standard for BKVN diagnosis. However, even the renal biopsy can have false negatives of up to 30% due to the focality of the BKV in the renal tissue.

### Diagnostic approach to and differential diagnosis of clear cell and glandular lesions of the lower urinary tract [^11225T3M]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

A variety of glandular and clear cell lesions may be seen in the urinary bladder and/or urethra, ranging from benign to malignant primary and secondary tumors. Lesions with no malignant potential include reactive processes, such as nephrogenic metaplasia, and may show similar morphologic features as an infiltrative neoplasm, particularly in small biopsies. Similarly, ectopic tissues of Müllerian origin may be seen in the lower urinary tract, and their distinction from a true glandular neoplasm is essential to avoid overtreatment. A wide variety of primary and secondary malignant tumors exist with varying degrees of glandular and clear cell features. Therefore, surgical pathologists must be aware of the full scope of possible lesions to avoid misdiagnosis.

- **Objective**: To provide a practical framework for approaching the diagnosis of clear cell and glandular lesions of the urinary bladder/urethra and prostate, highlighting the strengths and limitations of various diagnostic features and ancillary tests.

- **Data sources**: A review of the literature was performed to obtain data regarding up-to-date diagnostic features and ancillary studies.

- **Conclusions**: In summary, distinct morphologic and immunohistochemical features and clinical and radiologic correlation are essential to establish an accurate diagnosis when such cases with glandular and clear features are encountered in the lower urinary tract.

### "Sterile urine" and the presence of bacteria [^116SCaSd]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

### Podocyturia: An emerging biomarker for kidney injury [^112efM66]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Podocyte injury is an established hallmark of kidney disease progression. Podocyte loss is a widely proven hypothesis to explain, in part, glomerular damage. Regardless of the underlying kidney disease, the pathophysiologic processes frequently involve the glomerulus. A growing body of evidence considers podocyte detachment (podocytopathy) and their presence in the urine (podocyturia) as hallmarks of glomerular disease progression. Thus, developing new tools to monitor disease progression non-invasively is of major clinical importance. Detection of podocytes in the urine as a biomarker of disease progression would be a significant achievement toward developing such tools. This review summarizes current knowledge about podocyturia.

### Urine: Waste product or biologically active tissue [^112qKV3Z]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). High credibility.

Historically, urine has been viewed primarily as a waste product with little biological role in the overall health of an individual. Increasingly, data suggest that urine plays a role in human health beyond waste excretion. For example, urine might act as an irritant and contribute to symptoms through interaction with — and potential compromise of — the urothelium.

To explore the concept that urine may be a vehicle for agents with potential or occult bioactivity and to discuss existing evidence and novel research questions that may yield insight into such a role, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease invited experts in the fields of comparative evolutionary physiology, basic science, nephrology, urology, pediatrics, metabolomics, and proteomics (among others) to a Urinology Think Tank meeting on February 9, 2015.

This report reflects ideas that evolved from this meeting and literature, including the concept of urine quality and the biological, chemical, and physical characteristics of urine, such as microbiota, cells, exosomes, pH, metabolites, proteins, and specific gravity. Additionally, the manuscript presents speculative, and hopefully testable, ideas about the functional roles of urine constituents in health and disease.

Moving forward, there are several questions that need further understanding and pursuit. There were suggestions to consider actively using various animal models and their biological specimens to elaborate on basic mechanistic information regarding the human bladder.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^115ZmuWp]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, particularly in pediatric patients, the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a first morning urine sample for the initial testing of albuminuria and proteinuria in pediatric patients. The preferred testing methods, in descending order of preference, are as follows:

- **Urine protein-to-creatinine ratio and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio**: These ratios help assess the levels of protein and albumin in the urine, respectively.

- **Reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and for albumin with automated reading**: This method involves a chemically treated strip that changes color when proteins are present, and an automated system reads the results.

- **Reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and for albumin with manual reading**: Similar to the automated method, but the results are interpreted manually.

### Prostate cancer marker panel with single cell sensitivity in urine [^111reW2y]. The Prostate (2015). Low credibility.

About a third (31.2%, 10 of 32) of the biopsy-negative patients had a positive UCMP assay, potentially indicating biopsies missing tumor areas (false negatives). Although no evidence is available to confirm the existence of tumor foci missed by the biopsies, identifying patients with potentially false-negative biopsies is one of the main advantages of this assay, as these patients may most likely benefit from repeat biopsies. Theoretically, all biopsy-positive cases should be positive in the UCMP assay; however, the assay was negative in 9 of the 25 biopsy-positive cases. As our cell-capture method can pick up a single cell, we speculate that post-DRE urine of patients with CaP may not always contain CaP cells, possibly due to the location and/or size of the tumor. This observation also highlights the need for improvement in approaches releasing CaP cells into urine.

The most significant improvement of this assay over previous efforts is its sensitivity for capturing minute amounts of cells from urine. In bladder cancer, where many more tumor cells are released into the urine (typically thousands of cells are available for capture), cytological assays have been used efficiently with traditional cell capture approaches. In CaP, one thousand cells were required for consistent cell capture from urine, which is often not present in post-DRE urine specimens, limiting the applicability of the specific assay. The UCMP assay takes advantage of translucent filter membranes, on which the captured cells can be directly analyzed by ICC and microscopy.

### How important is urinary cytology in the diagnosis of urological malignancies [^112sCFeZ]. European Urology (2003). Low credibility.

To audit the clinical usefulness of urine cytology examination in a subspecialized urological unit setting, data from the hospital information support system on urinary cytology examinations carried out at one center was audited over a period of 15 months. The source of urine cytology specimens, the clinical profile of patients, and the findings of urinary cytology were analyzed and collated.

A total of 1,400 urinary cytology specimens from 900 patients were requested during the 15-month study period. Urologists requested 1,092 (78%), while non-urologists (general practitioners, physicians, or general surgeons) requested 318 (22%) specimens. The majority of specimens, 1,115 (80%), did not show any cytological evidence of malignancy. Eighty-three specimens (6%) showed cytological evidence of malignant cells consistent with origin from a urothelial malignancy. Among this group, 87% (72) were more than 50 years of age, and 60 (72%) had a history of gross hematuria. One hundred fifty-nine cases (11.35%) were reported as being suspicious of malignancy or showing atypical cells requiring further evidence. A total of 43 specimens (3.04%) were poorly preserved or insufficient for diagnosis. The positivity rate amongst urologist and non-urologist requests was 56% and 6%, respectively (p = 0.00001). The source in 37 (86%) specimens reported as poorly preserved or insufficient for diagnosis was non-urologists compared to 6 (14%) from urologists, with a significant p value (0.00001).

Urinary cytology for malignant cells is a contributory investigation in the diagnosis of urological malignancies.

### Cyto-injury factors in urine: A possible mechanism for the development of interstitial cystitis [^115wHaLV]. The Journal of Urology (2000). Low credibility.

In most of our patients with interstitial cystitis (IC), the disease is associated with an increased urothelial permeability whose cause has not been identified. We postulate that both normal urine and the urine of IC patients contain factors capable of injuring the mucosa and causing increased permeability that would allow urine components to leak into the bladder muscle. To test this hypothesis, we examined fractions of normal urine for toxic effects on bladder smooth muscle and epithelial cells in vitro. In the same in vitro system, we measured the effects of Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP), a normal urinary glycoprotein that may be a scavenger of injurious agents capable of "detoxifying" normal metabolic products.

Human urothelial cells (T24) and rabbit bladder smooth muscle cells were incubated overnight with various fractions prepared from healthy volunteers' urine. The urine fractions of molecular weights > 100 Da were incubated overnight with either urothelial or smooth muscle target cells after no treatment or after heating to 56°C, preincubation with THP, exposure to heparin, or elution from heparin. Cytotoxicity was determined for each group using a neutral red uptake assay.

Urine fractions of molecular weight 500 to 1000 Da were cytotoxic to smooth muscle cells (39%) and urothelial cells (50%). Cytotoxicity levels for THP-treated fractions were significantly lower than those for untreated fractions in both urothelial cells (7% versus 89%, p < 0.001) and smooth muscle cells (8% versus 70%, p < 0.01).

### Urothelial cells may indicate underlying bacteriuria in pregnancy at term: a comparative study [^1112a3zY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

This was a prospective, cross-sectional, single-blinded comparative study of two urinary sampling methods in pregnant women at term gestation undergoing elective caesarean section. Patients were recruited between June and August 2015 from the obstetric labour ward theatre at a tertiary hospital in Central London and gave written consent to an ethically approved study. The data were structured so that individual patients could not be identified.

A set of 41 questions was used to obtain a pertinent clinical, obstetric, and infection history. Further clinical data were gleaned from electronic patient notes and records. A lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) profile was created using the "Artemis questionnaire", a detailed 49-item questionnaire divided into four categories: stress incontinence symptoms, overactive bladder symptoms, voiding symptoms, and pain symptoms (Additional file 1). This questionnaire is used in clinical practice by a tertiary chronic LUTS clinic as a tool to identify urine infections and assess treatment response in non-pregnant patients with chronic LUT symptoms. In this study, the LUTS profile was used as an assessment of bladder distress.

Two urine samples were obtained from each participant for paired comparison. First, participants were instructed to provide an MSU sample before entering the labour ward operating theatre. Verbal and written instructions were given to ensure an adequate clean-catch sample by (1) washing hands and cleaning the genital area with a hypoallergenic wipe to prevent local contamination, and (2) parting the labia and urinating directly into the sample container.

### Protein trafficking defects in inherited kidney diseases [^111Fe3Qp]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

The nephron, the basic structural and functional unit of the kidney, is lined by different, highly differentiated polarized epithelial cells. Their concerted action modifies the composition of the glomerular ultrafiltrate through reabsorption and secretion of essential solutes to finally produce urine. The highly specialized properties of the different epithelial cell types of the nephron are remarkable and rely on the regulated delivery of specific proteins to their final subcellular localization. Hence, mutations affecting sorting of individual proteins or inactivating the epithelial trafficking machinery have severe functional consequences, causing disease.

The presence of mutations leading to protein trafficking defects is indeed a mechanism of pathogenesis seen in an increasing number of disorders, including about one-third of monogenic diseases affecting the kidney. In this review, we focus on representative diseases to discuss different molecular mechanisms that primarily lead to defective protein transport, such as endoplasmic reticulum retention, mistargeting, defective endocytosis, or degradation, eventually resulting in epithelial cell and kidney dysfunction.

For each disease, we discuss the type of reported mutations, their molecular and cellular consequences, and possible strategies for therapeutic intervention. Particular emphasis is given to new and prospective therapies aimed at rescuing the trafficking defect at the basis of these conformational diseases.

### Spectrum of bacterial colonization associated with urothelial cells from patients with chronic lower urinary tract symptoms [^1135PagU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), such as urgency and incontinence, are common, especially among the elderly, but their etiology is often obscure. Recent studies of acute urinary tract infections implicated invasion by Escherichia coli into the cytoplasm of urothelial cells, with the persistence of long-term bacterial reservoirs; however, the role of infection in chronic LUTS is unknown. We conducted a large prospective study with eligible patients with LUTS and controls over a 3-year period, comparing routine urine cultures of planktonic bacteria with cultures of shed urothelial cells concentrated in centrifuged urinary sediments. This comparison revealed large numbers of bacteria undetected by routine cultures.

Next, we typed the bacterial species cultured from patient and control sediments under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and we found that the two groups had complex but significantly distinct profiles of bacteria associated with their shed bladder epithelial cells. Strikingly, E. coli, the organism most responsible for acute urinary tract infections, was not the only or even the main offending pathogen in this more chronic condition. Antibiotic protection assays with shed patient cells and in vitro infection studies using patient-derived strains in cell culture suggested that LUTS-associated bacteria are within or extremely closely associated with shed epithelial cells. This finding explains how routine cultures might fail to detect them. These data have strong implications for the need to rethink our common diagnoses and treatments of chronic urinary tract symptoms.

### The application of new complex indicators in the detection of urine [^1172hoyA]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

Furthermore, because the concentration of urine components varies greatly under the influence of drinking water, exercise, and other factors, random urine sample tests lack stability. Our findings suggest that patients with biopsy-proven non-hematuria-dominant renal histologic lesions may have high URBCs on automated urine sediment analyzers. In addition, we observed that some patients with hematuria-dominant renal histologic lesions had negative hematuria on routine urinalysis with less than 25 RBCs/µL. According to Yang et al, the urine SG affects RBCs' morphology, thus altering the identification of RBCs via automated urine sediment analyzers.

Considering the mechanism by which the urine sediment analyzer operates, the counting and classification of urinary RBCs are based on signals of forwarding scattered light, side scattered light, and side-fluorescent light patterns. The pattern of individual light signals is transformed by specific algorithms into individual "fingerprints", allowing the counting, identification, and classification of the particles. This inconsistency might mainly be attributed to a variable mixture of components in the urine, such as cells, casts, crystals, and bacteria. Furthermore, when the automated urine sediment analyzer interferes with various particle sizes, it may mistake other urinary components for RBCs. In addition, the urine sediment analyzer itself cannot calibrate the urinary concentration or reduced kidney function. Morphological changes in urinary RBCs may be related to counting errors. Urine RBCs in a hypotonic environment exhibit a…

### Urothelial cells may indicate underlying bacteriuria in pregnancy at term: A comparative study [^112Twgzj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

In this study of pregnant women at term, we observed that MSU samples had greater bacterial growth and variety when compared to CSU samples. The majority of epithelial cells in both MSU and CSU samples were urothelial in origin, suggesting no difference in contamination rates. Furthermore, MSU samples had a higher proportion of clue cells to UP3+ cells and may indicate a greater propensity to detect bacterial invasion compared to CSU sampling. A closer examination of the MSU for clue cells may prove to be more informative on the disease state from practice, which has implications for the correct interpretation of MSU findings in late pregnancy.

### Podocyturia: An emerging biomarker for kidney injury [^115LcAoL]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Podocyte injury is an established hallmark of kidney disease progression. Podocyte loss is a widely proven hypothesis to explain, in part, glomerular damage. Regardless of the underlying kidney disease, the pathophysiologic processes frequently involve the glomerulus. A growing body of evidence considers that podocyte detachment (podocytopathy) and their presence in the urine (podocyturia) are hallmarks of glomerular disease progression. Developing new tools to monitor disease progression non-invasively is of major clinical importance. Detection of podocytes in the urine as a biomarker of disease progression would be a major achievement toward the development of such tools. This review summarizes knowledge about podocyturia.

### Influence of renal excretory function on the performance of urine based markers to detect bladder cancer [^116r6pZV]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

In hematuria cases, urine-based tests are utilized to detect bladder cancer; however, the diagnostic yield remains insufficient due to influencing variables, including urinary tract infection. Many patients are elderly with renal insufficiency and present proteinuria as an additional influencing factor. To our knowledge, no data are available on the accuracy of urine-based bladder cancer tests in conjunction with renal function.

- **Materials and methods**: Urine samples from 449 patients with hematuria and histology were included in the analysis. Cytology, fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunocytology, and nuclear matrix protein 22 assays were conducted. Renal function was classified as normal, impaired, or severely impaired based on serum creatinine, the glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria. False-positive rates were statistically compared in regard to renal function.

- **Results**: A total of 382 patients did not have bladder cancer. There was an increased false-positive rate for creatinine and the glomerular filtration rate. The nuclear matrix protein 22 test showed a 22.0% and 46.7% false-positive rate in the normal and limited function cohorts, respectively (p = 0.05). Similar trends were noted for proteinuria. Indeterminate significance was detected, separating those with severely impaired function for immunocytology and those in the normal group for fluorescence in situ hybridization (p = 0.08 and 0.06, respectively). Proteinuria was a significant factor for urine cytology, with increased false-positive results in the absence of urinary tract infection (p = 0.0017 and 0.05, respectively).

### Abnormal urinalysis results are common, regardless of specimen collection technique, in women without urinary tract infections [^114mXspZ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Voided urinalysis to test for urinary tract infection (UTI) is prone to false-positive results for a number of reasons. Specimens are often collected at triage from women with any abdominal complaint, creating a low UTI prevalence population. Improper collection technique by the patient may affect the result. At least four indices, if positive, can indicate UTI.

- **Objective**: We examine the impact of voided specimen collection technique on urinalysis indicators of UTI and on urine culture contamination in disease-free women.

- **Methods**: In this crossover design, 40 menstrual-age female emergency department staff without UTI symptoms collected urine two ways: directly in a cup ("non-clean") and midstream clean catch ("ideal"). Samples underwent standard automated urinalysis and culture. Urinalysis indices and culture contamination were compared.

- **Results**: The proportion of abnormal results from samples collected by "non-clean" vs. "ideal" technique, respectively, were: leukocyte esterase (> trace) 50%, 35% (95% confidence interval for difference -6% to 36%); nitrites (any) 2.5%, 2.5% (difference -2.5 to 2.5%); white blood cells (> 5/high-powered field [HPF]) 50%, 27.5% (difference 4 to 41%); bacteria (any/HPF) 77.5%, 62.5% (difference -7 to 37%); epithelial cells (> few) 65%, 30% (difference 13 to 56%); culture contamination (> 1000 colony-forming units of commensal or > 2 species) 77%, 63% (difference -5 to 35%). No urinalysis index was positively correlated with culture contamination.

- **Conclusion**: Contemporary automated urinalysis indices were often abnormal in a disease-free population.

### Urine based markers of urological malignancy [^1151eXb6]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

A number of urine-based markers have been and are being investigated for the diagnosis and prognostication of urological conditions. A majority of these markers have been evaluated in urological neoplasms, particularly bladder cancer. The diagnosis of bladder cancer currently relies on identifying malignant cells in the urine and subsequently visualizing the tumor on cystoscopy. This diagnosis is further confirmed by transurethral resection or biopsy. While urine cytology is specific, it is not sensitive, especially for detecting low-grade disease. This characteristic has prompted the search for more accurate markers of bladder cancer. In this review, we critically examine the results of studies evaluating various markers for bladder cancer.

- **Materials and methods**: The published literature on urine-based markers for all urological diseases, particularly bladder cancer, was identified using a MEDLINE search and critically analyzed. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the various markers were compared. The benefit of using combined markers rather than a single marker was also analyzed from published reports.

- **Results**: Most published literature on urine-based markers for urological malignancies involves such markers for diagnosing and prognosticating bladder cancer. Hence, we focused mainly on urine-based markers in bladder cancer. Most markers appear to have an advantage over urine cytology in terms of sensitivity, especially for detecting low-grade, superficial tumors. However, most markers tend to be less specific than cytology.

### Urothelial cells may indicate underlying bacteriuria in pregnancy at term: a comparative study [^112bARdm]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common in pregnancy. Urine is typically sampled by mid-stream collection (MSU). If epithelial cells are detected, contamination by vulvo-vaginal skin and skin bacteria is assumed. Outside pregnancy, catheter specimen urine (CSU) is considered less susceptible to contamination. We compared MSU and CSU methods in term pregnancy to test these assumptions.

- **Methods**: Healthy pregnant women at term gestation (n = 32, median gestation 38+6 weeks, IQR 37+6–39+2) undergoing elective caesarean section provided a MSU and CSU for paired comparison. Each sample was analyzed for bacterial growth and bladder distress by fresh microscopy, sediment culture, and immunofluorescent staining. Participants completed a detailed questionnaire on lower urinary tract symptoms. Epithelial cells found in urine were tested for urothelial origin by immunofluorescent staining of Uroplakin III (UP3), a urothelial cell surface glycoprotein. Urothelial cells with closely associated bacteria, or "clue cells", were also counted. Wilcoxon's signed rank test was used for paired analysis.

- **Results**: Women reported multiple lower urinary tract symptoms (median 3, IQR 0–8). MSU had higher white blood cell counts (median 67 vs. 46, z = 2.75, p = 0.005) and epithelial cell counts (median 41 vs. 22, z = 2.57, p = 0.009) on fresh microscopy. The proportion of UP3+ cells was not different (0.920 vs. 0.935, z = 0.08, p = 0.95); however, MSU had a higher proportion of clue cells (0.978 vs. 0.772, z = 3.17, p = 0.001). MSU had more bacterial growth on sediment culture compared to CSU specimens (median 8088 total cfu).

### Diagnostic and treatment difficulties of pyelonephritis in pregnancy in resource-limited settings [^1132d69D]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Pyelonephritis is essentially a clinical diagnosis. The sensitivity and specificity of leukocyte esterase and nitrites in this cohort are in agreement with a meta-analysis that found the sensitivity and specificity of nitrites were around 50% and 95%, whereas leukocyte esterase was highly variable, with a sensitivity of 50–60% and a lower specificity than nitrites. It has been suggested that nitrites alone indicate the need for further urine testing and could be used to initiate treatment, which would overtreat a large percentage of patients in this setting. Urine sediment microscopy proved more sensitive than urine dipsticks for the diagnosis of pyelonephritis. A WBC count of ≥ 7/HPF in the presence of bacteria and with an epithelial cell count < 5/HPF predicted a positive urine culture with the highest sensitivity, but this was not as specific as a WBC count of ≥ 10/HPF or the presence of leukocytes and nitrites on urine dipstick. In areas where microscopy is routinely practiced to diagnose malaria and microbiological facilities are not available, the urine sediment is likely to provide a cheap alternative for urine examination. Cut-offs are best confirmed with microbiological support, but this could be done as a survey.

Known limitations of the dipstick nitrite test in diagnosing bacteriuria include infection with non–nitrite-producing pathogens and insufficient time since the last void for nitrites to appear at detectable levels (ideally, at least 4 hours); in this setting, another limitation is possibly a lack of dietary nitrate.

### Use of patient derived urine renal epithelial cells to confirm pathogenicity of PKHD1 alleles [^1132W9Se]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Another possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the ciliary defect observed in ARPKD URECs is not a direct consequence of PKHD1 depletion, but rather an effect of the complex tissue dysregulation occurring in the cystic kidney epithelium. Knockdown of PKHD1 in URECs derived from healthy donors will help clarify this important point. Rescue experiments with wild-type or mutant PKHD1 alleles can provide definitive confirmation of the direct link between the aberrant transcripts and the ciliary phenotype.

Interspecies differences between murine models and humans, low expression levels of PKHD1 in the majority of tissues, coupled with possible tissue-specific effects of mutations and the lack of effective immunoreagents, have so far led to inconsistent results and hindered a detailed investigation of the functions of PKHD1. Functional investigations and mechanistic studies on URECs derived from controls and ARPKD patients, as an ex vivo disease-relevant model, promise to shed new light on PKHD1 functions.

### Urothelial cells may indicate underlying bacteriuria in pregnancy at term: a comparative study [^111GhprH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

In this study of pregnant women at term, we observed that MSU samples had greater bacterial growth and variety compared to CSU samples. The majority of epithelial cells in both MSU and CSU samples were urothelial in origin, implying no difference in contamination rates. Furthermore, MSU samples had a higher proportion of clue cells to UP3+ cells, indicating a greater degree of bacterial invasion than urine sampled directly from the bladder. This has implications for the correct interpretation of MSU findings in late pregnancy.

UK laboratories diagnose urinary tract infections using a threshold of ≥ 10⁵ total cfu/ml, first described in 1957 by Kass et al. This standard persists despite being shown to misdiagnose over 50% of women with lower urinary tract symptoms. A much lower count of ≥ 10² cfu/ml of a single isolate has been suggested as a more appropriate threshold for infection in acutely symptomatic women. In the event of mixed bacterial growth, the sample is considered contaminated by vulvo-vaginal bacterial flora. Within our term pregnant population, the majority of MSU sample sediment cultures had mixed growth and total cfu/ml > 10³. Our sediment culture appears to correlate with clinical presentation as most participants reported multiple lower urinary tract symptoms; however, they were classified as "no significant growth" or "mixed growth of uncertain significance" by routine laboratory culture. It is possible that symptomatic pregnant women at term gestation with mixed growth and fewer bacterial colonies may no

### Defining properly collected urine: Thresholds to improve the accuracy of urinalysis for microscopic hematuria evaluation in women [^114JkbXq]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Microscopic hematuria is one of the most common office consults for urologists. While revised guidelines have risk-stratified patients to reduce unnecessary screening, they do not provide guidance concerning specimen quality. We aimed to define "properly collected" specimens using catheterized urine samples as a reference to improve the utility of hematuria screening in women.

We prospectively acquired same-visit voided and catheterized urine samples from 46 women referred for microscopic hematuria from September 2016 to March 2020. Characteristics of pre-referral urinalysis were compared to the matched specimens. True microscopic hematuria was defined as ≥ 3 red blood cells per high power field on catheterization.

Catheterized urinalyses had significantly fewer red blood and squamous epithelial cells in comparison to both referral urinalyses (p = 0.006, p = 0.001, respectively) and same-day void urinalyses (p = 0.02, p = 0.04, respectively). As no catheterized sample had > 2 squamous epithelial cells, we applied this squamous epithelial cell threshold to referral urinalyses for analysis. The addition of this criterion for a "properly collected specimen" increased the positive predictive value of referral urinalyses from 46.1% to 68.8% for true microscopic hematuria. Fewer than 2 squamous epithelial cells with elevated red blood cells was a significant predictor for true microscopic hematuria (p = 0.003).

Voided specimens in the urology clinic had significantly lower red blood cells than referral samples, indicating improved collection technique.

### Urothelial cells may indicate underlying bacteriuria in pregnancy at term: a comparative study [^1154LQm7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection is common in pregnancy. Urine is sampled by mid-stream collection (MSU). If epithelial cells are detected, contamination by vulvo-vaginal skin and skin bacteria is assumed. Outside pregnancy, catheter specimen urine (CSU) is considered less susceptible to contamination. We compared MSU and CSU methods in term pregnancy to test these assumptions.

- **Methods**: Healthy pregnant women at term gestation (n = 32, median gestation 38 + 6 weeks, IQR 37 + 6–39 + 2) undergoing elective caesarean section provided a MSU and CSU for paired comparison that were each analyzed for bacterial growth and bladder distress by fresh microscopy, sediment culture, and immunofluorescent staining. Participants completed a detailed questionnaire on lower urinary tract symptoms. Epithelial cells found in urine were tested for urothelial origin by immunofluorescent staining of Uroplakin III (UP3), a urothelial cell surface glycoprotein. Urothelial cells with closely associated bacteria, or "clue cells", were also counted. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for paired analysis.

- **Results**: Women reported multiple lower urinary tract symptoms (median 3, IQR 0–8). MSU had higher white blood cell counts (median 67 vs 46, z = 2.75, p = 0.005) and epithelial cell counts (median 41 vs 22, z = 2.57, p = 0.009) on fresh microscopy. The proportion of UP3+ cells was not different (0.920 vs 0.935, z = 0.08, p = 0.95); however, MSU had a higher proportion of clue cells (0.978 vs 0.772, z = 3.17, p = 0.001). MSU had more bacterial growth on sediment culture compared to CSU specimens.

### Urinary squamous epithelial cells do not accurately predict urine culture contamination, but may predict urinalysis performance in predicting bacteriuria [^116iG1BJ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The presence of squamous epithelial cells (SECs) has been advocated to identify urinary contamination despite a paucity of evidence supporting this practice. We sought to determine the value of using quantitative SECs as a predictor of urinalysis contamination.

- **Methods**: Retrospective cross-sectional study of adults (≥ 18 years old) presenting to a tertiary academic medical center who had urinalysis with microscopy and urine culture performed. Patients with missing or implausible demographic data were excluded (2.5% of total sample). The primary analysis aimed to determine an SEC threshold that predicted urine culture contamination using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. The a priori secondary analysis explored how demographic variables (age, sex, body mass index) may modify the SEC test performance and whether SECs impacted traditional urinalysis indicators of bacteriuria.

- **Results**: A total of 19,328 records were included. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that SEC count was a poor predictor of urine culture contamination (area under the ROC curve = 0.680, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.671 to 0.689). In secondary analysis, the positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of predicting bacteriuria via urinalysis among noncontaminated specimens was 4.98 (95% CI = 4.59 to 5.40) in the absence of SECs, but the LR+ fell to 2.35 (95% CI = 2.17 to 2.54) for samples with more than 8 SECs/low-powered field (lpf). In an independent validation cohort, urinalysis samples with fewer than 8 SECs/lpf predicted bacteriuria better (sensitivity = 75%, specificity = 84%).

### Urothelial cells may indicate underlying bacteriuria in pregnancy at term: a comparative study [^116tERmz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

The uroplakin analysis refutes the assumption that epithelial cells are vulvo-vaginal skin contaminants. The epithelial cells seen in the urine were urothelial in origin and were often clue cells with closely associated bacteria. MSU samples had more clue cells and therefore a greater degree of bacterial invasion. There was no significant correlation between total cfu/ml and clue cells, which is expected, as intracellular bacteria will evade detection by routine culture means. Our findings confirm that colonization of urothelial cells by microbes leads to an innate immune response, as previously described by Horsley and colleagues.

Mucosal surfaces are common entry points for microbes, and in the context of urinary tract infections, uropathogenic bacteria invade the apical surface of the urothelium to create adherent surface biofilms or form intracellular bacterial colonies. The parasitized urothelial cell is subsequently exfoliated into the urine to encourage bacterial clearance, leading to the accumulation of these clue cells as sediment at the base of the bladder. While a transurethral catheter will pass through this deposit and sample the urine above, an MSU is more likely to achieve a greater sample of clue cells. It is conceivable that an ordinary void may achieve even more by including the first part of the stream.

Urine is increasingly recognized to have its own diverse microbiome, and standard culture methods only capture a small fraction of this living community. Imbalances within this healthy microbiota are associated with factors such as age and body mass.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^113noQG3]. MMWR. Recommendations and reports (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute epididymitis, specifically concerning urine tests, the CDC 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining any of the following point-of-care tests for all patients with suspected acute epididymitis:

- **Gram, methylene blue, or gentian violet stain of urethral secretions**: To demonstrate ≥ 2 WBCs/oil immersion field. This is preferred for evaluating urethritis to document both urethral inflammation and the presence or absence of gonococcal infection. Gonococcal infection is established by documenting WBC-containing intracellular Gram-negative or purple diplococci on urethral Gram, methylene blue, or gentian violet stain, respectively.

- **Leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine**.

- **Microscopic examination of sediment from a spun first-void urine**: To demonstrate ≥ 10 WBC/hpf.

### Urinary single-cell transcriptomics: A promising noninvasive method for assessing acute kidney injury [^117Y12Ad]. Kidney International (2022). Low credibility.

Noninvasive methods for obtaining intrarenal information are required to understand the mechanism of acute kidney injury (AKI). Klocke et al. explored the feasibility of using urinary single-cell RNA sequencing in assessing human AKI. Urine samples from patients with AKI included tubular epithelial cells with injury-related dedifferentiation and adaptive phenotypes, which could reflect kidney tissue damage. Thus, urinary single-cell RNA sequencing would provide new insights into human AKI, leading to the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

### Intracellular bacterial communities: A potential etiology for chronic lower urinary tract symptoms [^111hfoFD]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with persistent lower urinary tract symptoms and negative urine cultures are often difficult to treat. Infection may go undetected in these patients because the concentrations of bacteria in their urine are beneath the threshold of standard urine culture techniques. Empiric treatment may result in temporary relief, followed by recurrence of symptoms. Occult and recurring urinary tract infections may be due to both the invasion of the bladder wall by uropathogenic Escherichia coli and the formation of biofilm-like intracellular bacterial communities. This review examines emerging evidence for the role of intracellular bacterial communities in human infection.

### Human urine-derived renal epithelial cells provide insights into kidney-specific alternate splicing variants [^1179giHs]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

The majority of multi-exon genes undergo alternative splicing to produce different mRNA transcripts, which may occur in a tissue-specific manner. Assessment of mRNA transcripts isolated from blood samples may sometimes be unhelpful in determining the effect on the function of putative splice-site variants affecting kidney-specific mRNA transcripts. Here, we present data demonstrating the power of using human urine-derived renal epithelial cells (hUREC) as a source of kidney RNA.

We report clinical and molecular genetic data from three affected cases from two families, all with end-stage renal disease by 15 years of age. In both families, heterozygous variants predicted to affect function in NPHP3 were found on one allele, in combination with a synonymous SNV (c.2154C > T; p. Phe718 =), 18 base pairs from the exon–intron boundary within exon 15 of NPHP3. The only mRNA transcript amplified from wild-type whole blood showed complete splicing out of exon 15.

Urine samples obtained from control subjects and the father of family 2, who carried the synonymous SNV variant, were therefore used to culture hUREC, allowing us to obtain kidney-specific mRNA. Control kidney mRNA showed retention of exon 15, while the mRNA from the patient's father confirmed evidence of a heterozygous alternate splicing of exon 15 of NPHP3. Analysis of RNA derived from hUREC allows for a comparison of kidney-specific and whole-blood RNA transcripts and for assessment of the effect on function of putative splice variants leading to end-stage kidney disease.

### Is cytology required for a hematuria evaluation [^115raSWN]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

The value of urine cytology in evaluating patients with hematuria remains controversial. The American Urological Association Best Practice Policy on asymptomatic microscopic hematuria recommends cytology only in patients with risk factors for transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). This study evaluated how often urine cytology yielded supportive or unique information that led to the diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma, the cost of that information, and whether it would have been obtained using the Best Practice Policy.

Between March 1976 and June 1985, 1,000 sequential patients with one episode of gross hematuria or microscopic hematuria, defined as greater than three red blood cells per high power field on two of three properly collected urinalyses, were evaluated according to a standard protocol in a closed panel healthcare system in the state of Hawaii. These records were reviewed to determine if urine cytology yielded supportive or unique information that led to the diagnosis of TCC.

In four patients, positive urine cytology was the sole finding supporting a TCC diagnosis. Urine cytology had a sensitivity of 55% and a specificity of 99.3%. The cost of a cytology result that yielded unique information was 8,367 US dollars using the 2002 Medicare reimbursement schedule.

Urine cytology can have an important role in the evaluation of hematuria. The American Urological Society Best Practice Policy, using risk factors to select patients for urine cytology, would have captured the four patients for whom cytology was the key finding supporting a TCC diagnosis.

### The diagnostic accuracy of urine-based tests for bladder cancer varies greatly by patient [^112tYwCH]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Proper stratification into relevant subgroups allows for recognition of important spectrum associations. There is value in discerning between low-grade and high-grade lesions; high-grade should be detected as early as possible, while the likelihood of missing such a tumor should be as low as possible. In high-risk populations, sensitivity is more important than specificity because the consequences of a missed malignancy are great. FISH exhibits such properties in the smoking subgroup, whereas cytology does not have similar characteristics in the same population. Therefore, a clinician should give stronger consideration to FISH results than cytology results in smokers. Analogous spectrum effects can be seen for indication and cytology.

There are other patient populations where the risks of a procedure often outweigh the benefits. It is preferable for a urine test with a high specificity and low sensitivity in low-grade disease to reduce the number of unnecessary invasive procedures. Age and cytology illustrate this effect because as the patient's age increases, so does the specificity, with a reciprocal decrease in sensitivity. This should spare the elderly patient avoidable cystoscopies. The tradeoff would be that some tumors may be missed for a period of time, but the literature surrounding active surveillance suggests this is safe.

### Urine cytology discrepancies: Frequency, causes, and outcomes [^115GYmtq]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Although urine cytology is used for the early detection and surveillance of urothelial carcinoma, there has been little study of the frequency, causes, and outcomes of cytologic-histologic discrepancies. We obtained histologic follow-up in 361 (6.2%) of 5,785 voided, 124 (19.5%) of 636 lower tract instrumented, and 23 (33%) of 69 upper tract urinary cytologic specimens from one institution over a 2-year timeframe to determine diagnostic discrepancy frequency and outcomes. Cytologic-histologic discrepancies were observed in 208 (40.9%) cases with histologic follow-up, and the cause of discrepancy was attributed to interpretation in 35.1% and sampling in 63.0% of cases, respectively. Of all discrepancies, 101 (48.6%) resulted in minimal or mild harm, consisting mainly of repeated testing and/or diagnostic delays. Severe harm was never observed. We conclude that screening and surveillance methods that incorporate urine cytology are accurate in diagnosing urothelial cancer. However, the protocols result in potentially reducible errors that lead to unnecessary testing and diagnostic delays.

Regarding the follow-up and surveillance for upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma, specifically concerning surveillance after nephroureterectomy, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend performing cystoscopy and voided urinary cytology at 3 months in patients with a previous history of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. If the results are negative, repeat cystoscopy and cytology every 3 months for a period of 2 years, then every 6 months until 5 years, and annually thereafter.

### Use of patient derived urine renal epithelial cells to confirm pathogenicity of PKHD1 alleles [^111EsNCv]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

The longest open reading frame of PKHD1 comprises at least 66 exons, but several lines of evidence indicate that PKHD1/Pkhd1 undergoes a complex pattern of alternative splicing. The functional meaning of PKHD1 splicing isoforms and whether these are translated into the corresponding proteins has not been definitively proven, and results of immunoblotting to detect protein isoforms have been inconsistent across different studies. Moreover, the multiple PKHD1 protein isoforms reported by immunoblot may be the result of post-translational processing of a single splicing isoform rather than translation of multiple splicing products.

Mutations have been reported across the entire length of the gene. Genotype-phenotype correlations have been proposed based on the type of PKHD1 mutations, with biallelic truncating mutations causing perinatal death and at least one hypomorphic missense mutation being necessary but not sufficient for survival. However, exceptions to this rule have been described.

It was proposed that PKHD1 alternative splicing may contribute to the definition of ARPKD patients' phenotype. Nonsense-mediated alternative splicing or basal exon skipping may lead to a circumvention of nonsense-mediated decay induced by truncating mutations, giving rise to unexpectedly mild phenotypes for patients carrying biallelic severe mutations. At the same time, missense or synonymous variants may affect the expression of specific isoforms, perhaps disrupting a critical stoichiometric and temporal balance between different protein products, which could result in severe phenotypes.

### Identification of HIV-1 genitourinary tract compartmentalization by analyzing the env gene sequences in urine [^117PYu8p]. AIDS (2015). Low credibility.

HIV-1 persists indefinitely in memory CD4 T cells and other long-lived cellular reservoirs despite antiretroviral therapy. Our group had previously demonstrated that HIV-1 can establish a productive infection in renal epithelial cells and that the kidney represents a separate compartment for HIV-1 replication. Here, to better understand the viruses in this unique site, we genetically characterized and compared the viruses in blood and urine specimens from 24 HIV-1 infected patients with detectable viremia.

- **Design and methods**: Blood and urine samples were obtained from 35 HIV-1 positive patients. Single-genome amplification was performed on HIV-1 env RNA and DNA isolated from urine supernatants and urine-derived cell pellets, respectively, as well as from plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell from the same individuals. Neighbor-joining trees were constructed under the Kimura 2-parameter model.

- **Results**: We amplified and sequenced the full-length HIV-1 envelope (env) gene from 12 of the 24 individuals, indicating that 50% of the viremic HIV-1-positive patients had viral RNA in their urine. Phylogenetic analysis of the env sequences from four individuals with more than 15 urine-derived env sequences showed that the majority of the sequences from urine formed distinct cluster(s) independent of those peripheral blood mononuclear cell and plasma-derived sequences, consistent with viral compartmentalization in the urine.

- **Conclusion**: Our results suggest the presence of a distinct HIV compartment in the genitourinary tract.

### Urine flow cytometry in older adults urinary tract infection diagnosis: is it time to reevaluate thresholds for men and women [^112a6o37]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

**Culture thresholds**: We aimed to evaluate Sysmex parameters to predict urine culture positivity (Fig. S2). Both a high UBC and a high U-WBC were associated with a positive urine culture (p > 0.99), squamous cells (p > 0.99), non-secretory cells (p > 0.99), and transitional cells (p > 0.99). The ROC curve AUC was above 0.8 for UBC (AUC = 0.923 [0.895–0.950]) and for U-WBC (AUC = 0.853 [0.819–0.888]) (Fig. 2 B). The AUC for UBC was significantly higher than the AUC for U-WBC (p < 0.001). The optimal threshold defined by the Youden index was 1176 bacteria/µL, giving a sensitivity of 79.17% [72.41–84.62], specificity of 95.83% [92.86–97.6], LR- of 0.22 [0.21–0.23], and LR+ of 19.0 [16.07–22.46]. No UBC threshold was able to achieve an LR- < 0.1.

### Urinary single-cell sequencing captures kidney injury and repair processes in human acute kidney injury [^1122TEv9]. Kidney International (2022). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major health issue, with outcomes primarily dependent on the damage and reparative processes of tubular epithelial cells. The mechanisms underlying AKI remain incompletely understood; specific therapies are lacking, and monitoring the course of AKI in clinical routines is confined to measuring urine output and plasma levels of filtration markers.

This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of a novel approach to assess the cellular and molecular dynamics of AKI by establishing a robust urine-to-single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) pipeline for excreted kidney cells via flow cytometry sorting. We analyzed 42,608 single-cell transcriptomes of 40 urine samples from 32 patients with AKI and compared our data with reference material from human AKI post-mortem biopsies and published mouse data.

- **Cellular insights**: We demonstrate that tubular epithelial cell transcriptomes mirror kidney pathology and reflect distinct injury and repair processes, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and tissue rearrangement. Additionally, we describe an AKI-specific abundant urinary excretion of adaptive progenitor-like cells.

Ultimately, single-cell transcriptomics of kidney cells excreted in urine provides noninvasive, unprecedented insight into the cellular processes underlying AKI. This opens novel opportunities for target identification, AKI sub-categorization, and monitoring the natural disease course and interventions.

### Urethral cancer [^116UzW4r]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on urethral cancer:

- **Definition**: Urethral cancer is a rare malignancy originating from the epithelial cells of the urethra, with histological types including SCC (squamous cell carcinoma), transitional cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathogenesis of urethral cancer involves the malignant transformation of urethral epithelial cells, often preceded by dysplastic changes. SCC is more common in the distal urethra, while transitional cell carcinoma typically arises in the proximal urethra. The tumor can invade adjacent tissues, including the bladder, vagina, or prostate.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of primary urethral carcinoma in the US is estimated at 4.3 per million in males and 1.5 per million in females, with a higher incidence observed in the elderly and African Americans.

- **Risk factors**: Chronic inflammation of the urethra, such as recurrent urinary tract infections (reUTIs) and urethral strictures, is a recognized risk factor for urethral cancer. HPV 16 infection, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and prolonged catheter use are also risk factors for urethral cancer.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of urethral cancer vary according to tumor location and size. Common symptoms include hematuria, urethral bleeding, dysuria, and obstructive symptoms. A palpable urethral mass, perineal pain, and discharge may also be present. Advanced disease can present with pelvic pain, weight loss, and symptoms related to metastasis.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of urethral cancer is generally poor, largely due to late diagnosis and high rates of local recurrence.

### Noninvasive biomarkers for lupus nephritis [^112WHu6F]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Urinary biomarkers for LN

Like blood, urine also contains a variety of components, such as epithelial cells, proteins, glucose, inorganic salts, and trace elements, which can be used as biomarkers for laboratory medicine. Arazi et al. used single-cell transcriptomics to analyze kidney and urine samples from LN patients and healthy individuals. Their findings revealed similarities in the molecular signatures of urine and kidney tissues, highlighting the superiority of urine samples in understanding kidney damage. Additionally, numerous studies have demonstrated that the phenotype and composition of urine cells are similar to those observed in renal biopsies, suggesting that the immune cells examined in urine originated from the kidney. Of note, urine collection is clinically very easy with few side effects; hence, it can be used to significantly improve the frequency of continuous monitoring in LN patients. Therefore, urine testing has the potential to serve as a surrogate for renal biopsy in assessing the extent of kidney damage and inflammation level.

### Effect of oxalate on the growth of renal tubular epithelial cells [^114ZpHHF]. Journal of Endourology (2002). Low credibility.

Until recently, oxalate was considered merely a major component of calcium oxalate stones, forming crystals in the lumen of the renal tubules. However, new evidence suggests that oxalate is not only a major constituent of calcium oxalate stones but also affects renal tubular epithelial cells, influencing the pathogenesis of nephrolithiasis. This study aimed to elucidate the effect of oxalate on the growth of renal tubular epithelial cells of different species and locations and to interpret the possible role of oxalate in the pathogenesis of urolithiasis.

- **Materials and methods**: Porcine proximal renal tubular epithelial cells (LLC-PK1) and canine distal renal tubular epithelial cells (MDCK) were incubated with different concentrations of oxalate. The effect of oxalate on the growth of the cells was assessed by the methylthiazoletetrazolium assay.

- **Results**: The growth of the renal tubular epithelial cells was inhibited with increasing concentrations of oxalate in both proximal and distal lines.

- **Conclusion**: Oxalate may cause stone formation by affecting the growth of renal tubular epithelial cells as well as by being a constituent of calcium oxalate stones.

In combination with clinical information, the accuracy of urine RBC counting could be improved, and the integrity of hematuria diagnosis could also be promoted simultaneously to achieve or approach the non-invasive diagnosis of CKD. This small sample size study might provide crucial support for the diagnosis and treatment of patients who are contraindicated for renal biopsy and likely guide and support clinical activities for primary health care institutes that do not qualify to perform renal biopsy.

### Decoy cells detected in the urine of a patient with complex karyotype myelodysplastic neoplasms who underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation: A case report [^115eTcfU]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

The presence of decoy cells in urine, particularly alongside other clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, may indicate a BK virus infection. When decoy cells are detected in urine, it may also indicate complications related to kidney transplantation, such as BK virus-associated nephropathy. According to previous studies, the presence of polyomavirus-infected cells (decoy cells) in urine is a valuable non-invasive screening method. Decoy cells detected in the urine sediment of immunocompromised patients are usually caused by uncontrolled replication of polyomaviruses in the upper urinary tract. This case report discusses a patient with myelodysplastic neoplasms who underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation and had decoy cells detected in their urine.

Today, urinalysis is one of the most common clinical tests ordered for adult and pediatric patients. Because urine specimens are usually readily available and are obtained noninvasively, urine testing is well suited for children. This article discusses the most common urine tests performed in children for screening purposes and also less common tests for the diagnosis of specific disorders. Special considerations regarding urine specimen collection in children are discussed. Some simple tests that are underused by clinicians are mentioned, as are some exciting new molecular applications of urine testing.

### Urothelial cells may indicate underlying bacteriuria in pregnancy at term: a comparative study [^117DoRJM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

The urinary tract undergoes various physiological adaptations during pregnancy. The effect of increased progesterone leads to ureteral dilatation, reduced ureteral tone, and an increased potential for glycosuria, which encourages microbial growth. These changes predispose pregnant women to infections, and 1–4% of women develop an acute bladder infection for the first time during pregnancy. If untreated, bacteria may ascend the renal tract causing pyelonephritis, a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality.

Dogma defines a urinary tract infection (UTI) as the presence and multiplication of microorganisms in one or more structures of the urinary tract with associated tissue invasion. This may present with symptoms, such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, and suprapubic pain, or be asymptomatic. The routine urine culture techniques are designed to favor the growth of common uropathogens. Threshold bacterial counts of ≥ 10⁵ total colony-forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) urine are used to discriminate between true infection and contamination of the urine sample by vulvo-vaginal organisms. At present, this method of diagnosing UTIs is standard practice in UK laboratories, despite evidence of insensitivity. The majority of urine cultures do not surpass diagnostic thresholds in routine practice.

Contamination occurs when bacteria from the skin surfaces get into the urine culture. By proxy, a urine sample is presumed to be contaminated if epithelial cells are detected. Historically, urethral catheterization has been the gold standard for urine collection as…

### A revalidation and critique of assumptions about urinary sample collection methods, specimen quality and contamination [^115bpiEa]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to measure contamination and substrate content for four different methods of obtaining urine samples. It also utilized the fact that urothelial cells can be distinguished from squamous epithelial cells by UP3 staining. This enabled measurement of contamination by the extra-urinary milieu compromising these various methods. The proportion of UP3-positive cells found in MSU samples was previously reported as 75% (Q1 = 68, Q3 = 78.5) by Horsley et al. This study had a similar outcome and has extended this to three other sample collection methods.

Taken together with a wide body of literature demonstrating that urothelial cell shedding is a common innate immune response to infection, this study suggests that the widely held assumption that epithelial cells in a urine sample indicate contamination might need to be revised. The sample collection method did influence the absolute epithelial cell counts. The lowest number was observed with CSU samples, and the greatest number with natural void, during which the bladder contracts and collapses to eliminate bladder urinary substrate. The Peezy device seemed to do what it claimed, achieving a sample of fewer cells and very few uroplakin-negative cells. However, the sediment trapped in the sponge valve of the Peezy device may, counter-intuitively, prove to be a richer substrate for microbiological investigation, as bacteria are known to adhere to and colonize the urothelial cells.

The rationale of midstream sampling has always been the avoidance of contamination.

### The clinical impact of urinalysis screened by automated microscopy compared to reference manual analysis [^112dQZxE]. American Journal of Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Clinical laboratories have transitioned from conventional manual urine microscopy to automated urinalysis; however, concerns persist regarding its validity in detecting specific elements of urinary sediment crucial for evaluating kidney diseases. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of urinary sediment analysis performed by a large hospital laboratory compared to a standardized microscopic review, focusing on patients both with and without kidney disease.

- **Methods**: Urine samples were randomly selected from routine laboratory specimens at a university hospital. Laboratory analysis was performed using LabUmat 2 and Urised 3 PRO equipment (Abbott Diagnostics). In the automated analysis for sediment examination, technicians have the option to reclassify urinary sediment elements as necessary and, if warranted, conduct manual microscopic evaluations to validate findings. The laboratory's analysis was compared with a "reference" analysis, which was double-blinded and conducted by two experienced technicians using bright-field and phase-contrast microscopy.

- **Results**: 503 samples were selected, with 52.3% originating from nephrology outpatient clinic patients. Overall agreement between the laboratory results and the reference analysis was 42.1%. The sensitivity (SN) of the laboratory examination for detecting pathological casts, lipiduria, and renal tubular epithelial cells was low (98%). However, for hyaline casts (SN: 50.4%; SP: 80.9%) and dysmorphic red blood cells (SN: 62.3%; SP: 96.2%), accuracy was intermediate.
