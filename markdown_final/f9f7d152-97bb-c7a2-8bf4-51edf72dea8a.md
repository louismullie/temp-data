## Question

Can oral allergy syndrome be caused by mango and broccoli if yes, to which pollen?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether oral allergy syndrome (OAS) can be caused by mango and broccoli, and if so, which pollen(s) are responsible. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of OAS/PFAS and the role of cross-reactive panallergens. Then, I should verify mango-specific cross-reactivity data and the implicated pollen sources. Next, I will examine broccoli-specific cross-reactivity and whether it fits established pollen–food patterns. After that, I should consider geographic and patient-specific modifiers that influence clinical relevance. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and outline diagnostic implications and counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism so I don't jump to conclusions: OAS/PFAS is typically a secondary IgE-mediated food allergy driven by cross-reactivity between inhalant pollen allergens and homologous proteins in plant foods, most often PR-10 proteins (e.g. Bet v 1), profilins, and occasionally lipid transfer proteins; symptoms are usually limited to the oropharynx because these proteins are heat- and acid-labile, though exceptions occur [^abcaa963] [^5827c32a] [^fcf9cf8a].

> Now, mango: I initially thought mango might be linked to birch pollen via PR-10 cross-reactivity, but wait, let me verify that. The clearest evidence shows mango cross-reactivity with mugwort (Artemisia) and birch pollens, with inhibition studies demonstrating shared epitopes related to Art v 1 and Bet v 1, supporting mugwort and birch as key pollen sources for mango-associated OAS; this aligns with broader weed–food cross-reactivity patterns described in mugwort-related syndromes [^5e6d6e2a] [^94fb1bf4].

> For broccoli, I need to check whether it fits established pollen–food clusters. Broccoli is a cruciferous vegetable that shares PR-10 homologs with birch pollen; birch-related OAS commonly involves raw fruits and vegetables such as apple, carrot, celery, and members of the Brassicaceae family, so broccoli fits within the birch–PR-10 cross-reactivity spectrum, particularly in patients with birch pollinosis [^6fa10187] [^2977dce9].

> Hold on, I should verify geographic and patient-level modifiers because clinical relevance varies. In regions with high mugwort exposure, mango-related OAS may be more prominent, whereas in areas with dominant birch, broccoli and other Brassicaceae are more likely triggers; moreover, individual sensitization profiles (PR-10 vs profilin vs LTP) and cofactors (e.g. NSAIDs, exercise, uncontrolled asthma, gastric acid suppression) can modulate severity, so I need to ensure counseling reflects both typical patterns and exceptions [^94fb1bf4] [^38feb494].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating: Yes, both mango and broccoli can cause OAS via cross-reactivity with pollen allergens. Mango is most strongly linked to mugwort and birch pollens, while broccoli is typically linked to birch pollen through PR-10 cross-reactivity; in both cases, reactions are usually to raw forms and are often mild and localized, though rare systemic reactions can occur depending on the allergen family involved and patient risk factors [^5e6d6e2a] [^6fa10187] [^abcaa963].

> Next, I should review diagnostic implications so the advice is practical. Diagnosis is primarily clinical in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and characteristic immediate oral symptoms to raw plant foods; if uncertainty remains, fresh-food skin prick testing (prick-to-prick) is preferred over commercial extracts, and targeted specific IgE to the implicated pollens can support the cross-reactivity pattern, while oral food challenges are reserved for inconclusive cases or when multiple foods are being avoided unnecessarily [^56389cc7] [^10c9486c] [^1db8e55f].

> I should double-check management counseling so it's aligned with guidelines: for patients with oral-only symptoms, avoidance of the culprit raw food is reasonable, and many can tolerate well-cooked forms because heat denatures PR-10 and profilin allergens; however, lighter cooking (steaming, stir-frying) may be insufficient for some proteins, and patients with systemic symptoms or risk factors should avoid the food strictly and carry epinephrine after shared decision-making; importantly, pollen immunotherapy is not indicated solely for PFAS, though it may be considered for coexisting respiratory allergy with counseling that food benefits are inconsistent [^94f76179] [^35b917e1] [^68ec461b].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise: mango-associated OAS reflects cross-reactivity with mugwort and birch pollens, whereas broccoli-associated OAS reflects birch pollen PR-10 cross-reactivity; both are classic examples of PFAS in which raw ingestion triggers oropharyngeal symptoms, and management should be individualized based on symptom severity, allergen profile, and patient risk factors [^5e6d6e2a] [^6fa10187] [^abcaa963].

Oral allergy syndrome (OAS) can be triggered by **mango and broccoli** in patients with pollen allergy, due to cross-reactivity between pollen allergens and plant food proteins. Mango is most often linked to **birch and mugwort pollen** via PR-10 proteins (e.g. Bet v 1, Art v 1) [^5e6d6e2a], while broccoli is associated with **birch pollen** through PR-10 homologs [^notfound]. Symptoms are typically mild, localized, and occur with raw forms; cooking usually denatures the allergens and prevents reactions [^94f76179]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by fresh-food skin testing or specific IgE, and management focuses on avoiding raw triggers and using antihistamines for mild symptoms [^10c9486c] [^eb3e1811].

---

## Pathophysiology of oral allergy syndrome

OAS is an **IgE-mediated hypersensitivity** driven by cross-reactivity between pollen allergens and homologous proteins in plant foods [^abcaa963]. The main cross-reactive protein families are:

- **PR-10 proteins**: Heat-labile, found in birch and mugwort pollens; homologs in fruits/vegetables (e.g. Mal d 1 in apple, Api g 1 in celery) [^d9e73740].
- **Profilins**: Pan-allergens in pollens and plant foods; often cause mild, local reactions [^28a60838].
- **Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs)**: Heat-stable, associated with systemic reactions in some regions [^e564e66e].

---

## Mango and oral allergy syndrome

Mango can cause OAS via cross-reactivity with **birch and mugwort pollen** [^5e6d6e2a]. The identified cross-reactive allergens include PR-10 homologs (e.g. Bet v 1, Art v 1) and profilins, with birch and mugwort as the primary pollen sources [^5e6d6e2a].

---

## Broccoli and oral allergy syndrome

Broccoli belongs to the Brassicaceae family and can trigger OAS in **birch-allergic patients** through PR-10 cross-reactivity [^notfound]. The clinical pattern mirrors other birch-related vegetables (e.g. carrot, celery) with localized oropharyngeal symptoms to raw forms [^6fa10187].

---

## Clinical symptoms and diagnostic approach

Typical OAS symptoms include pruritus, tingling, or swelling of the lips, tongue, palate, or throat within minutes of eating raw mango or broccoli; systemic symptoms are uncommon but can occur, especially with LTP sensitization or cofactors [^abcaa963] [^38feb494]. Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, supported by:

- **Fresh-food skin prick testing**: Higher sensitivity than commercial extracts [^10c9486c].
- **Specific IgE testing**: To birch and mugwort pollens and relevant food allergens [^bfdee650].
- **Oral food challenge**: Reserved for unclear cases or when multiple foods are avoided [^1db8e55f].

---

## Management strategies

Management centers on **avoidance of raw triggers** and patient education:

- **Avoid raw forms**: Cooked mango and broccoli are usually tolerated due to protein denaturation [^94f76179].
- **Antihistamines**: For mild oropharyngeal symptoms [^eb3e1811].
- **Epinephrine**: Consider for patients with systemic reactions or risk factors (e.g. asthma, LTP sensitization) [^eb3e1811].
- **Pollen immunotherapy**: May reduce pollen symptoms; effects on OAS are variable and not guaranteed [^8f30078c].

---

## Geographic and individual variability

The prevalence and severity of OAS to mango and broccoli vary by **geographic region**, pollen exposure, and individual sensitization profiles. Birch pollen predominance increases OAS risk in temperate regions, whereas mugwort-related OAS is more common in areas with high mugwort exposure [^573de095].

---

Mango and broccoli can trigger OAS in pollen-allergic patients, with mango linked to **birch and mugwort** and broccoli to **birch** via PR-10 cross-reactivity. Reactions are typically mild and localized to raw forms; diagnosis is clinical and supported by fresh-food testing, and management focuses on avoidance, cooking, and antihistamines, with epinephrine for systemic risk.

Objectives

To provide a review of the literature and discuss the clinical, pathophysiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic challenges of oral allergy syndrome (OAS).

Data Sources

English-language publications on OAS (and pollen-food allergy syndrome) were identified through MEDLINE and through the reference lists of each identified article and review.

Study Selection

Articles pertaining to OAS with respect to its varied clinical presentation, underlying pathophysiology, available and investigational diagnostic testing, and evidence-based treatment options were selected.

Results

OAS occurs in patients with a prior cross-reactive aeroallergen sensitization and clinically presents with initial oralpharyngeal symptoms after ingestion of a triggering fruit or vegetable. Although controversial, these symptoms may progress to systemic symptoms outside the gastrointestinal tract in 8.7% of patients and anaphylactic shock in 1.7%. OAS's underlying pathophysiology may play a role in clinical presentation and outcome, depending on whether the cross-reactive protein is a heat-labile PR-10 protein, a partially labile profilin, or a relatively heat-stable lipid transfer protein. Diagnostic testing is variable based on the underlying food tested, but fresh food skin prick test typically has the highest sensitivity. Treatment centers on avoidance and the consideration of self-injectable epinephrine. Because of its relationship with a cross-reactive aeroallergen sensitization, subcutaneous immunotherapy and sublingual immunotherapy have also been therapeutically tried with mixed results.

Conclusion

OAS is a challenging diagnosis to the practicing allergist because of its many clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic considerations. Understanding these challenges and their underlying mechanisms can facilitate a knowledgeable approach to treating an oral allergy patient.

Most patients with OAS benefit from cooking raw fruits and vegetables; patients with mild-to-moderate oral symptoms are advised to cook foods and continue ingesting cooked or baked forms of plant foods, as tolerated. However, if symptoms are more severe, progress in severity, or are associated with systemic symptoms, full dietary restriction of the causal food or foods is warranted. Patients with a history of laryngeal swelling or respiratory compromise should avoid raw foods strictly and be prescribed an epinephrine autoinjector.

Pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS) — dietary avoidance and food-processing recommendations (Statements 5–9) specify that individuals with PFAS limited to oral symptoms may choose to avoid only the raw forms of the responsible fruit/vegetable, and patients with PFAS limited to oral symptoms may choose to continue to ingest the responsible fruit and vegetable if well-cooked but are cautioned that roasting may not eliminate the risk of reaction with nuts. Lighter cooking methods (eg, steaming or stir-frying) may be insufficient to fully denature the allergens relevant to PFAS, and patients should be educated on the higher allergen content in the peels and seeds of fruits but cautioned that peeling and removing the seeds are usually insufficient means for preventing symptoms of PFAS. Patients with PFAS characterized by systemic reactions (ie, symptoms extending beyond the oropharynx) should strictly avoid the responsible fruits and vegetables.

### Evaluation of food-pollen cross-reactivity by nose-mouth cross-challenge in pollinosis with oral allergy syndrome [^d6d3bc70]. Allergy (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Oral allergy syndrome (OAS) is often associated with pollen-induced rhinitis, and there are preferential associations between causative substances. If OAS and rhinitis are both immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated and there are cross-reacting proteins, it is expected that similar reactions can be elicited in the nose and mouth. In order to test this hypothesis we performed a series of 'cross-challenges' with foods and pollens in both the nose and the mouth.

Methods

Nine patients with ascertained OAS due to vegetables and rhinitis due to pollens were studied. On the first day a nasal challenge with pollen extracts and an oral challenge with fresh food was carried out. After a week, washout nasal challenge with food and an oral challenge with pollens were performed. Immediate symptoms, mucosal tryptase and soluble eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) were assessed after each challenge.

Results

The administration of pollen into the nose and food into the mouth elicited symptoms as expected, but the cross-challenge had no clinical effect. In parallel, tryptase and ECP increased after nasal challenge with pollens, whereas foods did not elicit a measurable response.

Conclusion

The cross-reactivity between foods and pollens, when evaluated at the shock organ, was not clinically evident. This data can be explained with a low concentration of cross-reagent epitopes in pollen extracts and food homogenized because of degradation. The different behaviour upon challenge suggests that different immunological mechanisms may act in the nose and mouth.

### Food contact hypersensitivity syndrome: the mucosal contact urticaria paradigm [^c45ee0d4]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Oral allergy syndrome (OAS) or pollen-fruit allergy syndrome represents a mucosal allergic contact urticaria in people sensitized to common pollens, due to IgE cross-reactivity between homologous pollen allergens and various plant foods. It is the most prevalent food allergy, affecting millions of people with respiratory allergies. Usually, symptoms are mild, self-limiting and localized to the oropharyngeal mucosa, although they may sometimes become generalized and life-threatening. Although patients usually recognize the offending foods, diagnosis may sometimes be complicated. Several clinical syndromes and association between pollens and plant-derived foods have been described. Crossreactivity on the basis of stringent immunological and allergological criteria can also occur in people without pollen sensitization or concomitant respiratory allergies, as in latex-fruit syndrome. The term 'food contact hypersensitivity syndrome' (FCHS) is proposed in this paper for the first time, to include all mucosal hypersensitivity reactions presenting with contact to food (both immunological and nonimmunological), whether due to crossreactivity with homologous plant-derived allergens or not. At this time, prophylaxis and treatment can only be attained by avoidance, even when symptoms are mild, with consequent impairment in quality of life. A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of FCHS and food allergy in general is essential for deeper insights and future emergence of effective therapies.

### Position paper of the EAACI: food allergy due to immunological cross-reactions with common inhalant allergens [^c05142a0]. Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

In older children, adolescents, and adults, a substantial part of all IgE-mediated food allergies is caused by cross-reacting allergenic structures shared by inhalants and foods. IgE stimulated by a cross-reactive inhalant allergen can result in diverse patterns of allergic reactions to various foods. Local, mild, or severe systemic reactions may occur already after the first consumption of a food containing a cross-reactive allergen. In clinical practice, clinically relevant sensitizations are elucidated by skin prick testing or by the determination of specific IgE in vitro. Component-resolved diagnosis may help to reach a diagnosis and may predict the risk of a systemic reaction. Allergy needs to be confirmed in cases of unclear history by oral challenge tests. The therapeutic potential of allergen immunotherapy with inhalant allergens in pollen-related food allergy is not clear, and more placebo-controlled studies are needed. As we are facing an increasing incidence of pollen allergies, a shift in sensitization patterns and changes in nutritional habits, and the occurrence of new, so far unknown allergies due to cross-reactions are expected.

Pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS) management algorithm (OAS, Oral allergy syndrome) outlines an approach beginning with "History suggestive of PFAS and supported by diagnostic testing", then branching to "Limited to oropharynx" or systemic involvement. For limited oropharyngeal symptoms, the steps are: "Counsel patients about the mechanistic basis of PFAS, the usual benign self-limited nature of OAS, and the option of treating mild symptoms with oral nonsedating antihistamines"; "Counsel patients to avoid the culprit raw fruit or vegetable"; "Counsel patients about the rare chance of systemic reaction and its recognition and treatment"; "Counsel patients that less thorough cooking techniques (e.g., stir-frying), and that roasting may not completely denature the allergenic proteins"; "Counsel patients that excessive ingestion as with soy milk or fresh smoothies may result in a more severe reaction"; and "Counsel patients about risk factors associated with more severe reactions and consider EAI prescription for these patients after shared decision-making". For systemic reactions, the algorithm directs "Strict avoidance of the culprit food", to "offer EAI prescription", and to "Identify and mitigate risk factors for systemic reactions".

### Pollen food allergy syndrome (PFAS): a review of current available literature [^7dabce15]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pollen food allergy syndrome (PFAS) is a complex syndrome posing a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Our objective was to summarize the available literature regarding its prevalence, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment.

Data Sources

A PubMed search was performed to include English language articles with the following search terms: pollen food syndrome, pollen food allergy syndrome, PFAS, oral allergy syndrome, OAS, food anaphylaxis, food components.

Study Selections

Human articles discussing PFAS.

Results

Varying reports have been made of the prevalence of PFAS, ranging from 4.7% to greater than 20% in children and 13% to 58% in adults. Prevalence varies widely by geographic region. PFAS is typically the results of class II food allergens (e.g. sensitized to anaeroallergen, but reaction occurs due to cross reactivity from a food allergen). Commonly these reactions are limited to the oropharynx due to the lability of the proteins causing the reaction. As multiple families of proteins with varying stability cause PFAS, severe systemic reactions are also possible, as anaphylactic shock has been documented in up to 1.7% of reactions.

Conclusion

Pollen food allergy syndrome therefore cannot be dismissed as a benign food allergy, but it needs to be approached individually based on known risk factors.

### Cross-reactive aeroallergens: which need to cross our mind in food allergy diagnosis? [^b9fec299]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Secondary food allergies due to cross-reactivity between inhalant and food allergens are a significant and increasing global health issue. Cross-reactive food allergies predominantly involve plant-derived foods resulting from a prior sensitization to cross-reactive components present in pollen (grass, tree, weeds) and natural rubber latex. Also, primary sensitization to allergens present in fungi, insects, and both nonmammalian and mammalian meat might induce cross-reactive food allergic syndromes. Correct diagnosis of these associated food allergies is not always straightforward and can pose a difficult challenge. As a matter of fact, cross-reactive allergens might hamper food allergy diagnosis, as they can cause clinically irrelevant positive tests to cross-reacting foods that are safely consumed. This review summarizes the most relevant cross-reactivity syndromes between inhalant and food allergens. Particular focus is paid to the potential and limitations of confirmatory testing such as skin testing, specific IgE assays, molecular diagnosis, and basophil activation test.

### Diagnosis and management of pollen food allergy syndrome to nuts [^1f8d89e0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Oral allergy syndrome or pollen food allergy syndrome (PFAS) represents a common clinical conundrum when the reported trigger food is a tree nut (usually almond or hazelnut) or peanut. The PFAS may give rise to uncertainty about the potential severity of the future reactions, indications for prescribing epinephrine, and the extent of the necessary dietary avoidance. As a food allergy, secondary to cross-reactivity with airborne pollen, PFAS usually manifests toward the end of the first decade of life as contact urticaria of the oropharyngeal mucous membranes. Molecular allergology facilitates diagnosis and risk stratification by establishing the profile of sensitization. Exclusive sensitization to pathogenesis-related proteins family 10 (PR10) and profilins indicates that signs and symptoms are due to PFAS, whereas sensitization to seed storage proteins with or without sensitization to PR10 and profilins may indicate a more severe primary nut allergy phenotype. Management relies on avoidance of the specific nut trigger, advice on the likelihood of more severe local or systemic symptoms, and treatment of reactions according to the severity. Future studies are needed to better delineate the risk of systemic reactions in individuals with nut PFAS and to establish the role of food or pollen allergen immunotherapy for the prevention or moderation of this condition.

Background

There is no consensus on the diagnosis and therapy of oral allergy syndrome (OAS; also known as pollen-food allergy syndrome), a disorder caused by IgE antibody-mediated reactions to homologous proteins in pollens and fruits and vegetables.

Objective

We sought to determine how practicing allergists define and treat OAS.

Methods

A questionnaire was mailed to 226 randomly selected US allergists from the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology directory.

Results

One hundred twenty-two (54%) returned surveys were analyzed. Median estimates of the prevalence of OAS among the patients with pollen allergy were 5% among children and 8% among adults. Twenty percent of allergists reported that some patients progressed to systemic symptoms. Fifty-three percent of allergists recommended complete avoidance of causal foods to all patients, whereas 9% did not advocate any restrictions. Thirty percent never prescribed epinephrine for OAS, 3% always did, and the remainder did so on the basis of symptoms. When presented with clinical cases, 20% diagnosed systemic reactions to peach as OAS, 13% believed peanut could cause OAS, and 25% did not prescribe epinephrine for peanut allergy manifested by oral symptoms.

Conclusion

Allergists' estimates of the prevalence of OAS in patients with pollen allergy (5%-8%) are lower than the prevalence reported (approximately 50%) in the published studies of these patients, perhaps reflecting a low index of suspicion, underdiagnosis, or both. The wide range of responses regarding diagnosis and management indicates the need for a better definition for the disorder and standard therapeutic guidelines. Discrepancies might be related to the term OAS, and therefore use of the more specific term "pollen-food allergy syndrome" is suggested.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for pollen-food allergy syndrome, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, BSACI 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that PFAS is a food allergy frequently affecting pollen-sensitized patients usually with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis and is characterized by immediate-onset, mild-to-moderate oropharyngeal symptoms to plant foods, but only when raw.

### Food allergies: the basics [^2977dce9]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Induction of atopic dermatitis by food allergens has been shown to require not only Th2 cells (and Th2 cytokines such as IL4, IL13, and IL5 — a cytokine that activates eosinophils), but also Th1 cells, which mediated delayed allergic inflammation. Interferon-γ, secreted by allergen-specific Th1 cells, was shown to induce epithelial damage in a model of respiratory allergy.

The immediate- and delayed-type allergic inflammation that occurs during IgE-associated food allergy has been studied extensively in patients with oral allergy syndrome (OAS) (Supplementary Table 1). OAS is caused by sensitization to respiratory allergens that structurally are similar to allergens in foods, leading to a cross-reactive immune response. The most common form of OAS develops with sensitization to the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1. In patients with this form of OAS, the immune response cross-reacts with allergens in plant-derived food such as apples, nuts, carrots, and celery. This leads to local allergy symptoms of the immediate type (local itching and swelling of the lips or tongue), caused by IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation. However, Bet v 1–related plant food allergens are digested by the gastrointestinal tract, therefore systemic reactions occur only in exceptional cases (such as after consumption of large amounts of the plant food allergens during exercise), and anaphylactic shock does not occur. Likewise, cooking destroys IgEs, but leaves peptides recognized by allergen-specific T cells intact. Ingestion of Bet v 1–related plant food allergens therefore can activate allergen-specific T cells by IgE-independent mechanisms, and induce late-phase and chronic allergic inflammation to cause disorders such as atopic dermatitis in sensitized patients.

Information on the time until onset of allergic reactions after food allergen intake (minutes–hours vs hours–days) and allergy phenotype (eg, urticaria vs atopic dermatitis) can help to determine whether the symptoms involve immediate IgE-mediated mast cell or basophil activation, or late-phase or chronic allergic inflammation caused by T-cell or eosinophil activation. Then, it is possible to select the most appropriate therapy. For example, immediate reactions would be treated with antihistamines, antileukotrienes, epinephrine, mast cell stabilizers, or anti-IgE, whereas late-phase chronic inflammation would be treated with steroids or anti-IL5.

### An international Delphi consensus on the management of pollen-food allergy syndrome: a Work group report of the AAAAI adverse reactions to foods committee [^1e8f9498]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS) is common among patients with allergic rhinitis. Treatment recommendations for patients with PFAS remain variable.

Objective

To develop consensus recommendation statements for managing patients with PFAS.

Methods

An international panel of allergists, researchers, and nutritionists with an interest in PFAS from 25 different institutions across 11 countries convened and a list of statements was written by 3 authors. The RAND/University of California Los Angeles methodology was adopted to establish consensus on the statements.

Results

After 2 Delphi rounds, a consensus was reached on 14 statements. The panel agreed that patients with PFAS would benefit from counseling on the nature and basis of PFAS and the rare chance of more severe systemic reactions and their recognition. The panel agreed on avoiding the raw food responsible for the index reaction, but not potentially cross-reactive fruits/vegetables based on the responsible food of the index reaction. Epinephrine autoinjectors should be recommended for patients with PFAS who experienced severe symptoms (beyond the oropharynx) or for patients considered at risk for severe reactions. The panel agreed that the benefit of allergen immunotherapy remains unclear and that PFAS should not be considered the primary indication for such intervention.

Conclusions

We developed consensus statements regarding counselling patients about the nature and severity of PFAS, potential risk factors, dietary avoidance, epinephrine autoinjector prescription, and allergen immunotherapy consideration for patients with PFAS.

### The impact of pollen-related food allergens on pollen allergy [^6ce13d77]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with birch pollen allergy frequently develop hypersensitivity reactions to certain foods, e.g. apples, celery, carrots and hazelnuts. These reactions are mainly caused by IgE-antibodies specific for the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1, which cross-react with homologous proteins in these foods. Analyzing the T-cell response to Bet v 1-related food allergens revealed that these dietary proteins contain several distinct T-cell epitopes and activate Bet v 1-specific T cells to proliferate and produce cytokines. Several of these cross-reactive T-cell epitopes were not destroyed by simulated gastrointestinal digestion of food allergens and stimulated Bet v 1-specific T cells despite nonreactivity with IgE antibodies. Similarly, cooked food allergens did not elicit IgE-mediated symptoms (oral allergy syndromes) but caused T-cell-mediated late-phase reactions (deterioration of atopic eczema) in birch pollen-allergic patients with atopic dermatitis because thermal processing affected their conformational structure and not the primary amino acid sequence. Thus, T-cell cross-reactivity between Bet v 1 and related food allergens occurs independently of IgE-cross-reactivity in vitro and in vivo. We speculate that symptom-free consumption of pollen-related food allergens may have implications for the pollen-specific immune response of allergic individuals.

AAAAI pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS) management — Round 2 Delphi appropriateness: Individuals with PFAS may benefit from education about the mechanistic basis of their PFAS (Appropriateness, median 9; DI 0). Reactions in PFAS are mostly benign and limited to the oropharynx, although, rarely, more severe symptoms may occur (9; DI 0.050). Certain foods associated with PFAS (nuts, soy milk, smoothies/fresh juices), especially if consumed rapidly or in large amounts, might rarely trigger systemic symptoms (9; DI 0.132). Individuals with PFAS limited to oral symptoms may choose to avoid only the raw forms of the responsible fruit/vegetable (9; DI 0.132), and may choose to continue to ingest the responsible fruit and vegetable if well-cooked but are cautioned that roasting may not eliminate the risk of reaction with nuts (9; DI 0.132). Lighter cooking methods (eg, steaming or stir-frying) may be insufficient to fully denature the allergens relevant to PFAS (8; DI 0.132), and patients should be educated on the higher allergen contents in the peels and seeds of fruits but are cautioned peeling and removing the seeds is usually insufficient to prevent symptoms of PFAS (9; DI 0.132). Patients with PFAS characterized by systemic reactions (ie, symptoms extending beyond the oropharynx) should strictly avoid the responsible fruits and vegetables (9; DI 0.132). Mild symptoms of PFAS limited to oropharynx often resolve without treatment; a nonsedating antihistamine can be used for uncomfortable symptoms (9; DI 0). PFAS with a history of systemic reaction may be at a higher risk for future severe reactions, and an emergency treatment plan and a prescription of EAI should be offered (9; DI 0). Pollen AIT via subcutaneous or sublingual route is not proven to alleviate symptoms of PFAS and PFAS is not an indication for pollen AIT (9; DI 0.132).

Regarding screening and diagnosis for pollen-food allergy syndrome, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, BSACI 2022 guidelines recommend to distinguish PFAS from a primary allergy to peanuts, tree nuts or fruit, or an allergy to non-specific lipid transfer proteins, highly cross-reactive proteins present in most plant foods, because of the significant differences in management.

### Real-life evaluation of molecular multiplex IgE test methods in the diagnosis of pollen associated food allergy [^28a60838]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Molecular IgE test methods have substantially advanced allergy diagnostics. Continuous evaluation of patients' sensitization profiles contribute to our mechanistic understanding of allergies and the characterization of major allergens. Molecular IgE tests are an essential support for decision making of allergy immunotherapy (AIT) for IgE‐mediated allergies and for choosing the right AIT preparation. In food allergy, identification of specific IgE (sIgE)‐sensitization pattern combined with the interpretation of the patients' history is essential for the management and guidance of patients. This information allows tailored recommendations regarding symptom severity based on the recognized allergen molecule.

As commonly recommended, determination of sIgE is performed after detailed recording of clinical history and skin prick test (SPT) with culprit food. If SPT is not possible, for example in patients with active atopic dermatitis, the "from molecules to clinic"‐concept is preferable. In multiplex testing, various allergens are tested simultaneously to provide clear sensitization profiles, which can predict potential reactions to foods, as well as possible cross‐reactivity to homolog molecules. Food allergy is associated with a multitude of different symptoms, including anaphylaxis. Especially patients with anaphylactic reactions experience a substantial health burden, due to the severity of reactions. These patients might particularly benefit from early diagnosis and correct recommendations regarding restrictive diet. Besides primary food allergy toward, for example, peanuts, tree nuts, and seafood, the pollen food syndrome (PFS) affects a large number of patients suffering from food adverse reactions due to cross‐reactivity with airborne allergens. The estimated worldwide prevalence of PFS is 9.4%–35%. The main clinical presentation is limited to local reactions in the oral cavity, such as itching and swelling of lips, oral mucosa, and tongue, in total known as the oral allergy syndrome (OAS), but reactions might also involve the gastrointestinal tract, and systemic symptoms may develop on skin, in the respiratory system, and in rare cases, the cardiovascular system, up to anaphylactic shock reactions. Thus, a comprehensive diagnostic work‐up of PFS patients is essential.PFS‐triggering allergens are mainly pan‐allergens. These molecules are characterized by recognition of cross‐reactive IgE due to amino‐acid overlaps and similarities of the three‐dimensional protein structure. Among the allergens found in a large variety of different allergen sources, pathogenesis related (PR)‐10 proteins and profilins found in most plants play a special role in PFS. Bet v 1 from birch is one of the best studied PR‐10 proteins and homologous proteins, such as Mal d 1 from apple are termed Bet v 1‐homologs. Ten to twenty percent of patients with pollen allergy show reactivity to profilins. The profilin in latex (Hev b 8) shows high homology to many other plant profilin proteins, such as Bet v 2 in birch and Cuc m 2 in melon. Thus, testing of Hev b 8‐sIgE can be used for diagnosis of profilin sensitization. Due to the high variability in the patients' sIgE repertoire, it is not possible to predict the cross‐reactivity pattern with food allergens from pollen allergy diagnosis. Therefore, multiplex testing might be specifically of benefit to PFS patients. Moreover, multiplex testing might also implement precision medicine in AIT, as the AIT preparation can be specifically chosen based on the allergen patterns recognized by the patient as tested by multiplex molecular IgE tests, given that information regarding the specific AIT composition is available. ImmunoCAP ISAC (ISAC) and Allergy Explorer, version 2 (ALEX 2), are two molecular tests used for determining sIgE levels. ISAC has been licensed for medical diagnostics in 2011. Most of the allergens are produced recombinantly and 38% of the allergens are purified, natural allergens. For control purpose, cross‐reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCDs)‐containing proteins are spotted on the chip. The ALEX 2 multiplex test was licensed in 2018. ALEX 2 not only determines total IgE reactivity, but also sIgE reactivity to allergen components and to allergen extracts. In regards to the source of allergen molecules, 77% of the allergens are recombinantly produced and 23% are natural allergens. During the sample preparation, IgE antibodies specific for CCDs are removed from the serum. The presence of whole food extracts and the high number of food proteins are an advantage of ALEX 2 when it comes to food allergy diagnosis.

### Optimal management of allergic rhinitis [^65e652af]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

In children, rhinitis may present via associated comorbidities (table 1) depending on the child's age. Nasal obstruction with chronic mouth breathing can sometimes be the only presenting symptom in small children: adenoidal hypertrophy and recurrent viral colds are frequent misdiagnoses. Adenoidal hypertrophy with or without sleep apnoea can, in fact, be associated with AR, and in some studies, a response to AR treatment has been noted with an improvement in sleep or hypoxia. Adenoidectomy has not been reported as improving AR, although it may have a role in treating chronic paediatric rhinosinusitis. Otitis media with effusion and Eustachian tube dysfunction can be detected in children with AR. In recent years, oral allergy syndrome (OAS), also known as pollen fruit syndrome, has more often been reported by patients suffering with pollen-induced AR, although the paediatric prevalence of this problem is uncertain. The history of oral pruritus and/or local angioedema in response to fresh fruits and vegetables, for example, apples, hazelnuts, carrots, celery and peanuts, in children with seasonal AR can be misdiagnosed as a primary food allergy (FA). In fact, the initial sensitisation is to pollen, with subsequent cross-reactivity to identical molecules in fruits and vegetables. In doubtful cases, molecular allergy diagnosis may help to distinguish OAS from FA.

### Reaction phenotypes in IgE-mediated food allergy and anaphylaxis [^cca9c73a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Primary IgE-Mediated Food Allergy vs Pollen Food Allergy Syndrome

Primary food allergy results from primary sensitization to a food allergen. In contrast, secondary food allergy, also known as pollen food allergy syndrome (PFAS), refers to where the primary sensitization is to aeroallergens, with symptoms occurring because of exposure to cross-reactive allergens in food. Patients with PFAS experience oropharyngeal symptoms of itching or tingling with or without mild lip swelling after ingestion of specific fresh fruit or vegetable. The term oral allergy syndrome (OAS) is often used interchangeably with PFAS, but is a more general term describing any oropharyngeal symptoms that occur as part of an allergic reactionand will often progress to systemic symptoms, including anaphylaxis (ie, OAS occurs in both PFAS and primary food allergy). Indeed, more than 50% of patients described by Amlot et alin the first case series of OAS later experienced systemic symptoms and anaphylaxis.

Drawing a distinction between primary and secondary food allergy is vital in both risk stratification and management advicebut may be tricky because patients will often have a mix of both primary food allergy and PFAS to different allergens, whereas others may even demonstrate a pattern of sensitization consistent with primary allergy and PFAS to the same allergen (eg, IgE positivity to both Ara h 2 and Ara h 8 for peanut or Cor a 1 and Cor a 8 for hazelnut). PFAS is usually considered to be a relatively benign condition in which systemic symptoms are rare because of lability of the causative allergens, such as Bet v 1 homologues and profilins. However, approximately 10% of PFAS presentations are associated with systemic symptoms and 1% to 2% with anaphylaxis. It is not clear why some patients experience more significant symptoms and whether this is due to polysensitization to more stable allergens, such as lipid transfer proteinsor diagnostic misclassification. Component resolved diagnostics have improved our ability to discriminate between PFAS and primary food allergy but are only of limited use in identifying patients with PFAS at risk of severe systemic reactions. Whether prescription of epinephrine autoinjector devices is indicated in patients with PFAS remains unclear.

### Prevalence survey on oral allergy syndrome in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis in yamanashi, Japan [^b902121a]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Oral allergy syndrome (OAS) is induced in some patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (sAR) due to specific IgE antibodies against cross‐reactive components in fresh plant foods and pollen allergenic proteins. In Japan, sAR prevalence has increased remarkably; however, the risk of OAS co‐incidence in these patients remains inconclusive. This study aimed to investigate recent trends in OAS prevalence in sAR patients, and the association between disease duration and symptom severity of sAR.

Prevalence surveys were conducted using questionnaires (Table S1), and responses were obtained from 2129, 3638, and 5547 patients with sAR symptoms who visited the otorhinolaryngology outpatient clinics in 13 general hospitals and seven ENT clinics in Yamanashi Prefecture (the region with the highest sAR prevalence caused by pollens in Japan) in 2002, 2013, and 2021, respectively. sAR patients who experienced itching, burning, swelling, or blistering of oral area while eating were defined as having sAR complicated with OAS.

### Prevalence and sensitization of pollen-food allergy syndrome among adolescents in tokyo [^05449347]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Pollen–food allergy syndrome (PFAS), also known as oral allergy syndrome (OAS), is an IgE-mediated allergic reaction that occurs in individuals with pollen allergies when they consume certain plant-derived foods.PFAS is characterized by symptoms primarily affecting the oropharynx, such as itching and swelling, and in some cases, it can lead to systemic reactions such as anaphylaxis. The prevalence of PFAS varies geographically and demographically, influenced by regional pollen types and dietary habits. Pan-allergens, such as profilins, PR-10 proteins, and lipid transfer proteins, are responsible for the cross-reactivity in PFAS. These proteins are found in both pollens and plant-derived foods.

The prevalence of allergic rhinitis has been increasing in multiple regions worldwide. In a previous study, we observed that the prevalence allergic rhinitis increased from approximately 11% at age 5 to approximately 31% by age 9 in Japan. In another study, the prevalence at age 13 was 68.8%, suggesting a continued upward trend. Cry j 1, a major allergen derived from Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) pollen, plays a crucial role in cedar pollen–induced allergic rhinitis in Japan. Given that the prevalence of allergic rhinitis, including sensitization to pollens, generally increases with age, the incidence of PFAS may also increase accordingly. We previously reported that the prevalence of PFAS among adolescents aged 13 years in the general population was approximately 10%. To our knowledge, no epidemiologic studies have assessed temporal changes in PFAS prevalence within the general population in Japan, particularly among 17-year-old adolescents. This study aimed to examine whether there were any changes in PFAS prevalence over a follow-up period of 5 years.

3 GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATIONS

Table 1 summarises the recommendations about the management of IgE‐mediated food allergy, which are presented and discussed below.

TABLE 1
Recommendations about the management of IgE‐mediated food allergy.

3.1 Dietary management

3.1.1 Recommendation 1

In patients with confirmed IgE‐mediated food allergy, avoidance of the food (or form of the food) to which the patient is allergic is recommended.

Reason for recommendation

The complete avoidance of a known trigger food is the only option for many individuals with a confirmed IgE‐mediated food allergy to one or more foods. However, for food allergies such as pollen‐food syndrome, where it is known that cooked or processed versions of the food may be tolerated, then individuals may be able to only avoid the raw or unprocessed version of the trigger food. This is also true for children allergic to cow's milk or hen's egg where baked forms of the food can be tolerated even whilst still reacting to the fresh or raw form of the food. For other foods, however, processing can increase allergenicity (e.g. roasting of nuts and seeds).

Strength of recommendation

The evidence base is low as there have been no RCTs evaluating and comparing outcomes for patients with a food allergy who continue to eat the small amounts or an altered form of the food (e.g. baked) and those who completely avoid it — clinical trials are underway. However, the panel formulated a strong recommendation, placing a high value on the risk of a severe allergic reaction upon exposure to food that can be fatal.

Practical implications

Avoidance of a food can be problematic especially if the food is a staple food in the local diet or is a common ingredient (e.g. egg). Accidental exposure and reactions to trigger foods are common occurrences in individuals with food allergy. For this reason, all those with confirmed IgE‐mediated food allergy should receive age‐appropriate oral or written advice which is specific to the known food trigger(s), outlining which foods need to be avoided. In addition, major allergens (or the risk of cross‐contamination) should always be highlighted on the label by the producer or in the menu for non‐prepacked food.

### Food allergy from infancy through adulthood [^cb54f15c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Food allergies are the result of immune responses that cause adverse reactions to foods. Immune responses to foods may produce a spectrum of symptoms and disorders, including acute allergic reactions and anaphylaxis, food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis, and oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome). Food-allergic responses also contribute to chronic inflammatory disorders such as eosinophilic esophagitis and atopic dermatitis. Although food allergy affects people from infancy through adulthood, there are allergic features that differ according to age (ie, presentation, triggers, and natural course) and have important implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and management. New food allergies can develop at any age, and we propose similarities in the etiology of de novo food allergy whether in infancy or adulthood. The approach to managing food allergy changes dramatically over the life course, and physicians and patients must respond accordingly to optimize care. Food allergy therapies are emerging, and the efficacy and safety of these interventions could differ by age group of those treated. In this review, we highlight interesting observations on the etiology and characteristics of food allergy presenting at different ages and discuss clinical management as it relates to life stage.

### Oral allergy syndrome (OAS): a pilot study to evaluate… [^29111478]. ClinicalTrials (2007). Low credibility.

Study Overview An increasing number of people have an allergy to birch pollen, which manifests itself as Springtime hayfever. Some will also have cross-reactions to fruits, vegetables and nuts, a condition known as Oral Allergy Syndrome. Research has demonstrated that the most effective method of diagnosing this problem is by taking a good clinical history and performing skin prick tests using fresh foods. The aim of the study will be therefore to investigate the prevalence of OAS in a birch-sensitive population using a simple screening tool and establish the range of foods involved. The objective will be to maximise effective treatment for the patients in our large respiratory allergy clinic by using the screening tool to identify patients with OAS and advise them on the usual foods involved. A further objective will be to use the data to discover if there are any patterns of particular foods involved in OAS in UK sufferers.

The study hypotheses are therefore that there is a high prevalence of oral allergy in people with birch pollen allergy; the best way of diagnosing the problem is by using a screening tool and that there is a core set of foods that are commonly involved in OAS in patients seen in the allergy clinic. Patients will be recruited both prospectively and retrospectively from the Royal Brompton Hospital allergy clinic and through advertisement. Subjects will be identified by diagnosis of birch pollen allergy, either routinely in the RBHT adult allergy clinic or by looking back at patient records. Suitable patients will be invited to participate in the study, with fully informed consent obtained, if they understand written English and fulfil the following criteria:

The patient will then be asked whether they have taken anti-histamines in the last 72 hours, and if they have not then prick prick tests can be performed using a range of different fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts and Birch and Grass reagent. The tests will be undertaken according to EAACI recommendations, with a positive and negative control. The allergen content of fresh foods is unknown, but using data from previous studies, a wheal of 3mm will be considered positive, and a wheal of 5 mm strongly positive. Participation Criteria For general information about clinical research, read Learn About Studies. Inclusion Criteria:

- History of Springtime hayfever
- Positive skin prick test to Birch
- FEV1 > than 70% predicted or greater than 1. 5L
- Aged 16 years or more.

### Food-induced anaphylaxis and oral allergy syndrome… [^970dd9e2]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: A 16-year-old boy presents to the allergy clinic with complaints of perioral itching and tingling after handling apples at his father's fruit stall. He had experienced such symptoms on previous occasions, but this time he has developed mild lip swelling and tongue itching, as well. He has a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis that is controlled by nasal steroid spray. His father is concerned that the reaction might be due to pesticides. A skin prick test with fresh apples gives a positive response that confirms the clinical diagnosis of oral allergy syndrome. Food allergies are an increasingly common problem faced by pediatricians. Food allergy is defined as an immune-mediated adverse reaction to foods causing symptoms affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or respiratory system. The reactions can be immune globulin E -mediated and nonIgE-mediated processes. Currently, food allergies affect 2%.

### Oral allergy syndrome (OAS): a pilot study to evaluate a clinical… [^1ceeaddd]. ClinicalTrials (2007). Low credibility.

Study Overview An increasing number of people have an allergy to birch pollen, which manifests itself as Springtime hayfever. Some will also have cross-reactions to fruits, vegetables and nuts, a condition known as Oral Allergy Syndrome. Research has demonstrated that the most effective method of diagnosing this problem is by taking a good clinical history and performing skin prick tests using fresh foods. The aim of the study will be therefore to investigate the prevalence of OAS in a birch-sensitive population using a simple screening tool and establish the range of foods involved. The objective will be to maximise effective treatment for the patients in our large respiratory allergy clinic by using the screening tool to identify patients with OAS and advise them on the usual foods involved. A further objective will be to use the data to discover if there are any patterns of particular foods involved in OAS in UK sufferers.

The study hypotheses are therefore that there is a high prevalence of oral allergy in people with birch pollen allergy; the best way of diagnosing the problem is by using a screening tool and that there is a core set of foods that are commonly involved in OAS in patients seen in the allergy clinic. Patients will be recruited both prospectively and retrospectively from the Royal Brompton Hospital allergy clinic and through advertisement. Subjects will be identified by diagnosis of birch pollen allergy, either routinely in the RBHT adult allergy clinic or by looking back at patient records. Suitable patients will be invited to participate in the study, with fully informed consent obtained, if they understand written English and fulfil the following criteria: Criteria for inclusion
- History of Springtime hayfever
- Positive skin prick test to Birch
- FEV1. > than 70% predicted or greater than

- Aged 16 years or more Exclusion criteria
- Pregnancy
- Existing medical condition which could be affected by a severe response on challenge
- Aged under 16
- FEV1. < than 70% predicted or greater than

1. 5L. The OAS screening tool will be completed for every patient. A venous blood sample will be taken and stored for the measurement of total IgE and specific IgE RAST tests for birch, apple, celery and hazelnuts. A questionnaire will be completed by the patient assessing the effect any food reactions is having on their diet and social life. The researcher will then complete a 24-hour food recall questionnaire with the patient, to ascertain their normal dietary intake.

### Risk factors for severe reactions in food allergy: rapid evidence review with meta-analysis [^732d2cb0]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Birch‐pollen sensitization is associated with less severe reactions in people allergic to peanutor hazelnut, probably because this is indicative of Bet v 1‐mediated PFAS, rather than primary sensitization to a food allergen. Importantly, patients with only oral symptoms (often referred to as oral allergy syndrome, OAS) to low levels of allergen exposure must not be assumed to have PFAS on that basis alone: indeed, in the first description of OAS in the literature, almost half of patients with OAS to peanut went on to experience systemic symptoms and anaphylaxis with subsequent exposure.OAS is therefore not synonymous with PFAS; the latter requires evidence of IgE‐sensitization to cross‐reactive pollens and/or the presence of OAS alone at higher doses of allergen ingestion.

While LTP‐mediated allergy can be associated with very severe reactions, LTP‐sensitization without clinical reactivity is common, although there is significant geographical variation. Data are emerging that polysensitization to pollen panallergens (particularly to Bet v 1 homologues and profilins) in LTP‐sensitized individuals can moderate severity. Conversely, mono‐sensitization to a single LTP (without other IgE‐sensitization) may be associated with a greater risk of severe reactions in some regions.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pollen-food allergy syndrome, more specifically with respect to indications for allergy testing, BSACI 2022 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining allergy tests to foods in the following situations:

- more severe or atypical symptoms to characteristic raw food triggers

- uncertainty whether reactions also occur to roasted hazelnuts, almonds, walnuts, Brazil nuts, or peanuts, either on their own or when present in composite foods, such as chocolates, spreads, desserts, and snacks

- triggers include other soy products or cooked/processed fruits/vegetables, such as smoothies and juices

- reactions are reported specifically to cashew, pistachio, or macadamia nuts.

### Prevalence and sensitization of pollen-food allergy syndrome among adolescents in tokyo [^59884154]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design, setting, and participants

This cross-sectional study of 17-year-old adolescents (range, 16–18 years) was conducted as part of the Tokyo Children's Health, Illness, and Development study (T-Child study), a prospective birth cohort study of the general population conducted by the National Center for Child Health and Development. The study aims to investigate various factors influencing child health and development, particularly in relation to allergic diseases. Newborns born between March 2004 and August 2006 were enrolled. The comprehensive methodology has been detailed in previous publications. In the present study, 458 adolescents aged 17 years underwent serum sampling and completed questionnaire surveys.

Ethics statement

The T-Child study was approved by the National Center for Child Health and Development research ethics committee (approval 52) and complies with the ethical standards outlined in the Japanese guidelines for medical research involving human participants (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare) as well as the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all guardians, and informed assent was obtained from all minors.

Outcome variables

Variables related to PFAS, pollen allergies, OAS, and sensitization to IgE components are presented in Table E1 in the Online Repository available at. In this study, OAS is defined as oral symptoms to fruits and vegetables as reported by participants. Pollen allergy is defined as the presence of rhinitis symptoms along with sensitization to plants. PFAS is defined as fulfilling both the criteria for OAS and pollen allergy. These definitions for late adolescents aged 17 years were consistent with those applied to 13-year-olds in our previous study. Rhinitis was assessed by the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire. Sensitization to IgE components was analyzed by ImmunoCAP ISAC.

Questionnaire survey

Participants and their parents completed a paper-based questionnaire in Japanese, which included medical history items related to ISAAC, OAS, and PFAS, to assess the health and daily life of 17-year-olds. The ISAAC questionnaire is widely used in epidemiologic studies on asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis (AD) and has been validated for cross-cultural use. Definition of allergic outcomes are shown in Table E1.

### Characterization of cross-reacting allergens in mango fruit [^5e6d6e2a]. Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Allergic reactions to mango fruit have become increasingly important. A cross-reaction between mango fruit, various other foods, and respiratory allergens has been assumed but not investigated until now.

Methods

The sera of nine patients were used to characterize cross-reacting allergens in mango fruits by EAST inhibition and immunoblot inhibition.

Results and Conclusions

EAST inhibition and immunoblot inhibition demonstrated that cross-reactions between mango fruits, mugwort pollen, birch pollen, celery, and carrot are based on allergens related to Bet v 1 and Art v 1, the major allergens of birch and mugwort pollen, respectively.

### The clinical relevance of sensitization to pollen-related fruits and vegetables in unselected pollen-sensitized adults [^21824912]. Allergy (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies have described cross-reactivity between fresh fruits, vegetables and pollen. However, no data demonstrates the clinical relevance of sensitization to pollen-related fruits and vegetables in unselected pollen-sensitized adults with and without symptoms in the pollen season.

Objective

The aim of this study was to estimate the clinical relevance of sensitization to pollen-related fruits and vegetables in unselected pollen-sensitized adults and to examine the diagnostic value of skin-prick test (SPT), histamine release and specific IgE compared with the outcome of oral challenge.

Methods

In total, 936 unselected adults (female: male 479: 457, median age 33.7 years) were examined for pollen sensitization and clinical cross-reactivity with pollen-related fruits and vegetables by questionnaire, SPT, histamine release, specific IgE and oral challenge.

Results

The prevalence of pollen sensitization was 23.8% (n = 223). The probability of a clinical reaction to pollen-related foods in the respective pollen-sensitized groups was: 24% (birch), 4% (grass), 10% (mugwort), 35% (birch + grass), 8% (grass + mugwort) and 52% (birch + grass + mugwort). The odds ratio of a clinical reaction to pollen-related fruits and vegetables in symptomatic pollen-sensitized adults was as high as four times (birch + grass) the odds ratio of a clinical reaction in asymptomatic pollen-sensitized adults.

Conclusion

This study not only demonstrates a high prevalence of clinical reactions to fruits and vegetables in pollen-sensitized adults, but also a discrepancy between the prevalence of sensitization to fruits and vegetables and the clinical relevance in different pollen-sensitized groups with symptoms in the pollen season as a significant factor.

### Epitope specificity determines cross-protection of a SIT-induced IgG4 antibody [^d9e73740]. Allergy (2016). Low credibility.

Referring to the WHO/IUIS Allergen Nomenclature, allergens are listed according to their origin and thus annotated to the individual allergen sources 1. However, it has turned out to be useful to group allergens into families which are related in terms of their sequence, three‐dimensional structure and immunological cross‐reactivity 2, 3. The latter grouping of allergens is extremely useful to explain clinical syndromes based on the cross‐reactivity of patients' IgE antibodies and/or T‐cell receptors with structurally related allergens from different allergen sources. For example, cross‐reactivity of the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 with counterparts in various plant foods is responsible for oral allergy syndrome and exacerbations of atopic eczema in birch pollen‐allergic patients upon ingestion of plant food containing cross‐reactive allergens 4, 5, 6. Other highly cross‐reactive plant allergens are the profilins, which are ubiquitous cytoskeletal proteins 7, 8, 9, 10, and the polcalcins, a family of calcium‐binding allergens which may cause clinical reactions to multiple plant pollens because they occur in pollens of most plants and share a high degree of sequence similarity 11, 12, 13, 14. Polcalcins from grass pollen seem to be the most potent primary sensitizers, and sensitized patients show extensive cross‐reactivity of their IgE antibodies with related allergens in pollens of various grasses, trees and weeds 15, 16. Although there is extensive cross‐reactivity of allergic patients' IgE antibodies towards allergens from the Bet v 1, profilin and polcalcin family, it is a matter of debate whether immunotherapy with one member of a particular allergen family cross‐protects against members of other allergen sources. For example in a double‐blind study of subcutaneous immunotherapy that employed a ragweed extract in grass–ragweed dual‐sensitized individuals, the extract proved highly effective during the ragweed season but with no cross‐protection being observed during the grass allergy season 17. A similar question is whether birch pollen extract‐based SIT has a protective effect on oral allergy syndrome (OAS) to apple or hazelnut 18, 19, 20, 21. Some trials reported no 19 or no significant 18 effects of birch pollen SIT to apple allergy in comparison with placebo, while other authors reported positive effects at varying degrees 20, 21. A more recent study indicated that during birch pollen SIT in most, but not all, food‐sensitized patients, there was an induction of allergen‐specific IgG 4 responses 22. These findings are supported by another trial showing that food‐tolerant individuals had significantly higher Mal d 1 (apple)‐ and Cor a 1 (hazelnut)‐specific IgG 4 /IgE ratios in comparison with individuals with food allergy 23.

### Pollen-food syndromes associated with weed pollinosis: an update from the molecular point of view [^94fb1bf4]. Allergy (2006). Low credibility.

Pollinosis patients often display adverse reactions upon the ingestion of plant-derived foods as a result of immunoglobulin E (IgE) cross-reactive structures shared by pollen and food allergen sources. The symptoms of such pollen-food syndromes (PFS) or class 2 food allergies range from local oral allergy syndrome to severe systemic anaphylaxis. Two clinical syndromes, the celery-mugwort-spice syndrome and the mugwort-mustard-allergy syndrome have been described in association with weed pollinosis. However, other associations between weed pollinosis and hypersensitivity to certain kinds of food have also been observed, like the mugwort-peach, the ragweed-melon-banana, the plantain-melon, the pellitory-pistachio, the goosefoot-fruit, the Russian thistle-saffron, and the hop-celery association. The number of allergen sources involved, the allergens, and influencing factors including geography, diet, and food preparation contribute to the high clinical complexity of PFS. So far, known causative cross-reactive allergens include profilins, lipid transfer proteins, and high-molecular weight allergens and/or glycoallergens. The current usage of nonstandardized allergen extracts poses additional problems for both diagnosis and therapy of PFS patients. Further identification and characterization of involved allergens is inescapable for better understanding of PFS and vaccine development. Panels of recombinant allergens and/or hypo-allergens are promising tools to improve both PFS diagnostics and therapy.

### A systematic review of allergen cross-reactivity: translating basic concepts into clinical relevance [^9e279d37]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Computational approaches for predicting allergenicity and cross-reactivity were increasingly reported, with some tools already available on the web.

Therapeutic advances

Taken together, clinical evaluation of cross-reactive molecules and individual sensitization patterns affect AIT prescription, efficacy, and monitoring;, help evaluate novel approaches such as apple oral AIT for birch pollinosis; and extend protection through cross-blocking reactivity.

The study of host immune cross-recognition contributed to further insight into Bet v 1 cross-reactivity at the IgG and IgE level after allergen vaccination or AIT, and B-cell memory at the mucosal allergen exposure sites. Finally, intervention-directed approaches such as identification of apple cultivars with low clinical cross-reactivity could be considered for birch-allergic patients with pollen-related food allergy to apple.

### Outcomes of apple oral immunotherapy in pollen food allergy syndrome [^05a87deb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Table I
Baseline characteristics of the apple OIT participants

To our knowledge, this is the first report of a study in which all participants tolerated a whole apple after OIT. On average, the end point was reached after 39 days, which is considerably sooner than the previously reported time of 140 to 240 days. This fact may be related to shorter intervals, as we doubled the quantity of apple every 3 to 7 days instead of every 2 to 3 weeks. Moreover, the patients were allowed to continue OIT if they experienced tingling sensations only; this more liberal approach may have prevented needless delay. In the case of 2 patients, it may be possible that their concurrent subcutaneous immunotherapy for birch pollen facilitated the OIT; however, 1 of the 2 had previously tried a different OIT regimen and aborted it when subcutaneous immunotherapy actually worsened her symptoms. Lastly, we speculate that the addition of yogurt facilitated OIT, presumably by reducing direct contact between the apple and oral mucosa. Alternatively, fermented dairy may positively influence the gut microbiome, although this is not likely to occur directly or at the study dosages. The a priori risk of anaphylaxis in PFAS is very low; we therefore consider it safe to perform OIT apple at home, provided that patients are selected carefully, clear instructions are given, and the dosage of apple is increased gradually. Our results are limited by the small patient numbers, the absence of a control group, the subjectivity of symptoms that is inherent to PFAS, and difficulties in standardizing the allergen dosage. Nonetheless, for all of the participants, there was an obvious increase in the tolerable amount of apple versus at baseline, reflecting a relevant clinical outcome for daily practice. Provided that apple was consumed regularly (we advised ≥ 3 apples per week), the induced tolerance was sustained and appeared to extend to other apple varieties and stone fruit. These findings suggest that tolerance could be extended to multiple Bet v1 homologues, and it is tempting to speculate that reintroduction of various fruits, vegetables, and tree nuts is feasible. Previous findings by Nothegger et al support this hypothesis. Because the majority of patients experience PFAS symptoms in response to multiple products and many of them experience considerable dietary restrictions affecting their quality of life, OIT may have the potential to improve the diet of patients with PFAS beyond apple reintroduction. Increasing variety in the daily diet by reintroducing various fruit and vegetables could facilitate maintaining tolerance to Bet v1 products in the long term.

### Food allergy: a practice parameter update-2014 [^98f78808]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Food allergy elimination diets and cross-reactivity — Dietary avoidance should be individualized by cross-reactivity risk, and certain food classes share proteins such that "patients with food allergy should avoid the food class". In contrast, the majority of patients with peanut allergy can safely consume other legumes, and patients with wheat or other grain allergy can often consume other grains without adverse symptoms. Some patients with pollen allergy tolerate cooked but not raw fruits/vegetables. Cross-reactive patterns also include latex–fruit associations, and with alpha-gal hypersensitivity all mammalian red meat should be avoided.

### An international Delphi consensus on the management of pollen-food allergy syndrome: a Work group report of the AAAAI adverse reactions to foods committee [^38feb494]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). High credibility.

Pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS) — risk factor counseling and systemic reaction cofactors are outlined as follows: The panel agreed to counsel patients with PFAS that certain foods and factors may be associated with increased severity of PFAS reactions and to educate patients that avoiding these factors, when possible, might serve as an opportunity to mitigate their rare risk of more severe reactions. Patients should be educated that there is a rare chance of systemic reaction including anaphylaxis and that severe reactions are more likely during the corresponding peak pollen season. Reported cofactors include that the use of PPIs was more prevalent among patients with PFAS who experienced systemic reactions; NSAID use was similarly more prevalent among patients with systemic reactions (3% vs 0%), but this was not statistically significant, and a subset of patients with history of PFAS limited to the oropharynx experienced systemic reactions related to exposure to NSAIDs and had no reaction during oral challenge to the culprit NSAID without ingesting the food. Additional associated factors include ingestion of peanuts, tree nuts, fasting, and excessive ingestion such as with liquid forms. Bariatric surgery has been linked to progression in case series, including 9 patients with systemic reactions after surgery that were previously tolerated or mild, and in another study 2 of 18 transitioned from mild oropharyngeal symptoms to generalized reactions after gastric bypass surgery. Alcohol consumption, exercise, and uncontrolled asthma are recognized cofactors for food-induced anaphylaxis and might increase PFAS severity.

### The functional connection between oral allergy syndrome and United airways disease assessed by oral challenge [^4eff7df8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The airways and the upper digestive tract have a common embryonic origin. In sensitized subjects they can respond to allergens with an immediate reaction (asthma, rhinitis, or oral allergy syndrome [OAS]).

Objective

To investigate the possible functional connection between respiratory and upper digestive tract by means of specific oral allergen challenges.

Methods

Patients sensitized to birch and apple were subdivided into group A (n = 12; asthma + rhinitis caused by birch and OAS caused by apple); group B (n = 10; OAS caused by apple without asthma/rhinitis); group C (n = 8; asthma and rhinitis caused by birch without OAS). Healthy subjects represented the control group D (n = 6). Oral provocation test with apple was performed out of the pollen season. Visual analog scale for eye, nose, and mouth symptoms, spirometry, nasal eosinophil count, and exhaled nitric oxide were assessed before and 6 hours after challenge.

Results

No change occurred in nasal and ocular symptoms before versus after challenge in all groups. On the contrary, in groups A and B the oral scores significantly increased after challenge (P < .001), whereas no change was seen in groups C and D. Exhaled nitric oxide and nasal eosinophils showed no change before versus after challenge in all groups. Nitric oxide was higher before and after challenge in groups A and C vs groups B and D. No change was seen in either forced vital capacity or forced expiratory volume in 1 second.

Conclusion

In the case of birch-apple syndrome, eating apple does not functionally or clinically affect the respiratory tract.

### An update on oral anaphylaxis from mite ingestion [^5a9bec7a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review systemic reactions due to the oral ingestion of mites.

Data Sources

We performed a MEDLINE search of peer-reviewed research articles published between 1993 and 2004 relevant to the subject of anaphylactic reactions to mite-contaminated foods.

Study Selection

Recent studies that emphasized the potentially life-threatening nature of anaphylactic reactions, responsible foodstuffs and mites, populations at risk, and pathogenesis were selected for inclusion in this review.

Results

Although relatively few new cases of oral mite anaphylaxis are reported in the literature, we speculate that this clinical condition is occurring more frequently than realized in many geographic locations, and only the suspicion of an informed physician can contribute to its diagnosis and prevention. Oral anaphylaxis from mite-contaminated foods may be lethal if not promptly recognized and treated, and some preventive measures may be helpful for individuals at risk. Frequent cross-reactions among domestic, storage, and phytophagous mites explain the increased risk of oral mite anaphylaxis in sensitive patients living in both urban and rural areas. The enzymatic activity of some mite allergens contributes to the pathogenesis of this syndrome by means of mucosal damage and enhanced allergen absorption through the oral route.

Conclusions

Oral mite anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially lethal allergic condition that occurs in many countries and is frequently undiagnosed. Early recognition may lead to the implementation of simple prophylactic measures in at-risk populations of allergic patients.

### Contact urticaria and related conditions: clinical review [^ba5b8e23]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Immunologic Contact Urticaria

I‐CoU is an immunoglobulin E (IgE)‐mediated hypersensitivity reaction requiring prior sensitization, which can occur through the skin, respiratory system or gastrointestinal tract. Upon re‐exposure, allergens penetrate the epidermis (often through a disrupted skin barrier), bind to IgE and trigger histamine release from mast cells. Lipophilic allergens may also enter through hair follicles. I‐CoU is induced by HMW or LMW chemicals, including cosmetic and industrial chemicals, food additives, plants or plant products, animals or animal products and pharmaceuticals (Table 3). Among healthcare workers, natural rubber latex (NLR) was once a common trigger of I‐CoU, but its incidence has declined due to the increased use of synthetic rubber gloves. LMW chemicals can induce IgE‐mediated sensitization, but must first bind to carrier proteins, such as serum albumin, to form hapten‐protein conjugates. Examples include diphenylmethane‐diisocyanate and p‐phenylenediamine (Table 3). I‐CoU caused by ammonium persulphate can be mediated by antigen‐specific IgE, immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM).

Wheals typically appear within minutes to an hour, faster than in NI‐CoU. Pruritus is more prominent than burning, stinging and/or tingling sensations, and wheals usually resolve within hours, typically by 24 h after avoidance. However, I‐CoU can sometimes have a delayed onset after repeated exposure, possibly due to slower penetration.

2.3 Oral Allergy Syndrome

Oral allergy syndrome is a type of I‐CoU that may present as itching, burning, and in some cases, swelling of the lips, tongue, roof of the mouth or throat within minutes of ingesting the allergen. This is a frequent manifestation of food allergy in adults. It may occur not only in individuals with the so‐called pollen‐food syndrome (which is caused by the cross‐reactivity between pollen allergens, such as the major birch allergen [Bet v 1] or profilin [a plant panallergen] with homologous, heat‐ and pepsin‐sensitive allergens in various fruits, vegetables and nuts), but also in those sensitised to heat‐ and pepsin‐stable food allergens, such as lipid transfer protein found in many plant‐based foods.

### Correlation of oral allergy syndrome due to plant-derived foods with pollen sensitization in Japan [^46c52b2f]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical features of patients with oral allergy syndrome (OAS) due to plant-derived foods related to pollen allergy have been rarely reported in Japan.

Objectives

To evaluate the characteristics of OAS and to investigate whether pollen sensitizations are correlated with the prevalence of OAS in Japan.

Methods

We measured specific IgE antibodies against 5 pollens in 622 outpatients (277 males and 345 females; mean age, 37 years) with atopic dermatitis, urticaria, angioedema, and food allergy during a 2-year period. Furthermore, OAS is diagnosed based on anamnesis and positive skin prick test reactions to suspected foods.

Results

Eighteen of the 436 patients (4.1%) sensitized to pollens were diagnosed as having OAS. Rates of specific IgE antibody-positive responses against Japanese cedar, ragweed, orchard grass, mugwort, and alder pollen were 69.8%, 35.3%, 29.1%, 24.1%, and 19.6%, respectively. The prevalence of OAS showed a significant positive correlation with sensitization to alder (P < .001). In addition, the most frequent causative foods were found to be apple, peach, and melon. The prevalence of OAS due to apple showed a significant positive correlation with sensitization to alder (P < .001) pollen, due to peach showed a significant positive correlation with sensitization to alder (P < .001) and orchard grass (P < .05) pollen, and due to melon showed a significant positive correlation with sensitization to alder (P < .005), orchard grass (P < .05), and ragweed (P < .05) pollen.

Conclusion

Sensitization to pollens from species in the Betulaceae family is most strongly implicated in causing OAS in Japan.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^10c9486c]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Allergy diagnostic testing — food skin testing practices and limitations: Food prick and puncture skin tests are described as excellent diagnostic modalities for IgE‑mediated entities such as anaphylaxis, food‑dependent exercise‑induced anaphylaxis, acute urticaria, atopic dermatitis, and oral allergy syndrome. Relatively few foods account for most IgE‑mediated reactions; common allergens in infants and young children include cow's milk, hen's egg, peanuts, tree nuts, soybeans, and wheat, whereas adults more often react to peanuts, tree nuts, fish, crustaceans, mollusks, fruits, and vegetables. Because commercial fruit and vegetable extracts rapidly lose potency, clinicians either use fresh extracts or the prick‑prick method, which is preferred to detect strain differences (eg, apple). Because of many false‑positive results and potential risks, intracutaneous tests to foods are not recommended, and food tests are inappropriate for investigating chronic idiopathic urticaria or angioedema.

### An allergen from olea europaea pollen (ole e 7) is associated with plant-derived food anaphylaxis [^e0d2f775]. Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Several cross-reacting proteins have been identified as responsible of the co-occurrence of pollinosis and plant-derived food allergy. This association has been mainly described in the birch-apple syndrome but other pollens such as Olea europaea and other fruits may also contain homologous proteins.

Objective

To evaluate the associations between sensitization to allergens of Olea europaea pollen and confirmed plant-derived food allergy, in addition to investigate if any pattern of clinical hypersensitivity of food allergy reaction (oral allergy syndrome (OAS) or anaphylaxis) and/or any fresh fruit or nut allergy, are associated to one or several Olea pollen allergen(s).

Methods

One-hundred and thirty-four consecutive patients diagnosed with pollinosis by Olea were studied. Of these patients only 40, reported adverse reaction to plant-derived food. Twenty-one (group A) were classified as OAS and 19 (group B) as anaphylaxis. Skin-tests with six Olea pollen allergens and several groups of fruits, were performed. Double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), confirmed the diagnostics of food allergy with the exception of patients who suffered previous anaphylactic reaction.

Results

All patients, showed a positive skin prick test (SPT), against one or more of Olea europaea allergens. Sensitization to Ole e 7, was more frequent (P = 0.02) in patients from group B. A total of 84 DBPCFC were performed with 44% positive results. Challenge confirmed at least the 50% of positive SPT in any case (peach: 68.42%; pear: 50%; melon: 71.42% and kiwi: 53.84%). In patients from group B, significant association with O. europaea pollen allergens were found between positive SPT to Rosaceae fruits and Ole e 3 (P = 0.045) and Ole e 7 (P = 0.03); Cucurbitaceae and Ole e 7 (P = 0.03) and Actinidiaceae with Ole e 3 (P = 0.04).

Conclusions

The results of this study, establish a new spectrum of associations between pollens and plant-derived foods: sensitization to olive profilin (Ole e 2) is not more frequent in OAS patients. Patients with anaphylactic reaction after eating fruit are also sensitized to Ole e 7, a LTP present in Olea pollen, and suffer pollinic symptoms. Finally a polcalcin (Ole e 3) could be also associated to Olea pollen respiratory and food allergy.

### Outcomes of apple oral immunotherapy in pollen food allergy syndrome [^3969aa5e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Up to 70% of patients with birch pollen allergic may develop pollen food allergy syndrome (PFAS). Patients may react to tree nuts and fruit of the Rosaceae family, including apple, as these contain food allergens homologous to Betula verrucosa 1 (Bet v 1) of birch pollen. Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms can be ameliorated by using subcutaneous or sublingual allergen immunotherapy, but its effects on PFAS are limited and inconsistent. Oral immunotherapy (OIT) for primary food allergies has been successful in experimental settings, but little data regarding PFAS are available. Experience with apple OIT is scarce but has shown promising results; 44% to 63% of patients who undertook apple OIT were able to tolerate a whole apple (128 g) after an average of 20 weeksto 8 months.

### Reactivity to potential cross-reactive foods in fruit-allergic patients: implications for prescribing food avoidance [^97af239b]. Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Prescribing therapeutic elimination diets in patients with fruit allergy should include recommendations on which other foods of the same family or group may be safely consumed. Evidence-based data on the management of fruit allergy are lacking; therefore, advice may vary from just avoiding the offending fruit, to overly restrictive diets of the entire botanical family. The aims of this investigation were to assess clinical reactivity to potential cross-reactive foods in fruit-allergic patients, and the implications for prescribing specific therapeutic elimination diets.

Methods

Sixty-five adults diagnosed with clinical allergy to one or more fruits were evaluated for IgE-mediated allergy to other related foods, which might share cross-reactive antigens. Those with actual allergy to some Rosaceae fruit (including peach, apple, apricot, plum, and almond) underwent skin prick testing (SPT), food-specific IgE assessment by the Pharmacia CAP-FEIA system, and oral challenges with the entire group. For those with allergy to other fruits (chestnut, melon, banana, kiwi, or avocado) immunologic and clinical reactivity to all five were evaluated. Since a number of people in the study also had proven clinically allergy to some nut or legume (peanut, sunflower seed, walnut, pistachio, or hazelnut), the reactivity to the entire set was investigated.

Results

Thirty-four of those tested (52%) were found to be clinically allergic to more than one fruit, so 125 allergic reactions occurred in the 65 patients. Peach, melon, kiwi, apple, and banana accounted for 72% of allergic reactions. Forty-two (65%) had sensitization to pollens, causing seasonal allergic rhinitis and/or asthma, and 18 (28%) were sensitized to latex. The 65 with IgE-mediated fruit allergy underwent 351 additional SPT and food-specific IgE determinations with potential cross-reactive foods considered in this study; 223 (64%) of these results were positive. The routine challenges with potential cross-reactive foods uncovered 18 further reactions in 14 (22%) out of 65 (to avocado in seven; apricot in three; plum in one; almond and peanut in one; banana and hazelnut in one; avocado, banana and kiwi in one). Only 8% (18/223) of positive results for SPT, or food-specific IgE levels of greater than 0.35 kU(A)/l to potential cross-reactive foods investigated in this study, were clinically relevant.

Conclusion

Elimination diets that rely on total group avoidance, or only on the results of allergy testing, might have resulted in unnecessary restriction of 205 foods in the 65 people studied. The lack of routine oral challenges with related fruits — before prescribing dietary restriction — may have allowed 18 food reactions in one-fifth (14/65) of patients to be overlooked.

### Clinical relevance of cross-reactivity in food allergy [^fa369885]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis and management of food allergy is complicated by an abundance of homologous, cross-reactive proteins in edible foods and aeroallergens. This results in patients having allergic sensitization (positive tests) to many biologically related foods. However, many are sensitized to foods without exhibiting clinical reactivity. Although molecular diagnostics have improved our ability to identify clinically relevant cross-reactivity, the optimal approach to patients requires an understanding of the epidemiology of clinically relevant cross-reactivity, as well as the food-specific (degree of homology, protein stability, abundance) and patient-specific factors (immune response, augmentation factors) that determine clinical relevance. Examples of food families with high rates of cross-reactivity include mammalian milks, eggs, fish, and shellfish. Low rates are noted for grains (wheat, barley, rye), and rates of cross-reactivity are variable for most other foods. This review discusses clinically relevant cross-reactivity related to the aforementioned food groups as well as seeds, legumes (including peanut, soy, chickpea, lentil, and others), tree nuts, meats, fruits and vegetables (including the lipid transfer protein syndrome), and latex. The complicating factor of addressing co-allergy, for example, the risks of allergy to both peanut and tree nuts among atopic patients, is also discussed. Considerations for an approach to individual patient care are highlighted.

Food allergy practice parameter — latex–fruit cross-reactivity: Evaluate patients with latex allergy for the possibility of cross-reactivity to banana, avocado, kiwi, chestnut, potato, green pepper, and other fruits and nuts, and use individualized management because clinical reactions caused by this cross-reactivity can range from mild to severe.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^ac1f7f0f]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Allergy diagnostic testing — prick/puncture skin tests emphasize standardized technique, test controls, and interpretation parameters: Optimal results can be expected by choosing a single prick/puncture device and properly training skin technicians in its use. Prick/puncture tests are generally age, sex, and race independent, but children younger than 2 years and adults older than 65 years and African American children factors may affect interpretation. Skin test allergens used for prick/puncture tests should be potent and stable, and to ensure proper interpretation, positive (histamine) and negative (saline or 50% glycerinated human serum albumin [HSA]–saline) should be performed at the same time as allergen tests. The peak reactivity of prick/puncture tests is 15 to 20 minutes and both wheal and erythema should be recorded in millimeters; qualitative scoring (0 to 4+; positive or negative) is no longer used by many clinicians. The diagnostic validity of prick/puncture tests has been confirmed under natural exposure and controlled organ challenge conditions, and many studies have verified sensitivity and specificity when correlated with nasal and oral challenge tests. Reliability depends on tester skill, instrument, skin color and reactivity on the test day, age, and reagent potency and stability, and false-positive results may occur in specified cross-reactive or nonindigenous pollen situations. Life-threatening generalized systemic reactions are rarely caused; in one retrospective survey, 1 death was reported in a patient who received 90 food prick/puncture tests at one time.

### IgE, IgG4 and IgA specific to bet V 1-related food allergens do not predict oral allergy syndrome [^1b382cde]. Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Birch pollen-associated plant food allergy is caused by Bet v 1-specific IgE, but presence of cross-reactive IgE to related allergens does not predict food allergy. The role of other immunoglobulin isotypes in the birch pollen-plant food syndrome has not been investigated in detail.

Methods

Bet v 1-sensitized birch pollen-allergic patients (n = 35) were diagnosed for food allergy by standardized interviews, skin prick tests, prick-to-prick tests and ImmunoCAP. Concentrations of allergen-specific IgE, IgG1, IgG4 and IgA to seven Bet v 1-related food allergens were determined by ELISA.

Results

Bet v 1, Cor a 1, Mal d 1 and Pru p 1 bound IgE from all and IgG4 and IgA from the majority of sera. Immunoglobulins to Gly m 4, Vig r 1 and Api g 1.01 were detected in < 65% of the sera. No significant correlation was observed between plant food allergy and increased or reduced levels of IgE, IgG1, IgG4 or IgA specific to most Bet v 1-related allergens. Api g 1-specific IgE was significantly (P = 0.01) elevated in celeriac-allergic compared with celeriac-tolerant patients. Likewise, frequencies of IgE (71% vs 15%; P = 0.01) and IgA (86% vs 38%; P = 0.04) binding to Api g 1.01 were increased.

Conclusion

Measurements of allergen-specific immunoglobulins are not suitable for diagnosing Bet v 1-mediated plant food allergy to hazelnut and Rosaceae fruits. In contrast, IgE and IgA to the distantly related allergen Api g 1 correlate with allergy to celeriac.

### EpidemAAITO: features of food allergy in Italian adults attending allergy clinics: a multi-centre study [^573de095]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Studies of the prevalence of different types of food allergy in adults are lacking.

Objective

To define the prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergies in Italian adults attending allergy clinics and to assess possible differences associated with geographical position and/or dietary habits.

Methods

Seventeen allergy outpatient clinics scattered throughout Italy participated to a multi-centre study in 2007. The number of atopic subjects and of food allergic patients along with clinical features were recorded by pre-defined criteria. Patients with unequivocal history of food allergy confirmed by positive skin prick test were included as cases.

Results

Twenty five thousand six hundred and one subjects were screened; 12,739 (50%) were atopic, and 1079 (8,5%) had IgE-mediated food allergy. Sixty four percent of patients were females. Overall, the most frequent food allergy was the pollen-food allergy syndrome (55%), which was associated with oral allergy syndrome in 95% of cases and whose frequency decreased southbound. Forty-five percent of patients had a type 1 food allergy, in most cases (72%) caused by fruits and vegetables, and generally associated with a history of systemic symptoms. Type 1 food allergies represented 96% of food allergies in the South. Lipid transfer protein (LTP) accounted for 60% of sensitizations and caused most primary food allergies in all areas.

Conclusion

Plant-derived foods cause most food allergies in Italian adults. The pollen-food allergy syndrome is the most frequent type of food allergy followed by allergy to LTP whose frequency increases southbound. The pattern of allergy to certain foods is clearly influenced by specific geographic features such as pollen exposure and dietary habits.

### Allergy to apple cultivars among patients with birch pollinosis and oral allergy syndrome [^721d6ce4]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Oral allergy syndrome (OAS) is caused by cross-reacting allergens found in pollen, raw fruits, vegetables, and some tree nuts. The major apple allergen, Mal d 1, is a cause of food allergic reactions in birch pollen sensitized patients.

Objective

To explore the allergenicity of the most popular and commonly consumed apple cultivars in Poland in patients with birch pollen allergy with or without OAS.

Methods

Data were obtained from 46 adults with clinical symptoms of birch allergy and allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the occurrence of OAS to apple. Skin prick tests (SPTs) were performed with pulp from the 11 most popular apple cultivars in Poland. Specific IgE (sIgE) to Bet v 1 was measured by radioallergosorbent test.

Results

Patients with OAS had more positive responses to apple SPT vs patients without OAS (odds ratios, 4.8–11.96). Patients with OAS had distinctive responses to apple cultivars. Szara Reneta and Cortland induced positive responses in 50% and 83% of patients, respectively. Patients with OAS vs patients without OAS who were allergic to apples vs nonallergic had 2-fold (P = 0.008) and 7-fold (P = 0.03) higher blood concentrations of sIgE Bet v 1, respectively. There were different profiles of correlations of sIgE Bet v 1 with wheal diameter for low and high allergenic cultivars in patients without and with OAS.

Conclusion

We noted a substantial role for Bet v 1 sensitization in the allergic response based on evaluation of the allergenicity of 11 apple cultivars. The sIgE Bet v 1 and SPT results of patients with and without OAS allowed differentiation between low and high allergenic cultivars.

Fig 3
Clinical vignette illustrating pollen and food cross-reactivity. Consider assessing IgE to corresponding allergen extracts for accurate interpretation of IgE to MA. Here, molecular assessment of birch pollen is not useful because it does not contain nsLTP or GRP. Profilin, a plant panallergen family, exhibits extensive pollen–fruit cross-reactivity. Lack of sensitization to grass and weed pollens excludes profilin involvement. PR-10, a cross-reactive family of plant allergens comprising major birch allergen Bet v 1, is heat sensitive. Cupressaceae pollen and bell pepper lack characterized PR-10 homologs. nsLTP, Nonspecific LTP. References.

Geographical variation in pollen exposure and subsequent molecular sensitization patterns also guide the work-up of pollen–food cross-reactivity. Identification of the cross-reactive allergen responsible for food plant-induced allergic reactions in the context of pollinosis supports adequate stratification and management, illustrating the clinical relevance of the molecular allergology approach (Fig 4).

### A genome-wide association study for allergen component sensitizations identifies allergen component-specific and allergen protein group-specific associations [^4bea0572]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2023). Medium credibility.

Allergic diseases including allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, and atopic dermatitis are common diseases worldwide. Allergic diseases have been increasing in prevalence in both developed and developing countries in the last decade, and the high prevalence of allergic diseases has become a social problem in many countries. A nationwide survey of Japanese primary school children (aged 6–8 years) found that 10.2% had wheeze; 18.7%, rhinoconjunctivitis; and 14.6%, eczema.

Prevention of allergic disease development has been proposed to be categorized into primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. In food allergy, primary prevention is defined as the prevention of IgE sensitization itself; secondary prevention, as the prevention of the onset of allergic symptoms in IgE-sensitized individuals; and tertiary prevention, as seeking to reduce the expression of end-organ allergic disease in children with established food allergy. The status of allergen sensitization is therefore important in evaluating allergic diseasesas well as in preventing them. Diagnosis of allergic diseases has become remarkably more accurate through improvements in allergen peptide purification. One of the most accurate allergy diagnostic methods in recent years is allergen component–specific IgE. Extracts using conventional crude allergens contain various allergens, and it is now possible to measure allergen component–specific IgE using a recombinantly purified protein. It has been reported that the measurement of allergen component–specific IgE improves diagnostic accuracy and is also useful for identifying cross-reactivity, such as oral allergy syndrome, and for detecting therapeutic targets for allergen-specific immunotherapy. The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology published guidelines for molecular-based diagnosis and declared that allergen-specific immunotherapy should be prescribed only when the clinical relevance of a given allergen source has been reliably demonstrated. Allergen components have been proposed as predictive markers of allergen immunotherapy because they distinguish between patients with genuine reactivity to biologic sources and those with misrecognition of biologic sources including pathogenesis-related PR proteins and profilin. A multiplex assay designed for multiple allergen components in human serum has been developed as a measure of allergen component–specific IgE, making it possible to evaluate an individual's sensitization profile to more than 100 allergen components. Patelis et alreported that IgE sensitization of allergen components may have higher clinical and prognostic values than those of extract-based measurements. We previously examined allergen component–specific IgE reactivity among children and showed high allergen sensitization rates, 57.8% at age 5 years and 74.8% at age 9 years, and that sensitization of allergen components related to allergic rhinitis was increased in children aged 9 years when compared with that in children aged 5 years.

### Diagnostic evaluation of grass-and birch-allergic patients with oral allergy syndrome [^2ae357e1]. Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with birch and grass allergy often suffer from oral allergy symptoms when ingesting cross-reacting fresh fruits and vegetables. However, fruit and vegetable allergen extracts are often readily degradable or contain clinically irrelevant cross-reacting epitopes, resulting in diagnostic discrepancies when fruit and vegetable allergic reactions are evaluated. The risk of using nonstandardized fresh food extracts for skin testing may also be of concern. The objective was to compare and evaluate the clinical utility of selected recombinant grass and birch cross-reacting food allergens with fresh and commercial melon, hazelnut, and apple extracts.

Methods

Thirty-six grass- and or birch-allergic patients and 17 control subjects consented to participate in the study. All subjects were skin prick tested and had basophil histamine-release tests done with fresh fruits and various extracts of hazelnut, apple, and melon. The diagnosis of oral allergy syndrome was confirmed by oral challenges. In addition, histamine release to recombinant Bet v 1 and Bet v 2, and recombinant Phl p 1 and Phl p 2, Phl p 5 was performed.

Results

The skin prick test with fresh hazelnut, apple, and melon showed sensitivities of 0.97, 0.92, and 0.89, respectively. The corresponding specificities were 0.78, 0.72, and 0.82, respectively. In contrast, the histamine-release test with hazelnut, apple, and melon gave sensitivities of 0.87, 0.71, and 1.00, respectively. The corresponding specificities were 0.65, 0.93, and 0.43. The skin prick test showed excellent negative predictive value (> 90%). No added value of recombinant allergen testing was noted. Oral challenge did not result in severe systemic reactions, and no systemic reactions were observed with skin prick tests with fresh fruits.

Conclusion

The skin prick test showed an almost optimal diagnostic value with a satisfactory sensitivity (> 89%) and excellent negative predictive value with fresh fruits. When the skin prick test with fresh nut and apple cannot be performed, histamine release is a diagnostic alternative. Histamine release with melon showed lack of specificity. This was probably due to extensive IgE cross-reactivity with pollen, since these patients also responded to recombinant Phl p 1 and Bet v 1. Skin testing and challenges with fresh fruits were safe.

### Antibody profiles and self-reported symptoms to pollen-related food allergens in grass pollen-allergic patients from Northern Europe [^f066a169]. Allergy (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Most studies on pollen-related food allergy have so far focused on the association of birch/weed pollen allergens and plant food allergy. The aim of this study was to elucidate the allergen spectrum among a group of grass pollen-allergic patients from northern Europe and to relate the results to clinical histories of pollen-related food allergy.

Methods

Fifty-eight grass pollen-allergic patients answered a questionnaire regarding allergy to foods. Blood samples were taken to test IgE-reactivity to a large panel of pollen allergens and pollen- and nonpollen-related food allergens using crude allergen extracts and recombinant and native allergens.

Results

Three different groups of grass pollen-allergic patients were identified according to their IgE antibody profile: a grass pollen group only (19%), a grass and tree pollen group (29%) and a grass, tree and compositae (pan-) pollen group (48%). No sensitization to Bet v 1 as well as almost no IgE to plant food was observed in the grass pollen group. In contrast, nearly all patients in the two tree-related groups had IgE to Bet v 1, which reflected the high frequency of adverse reactions to typical birch-related food in these groups. Only four patients belonging to the pan-pollen group displayed IgE to profilin Phl p 12/Bet v 2. Patients in the pan-pollen group reported significantly more symptoms to food allergens compared with patients in the two other groups. The most frequently reported symptom was the oral allergy syndrome.

Conclusions

Sensitization to grass pollen alone is rare among grass pollen-allergic patients from northern Europe. The majority of patients are in addition sensitized to birch (Bet v 1), which seems to be closely related to their pollen-derived food allergy. The study highlights the advantage of using well-defined allergen molecules for the diagnosis of cross-reactivity between pollen and food allergens.

### Cross-protection of allergen immunotherapy-induced antibodies to related allergens requires a high degree of structural identity [^761ef9d0]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

More than 70% of birch pollen‐allergic individuals develop birch pollen‐related food allergy (BPRFA) to at least one plant food. The latter comprise pome fruits (e.g. apple, pear), stone fruits (e.g. cherry, peach), tree nuts (e.g. hazelnut, walnut), vegetables (e.g. carrot, celery), and legumes (e.g. soybean, peanuts), all of which contain pathogenesis‐related group 10 (PR‐10) proteins with three‐dimensional structures similar to the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1. As a consequence, Bet v 1‐specific IgE antibodies may bind to similar conformational epitopes on these homologs and cause clinical reactions, that is, an oral allergy syndrome (OAS) in the majority of cases. Although BPRFA primarily results from the cross‐reaction of Bet v 1‐specific IgE antibodies and T cells, allergen immunotherapy (AIT) with birch pollen often has a limited curative effect on secondary food allergies.,

In search of novel treatment options for BPRFA, we conducted a single center, double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial including birch pollen‐allergic patients with apple allergy randomized into three groups for the daily sublingual application of placebo or either 25 μg of recombinant Mal d 1 (rMal d 1‐SLIT) or Bet v 1 (rBet v 1‐SLIT) for 16 weeks. We found that rMal d 1‐SLIT significantly reduced allergic reactions to rMal d 1 and fresh apple. This clinical success could be associated with the de novo induction of protective Mal d 1‐specific IgG1 antibodies. In contrast, rBet v 1‐SLIT showed limited therapeutic benefit regarding the related apple allergy which was accompanied by antibodies that cross‐reacted with Mal d 1 but lacked blocking activity. We considered the divergent types of protective and non‐protective Mal d 1‐specific antibodies following sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) with two highly cross‐reactive allergens as perfect tools to study the characteristics required for functional IgE blocking. A better understanding of such features will also help to better comprehend why AIT with birch pollen may have limited success on BPRFA.

### Lipid transfer protein syndrome: clinical pattern, cofactor effect and profile of molecular sensitization to plant-foods and pollens [^e564e66e]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple plant-food sensitizations with a complex pattern of clinical manifestations are a common feature of lipid transfer protein (LTP)-allergic patients. Component-resolved diagnosis permits the diagnosis of the allergen sensitization profile.

Objective

We sought to clinically characterize and describe the plant-food and pollen molecular sensitization profile in patients with LTP syndrome.

Methods

Forty-five subjects were recruited, after being diagnosed with multiple plant-food allergies sensitized to LTP, but not to any other plant-food allergen, according to the molecular allergen panel tested (Pru p 3 (LTP), Pru p 1 (Bet v 1-like), Pru p 4 (profilin) and those included in a commercial microarray of 103 allergenic components). IgE-mediated food-allergy symptoms and pollinosis were collected. Patients were skin prick tested with a plant-food and pollens panel, and specific IgE to Tri a 14 was evaluated.

Results

A heterogeneous group of plant-foods was involved in local and systemic symptoms: oral allergy syndrome (75.6%), urticaria (66.7%), gastrointestinal disorders (55.6%) and anaphylaxis (75.6%), 32.4% of which were cofactor dependent (Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs, exercise). All tested subjects were positive to peach and Pru p 3, Tri a 14 and to some of the LTPs included in the microarray. Pollinosis was diagnosed in 75.6% of subjects, with a broad spectrum of pollen and pollen-allergen sensitization. Plane tree and mugwort were the statistically significant pollens associated with Pru p 3.

Conclusions and Clinical Relevance

Several plant-foods, taxonomically unrelated, independent of peach involvement, are implicated in LTP syndrome. Local symptoms should be evaluated as a risk marker for anaphylaxis because they are frequently associated with cofactor-dependent anaphylaxis. The association of these symptoms with pollinosis, especially plane tree pollinosis, could be part of this syndrome in our area.

### Platanus acerifolia pollinosis and food allergy [^0cacc549]. Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

In Mediterranean areas, oral allergy syndrome (OAS) occurs independently of an associated birch pollinosis; moreover, on occasions it presents with no other associated pollinosis. The aim of this study was to assess the possible association of OAS with Platanus acerifolia pollinosis.

Methods

We evaluated consecutive patients seen for pollinosis in an allergy department. Seven hundred and twenty patients were selected on the basis of seasonal or perennial rhinitis, or asthma, or both. Respiratory and food allergies were studied in all patients. Clinical history was recorded and examinations and skin prick tests were performed with a battery of available common inhalant allergens and plant-derived food allergens. Specific IgE levels to P. acerifolia pollen extract and food allergens tested were measured. Molecular masses of the IgE-binding proteins and cross-reactivity among the P. acerifolia pollen and different food extracts were also determined.

Results

Of the 720 patients evaluated, 61 (8.48%) were sensitized to P. acerifolia pollen. Food allergy was observed in 32 (52.45%) of the 61 patients sensitized to P. acerifolia pollen. Food allergens most frequently implicated were hazelnuts, peach, apple, peanuts, maize, chickpea and lettuce. Enzyme allergosorbent (EAST)-inhibition showed high inhibition values when P. acerifolia pollen extract was used as free phase. On the contrary low inhibition was observed when plant-derived food allergens were used as free phase and P. acerifolia pollen extract as solid phase.

Conclusions

Cross-reactivity was observed among P. acerifolia pollen and plant-derived foods. OAS in these patients may have been caused by primary respiratory sensitization.

### Differences in the intrinsic immunogenicity and allergenicity of bet V 1 and related food allergens revealed by site-directed mutagenesis [^c5e19a33]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

To cite this article: Roulias A, Pichler U, Hauser M, Himly M, Hofer H, Lackner P, Ebner C, Briza P, Bohle B, Egger M, Wallner M, Ferreira F. Differences in the intrinsic immunogenicity and allergenicity of Bet v 1 and related food allergens revealed by site-directed mutagenesis. Allergy 2014; 69: 208–215.

Birch pollen allergies are frequently associated with adverse reactions to various fruits (i.e. pomaceous fruits, stone fruits), hazelnut, vegetables, and legumes and are generally described as pollen–food syndrome (PFS). The symptoms of PFS are mediated by cross-reactive IgE antibodies primarily directed against the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 and usually manifest themselves either locally and mildly as oral itching and swellingor, in rare occasions, systemically as urticaria or even anaphylaxis. In a recent study including 225 birch pollen-allergic patients from Austria, 73% of the patients reported Bet v 1-associated food allergies. 80% of the food-allergic patients showed hypersensitivity reactions to apple and 59.4% reacted with hazelnut; reactions to other Bet v 1-related food allergens were less frequently reported. Apple Mal d 1.0108 and hazelnut Cor a 1.0401 share 55% and 67% sequence identity with Bet v 1, respectively; however, the Bet v 1-fold seems very conserved within the whole allergen family. Successful allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) against birch pollinosis does not necessarily lead to a reduction of allergic reactions in concomitant food allergies–, possibly due to the fact that antibody epitopes of Bet v 1 and associated food allergens only converge to a certain degree. Recently, it has been shown that continuous consumption of apple can reduce OAS symptoms in allergic individuals; however, this clinical improvement failed to create enduring immunologic effects. Of note, there are even reports on patients sensitized to the Bet v 1 allergen family who only experience food-associated allergic symptoms. Thus, such data highlight the need for specific treatment of birch pollen-related food allergies. For therapy of Bet v 1-mediated birch pollen allergies, a novel derivative termed BM4 has recently been developed. The molecule was generated by computer-aided fold analysis of the Bet v 1 backbone followed by site-directed mutagenesis. This rendered BM4 unable to adopt the Bet v 1-like fold, which abolished IgE binding, and moreover, the activation of antigen-presenting cells and T-cell polarization were changed. Using this model, we investigated the effect of structural modifications on the Bet v 1-associated food allergens Mal d 1 and Cor a 1, respectively.
