## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory test the ICU nurse should anticipate the physician ordering for a patient with new-onset liquid diarrhea and abdominal pain who is currently receiving antibiotics for pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis given the clinical context. Then, I should verify the diagnostic testing strategy recommended by guidelines. Next, I will review why the alternative options are less appropriate. Finally, I will consider immediate nursing actions while awaiting results and summarize the answer.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and pretest probability. New-onset liquid diarrhea in a hospitalized ICU patient who is on antibiotics strongly raises concern for Clostridioides difficile infection, which accounts for roughly 15–25% of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and carries significant morbidity and transmission risk in healthcare settings, warranting prompt testing and infection control precautions [^115TRoAC].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before jumping ahead. The IDSA/SHEA guidance recommends obtaining a single diarrheal stool specimen to detect toxin or a toxigenic strain when CDI is suspected, and to avoid testing patients without clinically significant diarrhea to minimize false positives from colonization; this aligns with diagnostic stewardship principles emphasized by SHEA and CDC, which also caution against testing in the absence of diarrhea or within 7 days of a prior test [^113Ra2qe] [^112vzygU] [^115TRoAC].

> I should confirm the testing modality. Many hospitals use a two-step algorithm with GDH/toxin EIA plus NAAT confirmation, or NAAT alone in some settings; NAAT is highly sensitive but can detect colonization, so results must be interpreted in the right clinical context, which is why diagnostic stewardship and clinical correlation are essential in ICU patients with new diarrhea on antibiotics [^1134ZUeG] [^112vzygU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the alternatives. Blood cultures are not the priority here because the source of infection is gastrointestinal and the patient lacks new fever or systemic instability suggesting bacteremia; they would be reserved for sepsis workups rather than antibiotic-associated diarrhea evaluation, so they are not the most anticipated test in this scenario [^117MmJvs]. Urinalysis for UTI is off-target because there are no urinary symptoms and the clinical problem is diarrhea, making it an inappropriate first test in this context [^notfound]. Occult blood testing of stool is nonspecific and does not address the suspected pathogen; it would not change management when CDI is the leading concern and is not recommended as a first-line test for new watery diarrhea in a hospitalized patient on antibiotics [^notfound].

> I need to ensure we address immediate nursing actions while awaiting results. The nurse should anticipate contact precautions with gown and gloves, hand hygiene with soap and water given spore persistence, and prompt collection of a diarrheal stool specimen for CDI testing, while continuing to assess for dehydration and abdominal tenderness and documenting stool frequency and characteristics to support diagnostic stewardship and clinical decision-making [^115TRoAC] [^112vzygU].

> Let me reconsider the differential briefly to avoid anchoring. While enteral nutrition, osmotic agents, and other medications can cause diarrhea in ICU patients, the combination of new liquid stools with recent antibiotic exposure makes CDI the most urgent diagnosis to exclude because of severity and transmission risk; thus, the most appropriate anticipated order is a stool test for C. difficile using a recommended algorithm in a patient with clinically significant diarrhea [^1168yV1K] [^113Ra2qe].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the answer clearly. The ICU nurse should anticipate the physician ordering a stool test for Clostridioides difficile on a single diarrheal specimen, ideally using a two-step toxin-based algorithm or NAAT interpreted in clinical context, as this is the guideline-concordant first test for new liquid diarrhea in a patient receiving antibiotics [^113Ra2qe] [^112vzygU] [^1134ZUeG].

---

The ICU nurse should anticipate the physician ordering a **stool sample for C. difficile** [^111FMCQ1] because the patient has liquid diarrhea and is on antibiotics, which are major risk factors for C. difficile infection [^115TRoAC]. Testing should be done on a single diarrheal stool specimen using a toxin-based assay or NAAT [^113Ra2qe], and **testing should not be delayed** given the risk of severe complications in ICU patients [^116euxuc]. Blood cultures and urinalysis are not indicated for this presentation, and stool occult blood is not the priority test [^notfound].

## Clinical significance of diarrhea in ICU patients receiving antibiotics

Diarrhea is common in ICU patients receiving antibiotics, with reported incidences ranging from 14% to 50% [^115dYDEF]. Antibiotics disrupt normal gut flora, increasing the risk of **C. difficile infection (CDI)** [^115qL3Nn], a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and a significant healthcare-associated infection [^117HhFmH]. CDI ranges from mild diarrhea to severe, life-threatening colitis, particularly in critically ill patients [^114yMnwz].

---

## Risk factors for C. difficile infection in ICU patients

Several factors increase the risk of CDI in ICU patients, including:

- **Antibiotic exposure**: Particularly broad-spectrum antibiotics such as cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and carbapenems [^117HhFmH] [^115TRoAC].
- **Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)**: Commonly used in ICU patients, PPIs increase gastric pH, promoting C. difficile colonization [^114CfWMo].
- **Prolonged hospitalization**: Longer ICU stays increase exposure to healthcare-associated pathogens [^113zbCxf].
- **Immunosuppression**: Critically ill patients often have impaired immune function, increasing susceptibility to infections [^115TRoAC].

---

## Clinical guidelines for diagnosing C. difficile infection

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) provide clear guidelines for diagnosing CDI:

- **Indications for testing**: Patients with diarrhea (≥ 3 unformed stools in 24 hours) following antibiotic exposure or with healthcare-associated diarrhea should be tested for C. difficile [^111FMCQ1] [^115TRoAC].
- **Specimen collection**: A single diarrheal stool specimen is recommended for testing [^113Ra2qe].
- **Testing methods**: Toxin-based assays or nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) are recommended for accurate diagnosis [^113Ra2qe] [^1134ZUeG].
- **Avoidance of unnecessary testing**: Testing should not be performed in patients without clinically significant diarrhea or in those who have been recently tested [^112vzygU].

---

## Clinical presentation of C. difficile infection

CDI typically presents with the following symptoms, which align with the patient's current presentation:

- **Diarrhea**: Watery, unformed stools occurring three or more times per day [^114yMnwz].
- **Abdominal pain**: Cramping or discomfort, often associated with diarrhea [^1148H5Qh].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, weakness, and malaise, particularly in severe cases [^113nxxPH].

---

## Potential complications of untreated C. difficile infection

Untreated CDI can lead to severe complications, particularly in critically ill patients:

- **Pseudomembranous colitis**: Severe inflammation of the colon, potentially leading to perforation [^114yMnwz].
- **Toxic megacolon**: Life-threatening complication requiring surgical intervention [^114yMnwz].
- **Sepsis**: Systemic infection with multi-organ dysfunction [^115TRoAC].
- **Increased mortality**: Particularly in ICU patients with severe underlying conditions [^117HhFmH].

---

## Alternative diagnostic tests and their limitations

While other diagnostic tests may be considered, they are not the primary focus in this clinical scenario:

- **Blood cultures**: Not indicated unless there is suspicion of bacteremia or sepsis from another source [^1148QjvQ].
- **Urinalysis**: Not indicated in the absence of urinary symptoms or suspected urinary tract infection [^notfound].
- **Stool occult blood test**: Not specific for CDI and not recommended as a primary diagnostic tool [^notfound].

---

## Nursing implications and actions

The ICU nurse should anticipate the following actions:

- **Immediate isolation**: Implement contact precautions to prevent transmission of C. difficile [^115TRoAC].
- **Specimen collection**: Collect a single diarrheal stool sample promptly for C. difficile testing [^113Ra2qe].
- **Hydration monitoring**: Monitor for dehydration and electrolyte imbalances due to diarrhea [^115Ne5w9].
- **Medication review**: Document current antibiotic use and report to the healthcare team for potential modification [^1179KVhQ].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's current presentation — liquid diarrhea, abdominal pain, weakness, and recent antibiotic exposure — the ICU nurse should anticipate the physician ordering a **stool sample for C. difficile testing** [^113Ra2qe]. This is the most appropriate and guideline-supported diagnostic approach to confirm or exclude CDI, enabling timely management and prevention of complications [^113Ra2qe].

Pending the complete development of those above-mentioned techniques, Bouza and colleagues described simple microbiology laboratory-accessible, rapid, antimicrobial susceptibility E-tests directly on samples (lower respiratory tract or other biological specimens) to improve early appropriate in-ICU antimicrobial choices. In a prospective randomized study of 250 patients with microbiologically confirmed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), the authors showed that reporting rapid E-test-obtained antibiotic susceptibility of responsible microorganisms to the treating physicians (mean ± standard deviation: 1.4 ± 0.75 days post-sampling versus 4.2 days with standard methods) was associated with fewer days of fever and antibiotics until VAP-episode resolution, less antibiotic consumption, less Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea, lower antimicrobial costs, and fewer days on mechanical ventilation (MV).

β-Lactamase inhibitors were used in 66% of patients, and PPIs were prescribed in 48% of patients in our study. We should be aware that many physicians tended to use antibiotics containing β-lactamase inhibitors and prescribe PPIs for elderly patients as a routine practice. We should recognize the risk of AAD due to such medications, especially in combination, and avoid the unnecessary prescription of antibiotics containing β-lactamase inhibitors and PPIs for elderly patients with pneumonia. From the perspective to avoid AAD among elder patients with pneumonia or other infectious diseases, guidelines of antibiotics choice for elder patients should be reconsidered.

Consistent with previous reports, the median length of hospital stay was significantly longer in those who developed AAD. On the other hand, there was no significant difference between the in-hospital mortality and AAD in our study. Previous studies showed that mortality was significantly higher in those who developed Clostridium difficile infection. Because our hospital is an acute care hospital and patients with critical or terminal status tended to transfer to other facilities, our setting was not appropriate to investigate the relationship between AAD and mortality.

### Clinical characteristics and factors related to antibiotic-associated diarrhea in elderly patients with pneumonia: a retrospective cohort study [^111bgbpY]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

There were several limitations. First, our study design was retrospective, and thus we could not obtain information on all potential factors that were not recorded. Therefore, other risk factors might exist, but the information on medication use was well recorded, and the two risk factors in medication use were considered credible. Second, some cases of AAD could have been missed because medical staff could not recognize and record the stool properties and number of bowel movements for all patients. However, the electronic health record was equipped with standard form for diarrhea and the definition of diarrhea was liquid stool greater than 3 times for 24 h in this study. Such missed cases were less likely. In addition, such missing should be happened at random if occurred, the incidence showed the lowest data and the results of multivariable model should be credible. The length of hospital stay or in-hospital mortality could also be underestimated in our study. Third, we could not take into consideration the effects of drugs that induce diarrhea, such as NSAIDs and laxatives or probiotics that prevent or reduce diarrhea. Most of elderly patients often use such drugs or probiotics, but we considered the administration of β-lactamase inhibitors or PPIs was independent to those used such drugs or probiotics. Finally, we did not discriminate the Clostridium difficile infection from AAD. Because the detection of Clostridium difficile infection at the study hospital was Clostridium difficile antigen test which was low sensitivity, the incidence of Clostridium difficile infection was underestimated. When we analyze the Clostridium difficile precisely, we should culture all stools from AAD for Clostridium difficile but this strategy was not realistic in the daily clinical practice. Therefore, we focused on AAD general in this study.

### Duration and cessation of antimicrobial treatment [^1134Dn5r]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Shortening the duration of antimicrobial therapy is an important strategy for optimizing patient care and reducing the spread of antimicrobial resistance. It is best used in the context of an overall approach to infection management that includes a focus on selecting the right initial drug and dosing regimen for empiric therapy, and de-escalation to a more narrowly focused drug regimen (or termination) based on subsequent culture results and clinical data. In addition to reducing resistance, other potential benefits of shorter antimicrobial courses include lowered antimicrobial costs, reduced risk of superinfections (including Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea), reduced risk of antimicrobial-related organ toxicity, and improved drug compliance. There have been relatively few randomized clinical trials that study the optimal treatment durations for such serious infections as pneumonia (community- and healthcare/hospital-acquired), complicated intra-abdominal infection, and catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). Nonetheless, a growing number of studies have explored the possibilities of reducing the duration of antimicrobial therapy for at least certain patients with these infections, under certain circumstances. Professional organizations have compiled these data and used them to develop clinical practice guidelines to aid clinicians in choosing optimal treatment durations for individual patients. Many patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or healthcare-associated pneumonia can be treated for 7–8 days, while 4–7 days and 14-day treatment durations may suffice for many patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections and uncomplicated CRBSI, respectively. This article first provides a general background on the rationale and data supporting shortened courses of antimicrobial therapy, before using 3 case studies to explore the practical implications of current knowledge and treatment guidelines when making decisions about treatment duration for individual patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia, complicated intra-abdominal infection, and CRBSI.

Patients and methods

Study design

A single-center retrospective cohort study identified 498 adult patients who had an emergency department visit and required hospitalization for AGE between January 2005 and July 2015. Of these, 19 patients did not meet the inclusion criteria (see below) and were removed from the study, leaving a total of 479 patients evaluated (Fig. 1). We identified patients with AGE based on the clinical diagnosis made by the treating physician. The diagnosis was based either on the clinical presentation alone, or on the clinical presentation and imaging findings from a computed tomography scan of the abdomen, if applicable. Inclusion criteria included adult patients with diagnosis of AGE as above, older than 18 years, no history of inflammatory bowel disease, no active diagnosis of diverticulitis, active Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection, or concurrent infection (e.g. pneumonia or urinary tract) during the same admission. The primary outcome of this study was to compare the LOS in days between patients who received antibiotic therapy and patients who received supportive therapy alone. A subanalysis was performed to eliminate a potential confounder in our study, patients with a prolonged hospital stay (> 10 days) were excluded from the study and the LOS was re-measured.

Figure 1
Study design with exclusion criteria

QuadraMed Computerized Patient Record software was accessed for extraction of patient age, sex, body mass index (BMI), LOS, presenting symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody diarrhea or abdominal pain, initial vital signs including body temperature, heart rate and systolic blood pressure, laboratory tests including white cell count and lactate level, stool culture, stool leukocytes and C. difficile testing, and the antibiotic therapy administration during hospitalization. A diagnosis of presumed sepsis of enteric source was made if 2 or more of the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) were present: tachycardia (pulse > 90 beats/min), hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg), leukocytosis (white blood cell count > 12,000), fever (> 38.0°C) and increased lactate levels (when determined). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.

Rationale for best practice statements — history taking for gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in COVID-19. In outpatients with new-onset diarrhea, ascertain information about high-risk contact exposure; obtain a detailed history of symptoms associated with COVID-19, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell; and obtain a thorough history for other GI symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In outpatients with new-onset GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), monitor for symptoms associated with COVID-19, as GI symptoms may precede COVID-related symptoms by a few days, and in a high COVID-19 prevalence setting, COVID-19 testing should be considered. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain a thorough history of GI symptoms (ie, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), including onset, characteristics, duration, and severity.

Infectious diarrhea — workup when no pathogen is identified or symptoms worsen: If no pathogen has been identified, it may be reasonable to reevaluate stool and/or blood if there is evidence of systemic symptoms to evaluate for an undetected pathogen; if symptoms worsen after antibiotics, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (non–C. difficile) should be considered, and if hospitalized or with healthcare exposure, C. difficile becomes an additional consideration, particularly if there is fever or leukocytosis > 20000 cells/µL, and stool should be assessed for C. difficile toxin or a toxigenic C. difficile strain (eg, NAAT); stool also should be submitted for culture and susceptibility, and if a bacterial etiology is confirmed and antibiotics are indicated or have been used, susceptibility testing may reveal antimicrobial resistance.

Consultative management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) gastrointestinal (GI) and liver issues — best practice statements are as follows: In outpatients with new-onset diarrhea, ascertain information about high-risk contact exposure; obtain a detailed history of symptoms associated with COVID-19, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell; and obtain a thorough history for other GI symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In outpatients with new-onset GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), monitor for symptoms associated with COVID-19, as GI symptoms may precede COVID-related symptoms by a few days. In a high COVID-19 prevalence setting, COVID-19 testing should be considered. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain a thorough history of GI symptoms (ie, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), including onset, characteristics, duration, and severity. There is presently inadequate evidence to support stool testing for diagnosis or monitoring of COVID-19 as part of routine clinical practice. In patients (outpatients or inpatients) with elevated LFTs in context of suspected or known COVID-19, evaluate for alternative etiologies. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain baseline LFTs at the time of admission and consider LFT monitoring throughout the hospitalization, particularly in the context of drug treatment for COVID-19. In hospitalized patients undergoing drug treatment for COVID-19, evaluate for treatment-related GI and hepatic adverse effects.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^113heVKw]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is a frequent cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and is the most common infection in ICU patients across all geographic regions. It takes 48–72h for most patients to respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Non-response is typically defined as the persistence/worsening of clinical signs-such as fever, respiratory distress, impaired oxygenation and/or radiographic abnormalities-with rates ranging 20–30%. Several factors can contribute to non-response. Host factors, including immunosuppression, chronic lung disease, or ongoing aspiration, may impair resolution. Additionally, incorrect antibiotic dosing, atypical or resistant pathogens (such as multidrug-resistant bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or fungal infections) may be responsible, requiring alternative antimicrobial strategies. A septic complication related to pneumonia (e.g., empyema) or not (e.g., acalculous cholecystitis) may need to be excluded. Finally, non-infectious conditions (e.g., pulmonary embolism, malignancy, secondary ARDS or vasculitis) that can mimic or potentiate pneumonia must be considered. Although non-responding pneumonia is frequent, its management lacks strong evidence, and its approach is based mostly on the art of medicine and clinical judgement. Clinicians should continuously reassess the medical history and physical exam, review microbiological data, and consider imaging such as chest CT. Bronchoscopy or repeat sputum sampling may aid in identifying alternative pathogens or non-infectious causes. The management of a non-responding pneumonia depends on the findings of a structured reassessment. Herein, we provide guidance on how to identify and manage non-responding pneumonia. Ultimately, addressing pneumonia that does not respond to antibiotics is crucial for preventing complications, optimizing antimicrobial stewardship, and improving patient outcomes.

### Minimizing antibiotic exposure in the ICU: in search of the optimal strategy [^1137hKMo]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The current paradigm for antibiotic management in critically ill patients is to initiate broad-spectrum therapy followed by de-escalation based on microbiological results. Routine screening cultures may allow better targeting and reduce unnecessary exposure to antibiotics.

### A randomized controlled pilot study to evaluate the effect of an enteral formulation designed to improve gastrointestinal tolerance in the critically ill patient-the SPIRIT trial [^111M1t6k]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal dysfunction is common in critically ill patients with prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and diarrhea is one of the leading clinical symptoms. The causes of diarrhea are multifactorial and include recent abdominal surgery, infection, decreased gastrointestinal perfusion, and antibiotics. In a prospective study in patients during the first 2 weeks of ICU stay, the combination of enteral nutrition covering > 60% of the energy target and antibiotics or antifungal drugs increased the incidence of diarrhea.

The inability to absorb sufficient amounts of nutrition can increase muscle wasting and prolong recovery from critical illness. Attempts to reduce diarrhea using fiber-enriched enteral formulas have been disappointing in ICU patients. Diarrhea, independent of its reason, may predispose patients to a risk of malnutrition and development of decubitus ulcers. It causes substantial discomfort for patients and is likely to add to the workload of nurses and the cost of care.

There is a wide range of diarrhea incidence reported in recent randomized clinical studies (14%, 19–23%, 22–26%, 26–29%, and 33–92%), partly related to patient population and varying diarrhea definition. Reports on diarrhea-related costs are scarce.

We performed a pilot study to test the effect of a new enteral formula on the frequency of diarrhea and gastrointestinal tolerance, and on all diarrhea-related costs in ICU long-stayers. The purpose of the study was also to gain information for the design of a future confirmatory trial. The tested formula has a high energy density in order to reduce the necessary feeding volume, enzymatically hydrolyzed whey protein to improve absorption, and its lipid fraction contains 50% medium chain triglycerides and fish oil due to their possible benefits in inflammatory states.

### AGA rapid recommendations for gastrointestinal procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic [^1138GDn1]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 — In a cohort of 1099 hospitalized patients from China, 5.0% had nausea or vomiting and 3.8% had diarrhea. Across published cohorts, 2.0%–13.8% had diarrhea, 1.0%–10.1% had nausea or vomiting, and abdominal pain was reported in 2.2% of patients. In a cross-sectional study of 204 COVID-19–positive patients, 14.3% developed diarrhea, 3.9% experienced vomiting, and 2.0% had abdominal pain. A meta-analysis of 4243 patients suggested approximately 17.6% had any gastrointestinal (GI) symptom, including 9.2% with pain, 12.5% with diarrhea, and 10.2% with nausea/vomiting. There is evidence for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens independent of the presence of diarrhea, with reports that stool remained positive even after respiratory samples became negative, and a case with positive stool real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 RNA but negative pharyngeal swabs and sputum samples.

Intravenous therapy indications and ORS use recommendations — Isotonic intravenous fluids such as lactated Ringer's and normal saline solution should be administered when there is severe dehydration, shock, or altered mental status and failure of ORS therapy (strong, high), or ileus (strong, moderate), and in people with ketoemia an initial course of intravenous hydration may be needed to enable tolerance of oral rehydration (weak, low); in severe dehydration, intravenous rehydration should be continued until pulse, perfusion, and mental status normalize and the patient awakens, has no risk factors for aspiration, and has no evidence of ileus, after which the remaining deficit can be replaced by using ORS (weak, low); additionally, infants, children, and adults with mild to moderate dehydration should receive ORS until clinical dehydration is corrected (strong, low), and once rehydrated, maintenance fluids should be administered with ongoing stool losses replaced with ORS until diarrhea and vomiting are resolved (strong, low).

### A randomized controlled pilot study to evaluate the effect of an enteral formulation designed to improve gastrointestinal tolerance in the critically ill patient-the SPIRIT trial [^115dYDEF]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Previous studies have reported diarrhea incidences ranging from around 15% to over 50%. Some of the differences can be explained by a differing case mix and definition of diarrhea. The patients in the present study had several risk factors for diarrhea which were likely to contribute to the observed high diarrhea incidence: use of a hyperosmolar formula in both study groups; a relatively high administration rate of the enteral nutrition; the presence of hypoalbuminemia in all study patients; and frequent use of antibiotics in 77% of patients.

The composition of enteral feeding had no effect on diarrhea or feeding tolerance. The higher protein content of the new formula was aimed to facilitate higher protein intake, as recommended by recent guidelines. The relevance of protein intake in ICU patients remains controversial. Fewer surgical ICU patients with deficits in protein intake during enteral nutrition were discharged home. In patients with pneumonia and/or sepsis, higher protein administration decreased mortality. In contrast, a recent trial in patients with acute lung injury was stopped prematurely because administration of higher percentages of estimated protein (76% vs. 54%) and energy needs (85% vs. 55%) increased hospital mortality despite unchanged length of mechanical ventilation or infection rates. An enteral diet rich in medium-chain triglycerides, carnitine, and taurine increased protein and energy intake and reduced feeding intolerance and diarrhea in a single-blind study in ICU patients with overall lower diarrhea incidence than in our study. In our study, the differences in protein intake between the study groups were substantial, but were not associated with differences in diarrhea incidence or any of the secondary clinical outcomes.

There are limited data on resource use for patients with diarrhea, and the few published studies focus on Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea. For example, a multicenter retrospective study reporting adjusted outcomes found longer ICU (8.3 days vs. 6.6 days; p < 0.01) and hospital stay (13.2 days vs. 8.5 days; p < 0.01) and almost 40% increased total cost for patients with compared to those without C. difficile -associated diarrhea. Nursing workload for diarrhea care has not been addressed so far. In our study, with a low incidence of C. difficile, the average nursing workload for diarrhea care was more than 3 h/patient, with a moderate increase in material costs. However, also in our study, patients with diarrhea spent more days on mechanical ventilation and in the ICU compared to those without. This finding emphasizes the need for more research on potentially preventable factors associated with diarrhea.

### Diarrhoea in the ICU: respective contribution of feeding and antibiotics [^112y5PUi]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Characteristics of the included patients

Among the 422 patients admitted to the ICU during the study period (2,038 patient-days), 278 were consecutively included (Figure 1). A total of 1,595 patient-days were analysed after exclusion of diarrhoea days occurring during the first 24 hours in the ICU, of diarrhoea days occurring during the 48 hours following laxative treatment, or of C. difficile infection. EN, antibiotics, antifungal drugs, immunosuppressants, and prokinetics were observed during the 48 hours preceding the analysed patient-day in 69%, 62%, 11%, 5%, and 5% of patient-days, respectively. Patients' characteristics according to the presence or absence of at least 1 day of diarrhoea are shown in Table 1. Those with diarrhoea were characterised by a higher proportion of females, respiratory and gastrointestinal diagnoses, and low BMI. Patients with diarrhoea had a more severe disease: high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and SAPS II at admission, high proportion of bedsores, and longer ICU length of stay. Age and medical or surgical types of diagnosis were not significantly different between the two groups.

### Diarrhoea in the ICU: respective contribution of feeding and antibiotics [^112JXuk4]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The incidence of diarrhoea is 14% during the first 2 weeks in a mixed population of patients in a tertiary referral ICU. Delivering more than 60% of the energy target by EN, antibiotics, and antifungal drugs are diarrhoea risk factors. Diarrhoea risk is further increased when EN covering more than 60% of the energy target is combined with antibiotics or antifungal drugs. Studies are needed to better understand diarrhoea physiopathology when EN and antibiotics or antifungal drugs are combined in ICU patients in order to optimise the clinical care and cost management.

### Diarrhoea in the ICU: respective contribution of feeding and antibiotics [^113PzoVj]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Key messages

- EN is a diarrhoea risk factor only when covering at least 60% of the energy target.

- The combination of antibiotics or antifungal drugs with EN delivering more than 60% of the energy target markedly increased the risk of diarrhoea.

- Of ICU patients, 14% experience at least 1 day of diarrhoea.

- Of diarrhoea episodes, 89% last 4 days or less.

- C. difficile infection was an infrequent cause of diarrhoea: incidence of 0.7%.

### Antibiotic use in sepsis: how and why less can really mean more (survival) [^111RT4SW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the Journal, Kyriazopoulou and colleagues (pp.) describe a multicenter, open-label study, the PROGRESS (Procalcitonin-guided Antimicrobial Therapy to Reduce Long-Term Sequelae of Infections) trial, of 266 patients meeting sepsis 3 criteria, which compared PCT-guided therapy to standard care and also found a significant benefit in mortality reduction, with a plausible mechanism for this benefit. In the study, antibiotic discontinuation was recommended when PCT was below 0.5 μg/L or when there was a reduction of at least 80% from the baseline at Day 5 or later. PCT-guided discontinuation was followed 76.8% of the time in a setting where 98% of all patients received appropriate therapy (presumably because of a 4% rate of multidrug-resistant [MDR] pathogens) and led to a significant reduction in infection-associated adverse events at 180 days. This was the primary endpoint, and it consisted of a composite of new infection or death caused by MDR pathogens or Clostridium difficile. Although fecal colonization rates at 7 and 28 days were similar in both groups, colonized patients, particularly those with C. difficile or MDR pathogens getting standard care (but not those getting PCT guidance) developed a higher rate of infection-associated adverse events. These data suggest that PCT-guided early discontinuation of antibiotics can prevent intestinal colonization from progressing to clinical infection. Patients in the study had a mixture of infections, with 62% because of pneumonia, 37% with pyelonephritis, and 1% with primary bloodstream infection. Although all met sepsis 3 criteria, 7% had septic shock, and 16% had positive blood cultures.

Mortality at 28 days, a secondary endpoint, was significantly lower (15.2% vs. 28.2%; P = 0.02) with PCT guidance, with a trend toward significant reduction in 180-day mortality (P = 0.24). Cost of care and length of antibiotic therapy were also lower in the PCT-guided group. The findings in the PROGRESS study extend the observations of the SAPS study in a number of important ways. They show a mortality benefit of biomarker-guided antibiotic therapy in a population of patients with sepsis who are not exclusively in the ICU and have a lower predicted mortality than in ICU patients. The data also helped to define a potential mechanism for mortality benefit — the avoidance of infection-associated adverse events, particularly the prevention diarrhea and acute renal injury.

### Antimicrobial de-escalation strategies in hospitalized patients with pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, and bacteremia [^114f9aMK]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Increasing numbers of serious hospital/healthcare- or community-acquired infections are caused by resistant (often multi-drug resistant) bacterial pathogens. Because delayed or ineffective initial therapy can have severe negative consequences, patients at risk for these types of infections typically receive initial empiric antibiotic therapy with a broad-spectrum regimen covering the most likely pathogens, based on local surveillance data and risk factors for infection with a resistant microorganism. While improving the likelihood of a successful outcome, use of broad-spectrum, often high-dose, empiric antimicrobial therapy also creates pressure for the selection or development of resistant microorganisms, as well as increasing costs and possibly exposing patients to adverse events or collateral damage such as Clostridium difficile-associated disease. De-escalation is a strategy that attempts to balance the competing aims of providing initial empiric therapy that is appropriate and covers the likely pathogens, and limiting antimicrobial exposure and increased risk for emergence of resistant pathogens. More specifically, the de-escalation strategy involves collection of cultures for later microbiological assessment before initiating broad-spectrum empiric therapy covering the most likely pathogens, with the intention of streamlining or de-escalating to a more narrow-spectrum antimicrobial regimen 2–3 days later if warranted by clinical status and culture results. In some cases, negative culture results and subsequent clinical review may allow for termination of initial empiric therapy. In this manner, de-escalation enables more effective targeting of the causative pathogen(s), elimination of redundant therapy, a decrease in antimicrobial pressure for emergence of resistance, and cost savings. This article examines application of the de-escalation strategy to 3 case patients, one with healthcare-associated pneumonia, another with complicated intra-abdominal infection, and a third with central line-associated bacteremia.

Epidemiology of diarrhoea

During the 14 first ICU days, at least 1 day of diarrhoea was observed in 14% of patients (Tables 1 and 2). Among the 278 included patients, 42 were sought for a C. difficile infection at least once during their ICU stay, but the infection was diagnosed in only two (overall incidence of 0.7%). Out of 1,595 patient-days, 83 were associated with diarrhoea: the diarrhoea incidence rate was 5.2 per 100 patient-days (Table 2). The median day of diarrhoea onset was the sixth day after admission. Table 2 shows the median number of diarrhoea incidents per patient, the median number of liquid stools per diarrhoea, and the median day of diarrhoea onset during the 14 first days in the ICU. Figure 2 reports the number of days with diarrhoea per patient. In 89% of patients, ≤ 4 diarrhoea days were observed during the ICU stay.

Figure 2

### Are quantitative cultures useful in the diagnosis of hospital-acquired pneumonia? [^113suXPU]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Noninvasive and invasive tests have been developed and studied for their utility in diagnosing and guiding the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia, a condition with an inherently high mortality. Early empiric antibiotic treatment has been shown to reduce mortality, so delaying this treatment until test results are available is not justifiable. Furthermore, tailoring therapy based on results of either noninvasive or invasive tests has not been clearly shown to affect morbidity and mortality. This may be related to quantitative limitations of these tests or possibly to a high false-negative rate in patients who receive early antibiotic treatment and may therefore have suppressed bacterial counts. Results of these tests, however, do influence treatment. It is therefore hoped that they may ultimately provide a rational basis for making therapeutic decisions. In the future, outcomes research should be a part of large-scale clinical trials, and noninvasive and invasive tests should be incorporated into the design in an attempt to provide a better understanding of the value of such tests.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Bactrim DS) [^1148veyB]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients

Hypersensitivity and Other Serious or Fatal Reactions: Advise patients to stop taking BACTRIM immediately if they experience any clinical signs such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura or jaundice and to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Antibacterial Resistance: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Crystalluria and Stone Formation: Advise patients to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation.

Diarrhea: Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Laboratory Tests

Complete blood counts and clinical chemistry testing should be done frequently in patients receiving BACTRIM. Perform urinalyses with careful microscopic examination and renal function tests during therapy, particularly for those patients with impaired renal function. Discontinue BACTRIM if a significant electrolyte abnormality, renal insufficiency or reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted.

Drug Interactions

Potential for BACTRIM to Affect Other Drugs

Trimethoprim is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 as well as OCT2 transporter. Sulfamethoxazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9. Avoid coadministration of BACTRIM with drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8 and 2C9 or OCT2.

### Sleeping with the enemy: Clostridium difficile infection in the intensive care unit [^114yF6Fe]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

About 10% of patients with diarrhea will test positive for CDI. Around 2% of ICU patients develop an episode of CDI.
Estimating the severity of CDI is essential for prognosis and therapy. Diagnosis and estimation of disease severity and progression are even more complicated in the ICU setting and should be assisted by clinical prediction tools (i.e. ATLAS score). Current diagnostic algorithms may lead to an underestimation of CDI severity in ICU patients.
Testing should include direct toxin testing by ELISA. We do not consider the isolated detection of C. difficile via PCR sufficient to make the diagnosis of CDI.
10 to 20% of patients show an asymptomatic colonization with C. difficile without disease symptoms. The prognostic consequence for the asymptomatic carrier is not clear.
Oral and, if needed, topical application of vancomycin is still the backbone of antibiotic treatment.
Early recognition of treatment failure is still an unresolved clinical problem. In the case of treatment failure, alternative treatments include substituting vancomycin with fidaxomycin, tigecycline, a combination of intravenous metronidazole and vancomycin, immunoglobulins, and FMT.
Preventative measures and an acute awareness of risk factors should be a priority in every ICU. The clinical team should be aware of the individual risk profile of each patient for developing CDI while in the ICU. Where possible, this risk should be minimized using a set of preventive bundles. These should include involving an ID specialist and reducing or terminating antibiotic therapy, discontinuation or replacement of PPI therapy, and increased and predefined hygienic measures

De escalation approach in critically ill patients

The rise in antibiotic resistance in the ICU poses serious problems for the management of critically ill patients. The choice of empiric antibiotic therapy can have a significant impact on patient outcome when resistant pathogens may be involved. Empiric antimicrobial therapy for patients with severe sepsis or septic shock may be ineffective if the responsible organism is not susceptible to available antibiotics. Therefore, attention has been focused on the need for strategies to combat antibiotic resistance in the ICU.

In critically ill patients a de escalation approach may be recommended. For years antibiotic therapy has been started with a basic agent and only once microbiological culture results and susceptibility tests were available, more potent compounds were used. The traditional approach, however, may no longer be appropriate for critically ill patients in the current era of increasing antibiotic resistance.

Rising resistance rates and better understanding of the inflammatory process prompted some experts to advocate initial therapy with broad-spectrum, initially in severe pneumonias.

This two-stage approach of using aggressive initial therapy followed by de-escalation allows serious infection to be treated immediately and effectively avoiding antibiotic overuse, potential resistance and excessive costs.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on fecal microbiota-based therapies for select gastrointestinal diseases [^111Rfr6P]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — A CDI diagnosis requires acute-onset, clinically significant, new-onset diarrhea (eg, 3 or more unformed stools in 24 hours) with highly sensitive testing in combination with highly specific testing plus improvement of diarrhea with C difficile–directed antibiotics; a positive nucleic acid amplification test alone in the appropriate clinical context is also reasonable for making a CDI diagnosis. Recurrent CDI is typically defined as clinically significant diarrhea with a confirmatory positive test within 8 weeks of completing antibiotics for CDI. In patients with recurrent diarrhea after CDI treatment, consider alternative diagnoses, especially when symptoms are atypical or there is no response to vancomycin or fidaxomicin.

Fluid management in infectious diarrhea — Isotonic intravenous fluids such as lactated Ringer's and normal saline solution should be administered when there is severe dehydration, shock, or altered mental status and failure of oral rehydration solution (ORS) therapy (strong, high) or ileus (strong, moderate). In people with ketoemia, an initial course of intravenous hydration may be needed to enable tolerance of oral rehydration (weak, low). In severe dehydration, intravenous rehydration should be continued until pulse, perfusion, and mental status normalize and the patient awakens, has no risk factors for aspiration, and has no evidence of ileus (strong, low), after which the remaining deficit can be replaced by using ORS (weak, low). Infants, children, and adults with mild to moderate dehydration should receive ORS until clinical dehydration is corrected (strong, low), and once rehydrated, maintenance fluids should be administered with replacement of ongoing stool losses with ORS until diarrhea and vomiting are resolved (strong, low).

### A focus on intra-abdominal infections [^112Ld3SB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Tigecycline maintains satisfactory profiles of safety and efficacy in treatment of multidrug resistant bacteria, in complicated intra-abdominal infections. Judicious use of antibiotics for multidrug resistant pathogens is important to preserve their effectiveness, and tigecycline is one of the few available compounds active against multidrug resistant strains. It may be more suitable to use tigecycline for empiric or definitive treatment of patients with high risk intra-abdominal infections. Combinations with other broad-spectrum antibiotics may be suitable in critically ill patients or in patients with health-care infections known or suspected to be owing to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Adequate therapy

Adequate indications and duration of therapy are particularly important. Inadequate duration of treatment is probably the main inappropriate use of antibiotics in surgical practice and the intensive care unit. Antimicrobial therapy for established infections should be continued until normalization of clinical signs of infection occurs, including normalization of temperature and WBC count. If clinical signs and symptoms persist after a reasonable course of antibiotic therapy, another infectious cause should be sought rather than prolonging antibiotic treatment for the initial infection.

Unnecessary broad coverage or prolonged therapy can carry high costs, toxicities of therapy and Clostridium difficile colitis superinfection. Clostridium difficile causes 15%-25% of all cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the severity of which ranges from mild diarrhea to fulminant pseudomembranous colitis.

Over the past years, some Authors have investigated procalcitonin (PCT) to guide duration of antibiotic therapy. Currently, procalcitonin (PCT) has emerged as a laboratory variable that allows early differentiation between SIRS and sepsis. It was recently been used to guide antibiotic treatment in medical patients with pulmonary diseases.

### Diarrhea in critically ill patients: the role of enteral feeding [^114R94QJ]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

This tutorial presents a systematic approach to the management of diarrhea in the critical care setting. Diarrhea is a common and prevalent problem in critically ill patients. Despite the high prevalence, its management is far from simple. Professionals are confronted with a myriad of definitions based on frequency, consistency, and volume. The causes are complex and multifactorial, yet enteral tube feeding formula is believed to be the perpetrator. Potential causes for diarrhea are discussed, and 3 case reports provide context to examine the treatment from a nutrition perspective. Each scenario is comprehensively addressed discussing potential causes and providing specific clinical strategies contributing to improved bowel function in this patient group. The approach used for diarrhea management is based on a complete understanding of enteral tube formula, their composition, and their impact in the presence of gut dysfunction. Choosing the right feeding formula may positively influence bowel function and contribute to improved nutrition.

### Critical care management of the patient with Clostridioides difficile [^117HhFmH]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To review published clinical evidence on management of Clostridioides difficile infection in critically ill patients.

Data Sources

We obtained relevant studies from a PubMed literature review and bibliographies of reviewed articles.

Study Selection

We selected English-language studies addressing aspects of C. difficile infection relevant to critical care clinicians including epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, with a focus on high-quality clinical evidence.

Data Extraction

We reviewed potentially relevant studies and abstracted information on study design, methods, patient selection, and results of relevant studies. This is a synthetic (i.e., not systematic) review.

Data Synthesis

C. difficile infection is the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States. Antibiotics are the most significant C. difficile infection risk factor, and among antibiotics, cephalosporins, clindamycin, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, and piperacillin-tazobactam confer the highest risk. Age, diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease, and end-stage renal disease are risk factors for C. difficile infection development and mortality. C. difficile infection diagnosis is based on testing appropriately selected patients with diarrhea or on clinical suspicion for patients with ileus. Patients with fulminant disease (C. difficile infection with hypotension, shock, ileus, or megacolon) should be treated with oral vancomycin and IV metronidazole, as well as rectal vancomycin in case of ileus. Patients who do not respond to initial therapy should be considered for fecal microbiota transplant or surgery. Proper infection prevention practices decrease C. difficile infection risk.

Conclusions

Strong clinical evidence supports limiting antibiotics when possible to decrease C. difficile infection risk. For patients with fulminant C. difficile infection, oral vancomycin reduces mortality, and adjunctive therapies (including IV metronidazole) and interventions (including fecal microbiota transplant) may benefit select patients. Several important questions remain regarding fulminant C. difficile infection management, including which patients benefit from fecal microbiota transplant or surgery.

Materials and methods

Patients

Patients were eligible for inclusion in this prospective study if they presented, during the period from 1 June 2003 to 29 February 2004, with a oral temperature of 38.5°C or greater to the adult ED of a 1800-bed academic tertiary care hospital. Patients younger than 15 years were excluded. Immunocompromised status was not an exclusion criterion. The study was approved by the ethical committee of our hospital (Comité de Protection des Personnes Pitié-Salpêtrière, Paris, France). All patients gave written informed consent.

After evaluation in the emergency room, each patient was examined by a senior physician. Blood sampling and radiological examinations were ordered in accordance with routine care apart from blood chemistry, which in all patients included a sample for PCT measurement. Microbiological work up varied according to infectious clinical focus but included, in all patients, one pair of blood culture and urinary analysis. The emergency physician completed a standardized form for each patient, including co-morbidity, vital signs, putative source of infection, prior antibiotic therapy before ED consultation, and presence or absence of headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, myalgia, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, dry cough, polyadenopathy and rash. The form ended with the emergency physician's diagnostic suspicion, antibiotic prescription and patient course (not admitted or admitted to a medical, surgical, or intensive care unit [ICU] bed). PCT results were not available at this time.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Sulfatrim) [^114C8b3A]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients

Hypersensitivity and Other Serious Reactions: Advise patients to stop taking Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim immediately if they experience any clinical signs such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura, or jaundice and to contact their health care provider as soon as possible (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Antibacterial Resistance: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Crystalluria and Stone Formation: Advise patients to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation.

Diarrhea: Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with and without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Laboratory tests

Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim; if a significant reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be discontinued. Urinalyses with careful microscopic examination and renal function tests should be performed during therapy, particularly for those patients with impaired renal function.

SHEA Choosing Wisely — antibiotic initiation advises: "Do not start antibiotics without evaluating the patient for bacterial infection and determining that antibiotics are needed to treat the infection". The page explains that "Antibiotics increase the risk for C. difficile infection and other patient harms. Antibiotics also can affect the body's microbiome and contribute to antibiotic resistance", and that "Many patients are given antibiotics unnecessarily, primarily for misdiagnosed urinary tract infections or pneumonia. Antibiotics should never be given to a patient who does not need them". Harms noted include that antibiotics "can cause adverse drug reactions, disrupt the body's microbiome, increase antibiotic resistance, and increase the risk for a patient to get Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile (C. difficile) infection", with "C. difficile infection" described as "a life-threatening illness that can occur when antibiotics kill normal bacteria in the intestine". The page states that "Patients recovering from C. difficile infections are three times more likely to have a recurrence of C. difficile infection if they take an antibiotic within a month", that "Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a rising cause of death of hospitalized patients", and that "Some studies have linked exposure to antibiotics to other medical problems even beyond the period when a person has an infection, such as asthma in childhood".

### Direct E-test (AB biodisk) of respiratory samples improves antimicrobial use in ventilator-associated pneumonia [^117U1sza]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Ventilator-associated pneumonia is the most frequently observed nosocomial infection in intensive care units, and it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Early microbiological diagnosis and the initial administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy are associated with decreased mortality and potentially reduced costs. Our study evaluates the clinical and financial impact of performing rapid antimicrobial susceptibility tests directly on samples obtained from the lower respiratory tract.

Methods

A prospective, randomized study was performed over a 2-year period. Patients who had a lower respiratory tract infection that was acquired during mechanical ventilation and for whom samples obtained from the respiratory tract were sent for culture were randomized to 1 of 2 groups. Samples were cultured for the control group, and results were reported using standard procedures. Samples were also cultured for the test subject group using standard procedures, but in addition, a rapid antibiogram was immediately performed by placing E-test antibiotic strips (AB Biodisk) directly on respiratory tract samples. Patients in the E-test group received a preliminary laboratory report when it became available. The 2 patient groups were compared according to the following variables: type and severity of underlying conditions, total days of antimicrobial use, number of defined daily doses, cost of acquisition of the antimicrobial agent per episode, days of fever, days receiving mechanical ventilation, days in the intensive care unit, incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, and mortality.

Results

Reporting a rapid E-test was associated with fewer days of fever, fewer days of antibiotic administration until resolution of the episode of ventilator-associated pneumonia, decreased antibiotic consumption, less C. difficile-associated diarrhea, lower costs of antimicrobial agents, and fewer days receiving mechanical ventilation.

Conclusions

A rapid E-test of respiratory tract samples improves antimicrobial use in cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

### Impact of microbiome-based interventions on gastrointestinal pathogen colonization in the intensive care unit [^117MSUhU]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Probiotics

Probiotics are live, ingestible microorganisms that can confer health benefits on to their host. The mechanisms by which these symbionts may deter pathogen colonization include competition, reduction of gut pH, enhancement of innate and adaptive immunity, and production of antimicrobial substances. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have evaluated the benefits of probiotics in critically ill patients. – Probiotic administration has been associated with several favorable infection-related outcomes, including reduced incidence of overall infections, and in ICU-acquiredand ventilator-associated pneumonia.

At least 5 randomized-controlled studies with 48–208 patients have investigated the effects of Lactobacillus -based probiotics on gut colonization in adult ICU patients. The first study investigated the impact of a probiotic drink containing 5 × 10 7 colony-forming units (CFU) per mL of Lactobacillus plantarum, on gastric colonization via nasogastric aspirate at days 1, 4, and 8 of ICU admission. The study enrolled 103 patients and also investigated intestinal permeability, endotoxin exposure, inflammatory marker levels, and overall sepsis morbidity and mortality. No difference was detected in pathogen colonization related to the intervention. The probiotic group did exhibit significantly lower interleukin-6 levels at day 15 compared with controls, however clinical outcomes, i.e. sepsis complications and mortality, were unaffected.

Another study investigated the effect of L. plantarum 299v on Clostridioides difficile colonization in 48 ICU non-colonized patients. Around 19% of control patients had positive rectal swabs for C. difficile by ICU discharge compared with zero C. difficile- positive patients in the probiotic treatment group. They concluded that probiotic supplementation could reduce C. difficile colonization rates in the ICU but that interpretation of these results should be taken with caution given the study's small sample size and premature termination due to loss of funding. A more recent study investigating the feasibility of a L. casei drink found a nonsignificant trend towards lower rates of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and C. difficile among ICU patients receiving antibiotics compared with a contemporary control. The efficacy of other probiotic strains for the treatment and prevention of C. difficile, including Saccromyces boulardii, has been reviewed elsewhere. – Systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggest (with moderate certainty) that probiotics are effective for preventing C. difficile -associated diarrhea, though few studies have specifically studied C. difficile prevention using probiotics in the ICU. In appropriately selected high-risk populations, probiotics probably do decrease C. difficile incidence, but the effect size is likely small and the optimal probiotic is unknown.

### Clostridium difficile among hospitalized patients receiving antibiotics: a case-control study [^113zbCxf]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of infectious nosocomial diarrhea and can be found in up to 30% of asymptomatic hospitalized patients. Our primary aim was to compare the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients who received antibiotics and developed C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) with those of hospitalized patients who received antibiotics and did not develop the disease.

Design

Case-control study comprising inpatients at a single institution.

Patients

Case-patients were defined as patients who had diarrhea and tested positive for C. difficile. Control-patients (matched 4:1 to case-patients) were defined as patients who received antibiotics for at least 5 days and did not develop CDAD.

Results

On univariate analysis, nine variables were associated with CDAD. Only three of the variables, need for intensive care, length of stay, and macrolide antibiotic use, were found to be significant (P < .05) on logistic regression analysis. The odds ratios for status as a CDAD case were 3.68 (CI95, 1.44 to 9.40) for stay in the intensive care unit and 1.03 (CI95, 1.02 to 1.05) for each day of hospital stay. Receipt of macrolide antibiotics reduced risk significantly; the odds ratio was 0.23 (CI95, 0.19 to 0.87).

Conclusions

We identified need for intensive care and length of stay as important risk factors for the development of CDAD. We also identified macrolide antibiotic use as protective against its development. Patients receiving intensive care may represent a population to study for targeted prophylaxis.

### Gastrointestinal function in intensive care patients: terminology, definitions and management. recommendations of the ESICM working group on abdominal problems [^1122dXsy]. Intensive Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

Several key elements were used as a starting point for defining acute GI organ failure. An organ failure was considered as a dichotomous event that is either present or absent, whereas organ dysfunction is a continuum of physiologic derangement. The expression "GI dysfunction" is used to describe the large variety of GI symptoms (diarrhoea, vomiting) and diagnoses (gastroenteritis) outside of the ICU setting; therefore, the expression "acute GI injury" was introduced.

Current definitions and management recommendations (according to Table 1 ;) were developed on the basis of the available evidence and current understanding of the pathophysiology. Definitions serve as expert opinion, with their reasoning given in each "rationale" subsection.

The working method is described in detail in the electronic supplementary file.

### Clinical recognition and diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection [^116euxuc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Prompt and precise diagnosis is an important aspect of effective management of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). CDI causes 15%-25% of all cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the severity of which ranges from mild diarrhea to fulminant pseudomembranous colitis. Several factors, especially advanced age and hospitalization, should be considered in the diagnosis of CDI. In particular, nosocomial diarrhea arising > 72 hours after admission among patients receiving antibiotics is highly likely to have resulted from CDI. Testing of stool for the presence of C. difficile toxin confirms the diagnosis of CDI. However, performance of an enzyme immunoassay is the usual method by which CDI is confirmed, but this test appears to be relatively insensitive, compared with the cell cytotoxicity assay and stool culture for toxigenic C. difficile on selective medium. Endoscopy and computed tomography are less sensitive than stool toxin assays but may be useful when immediate results are important or other confounding conditions rank high in the differential diagnosis. Often overlooked aspects of this diagnosis are high white blood cell counts (which are sometimes in the leukemoid range) and hypoalbuminemia.

### Advances in the management of pneumonia in the intensive care unit: review of current thinking [^115JQknA]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Interventions to prevent pneumonia in the intensive care unit should combine multiple measures targeting the invasive devices, microorganisms and protection of the patient. Microbiological investigation is useful for evaluating the quality of the respiratory sample, and permits early modification of the regimen in light of the microbiological findings. Once pneumonia develops, the appropriateness of the initial antibiotic regimen is a vital determinant of outcome. Three questions should be formulated: (1) is the patient at risk of acquiring methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, (2) is Acinetobacter baumannii a problem in the institution, and (3) is the patient at risk of acquiring Pseudomonas aeruginosa? Antibiotic therapy should be started immediately and must circumvent any pathogen resistance mechanisms developed after previous antibiotic exposure. Therefore, antibiotic choice should be institution-specific and patient-oriented.

### Randomized trial of combination versus monotherapy for the empiric treatment of suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia [^112MQQz9]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare a strategy of combination therapy with a strategy of monotherapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected late ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Design

Randomized trial.

Setting

Twenty-eight intensive care units in Canada and the United States.

Patients

The study included 740 mechanically ventilated patients who developed suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia after 96 hrs in the intensive care unit. Patients known to be colonized or infected with Pseudomonas or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or who were immunocompromised were excluded from the study.

Interventions

As initial unblinded therapy, patients were allocated to receive meropenem (1 g every 8 hrs) and ciprofloxacin (400 mg every 12 hrs) or meropenem alone. Before starting antibiotics, patients were also randomized to bronchoalveolar lavage with quantitative cultures or endotracheal aspirates. When culture results were available, physicians were encouraged to adjust antibiotics. Adequacy of antibiotics was defined as the organism present in the enrollment culture having in vitro susceptibility to one or more of the study antibiotics.

Measurements and Main Results

Baseline characteristics and etiologies of ventilator-associated pneumonia were similar in the two groups. There was no difference in 28-day mortality between the combination and monotherapy groups (relative risk = 1.05, 95% confidence interval 0.78–1.42, p = .74). Duration of intensive care unit and hospital stay, clinical and microbiological treatment response, emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, isolation of Clostridium difficile in stool, and fungal colonization were also similar in the two groups. In a subgroup of patients who had infection due to Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, and multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli at enrollment (n = 56), the adequacy of initial antibiotics (84.2% vs. 18.8%, p < .001) and microbiological eradication of infecting organisms (64.1% vs. 29.4%, p = .05) was higher in the combination group compared with the monotherapy group, but there were no differences in clinical outcomes.

Conclusions

For critically ill patients who have suspected late ventilator-associated pneumonia and who are at low risk for difficult-to-treat gram-negative bacteria, monotherapy is associated with similar outcomes compared with combination therapy. For those patients at high risk of difficult-to-treat gram-negative bacteria, combination therapy is safe and may be associated with better microbiological and clinical outcomes.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) testing in people with HIV — population selection and criteria — the diagnosis of CDI can be made only through careful selection of the correct population for testing and a correlation of clinical and laboratory findings, and populations at risk for C. difficile diarrhea include individuals who recently received or currently are receiving antibiotics (including antimicrobial prophylaxis) or cancer chemotherapy; those who have been hospitalized in the past 4 to 6 weeks (or currently are hospitalized); those who reside in a long-term care facility; those with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3; those taking acid-suppressive medications; and those with moderate-to-severe community-acquired diarrhea. Only people with diarrhea (defined as three or more loose stools in 24 hours) should be tested for CDI to limit detection of asymptomatic colonization, and only stool samples that take the shape of the container (i.e., diarrheal) should be tested.

### Successful treatment with fecal microbiota transplantation in patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and diarrhea following severe sepsis [^1157gpQh]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

On the 20th day of hospitalization, the patient developed septic shock. Antibiotics were changed to imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin, while itraconazole was continued. The patient then had progressive diarrhea on average 6–12 times a day, with a total volume of 1000–2200 mL per day, with stool of a pasty jam consistency. We carried out comprehensive bacteriological investigations, including stool bacterial culture and fungal culture, and tested for Clostridium difficile toxin A and B. All results were negative. The fecal bacteria population was analyzed, and the results indicated severely perturbed intestinal microflora. Based on the above findings, this patient was rendered a good candidate for treatment with FMT. Therefore, FMT was performed once, and the anti-infection therapy was stopped.

Case 2: an 84-year-old male patient with right-sided weakness and fever was admitted. CT confirmed the presence of cerebral infarction near the left lateral ventricle and pulmonary infection. The patient was then transferred to ICU due to infection-induced respiratory failure. His blood cultures now yielded Burkholderia cepacia. Antibiotics were changed from imipenem/cilastatin to cefoperazone/sulbactam. On the fourth day of hospitalization, fluconazol was added due to the discovery of pseudohyphae in the sputum. The pneumonia improved, but the patient suffered from fever and diarrhea after the use of multiple antibiotics. The anti-infection therapy was ineffective. In addition, metronidazole, probiotics, and loperamide were useless in treating the diarrhea. Consequently, the patient's fever persisted, and he progressed to MODS. His APACHE II score was 20. Continuous hemofiltration was given for aggravated renal failure on the seventh day of hospitalization. The patient had diarrhea 4–8 times a day, with a total stool volume of 1000–2000 mL per day. We carried out comprehensive bacteriological investigations for this patient too, including stool bacterial culture and fungal culture, and tested for C. difficile toxin A and B. All results were negative. As was the case for the first patient, analysis of the fecal bacteria indicated severe microflora imbalance and thus, a likelihood of successful treatment with FMT. Based on the experience of treating the first patient, the same FMT regimen was administered to this patient.

### Diarrhoea in the ICU: respective contribution of feeding and antibiotics [^116VeJrx]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Based on older studies, C. difficile infection is always suspected when diarrhoea occurs in the ICU, mainly in patients with antibiotics. In our tertiary ICU, a low incidence of C. difficile infection (0.7%) was observed. This is in accordance with studies that found no C. difficile infection in cohorts of 39 and 72 ICU patients with diarrhoea, respectively. These results indicate that C. difficile infection is nowadays a rare cause of diarrhoea in the ICU. However, because of its potentially severe consequences and transmission, C. difficile infection has to be sought in case of diarrhoea in ICU patients.

In this study, antifungal or antibiotics drugs were identified as independent risk factors for diarrhoea. However, the analysis of the contribution of the different classes of antibiotics was not possible because the study samples were too small. This limitation has to be addressed in future studies.

### Antimicrobial stewardship approaches in the intensive care unit [^112ZfEVZ]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship programs aim to monitor, improve, and measure responsible antibiotic use. The intensive care unit (ICU), with its critically ill patients and prevalence of multiple drug-resistant pathogens, presents unique challenges. This article reviews approaches to stewardship with application to the ICU, including the value of diagnostics, principles of empirical and definitive therapy, and measures of effectiveness. There is good evidence that antimicrobial stewardship results in more appropriate antimicrobial use, shorter therapy durations, and lower resistance rates. Data demonstrating hard clinical outcomes, such as adverse events and mortality, are more limited but encouraging; further studies are needed.

During treatment, adequate fluid intake and urinary output should be ensured to prevent crystalluria. Patients who are "slow acetylators" may be more prone to idiosyncratic reactions to sulfonamides.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold).

When sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Patients should be instructed to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation.

Antibacterial Resistance: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Crystalluria and Stone Formation: Advise patients to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation.

Diarrhea: Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Laboratory Tests

Complete blood counts and clinical chemistry testing should be done frequently in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Perform urinalyses with careful microscopic examination and renal function tests during therapy, particularly for those patients with impaired renal function. Discontinue sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim if a significant electrolyte abnormality, renal insufficiency or reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted.

Drug Interactions

Potential for Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim to Affect Other Drugs

Trimethoprim is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 as well as OCT2 transporter. Sulfamethoxazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9. Avoid coadministration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim with drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8 and 2C9 or OCT2.

Case Presentation

A 62-year-old woman with no medical history was admitted to the ED for fever, acute respiratory failure, and pain in the right lower limb. Three months prior to presentation, she had spent 45 days travelling through India and Thailand. She presented with no signs of traveler's disease such as fever or diarrhea during that trip. Two weeks following her return to France, the patient presented with an episode of bronchitis and received 5 days of treatment with cefixime (a third-generation cephalosporin). Despite this antibiotic treatment, her symptoms worsened and she developed, over the following 3 weeks, general weakness and arthralgia/myalgia. Due to the severity of hypoxemia, the patient was immediately transferred to the ICU.

ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) epidemiology includes estimates that 13 to 20 million people annually require life support in intensive care units worldwide; in the United States, more than 750,000 people receive mechanical ventilation, with almost 300,000 requiring prolonged support (> 5 d) annually. Multiple series estimate that ~25% of patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation develop global and persistent weakness, and based on this, more than 75,000 patients in the United States and up to 1 million worldwide may develop ICUAW. Physical impairment is common and may persist for years, and in some patients physical deficits manifest as profound weakness associated with worsened outcomes.

Diarrhea as the only presenting symptom in absence of upper respiratory symptoms — reports across cohorts show that isolated gastrointestinal (GI) presentations were uncommon: In Luo et al (1141 patients), 183 patients (16%) presented with GI symptoms only in the absence of respiratory symptoms; among 1141 patients, loss of appetite (15.8%) and nausea or vomiting (11.7%) were the most common symptoms, while diarrhea was 6.0% and abdominal pain 3.9%, and 96% had lung infiltrates on chest computed tomography. In Jin et al (651 hospitalized patients), 21 patients (3.2%) had GI symptoms only. Conversely, in a US cohort of 116 patients, 31.9% had GI symptoms on admission (median duration, 1 day); diarrhea occurred in 10.3% (12 of 116), nausea and/or vomiting in 10.3% (12 of 116), and abdominal pain in 8.8% (10 of 116), and none had isolated GI symptoms as the only manifestation of COVID-19.

### Principles and practice of antibiotic stewardship in the ICU [^116i3yDx]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

In the face of emerging drug-resistant pathogens and a decrease in the development of new antimicrobial agents, antibiotic stewardship should be practiced in all critical care units. Antibiotic stewardship should be a core competency of all critical care practitioners in conjunction with a formal antibiotic stewardship program (ASP). Prospective audit and feedback, and antibiotic time-outs, are effective components of an ASP in the ICU. As rapid diagnostics are introduced in the ICU, assessment of performance and effect on outcomes will clearly be needed. Disease-specific stewardship for community-acquired pneumonia that relies on clinical pathways may be particularly high-yield. Computerized decision support has the potential to individualize stewardship for specific patients. Finally, infection control and prevention is the cornerstone of every ASP.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) prevention — diagnostic stewardship essential practice: "Implement diagnostic stewardship practices for ensuring appropriate use and interpretation of C. difficile testing" (Quality of evidence: LOW). The guidance states, "Hospital infection prevention and control programs should work with their clinical microbiology laboratory to develop pre-agreed criteria for C. difficile testing, particularly if NAATs are used either as a standalone test or part of a multistep testing algorithm". It further specifies, "At minimum, C. difficile testing should be avoided in patients without clinically significant diarrhea, in those who have been tested in the prior 7 days, and in children aged < 1 year". Additional notes include, "Additional action may be taken to reduce testing in individuals with diarrhea from a more likely etiology such as recent laxative use or initiation of enteral tube feeding", and "Ordering providers and bedside nurses should receive education about appropriate use and interpretation of C. difficile testing".

Materials and methods

Study design

This was a retrospective multicenter study including all adult patients admitted to one of 9 ICUs of Paris University Hospitals for an iGAS infection between 01/03/2018 and 01/08/2023. These 9 ICUs account for 221 ICU beds of the roughly 1150 available at the Paris University Hospitals, which are set in a region with over 12 000 000 inhabitants. Patients were identified by the microbiology laboratory of each participating center using a dedicated software as patients with Streptococcus pyogenes growth in any microbiological sample from a sterile site (blood cultures, perioperative soft tissue sample, joint fluid, lower respiratory tract samples, cerebrospinal fluid, peritoneal fluid) during an ICU stay. Data were extracted from medical charts. All patients received information that data extracted from their medical charts could be used for research purposes. The study was approved by an institutional review board (Comité d'Ethique de la Société de Réanimation de Langue Française, n° 23–037).

Statistical analysis

A clustering analysis was performed to group patients using a comprehensive set of clinical and biological variables available at ICU admission. The methodology used is described hereafter and illustrated in supplemental Fig. 1.

The variables used for the construction of the clusters were the following: age, sex, obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2), diabetes, immunosuppression (i.e. active cancer or cirrhosis or immunosuppressive drugs), chronic renal failure, cardio-vascular comorbidities (i.e. peripheral arterial disease of the lower limb or ischemic heart disease or former ischemic stroke or chronic heart failure), chronic alcohol consumption, social deprivation (i.e. homelessness or living in a social care shelter or receiving special minimum benefits (Couverture Maladie Universelle)), psychiatric comorbidities, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) consumption in the week before first symptoms, fever, gastrointestinal signs (i.e. nausea or vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain), pain, exanthema, acute myocardial dysfunction (defined as mentioned in the medical chart by the treating physician or as an acute alteration of left ventricular ejection fraction < 30%), infection source, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, white cell counts, Platelet counts, C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma levels, procalcitonin plasma levels.

Ancillary therapy strategies for CDI — treatment actions: Discontinue therapy with the inciting antibiotic agent(s) as soon as possible, as this may influence the risk of CDI recurrence (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Antibiotic therapy for CDI should be started empirically for situations where a substantial delay in laboratory confirmation is expected, or for fulminant CDI (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).

Results

One hundred ninety-three patients (49.2% females) with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and a median age of 47.0 ± 23.7 years (range 1.5–93 years) completed the study. The study included 35 (18.1%) children below the age of 18 years. In addition, 52 (26.94%) patients needed ICU care (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Study flowchart

The median hospital LOS was seven days (IQR 5–11.5). It was ten days (IQR 6.25 to 15) in the subgroup that needed ICU admission. We encountered nine death events (equal to a mortality rate of 4.66% with a 95% CI of 2.42–8.77%). Out of them, 8 (88.9%) occurred among patients admitted to ICU wards. The most common presenting symptoms were lower respiratory symptoms, including cough, sputum production, chest pain, and shortness of breath (63%), followed by constitutional symptoms including fatigue, myalgia, generalized body pain, headache, loss of appetite (40%), and gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (18%). The background characteristics of the study cohort are summarized in Table 1.

✱ p value compares patients with and without ICU care in terms of the mean of HScore

The median HScore was 43.0 (IQR: 0.0 to 63.0). The mean HScore was higher in those who needed ICU care (59.7, 95% CI 46.4–72.7) than those admitted to non-ICU medical wards (38.8, 95% CI: 32.2 to 45.4; P = 0.003). The mean HScore was also significantly higher in patients who died of COVID-19 (105.1, 95% CI 53.7–156.5) than individuals who survived (41.5, 95% CI 35.8–47.1; P = 0.005). Regarding signs and symptoms, patients with fever, sore throat, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain as their present illness showed higher HScore compared to those without these symptoms (Table 1).

### Clinical testing and diagnosis for C. diff infection… [^1134ZUeG]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- There are four laboratory tests used to diagnose Clostridioides difficileinfection or CDI.
- Hospitals are required to report C. diffinfections. Recommended tests Molecular tests
- FDA-approved PCR assays are same-day tests that are highly sensitive and specific for the presence of a toxin-producing C. difforganism.
- Molecular assays can be positive for C. diffin asymptomatic individuals and those who do not have an infection. Patients with other causes of diarrhea might be positive, which leads to over-diagnosis and treatment.
- When using multi-pathogen molecular methods, read the results with caution as the pre-test probability of C. diffinfection might be less. Antigen tests
- These rapid tests detect the presence of C. diffantigen glutamate dehydrogenase.
- Because results of antigen testing alone are nonspecific, antigen assays have been employed in combination with tests for toxin detection, PCR, or toxigenic culture in two-step testing algorithms. Toxin tests
- Tissue culture cytotoxicity assay only detects toxin B. This assay requires technical expertise to perform, is costly and requires 24 to 48 hours for a result. It does provide specific and sensitive results for CDI.
- Although a historical gold standard for diagnosing disease caused by C. diff, this assay is less sensitive than PCR or toxigenic culture for patients with diarrhea.
- Enzyme immunoassay detects toxin A, toxin B, or both A and B. With concerns over toxin A-negative and B-positive strains causing disease, most laboratories employ a toxin B-only or A and B assay. Since these are same-day assays that are cheap and easy to perform, they are popular with clinical laboratories.

However, there are increasing concerns about their relative insensitivity. Stool cultures This is the most sensitive test available and is most often associated with false-positive results because of the presence of nontoxigenic C. diff strains. However, testing isolates for toxin production like so-called "toxigenic culture" helps to reduce false positive results. Moreover, stool cultures for C. diff are less useful as they are: Resources

### Infectious diarrhea: IDSA updates guidelines for diagnosis and… [^1148QjvQ]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Diagnostic testing is not routinely recommended in patients with uncomplicated traveler's diarrhea.
- If diarrhea is accompanied by fever, bloody stools, abdominal cramping, or signs of sepsis, stool should be tested for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Clostridium difficile, and STEC. Patients with fever or bloody diarrhea should be evaluated for enteropathogens for which antimicrobial agents may be beneficial, including Salmonella enterica, Shigella, and Campylobacter. Identifying these bacteria can avoid unnecessary antibiotic therapy and procedures such as colonoscopy, abdominal surgery, or ulcerative colitis treatment. Additionally, stool tests that are negative for infectious pathogens increase suspicion for a noninfectious cause.

Clinicians should evaluate patients with diarrhea for postinfectious and extraintestinal manifestations associated with enteric infections such as reactive arthritis, erythema nodosum, or glomerulonephritis. Specific manifestations may be associated with specific pathogens. When a clinical syndrome consistent with a known postinfectious manifestation is identified, an exposure history should be obtained with a diagnostic evaluation and directed management. DIAGNOSIS Diarrheal illnesses are usually self-limited and determining the exact etiology is not always necessary. Stool testing is indicated in patients at high risk of severe illness and when identification of a pathogen is important for the patient or public health. In patients with diarrhea accompanied by fever, bloody or mucoid stools, severe abdominal cramping or tenderness, or signs of sepsis, stool should be tested for. Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Clostridium difficile, and STEC.

Blood cultures should be performed in infants younger than three months and in patients with signs of septicemia or suspected enteric fever, patients with certain high-risk conditions, and patients who have traveled to endemic areas or had contact with travelers from endemic areas who have a fever of unknown etiology. Patients with clinical features of sepsis and suspected enteric fever should be treated empirically with broad-spectrum antimicrobials after blood, stool, and urine culture collection. Therapy can be narrowed once test results are available. If an isolate is unavailable and enteric fever is suspected, the antimicrobial choice may be tailored to susceptibility patterns in the geographic location where the infection was acquired.

### C. diff: facts for clinicians… [^115TRoAC]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points Clostridioides difficile is a common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. It accounts for 15 to 25% of all events of AAD.
- Prevent C. diffinfections by appropriately using antibiotics and implementing infection control recommendations to prevent transmission.
- Use EPA-registered disinfectants in patient-care areas, as appropriate. Background C. diff is a spore-forming, Gram-positive anaerobic bacillus that produces two exotoxins: toxin A and toxin B. Risk factors
- Antibiotic exposure.
- Gastrointestinal surgery or manipulation.
- Long length of stay in healthcare settings.
- A serious underlying illness.
- Immunocompromising conditions.
- Advanced age. Diagnosis Patients with CDI exhibit clinical symptoms and test positive for the C. diff organism or its toxin. Colonization vs infection Colonization with C.

diff is more common than infection. Colonized patients do not have disease caused by C. diff and often exhibit NO clinical symptoms like diarrhea. Colonized patients do test positive for the C. diff organism or its toxin. Treatment and recovery If a patient has had three or more stools in 24 hours:

- Isolate patients with possible C. diffimmediately, even if you only suspect CDI.
- Order a C. difftest if other etiologies of diarrhea such as stool softener or laxative were not used.
- Wear gloves and a gown when treating patients with potential infectious diarrhea, including C. diff, even during short visits. Gloves are important because hand sanitizer doesn't kill C. diff. In addition, handwashing alone may not be sufficient to eliminate all C. diffspores.
- Reassess appropriateness of antibiotics in. Complications
- Pseudomembranous colitis
- Toxic megacolon
- Perforations of the colon
- Sepsis
- Death.
