## Question

Management of ASCUS

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing ASC-US across ages, HPV status, and special populations, preserving the stepwise thinking and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining ASC-US and its baseline risk profile. Then, I should verify the overarching risk-based management framework and the 4% CIN3+ colposcopy threshold. Next, I will examine management by HPV status and age, including adolescents and young adults, and then consider special populations like pregnancy, immunosuppression, and postmenopausal women. After that, I should review postcolposcopy pathways and surveillance intervals, and finally I will double-check cost-effectiveness, implementation pitfalls, and summarize a practical algorithm with key takeaways anchored in the 2019 ASCCP guidelines and contemporary evidence.

> Let me first confirm the entity and baseline risk so I don't jump to conclusions: ASC-US is the most common abnormal cytology category, with a median U.S. reporting rate around 5% and a CIN3+ prevalence of roughly 5% in unselected populations, which explains why management hinges on HPV triage rather than immediate colposcopy for all comers [^116fHtBp] [^111Uwf7G].

> I need to ensure I'm applying the correct framework before assigning actions: the 2019 ASCCP guidelines shifted from result-based to risk-based management using immediate and 5-year CIN3+ risks to trigger surveillance at 1, 3, or 5 years, or referral to colposcopy or expedited treatment, with the key colposcopy threshold set at an immediate CIN3+ risk of 4.0% or greater, which operationalizes the principle of equal management for equal risk [^111w4nBk] [^114BhmGY] [^115bEekr].

> Now, for HPV-positive ASC-US in patients aged 25 years or older, I should confirm the immediate risk and the action: the immediate CIN3+ risk is about 4.4–4.5%, which meets the colposcopy threshold, so referral to colposcopy is recommended; wait, let me verify the exact estimate — yes, the corrected Figure 2 legend specifies 4.45% immediate risk for HPV-positive ASC-US, aligning with the 4% action threshold [^1123L7oN] [^114BhmGY].

> For HPV-negative ASC-US in patients aged 25 years or older, I should double-check the risk and interval: the immediate CIN3+ risk is very low, approximately 0.06%, and the 5-year risk is about 0.78%, so the recommended action is return to routine screening in 3 years; hold on, I should verify that this aligns with the risk tables — yes, HPV-negative ASC-US with unknown history carries a 5-year CIN3+ risk around 0.40–0.55%, supporting a 3-year return [^112MKveH].

> But wait, what if there is a recent documented negative HPV-based screen within about 5 years; does that change management for a new HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL? I need to check that nuance: yes, after a documented negative HPV test or cotest, the immediate risk for HPV-positive ASC-US drops to about 2.0–2.1%, so surveillance in 1 year rather than immediate colposcopy is appropriate, reflecting the risk-modifying effect of prior HPV negativity [^114yzbLm] [^116UPRPW].

> Next, I should review adolescents and young adults under 25 years because overtreatment is a major concern: for patients younger than 25 with ASC-US, the preferred approach is conservative cytology-only follow-up with repeat cytology at 12 months; if results are normal, repeat cytology in 12 months, and if both are negative, return to routine screening; if ASC-US/LSIL persists at 2 years or if any high-grade cytology appears, then proceed to colposcopy; I should confirm that reflex HPV testing is not routinely recommended in this age group — correct, it is not recommended except in special circumstances like HIV, given low specificity and high regression rates [^1114nyBo] [^112Ahuaw].

> Hold on, I should verify the rationale for this conservative stance: HPV prevalence is high and most infections are transient in adolescents, CIN2+ often regresses, and unnecessary excisions can cause obstetric morbidity; ALTS-era and subsequent analyses support higher regression and lower cancer risk in this group, reinforcing observation over intervention for low-grade cytology [^111ZqETZ] [^113N9BNs].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with pregnancy: for pregnant patients with ASC-US, defer colposcopy until at least 6 weeks postpartum unless there is suspicion of high-grade disease; if colposcopy is performed, avoid endocervical sampling and reserve excisional procedures for high-grade indications, balancing maternal–fetal safety with oncologic risk [^112Ahuaw].

> For immunosuppressed patients, including those with HIV, I should confirm that management follows the 2021 OI guidelines: HPV testing is recommended for triage of ASC-US, and if HPV-positive, proceed to colposcopy; if HPV-negative, repeat HPV-based testing in 12 months rather than extending to 3 years, given higher and more persistent HPV risks in this population [^notfound].

> For postmenopausal patients with ASC-US, let me consider atrophy and sampling: HPV triage remains preferred; if HPV-negative, return to routine screening in 3 years; if HPV-positive, proceed to colposcopy, and if atrophy obscures cytology, short-course vaginal estrogen may be used before repeating cytology to improve specimen adequacy, which can reduce unsatisfactory results and missed disease [^112MKveH] [^117NLpEX].

> Next, I should review postcolposcopy management when CIN2+ is not found after HPV-positive ASC-US referral: if histology is less than CIN2, the 5-year CIN3+ risk is about 2.9%, so surveillance with HPV-based testing in 1 year is recommended; if the 1-year result is HPV-negative, extend to 3 years; if HPV remains positive or cytology is ASC-H or higher, repeat colposcopy; I should double-check the exact risk estimates — yes, the corrected Figure 2 legend supports these numbers and pathways [^1123L7oN] [^1122SbwP].

> I need to ensure I'm precise about treatment triggers: if colposcopy and biopsy reveal CIN2, CIN3, AIS, or cancer, treatment is indicated; for histologic HSIL (CIN2/3), excision is preferred over ablation in the U.S.; for HPV-positive ASC-US with very high immediate risk, such as HPV16-positive HSIL or rarely/never screened patients with HPV-positive HSIL, expedited treatment without biopsy may be preferred, with shared decision-making regarding fertility implications [^112Cvp7p] [^116tJhXY].

> Let me consider cost-effectiveness and implementation so I don't overlook real-world feasibility: HPV triage for ASC-US is more cost-effective than immediate colposcopy or serial cytology, reduces unnecessary procedures, and maintains high sensitivity for CIN3+ detection; however, adherence varies, with underuse of HPV testing and overuse of colposcopy documented in some settings, and disparities by race, ethnicity, and insurance status persist, underscoring the need for systems-level supports and equitable access [^116cncq7] [^111ZT8cQ] [^117Mk6Ft].

> I should double-check the practical algorithm to ensure internal consistency: for any ASC-US result, perform reflex HPV testing when available; if HPV-positive and age is 25 or older, refer to colposcopy; if HPV-negative, return to routine screening in 3 years; if the patient is younger than 25, favor repeat cytology at 12-month intervals for 2 years with colposcopy only if abnormalities persist or high-grade cytology appears; throughout, incorporate prior HPV results to modulate risk and adjust thresholds for 1-year surveillance versus immediate colposcopy [^1114nyBo] [^114yzbLm] [^114BhmGY].

> Key takeaway, and let me reconsider to ensure alignment with evidence: HPV triage is the preferred, evidence-based approach for ASC-US because it balances high sensitivity for CIN3+ with fewer colposcopies; management should be risk-based, not result-based, integrating current and prior HPV results; and in patients younger than 25, conservative cytology-only follow-up minimizes overtreatment while preserving safety, consistent with contemporary U.S. guidelines and the principle of equal management for equal risk [^111Uwf7G] [^111w4nBk] [^1114nyBo].

ASCUS management is guided by **HPV triage** [^115PLLms] and **risk-based follow-up** [^111w4nBk]. For women ≥ 25, reflex HPV testing is preferred [^111hdEGk]: HPV-positive ASC-US goes to colposcopy [^114BhmGY]; HPV-negative ASC-US returns to routine screening in 3 years [^112MKveH]. For women < 25, repeat cytology at 12 months is recommended [^1114nyBo]; colposcopy if ASC-US/LSIL persists at 24 months or if HSIL/ASC-H/AGC appears. HPV testing is not recommended for < 25 unless immunocompromised [^115Td2T1]. Postcolposcopy, if CIN2+ is found, treat; if < CIN2, repeat HPV-based testing at 12 months [^112Cvp7p] [^116QGrRi]. HPV triage is preferred because it is **more sensitive than cytology alone** [^111Uwf7G] and reduces unnecessary colposcopies [^112aKq1J].

---

## Initial evaluation and triage

### HPV triage testing

- **Preferred approach**: Reflex HPV testing is the preferred initial triage for ASCUS [^112Gggw2], especially with liquid-based cytology or co-collection [^112DmStL].

- **HPV-positive ASC-US**: Refer for colposcopy [^114BhmGY] due to higher risk of CIN2+ [^notfound].

- **HPV-negative ASC-US**: Return to routine screening in 3 years [^112MKveH].

---

### Alternative triage methods

Alternative options include **repeat cytology** at 6–12 months [^1147Qhd1]; if ASC-US or higher persists, refer for colposcopy [^1147Qhd1]. Immediate colposcopy is acceptable but less efficient and may lead to overtreatment [^116cncq7] [^11195Bup].

---

## Management by age group

### Women aged 25 years and older

| **Hpv result** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Positive | Colposcopy [^notfound] |
| Negative | Routine screening in 3 years [^notfound] |

---

### Women younger than 25 years

For women younger than 25 years, **repeat cytology** at 12 months is recommended [^1114nyBo]; if ASC-US/LSIL persists at 24 months or HSIL/ASC-H/AGC appears, proceed to colposcopy. HPV testing is not recommended unless the patient is immunocompromised [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up after colposcopy

### Histology results

- **CIN2+**: Treat per ASCCP guidelines [^112Cvp7p].

- **CIN1 or negative**: Repeat HPV-based testing at 12 months [^116QGrRi]; if HPV-positive or ASC-US/LSIL persists, colposcopy is indicated [^1147Qhd1].

---

## Special considerations

### Immunocompromised patients

For immunocompromised patients, **HPV testing** is recommended for triage [^notfound]; HPV-positive ASC-US warrants colposcopy.

---

### Pregnant patients

For pregnant patients, **postpone colposcopy** until at least 6 weeks postpartum unless invasive disease is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Evidence supporting HPV triage

HPV triage is **highly sensitive** for CIN3+ (96.3%) [^111Uwf7G] and reduces colposcopies compared with immediate colposcopy [^112aKq1J]. It is also more cost-effective than immediate colposcopy or repeat cytology [^112ArzzW].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **HPV triage**: Preferred initial approach for ASCUS [^115PLLms].

- **HPV-positive**: Colposcopy [^114BhmGY].

- **HPV-negative**: Routine screening in 3 years [^112MKveH].

- **< 25 years**: Repeat cytology at 12 months; colposcopy if persistent or high-grade [^1114nyBo].

- **Postcolposcopy**: Repeat HPV-based testing at 12 months if < CIN2 [^116QGrRi].

---

ASCUS management centers on **HPV triage** [^115PLLms] and **risk-based follow-up** [^111w4nBk], balancing detection of CIN2+ with avoidance of overtreatment [^11195Bup].

### ASCUS in Papanicolaou smears. problems, controversies, and potential future directions [^115KPmPj]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Each year, an estimated 2 to 3 million women in the United States receive a Papanicolaou smear diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). There is no uniform practice for the diagnosis or management of these patients, and the annual cost of aggressively treating ASCUS lesions is estimated to be billions of dollars. Since its introduction in 1988, ASCUS has been problematic and controversial. ASCUS is a problem to define, to diagnose, to reproduce, and to manage. The following article reviews the various aspects and problems of ASCUS, its controversies regarding diagnosis, reproducibility, and management, and discusses the possible future directions of this category in light of the recent Bethesda System 2001 Workshop recommendations.

### Comparison of three management strategies for patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance: baseline results from a randomized trial [^111Uwf7G]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2001). Low credibility.

Background

More than 2 million U.S. women receive an equivocal cervical cytologic diagnosis (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASCUS]) each year. Effective colposcopy triage strategies are needed to identify the minority of women who have clinically significant disease while avoiding excessive follow-up evaluation for others.

Methods

The ASCUS/LSIL (i.e., low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) Triage Study (ALTS) is a multicenter, randomized trial comparing the sensitivity and specificity of the following three management strategies to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3): 1) immediate colposcopy (considered to be the reference standard), 2) triage to colposcopy based on human papillomavirus (HPV) results from Hybrid Capture 2(TM) (HC 2) and thin-layer cytology results, or 3) triage based on cytology results alone. This article summarizes the cross-sectional enrollment results for 3488 women with a referral diagnosis of ASCUS. All statistical tests are two-sided.

Results

Among participants with ASCUS, the underlying prevalence of histologically confirmed CIN3 was 5.1%. Sensitivity to detect CIN3 or above by testing for cancer-associated HPV DNA was 96.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 91.6% to 98.8%), with 56.1% of women referred to colposcopy. Sensitivity of a single repeat cytology specimen with a triage threshold of HSIL or above was 44.1% (95% CI = 35.6% to 52.9%), with 6.9% referred. Sensitivity of a lower cytology triage threshold of ASCUS or above was 85.3% (95% CI = 78.2% to 90.8%), with 58.6% referred.

Conclusions

HC 2 testing for cancer-associated HPV DNA is a viable option in the management of women with ASCUS. It has greater sensitivity to detect CIN3 or above and specificity comparable to a single additional cytologic test indicating ASCUS or above.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: updates through 2023 [^117L6CGc]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

3) Update to interval for repeating unsatisfactory cytology: The recommendation statement has been updated to reflect evidence that waiting 2 months before repeating the cytology test is not necessary.

Guideline: For patients with an unsatisfactory cytology result and no, unknown, or a negative HPV test result, repeat age-based screening (cytology, cotest, or primary HPV test) as soon as convenient and no later than 4 months is recommended (BIII).

Rationale: The 2- to 4-month waiting period was initially proposed due to early studies indicating differences in cytology results repeated over a short time interval. The recommendation was carried forward through several guideline iterations, but rereview of evidence supports revision of the 2-month waiting period. A seminal article in 2005 specifically addressed this question and found the concern of reduced cellularity with short interval repeat not to hold true. In this study, the cytology interval ranged from 8 to 30 days in 763 women, 31 to 60 days in 2,317 women, 61 to 90 days in 1,090 women, 91 to 120 days in 491 women, and 121 to 184 days in 394 women. They found that repeat cytologic interpretations of unsatisfactory findings, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) did not vary among the Pap interval groups. Most importantly, the approximate cellularity of the samples was slightly better in the interval group of 8 to 30 days (P trend = 0.04). In addition, higher rates of unsatisfactory results have been documented in patients with cancer compared with those with CIN3 or lower grade results. Waiting to repeat an unsatisfactory cytology in the presence of cancer could lead to harm, specifically if other recommended workup for symptomatic patients is not performed. For this reason, the 2019 recommendations were updated.

Indeed, the target age range for screening, screening interval, year of program initiation as well as government financial support are factors that inform management in different screening policies. Where clear guidelines do not exist, the clinician is left with the dilemma of how to manage ASC‐US‐screened young patients. We performed this review of the literature to gather different strategies that have been recommended for the management of ASC‐US in young women through published studies.

### 2001 consensus guidelines for the management of women with cervical cytological abnormalities [^115PLLms]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of women with cervical cytological abnormalities and cervical cancer precursors.

Participants

A panel of 121 experts in the diagnosis and management of cervical cancer precursors, including representatives from 29 professional organizations, federal agencies, and national and international health organizations, were invited to participate in a consensus conference sponsored by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP).

Evidence and Consensus Process

Guidelines for the management of women with cervical cytological abnormalities were developed through a multistep process. Starting 6 months before the conference, working groups developed draft management guidelines based on formal literature reviews of English-language articles published in 1988–2001, as well as input from the professional community at large, obtained using interactive Internet-based bulletin boards. On September 6–8, 2001, the ASCCP Consensus Conference was held in Bethesda, Md. Guidelines with supporting evidence were presented and underwent discussion, revision, and voting.

Conclusions

Management of women with atypical squamous cells (ASC) depends on whether the Papanicolaou test is subcategorized as of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or as cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (ASC-H). Women with ASC-US should be managed using a program of 2 repeat cytology tests, immediate colposcopy, or DNA testing for high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Testing for HPV DNA is the preferred approach when liquid-based cytology is used for screening. In most instances, women with ASC-H, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, HSIL, and atypical glandular cells should be referred for immediate colposcopic evaluation.

### Management of women with atypical Papanicolaou tests of undetermined significance by board-certified gynecologists: discrepancies with published guidelines [^111ZT8cQ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The Bethesda System introduced 2 categories of atypia: atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGUS) and atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). Our objective was to test the hypothesis that there is lack of consensus regarding management of women with ASCUS and AGUS.

Study Design

A 2-page survey was mailed in April 1998 to a random sample of 491 fellows of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

Results

There were 241 responses (50.6%). For first-time ASCUS, 23.0% of respondents would perform colposcopy and 24.4% would repeat the Papanicolaou test in < 3 months, indicating aggressive management of ASCUS by 47.4% of respondents. For recurrent ASCUS, 88.7% followed recommendations to manage with colposcopy. For AGUS, 23% repeated the Papanicolaou test and only 43% would manage appropriately. For recurrent AGUS, only 25% would perform surgical excision.

Conclusion

Compared with published guidelines, practitioners undermanage patients with AGUS and overmanage patients with ASCUS. Further physician education appears to be warranted.

### Colposcopic evaluation after a repeat atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) smear [^113BSBrQ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Management of patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) remains controversial. We chose to repeat the Pap smear after four months. If ASCUS persisted in this second test, the patient was advised to undergo colposcopy. Our objective is to determine the clinical significance and the prediction of neoplasia among these patients through a colposcopic examination.

Methods

Of 29,827 patients who had a Pap smear, ASCUS were detected in 1387 (5%) and persisted in the repeat smear of 225 (16%). Colposcopy and an additional Pap smear were performed on 186 patients.

Results

Out of 186 colposcopic evaluations, 91 (49%) were normal and the patients had a negative Pap smear. Colposcopy was abnormal in 95/186 patients (51%) (Table 1). Histology of the directed biopsies revealed 38 (21%) low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and 17 (9%) high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). Forty patients (21%) with normal biopsies had ASCUS for the third time in the Pap smear.

Conclusions

Colposcopic evaluation after a repeated Pap smear with ASCUS is an appropriate cost-effective management. Finding 30% of LSIL or HSIL justifies this additional investigation.

### Review of triage strategies for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance among young women [^111ZqETZ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Globally, cancer of the cervix is ranked as the fourth most common malignancy among women. Low‐ and middle‐income countries are the most affected, where 85% of deaths from the disease occur annually. The screening strategy through Pap smear followed by the subsequent management of abnormal results has shown its efficiency in the reduction of the disease in countries with high screening coverage rates. Through the Bethesda system 2001, squamous cell abnormalities on Pap smear constitute different categories, mainly atypical squamous cells (ASCs) subdivided into ASCs of unknown significance (ASC‐US) and ASCs cannot rule out high‐grade intraepithelial lesion (ASC‐H); low‐ and high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL, HSIL) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

ASC‐US is a mix of cervical abnormalities at different stages encompassing the lowest risk atypia to the worst form of precancerous lesions, with some harboring the potential to downgrade to normalcy. The literature reports approximately 10%–20% of women with ASC‐US to harbor a different degree of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which are precursor lesions of SCC. Young women present certain particularities in the cervical cancer screening program. Among those who are sexually active, 70% carry human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and almost 70% are transient. Only a few of these women develop CIN2/3, and a study by Case et al.found that only 50% of adolescents referred for colposcopy for HSIL had confirmed CIN2 or 3, considering that HSIL may be overstated in younger women. The majority of these lesions regress with time and do so at a higher rate than in older women. The concern with ASC‐US is that without adequate follow‐up or lack of it, complications may arise or follow the treatment. Furthermore, the management of ASC‐US presents a few challenges because its progression following identification remains unpredictable. It is unknown which cases of ASC‐US may regress to become normal or progress to LSIL or HSIL. The rate of regression and progression is also unpredictable. In a meta‐analysis by Melnikow et al. ASC‐US showed a regression to normal in 68% of cases over duration of 24 months, whereas in 7.13% of cases, it progressed to a worse grade of SIL in the same period. Furthermore, in a study by Moscicki and colleagues, among the patients aged 13–25 years who were diagnosed in the community hospital setting as having CIN2, 62% of cases went into remission spontaneously. However, as progression in one sense or another cannot be predicted, clinicians need to exercise caution. Therefore, women with ASC‐US require sufficient triage or appropriate management and treatment.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^1114nyBo]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — patients younger than 25 years, initial management after an abnormal screening test result: In patients younger than 25 years with low-grade cytology screening results, repeat cytology alone at 1 and 2 years after the initial abnormal result is recommended (BII). Colposcopy is recommended if high-grade cytology is found at any point (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL], atypical squamous cells — cannot exclude HSIL [ASC-H], atypical glandular cells [AGC], adenocarcinoma in situ [AIS]) or if low-grade cytology persists at the 2-year follow-up visit (BII). If reflex human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) is performed and the results are negative, repeat cytology in 3 years is recommended (BII). After 2 consecutive negative cytology results, return to routine age-based screening is recommended (BII). If colposcopy is performed and the results are less than CIN 2 (i.e., histologic low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [LSIL; CIN 1] or less), repeat cytology in 1 year (BII), and manage as above (e.g., repeat cytology for ASC-US/LSIL, colposcopy for ASC-H or higher).

### Review of triage strategies for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance among young women [^115Ntdhg]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

2 SUMMARY

The management of ASC‐US is challenging and even more complicated when diagnosed in young women aged < 30 years. There is no universal consensus for screening young women, and different triage strategies or this clinical entity vary among clinicians and most developed countries.
The tests and approaches that correctly triage ASC‐US remain a target of extensive research.
The triage issue for ASC‐US is not only about strategies but also the performance of the tests.
For some cervical cancer screening programs, screening below the age of 25 or 30 years is not recommended.
Few guidelines exist that address the management of young women with ASC‐US.

There is no universal consensus on the age range that defines "young women", although studies of young women have taken either age under 25 years old into consideration (21–24 years), and/or under 30 years old (21–29 years). In the context of this review, we included the age range of 21–29 years, since some earlier recommendations included all sexually active women after the age of 21. Recognizing that the WHO recommends screening should be initiated at age 30, the aim of the present review was to highlight gaps in understanding the management of ASC‐US in younger women and to show the benefits and drawbacks of managing young women with ASC‐US (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Consensus for screening age initiation.

In Canada, screening starting from 18 years is still widely applied in the majority of provinces of the country despite the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care having updated its recommendations for cervical cancer screening in 2013 and adopting 25 years as the starting age. In this country, only two provinces have updated their guidelines accordingly to reflect this change. Current policies are modifying the starting age for cervical cancer screening to 25 years old, in view of the strong evidence that cervical cancer in women younger than 25 years is thought to be uncommon.

Existing consensus recognizes that women with HSIL detected during screening need further investigation with colposcopy and/or biopsy. However, follow‐up approaches and tests for ASC‐US lack consensus and vary between countries, including cytologic surveillance, triage using HPV DNA or RNA testing, or referral for colposcopy. Table 2 describes the type of response validated for the ASC‐US triage according to different guidelines.

### Participants at the ASCCP 2000 biennial meeting adhere to published guidelines in their management of atypical squamous cells and atypical glandular cells on pap test [^113PyNFG]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine practice patterns of the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) 2000 Biennial Meeting participants for management of women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGUS).

Materials and Methods

A three-page survey was developed to query participants about their standard practices for managing atypical squamous cells and atypical glandular cells on Pap tests; use of human papillomavirus testing; and use of vaginal estrogen cream in postmenopausal women before follow-up.

Results

There were 217 completed surveys (47.0% response rate). Responses of 194 qualified surveys are presented here. For women with first-time ASCUS (unqualified) and no previous history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), 16.4% of respondents would perform colposcopy. For ASCUS (favor squamous intraepithelial lesion [SIL]), a significantly higher percent, 74.9%, would proceed immediately to colposcopy (p < .001). For ASCUS (unqualified or favor SIL) in a woman with a previous history of CIN, 82.7% and 95.5% would perform colposcopy, respectively (p < .001). For a patient with AGUS, 97.5% would perform colposcopy (with or without endocervical curettage or endometrial biopsy). Human papillomavirus testing was seldom used in the management of ASCUS (10.4%) and AGUS (7.8%).

Conclusions

Participants at the 2000 ASCCP Biennial Meeting made clear distinctions between ASCUS and AGUS in managing women with abnormalities on Pap, and management was consistent with guidelines published by the ASCCP, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the National Cancer Institute.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: updates through 2023 [^112QTZyx]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). High credibility.

ASCCP patient scenarios not initially addressed in 2019 — among individuals "aged 25 years or older screened with cytology alone", "the 2012 guidelines should be followed", and "In the 2012 guidelines, colposcopy is recommended for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or a more severe cytologic interpretation". For cases "in which a colposcopy was previously recommended but not completed", "the recommendation is for colposcopy if the previous result was high-grade cytology [atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H), atypical glandular cells (AGC), HSIL, or a more severe cytologic interpretation]".

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^1144gGLG]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP risk-based management — follow-up of HPV-negative atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) presents immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ with recommended actions for patients who are under surveillance after a prior HPV-negative ASC-US test result. For current HPV-negative with NILM cytology, the table lists n 13,918, CIN 3+ cases 14, CIN 3+ immediate risk 0.10, CIN 3+ 5-y risk 0.14, and recommended management "5-y follow-up" with recommendation confidence score 58. For current HPV-negative with ASC-US cytology, n 1,701 with CIN 3+ cases 11, CIN 3+ immediate risk 0.06, CIN 3+ 5-y risk 0.78, and recommended management "1-y follow-up" with confidence 82. For current HPV-negative with LSIL cytology, n 193 with CIN 3+ cases 5, CIN 3+ immediate risk 2.4, CIN 3+ 5-y risk 3.1, and recommended management "1-y follow-up" with confidence 80. For current HPV-positive with HSIL+ cytology, n 26 with CIN 3+ cases 8, CIN 3+ immediate risk 36, CIN 3+ 5-y risk 36, and recommended management "Colposcopy/treatment" with confidence 86. The table specifies that the "Recommended management" column gives the recommendation for clinical management based on the clinical action thresholds decided by the guideline.

### Response to letter to the editor regarding: 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^1122SbwP]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — revised Figure 2 legend for human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) outlines risk-based actions. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk = 4.45%). If colposcopy shows less than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). If the HPV test or cotest performed for the second postcolposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. If the second postcolposcopy surveillance test results are either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of atypical squamous cells–cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or higher, colposcopy is recommended. Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASC-US or HPV-negative low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion results. Note similar management would be recommended for any minimally abnormal test result less severe than atypical squamous cells–cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. NA indicates not applicable because stable risk estimates are not available.

### Review of triage strategies for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance among young women [^11195Bup]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Management of ASC‐US remains challenging for clinicians although research regarding triage strategies and tests has increased. There is a lack of convincing data for screening women aged between 21 and 25 years, and most findings are based on evidence from women aged 25–29 years. Accurate tests for triage of ASC‐US remain controversial among researchers and are different from one guideline to another. The widely accepted conservative management aims to perform accurate triage tests that reduce the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment and limit obstetrical complications associated with excision of CIN lesions. Despite lack of consensus on the triage of ASC‐US among young women, researchers show agreement on certain points of management:
First, triage approach must prioritize the possibility of conservative management.
Second, HPV DNA test, hrHPV, is generally accepted in triaging ASC‐US and has shown superior accuracy with higher sensitivity and similar specificity as repeat cytology for detecting CIN2+, but some researchers showed skepticism regarding its necessity in this age group. The realities encountered in some screening programs have motivated more aggressive management strategies, such as in Korea and China, where studies have shown a high incidence of underlying ≥ CIN2 in young women screened with ASC‐US, and thus justified direct referral for colposcopy.
Third, cytology has been approved as safe and better for follow‐up of ASC‐US/HPV‐positive women aged 25 years, with equal effectiveness compared with colposcopy/biopsy. However, the 12‐month interval for repeat cytology after the first ASC‐US diagnosis adopted by ASCCPwas not validated by some researchers, who found that it minimizes risk occurrence of CIN2+.
The accuracy to detect all CIN2+ earlier with colposcopy/biopsy has been approved; however, it generates overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Its higher cost and psychological morbidity (anxiety, depression) must motivate avoidance of immediate colposcopic referrals at the first occurrence of ASC‐US, unless compliance is not guaranteed with other triage strategies. Due to the high regression rates of CIN2 lesions in patients under the age of 25, it is suitable for a conservative approach, as stated in the ASCCP guidelines, and therefore cytology follow‐up of ASCUS results may be reasonable in young patients.
Nucleic acid sequence‐based RNA amplification presents more benefits, but these tests show limitations regarding their performance, either in sensitivity or specificity. However, there is an expectation of a better triage using dual staining of p16/Ki‐67, which proved its performance in terms of both sensitivity and specificity for all categories of cervical lesions.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: updates through 2023 [^116nq9eV]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

4) Patient Scenarios Not Initially Addressed in the 2019 Guidelines:

Additional guidance was developed to address scenarios for which the 2019 Guidelines did not initially provide management recommendations. This guidance was voted on in July 2021 and previously published. To summarize, this guidance (1) outlined management guidelines for cytology results without HPV testing among individuals aged 25 years and older and (2) clarified management when previous guidelines had not been followed:

(a) Guideline for individuals aged 25 and older screened with cytology alone: For individuals aged 25 years or older screened with cytology alone, the 2012 guidelines should be followed. In the 2012 guidelines, colposcopy is recommended for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or a more severe cytologic interpretation.
(b) Guideline for cases in which colposcopy was previously recommended but not completed: In cases in which a colposcopy was previously recommended but not completed, the recommendation is for colposcopy if the previous result was high-grade cytology [atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H), atypical glandular cells (AGC), HSIL, or a more severe cytologic interpretation]. If the previous cytology result was not high grade, and the patient undergoes repeat testing with HPV testing or cotesting instead of colposcopy: colposcopy is recommended if the result on repeat testing indicates a second consecutive HPV-positive result and/or persistent cytologic abnormality (ASC-US or a more severe cytologic interpretation); repeat HPV testing or cotesting in 1 year is acceptable if the result on repeat testing is HPV negative or cotest negative.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^1147Qhd1]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Management of women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) — initial follow-up, HPV triage, and post-colposcopy care are specified with graded recommendations. Cytological testing should be performed at 6-month intervals until 2 consecutive "negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy" results are obtained (AII), and colposcopy is recommended for women with ASC-US or greater cytological abnormality on a repeat test (AII); after 2 repeat negatives, women can return to routine cytological screening (AII). HPV DNA testing is presented as "Preferred if liquid-based cytology or co-collection available", with "HPV Positive* (managed in same manner as women with LSIL)". When colposcopy is used, "Endocervical sampling [is] preferred in women with no lesions, and those with unsatisfactory colposcopy", and if CIN is not identified, repeat cytology at 12 months is recommended (BIII); the algorithm lists "Cytology @ 6 to 12 mos OR HPV DNA Testing @ 12 mos", proceeding to "Repeat Colposcopy" for " ≥ ASC or HPV (+)" and to "Routine Screening" if "Negative", while cases with "CIN" are to "Manage per ASCCP Guideline". Because of overtreatment concerns, "the routine use of diagnostic excisional procedures such as the loop electrosurgical excision is unacceptable for women with an initial ASC-US in the absence of histologically diagnosed CIN 2,3. (EII)".

### An introduction to the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^115bEekr]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Deciding on the clinical action thresholds for each management option (treatment preferred, treatment or colposcopic biopsy, colposcopic biopsy, surveillance retesting at 1 year, surveillance retesting at 3 years, return at regular screening interval of 5 years) required an 18-month collective effort involving the volunteering cervical health professionals and patient advocates and including a period for public input. These societal decisions were acknowledged to be part of the larger subjective question of "How safe is safe enough? What risk levels in our society warrant escalating to the next, more aggressive clinical actions?"

The clinical action thresholds adopted by consensus voting in October 2019 after substantial study and discussion are intended to endure, providing stability to the US cervical screening effort, even as screening test methods and strategies evolve. When a new test is approved by the Food and Drug Administration that test can be considered for inclusion in the consensus guidelines as soon as sufficient data are available to know what risk of precancer is predicted by a positive result versus a negative result. Adequate prospective data will be necessary before a test can be recommended as the basis for surveillance at 1- or 3-year intervals or return to routine screening at 5-year intervals. Cross-sectional data will be needed to supply the immediate risk estimates that support recommendations for treatment or referral to colposcopy. To give an example, the new consensus is that the clinical action threshold for referral to colposcopy and biopsies (and possibly treatment) is a 4.0% immediate risk of CIN 3+. Patients with an underlying immediate risk of CIN 3+ of 4.0% or more are recommended to have colposcopy whether that risk is due to HPV-positive ASC-US, HPV-positive low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or greater, HPV 16–positive NILM, a posttreatment positive HPV test, or any other set of results predicting equally high risk. If a positive result from a new triage test for HPV-positive patients is convincingly shown to convey a CIN 3+ risk greater than or equal to 4.0% upon immediate referral to colposcopy, there would be no need for a new consensus conference to determine how to use that test in clinical practice: the management of a positive result would be to refer to colposcopy (with optional or even preferred, expedited treatment if risk is sufficiently high). By the guiding principle of "Equal Management of Equal Risk", the guideline would be evident and easily settled.

### ASCCP patient management guidelines: pap test specimen adequacy and quality indicators [^112NRKzn]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide management guidelines according to Pap test specimen adequacy based on literature review and expert opinion.

Methods

A task force named by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology conducted a literature review and discussed appropriate management. The steering committee of the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology and other experts reviewed the guidelines.

Results

The guidelines recommend a repeat Pap test in 12 months for most women who are undergoing routine annual/biennial screening if the current Pap test is negative but either lacks an endocervical/transformation zone component or is partially obscured. Indications for considering an earlier repeat are also provided. The preferred management for unsatisfactory Pap tests is a repeat Pap test within a short interval of 2 to 4 months.

Conclusions

The management guidelines will help promote optimal and uniform follow-up of women's Pap tests, according to Pap test specimen adequacy.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^112MKveH]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Guideline: When patients have an estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risk of 0.15% or greater but less than 0.55% based on history and current test results, repeat testing in 3 years with HPV-based testing is recommended (AII).

Rationale: Using the principle of equal management for equal risk, the 3-year return Clinical Action Threshold corresponds to the 5-year CIN 3+ risk after negative cervical cytology in the general population, for whom national guidelines recommend a 3-year return. Estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risks after a negative cytology result without HPV testing ranged from 0.33% in the KPNC population to 0.52% in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry, to an estimated 0.45% in the screened population of the CDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. Thus, 0.55% was considered an appropriate value for the Clinical Action Threshold. Three-year surveillance is recommended for patients whose risk falls between the 3- and 5-year follow-up thresholds. Consistent with the 2012 guidelines, patients with a low-grade cotest result (e.g. HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL) followed by a colposcopy with results of less than CIN 2, followed in turn by a negative follow-up HPV test or cotest reach the 3-year return threshold (see Figure 2). Also consistent with previous guidelines, patients with an HPV-negative ASC-US screening result in the setting of an unknown history can return at 3 years (estimated 5 year CIN 3+ risk 0.40%).

FIGURE 2
This figure demonstrates how a patient with a common low-grade screening abnormality (HPV-positive ASC-US) would be managed based on risk estimates. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.2%). Colposcopy of less than CIN 2 has a 5-year risk of 3.2% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). If the patient has a repeat abnormal screen at the next follow-up, colposcopy is recommended. If the HPV-based test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. NA, not applicable because stable risk estimates are not available.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^112PDT2C]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

2006 consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical screening — major management updates include that the core recommendations for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) were changed minimally, and postcolposcopy management for these cytological abnormalities is now identical; for special populations such as adolescents a more conservative approach incorporating cytologic follow-up for 2 years was approved. For high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and atypical glandular cells, core recommendations underwent only minor modification, with more emphasis placed on immediate "screen-and-treat" approaches when managing women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA is incorporated into the management of women with atypical glandular cells after initial evaluation with colposcopy and endometrial sampling, and use of HPV DNA testing as an adjunct to cervical cytology for screening in women 30 years and older was formally adopted with only very minor modifications.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^116FvcWG]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Atypical squamous cells (ASC) — subcategories, prevalence, and HPV positivity: ASC are subcategorized into atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H); the median reporting rate of ASC-US in US laboratories is 4.7%, and the median rate of ASC-H is 0.4%, the prevalence of invasive cancer is low in women with ASC (approximately 0.1%–0.2%), the prevalence of CIN 2,3 among women with ASC is 7% to 12% versus 26% to 68% among women with ASC-H, and high-risk HPV DNA positivity is 40% to 51% among women with ASC-US but 74% to 88% among women with ASC-H; consequently, ASC-H should be considered to represent equivocal HSIL and a productive HPV infection.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: updates through 2023 [^111ANtU2]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). High credibility.

Update to interval for repeating unsatisfactory cytology — guidance states that for patients with an unsatisfactory cytology result and no, unknown, or a negative HPV test result, repeat age-based screening (cytology, co-test, or primary HPV test) as soon as convenient and no later than 4 months (BIII). Supporting evidence includes a study in which the cytology interval ranged from 8 to 30 days in 763 women, 31 to 60 days in 2,317 women, 61 to 90 days in 1,090 women, 91 to 120 days in 491 women, and 121 to 184 days in 394 women, with approximate cellularity slightly better at 8 to 30 days (P = 0.04). Higher rates of unsatisfactory results have been documented in patients with cancer compared with those with CIN3 or lower grade results, and waiting to repeat an unsatisfactory cytology result could lead to harm; for this reason, the 2019 recommendations were updated.

### Review of triage strategies for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance among young women [^114P3N59]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

A systematic review reported that in cases of poor compliance with cytologic surveillance, women with ASC‐US/LSIL should be immediately referred for colposcopy. However, repeat cytology should be performed when good follow‐up compliance is guaranteed as it would reduce the overdiagnosis and overtreatment rate. However, another area of concern centers around the period before repeat cytology after the first ASC‐US diagnosis has been released. A prolonged interval of 12 months before repeat cytology has been shown to increase the incidence risk of cancer contrary to colposcopy and/or biopsy follow‐up. Therefore, some researchers urge repeat Pap test at 6 rather than 12 months, as recommended by American policy.

As researchers opt for conservative management, screening by HPV DNA testing, a non‐aggressive management, has emerged as a very sensitive test in earlier detection of cervical lesions than cytology, and is estimated to be the most cost‐effective test for triage of ASC‐US. This screening is based on the identification of HPV, the first and indispensable risk factor for carcinogenesis. Because most HPV infections are transient in young women, the validity of the HPV test for detecting underlying or developing high‐grade CIN is of low specificity. Current guidelines for cervical cancer screening in China, recommend immediate colposcopy referrals for all women with ASC‐US hr‐HPV 16/18, which is the same as in Norwayand Japan. A survey in China assessed the effectiveness of models combining different high‐risk HPVs, namely hrHPV, HPV 16/18, HPV 16/18/58, HPV 16/18/52/58, HPV 16/18/31//52/58, and HPV 16/18/31/33/52/58, to reduce the heavy burden of immediate referral for colposcopy. The HPV 16/18/31/33/52/58 model had the highest sensitivity but was equal to HPV 16/18; however, its specificity was higher 70% versus 57.4% regarding the detection of CIN2+ among ASC‐US patients. Consequently, it referred a few women for colposcopy compared with the hrHPV 16/18 model (36.2% vs 47.6%). The researchers believe that this model is a better alternative triage to diagnose CIN2+ in women with ASC‐US in China.

### Management of atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance pap smears: a reappraisal [^111hTHfY]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2003). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE.: To find appropriate management of patients with atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGUS) Pap smears. MATERIALS AND METHODS.: The authors present their findings on patients with 606 AGUS Pap smears based on colposcopy, cervical biopsies, endocervical curettage, and endometrial biopsy. Twenty-one proposed management schemes by other authors are reviewed. RESULTS.: From 606 AGUS Pap smears, 69% had benign findings and 31% had neoplastic findings. Among 29 patients with endometrial pathology, only 4 patients (14%) were < 40 years old. All proposed management schemes were uniform in the use of colposcopy but differed on the selective use of endometrial biopsy. CONCLUSION.: An AGUS Pap smear requires colposcopy. We suggest endometrial biopsy for women over 40 years old and for women younger than 40 years old who have a high risk for endometrial neoplasia. Better-defined cytologic criteria from cytologists are needed.

### Results of a randomized trial on the management of cytology interpretations of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [^112aKq1J]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to compare alternative strategies for the initial management of a cytologic diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS).

Study Design

A total of 3488 women with a community-based ASCUS interpretation were randomly assigned to immediate colposcopy, triage that was based on enrollment HPV DNA testing and liquid-based cytology at a colposcopy referral threshold of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), or conservative management based on repeat cytology at a referral threshold of HSIL. All arms included 2 years of semiannual follow-up and colposcopy at exit. Loop electrosurgical excision procedure was offered to women with histologic diagnoses of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or 3 at any visit or persistent CIN grade 1 at exit. The study end point was 2-year cumulative diagnosis of CIN grade 3.

Results

The 2-year cumulative diagnosis of CIN grade 3 was 8% to 9% in all study arms. The immediate colposcopy strategy yielded 53.6% sensitivity for cumulative cases of CIN grade 3 diagnosed over 2 years. The human papillomavirus (HPV) triage strategy referred 55.6% of women and detected 72.3% of cumulative cases of CIN grade 3. A conservative management strategy of repeat cytology at the HSIL threshold referred 12.3% of women while detecting 54.6% of cumulative CIN grade 3. To compare triage tests, we re-estimated the performance of HPV and cytology in successfully referring women with underlying CIN grade 3 (ie, ignoring the insensitivity we discovered in colposcopically directed biopsies). A single enrollment HPV test identified 92.4% of the women diagnosed with CIN grade 3. Serial cytology, even at an ASCUS threshold, would have required two visits to achieve similar sensitivity (95.4%) and would have referred 67.1% to colposcopy.

Conclusion

HPV triage is at least as sensitive as immediate colposcopy for detecting CIN grade 3 and refers about half as many women to colposcopy. Follow-up that used repeat cytology is sensitive at an ASCUS referral threshold but requires two follow-up visits and ultimately more colposcopic examinations than HPV triage.

ASCCP risk estimates — postcolposcopy after high-grade referral with no CIN 2+ found indicate that, in the stratum with prior HPV-positive status, if the current cytology is negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM), the CIN 3+ immediate risk is 5.0% and the 5-year risk is 12% with management of Colposcopy and a recommendation confidence score of 80; if the current cytology is atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-US/LSIL), the CIN 3+ immediate risk is 6.6% and the 5-year risk is 17% with management of Colposcopy and a recommendation confidence score of 99.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^1163kbRD]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Atypical squamous cells — cannot exclude high-grade (ASC-H) management — The recommended management of women with ASC-H is referral for colposcopic evaluation (AII). In women in whom cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 (CIN 2,3) is not identified, follow-up with human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing at 12 months or cytological testing at 6 months and 12 months is acceptable (CIII). Referral to colposcopy is recommended for women who subsequently test positive for HPV DNA or who are found to have ASC-US or greater on their repeat cytological tests (BII). If the HPV DNA test is negative or if 2 consecutive repeat cytological tests are "negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy", return to routine cytological screening is recommended (AI). If CIN 2,3 is identified, manage per ASCCP Guideline.

### Adolescents with ASCUS: are they a high risk group? [^112UeHaC]. Clinical Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Population demographics, risk behaviors, and compliance rates for the management of an ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) diagnosis are not well studied in the adolescent population. From June 1994 to December 1996, 1,175 Papanicalou (pap) smears were performed in an urban adolescent clinic on patients age 12 to 18. Of these, 124 (10.5%) were diagnosed with ASCUS or ASCUS with a qualifying statement. A retrospective chart review (n = 83) and telephone interview was performed on patients with ASCUS. Ninety-nine percent of enrollees were African American. Comparisons were made between those patients with normal pap smears and those with ASCUS. No statistically significant difference existed pertaining to age at pap smear, age at menarche, age at first coitus, and education level. A positive association was found in the ASCUS group for the presence of sexually transmitted diseases (P < 0.001), number of sexual partners (P < 0.0007), and pregnancy (P < 0.001). Of the 80% of patients who had an ASCUS diagnosis and were referred for colposcopy (n = 62), only 61% attended their appointment (n = 38). Thirty-nine percent of these patients were aware of an abnormal diagnosis after colposcopy. For those that attended colposcopy, 56% were accompanied by a parent. For those who were not compliant with attendance, none cited parental consent for the procedure as a barrier to obtaining treatment. Adolescent females in an urban setting with multiple sexual partners, history of sexually transmitted diseases, and prior pregnancy are at a greater risk for ASCUS on cervicovaginal smear when compared to their age-matched controls. In addition, the adolescent compliance rate for colposcopy is low. We, therefore, recommend that these adolescent females be observed diligently.

### The management of ASCUS cervical cytologic abnormalities and HPV testing: a cautionary note [^112q1Y8e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

A recently published study of the management of low-grade cytologic smears compared immediate colposcopy to human papillomavirus (HPV) triage and entry cytology smears (conservative management) as three triage techniques for managing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) smears (Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance/Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study [ALTS]). The study reported a high sensitivity (96.3%) for HPV testing using hybrid capture 2 to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III. The authors concluded that HPV testing is a viable option for managing ASCUS smears. We have reviewed the published data from the ALTS trial and have found a large excess of colposcopies and biopsies in the HPV arm in comparison with the conservative management (cytology) arm. In addition, the ALTS trial quality control and pathology review results raise doubts about the diagnostic validity of the study to establish standards of clinical practice. Furthermore, until the 2-year follow-up analysis of the conservative management arm is completed to detect CIN III, a valid comparison between HPV triage and conservative management is not possible. We conclude that, based on published data, HPV testing for routine clinical management of low-grade cytologic abnormalities (ASCUS smears) is not warranted, and that HPV testing is currently an investigational tool.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^116QGrRi]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP risk-based management — one-year surveillance thresholds and indications are as follows: When the estimated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN 3+) risk is below the threshold for immediate colposcopy (4.0% immediate risk) and above the 3-year follow-up threshold (≥ 0.55% at 5 years), repeat testing in 1 year with human papillomavirus (HPV)-based testing is recommended (AII). Follow-up at 1 year is recommended after screening tests showing minimal abnormalities — HPV-positive/negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) or HPV-negative/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) with unknown previous screening history (immediate risks 2.1% and 1.9% respectively) — and after colposcopy with biopsies of histologic LSIL (CIN 1) or less preceded by a low-grade cotest result (defined as HPV-positive LSIL, HPV-positive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US], or repeated HPV-positive NILM). Because risk is substantially reduced after a documented negative HPV primary screening test or cotest or normal colposcopic examination with biopsy confirmation of less than CIN 2, 1-year surveillance, not colposcopy, is recommended for most patients with new HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL results after a documented negative HPV test or cotest within approximately 5 years or colposcopic examination less than CIN 2 within the past year. Three-year surveillance is recommended for patients whose risk falls between the 3- and 5-year follow-up thresholds; patients with an HPV-negative ASC-US screening result in the setting of an unknown history can return at 3 years (estimated 5 year CIN 3+ risk of 0.40%), and patients with a low-grade cotest result followed by colposcopy less than CIN 2 and a negative follow-up HPV test or cotest reach the 3-year return threshold. A previous negative cytology result alone does not reduce subsequent risk like a negative HPV-based screen; therefore, cytology alone is not used to modify subsequent management recommendations.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^111Umqem]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide revised evidence-based consensus guidelines for managing women with abnormal cervical cancer screening test results.

Participants

A group of 146 experts, including representatives from 29 professional organizations, federal agencies, and national and international health organizations, met in Bethesda, MD, September 18–19, 2006, to develop the guidelines. MAJOR CHANGES IN GUIDELINES: The core recommendations for managing women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions were changed minimally. Postcolposcopy management for women with these cytological abnormalities is now identical. Management recommendations for these conditions did change for "special populations", such as adolescents for whom a more conservative approach incorporating cytological follow-up for 2 years was approved. Core recommendations for managing women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and atypical glandular cells also underwent only minor modifications. More emphasis is placed on immediate "screen-and-treat" approaches when managing women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Testing for high-risk human papillomavirus DNA is incorporated into the management of women with atypical glandular cells after their initial evaluation with colposcopy and endometrial sampling. The 2004 Interim Guidance for the use of human papillomavirus DNA testing as an adjunct to cervical cytology for screening in women 30 years and older was formally adopted with only very minor modifications.

Conclusions

The 2006 Consensus Guidelines reflect recent data from large clinical trials and advances in technology and are designed to assist clinicians of all subspecialties.

### Role of screening history in clinical meaning and optimal management of positive cervical screening results [^115bqUBL]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cervical cancer is caused by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. US consensus management guidelines for a positive cervical screening result typically focus on the current screening result only. A negative testing history may alter risk of the following positive screening results, caused by a new HPV infection, and therefore its optimal management.

Methods

Women ages 30years and older were screened with triennial HPV and cytology co-testing at Kaiser Permanente Northern California from 2003 to 2014. We estimated the subsequent 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or more severe diagnoses (CIN3+) in a cohort of 1 156 387 women following abnormal (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US] or worse) cytology and/or positive HPV testing, when the test result followed 0 (n = 990 013), 1 (n = 543 986), 2 (n = 245 974), or 3 (n = 79 946) consecutive negative co-test(s). All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

Following 0–3 successive negative co-tests, 5-year CIN3+ risks following a positive HPV test decreased progressively from 7.2% (95% CI = 7.0% to 7.4%) to 1.5% (95% CI = 0.7% to 3.4%) (Ptrend < .001). Similarly, risks following an abnormal (ASC-US or worse) cytology result decreased from 6.6% (95% CI = 6.4% to 6.9%) to 1.1% (95% CI = 0.5% to 2.3%) (Ptrend < .001). Risks following low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, the risk threshold for referral to colposcopy in the United States, decreased from 5.2% (95% CI = 4.7% to 5.7%) to 0.9% (95% CI = 0.2% to 4.3%). Risks following high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or more severe, a specific marker for the presence of precancerous lesions, decreased from 50.0% (95% CI = 47.5% to 52.5%) to 10.0% (95% CI = 2.6% to 34.4%).

Conclusions

Following one or more sequential antecedent, documented negative co-tests or HPV tests, women with HPV-positive ASC-US or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion might have sufficiently low CIN3+ risk that they do not need colposcopy referral and might instead undergo 6–12-month surveillance for evidence of higher risk before being referred to colposcopy.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^117Jq41o]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — clinical situations framework specifies that patients with abnormal cervical cancer screening results are managed within "5 common clinical situations", including "(a) initial management of an abnormal screening test result", "(b) return visit for surveillance of a previous abnormal result that did not lead to colposcopy (e.g. HPV-positive ASC-US), with consideration of whether to continue surveillance or refer to colposcopy", "(c) evaluation of the colposcopic biopsy results with consideration of whether to treat or begin postcolposcopy surveillance", and "(d) managing test results after treatment".

### An introduction to the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^115njFKx]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — colposcopy referral threshold and equal-risk principle specify that the clinical action threshold for referral to colposcopy is a 4.0% immediate risk of CIN 3+. Patients with an underlying immediate risk of CIN 3+ of 4.0% or more are recommended to have colposcopy when this risk follows HPV-positive ASC-US, HPV-positive low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or greater, HPV 16-positive NILM, a posttreatment positive HPV test, or other equally high-risk results. If a new triage test for HPV-positive patients is shown to convey a CIN 3+ risk greater than or equal to 4.0% upon immediate referral, the management of a positive result would be upgraded to referral to colposcopy, with optional or even preferred, expedited treatment if risk is sufficiently high, consistent with the guiding principle of "Equal Management of Equal Risk".

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors: erratum [^111STseh]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

2019 ASCCP risk-based management erratum — Figure 2 legend for minimally abnormal HPV-positive ASC-US specifies corrected risk estimates and recommendations. This figure demonstrates how a patient with a common minimally abnormal screening test result (HPV-positive ASC-US) would be managed based on risk estimates. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.45%). If colposcopy shows less than CIN 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). If the HPV-based test performed for the second post-colposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. If the second post-colposcopy surveillance test results are either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of ASC-H or higher, colposcopy is recommended. Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASCUS or LSIL results. Note similar management would be recommended if the initial abnormality preceding colposcopy were any minimally abnormal test result (i.e., less severe than ASC-H). The erratum clarifies that the prior legend instead reported immediate risk 4.2% and a 5-year risk of 3.2% (1-year return).

### Is colposcopic biopsy overused among women with a cytological diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS)? [^1111JYdk]. Journal of Women's Health (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) during cervical screening indicates cellular abnormality but is not sufficient for a definitive diagnosis of a squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL). Before the 2001 consensus guidelines for the management of women with cervical cytological abnormalities are introduced, follow-up management of ASCUS women by colposcopic biopsy is done at patient and physician discretion.

Methods

In this study, we examined variables associated with the method of follow-up (colposcopic biopsy, repeat Pap smear) in a sample of 651 women(ages 18–82 years) who were diagnosed with ASCUS and were then referred for either a colposcopic biopsy or a repeat Pap smear at their next follow-up appointment.

Results

In a multivariate logistic regression analysis (outcome variable = follow-up by colposcopic biopsy or by repeat Pap smear), we found that the odds of follow-up by colposcopic biopsy were 8-fold (OR 8.5, 95% CI 4.4–16.3) higher for high-income (> 47,117 US dollars vs. < 24,767 US dollars) women, 2-fold higher (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.5–5.1) for women with private insurance (relative to Medicaid), and 3-fold higher (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3–7.4) for middle-aged women (ages 36–45 vs. > 55 y).

Conclusions

In stratified analyses, we found that high income was positively associated with odds of colposcopic biopsy in all strata of health coverage and that among those in the highest income category, private insurance remained an indicator of colposcopic biopsy use. Our findings raise the possibility that among women with ASCUS, there is an overuse of colposcopic biopsy by high-income and privately insured women who are likely to be at low risk of cervical malignancies.

### Cytopathology update on atypical squamous cells [^116MQaVm]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2005). Low credibility.

The most common abnormality reported by cervical cytology (Pap tests) is atypical squamous cells (ASC). The two subcategories are ASC of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and ASC, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H). ASCUS show morphology suspicious for a low-grade lesion, while ASC-H cells are suspicious for a high-grade process. ASCUS account for most ASC reports, and the 2002 median ASCUS reporting rates were 3.1% for conventional smears and 4.1% for liquid-based preparations. Reporting rates for squamous intraepithelial lesions and cancer (SIL+) were also higher for liquid-based preparations, and thus the median ASC/SIL+ ratio was lower for liquid-based preparations (1.27) than for conventional smears (1.44). Interobserver reproducibility for ASC is generally considered lower than for other squamous epithelial abnormalities. Women with ASCUS may be managed by human papillomavirus DNA testing, repeated cytology, or colposcopy, while women with ASC-H should generally proceed to colposcopy.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^112DmStL]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

ASC-US general management — women older than 20 years: A program that includes testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), repeat cervical cytological testing, or colposcopy are all acceptable methods for managing women older than 20 years with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) (AI). When liquid-based cytology is used, or when co-collection for HPV DNA testing can be done, reflex HPV DNA testing is the preferred approach (AI). Women with ASC-US who are HPV DNA negative can be followed up with repeat cytological testing at 12 months (BII). Women who have HPV DNA positive should be managed in the same fashion as women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and be referred for colposcopic evaluation (AII). Endocervical sampling is preferred for women in whom no lesions are identified (BII) and those with an unsatisfactory colposcopy (AII) but is acceptable for women with a satisfactory colposcopy and a lesion identified in the transformation zone (CII). Acceptable postcolposcopy management options when CIN is not identified are HPV DNA testing at 12 months and repeat cytological testing at 6 and 12 months (BII), and it is recommended that HPV DNA testing not be performed at intervals less than 12 months (EIII).

### ASCCP patient management guidelines: pap test specimen adequacy and quality indicators [^112u84qd]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Our objective was to provide management guidelines according to Papanicolaou (Pap) test specimen adequacy based on literature review and expert opinion. A task force named by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) conducted a literature review and discussed appropriate management. The Steering Committee of the ASCCP and other experts reviewed the guidelines. The guidelines recommend a repeated Pap test in 12 months for most women undergoing routine annual/biennial screening if the current Pap test is negative but either lacks an endocervical/ transformation zone component or is partially obscured. Indications for considering an earlier repeat are also provided. The preferred managementfor unsatisfactory Pap tests is a repeated Pap test within a short interval of 2 to 4 months. The management guidelines will help promote optimal and uniform follow-up of women according to Pap test specimen adequacy.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — cytology ASC-H or HSIL in patients younger than 25 years: Colposcopy is recommended for patients younger than 25 years with ASC-H or HSIL cytology (AII), and immediate treatment without histologic confirmation is not recommended.

FIGUR'E 1
This figure demonstrates how patient risk is evaluated. For a given current results and history combination, the immediate CIN 3+ risk is examined. If this risk is 4% or greater, immediate management via colposcopy or treatment is indicated. If the immediate risk is less than 4%, the 5-year CIN 3+ risk is examined to determine whether patients should return in 1, 3, or 5 years.

The 5-year return Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after a negative screening test using HPV testing or cotesting in the general population, for whom retesting in 5 years is recommended by national screening guidelines. Patients with risks at or below this threshold are recommended to receive routine screening at 5-year intervals with HPV-based testing (Section E.1).
The 3-year return Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after a negative cervical cytology screen in the general population, for whom retesting in 3 years is recommended by national screening guidelines. Patients with risks at or below this threshold but above the 5-year threshold are recommended to receive HPV-based testing in 3 years (Section E.1).
One-year return is recommended for patients with risks above the 3-year threshold but below the Clinical Action Threshold for colposcopy (Section E.1).
The colposcopy Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL screening result in the general population, for whom colposcopy is recommended in the 2012 guidelines. Patients with risks at or above this threshold but below the expedited treatment threshold are recommended to receive colposcopy (Section E.2).
The expedited treatment or colposcopy acceptable Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV-positive atypical squamous cells cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H) cytology screening result in the general population. Patients with risks at or above this threshold but below the expedited treatment preferred threshold are recommended to receive counseling from their providers to choose between evaluation with colposcopy and biopsy or expedited treatment (Section E.3). Expedited treatment is defined as treatment without confirmatory colposcopic biopsy.
The expedited treatment preferred Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV 16–positive HSIL cytology screening result in the general population. It is preferred that patients with risks at or above this threshold receive expedited treatment unless they are pregnant, younger than 25 years, or have concerns about the potential effects of treatment on future pregnancy outcomes that outweigh concerns about cancer (Section E.3).
Of note, patients with histologic HSIL (CIN 2) who have chosen observation are recommended to receive colposcopy and HPV-based testing at 6-month intervals (Section I.3).

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: methods for risk estimation, recommended management, and validation [^111juTdu]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

Screening tests and clinical management in the KPNC describe testing platforms and intervals: Since 2001, HPV testing was used to triage atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US); beginning in 2013, patients 30 years and older underwent concurrent HPV and cytology cotests, and in 2013 cotesting was extended to ages 25–29 years. Clinical HPV testing used Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) and reported infection with any of the 13 high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 59, and 68). From 2003 to 2009, cytology used the BD FocalPoint Slide Profiler, transitioning in 2009 to liquid-based cytology using BD SurePath, with results reported according to the 2001 Bethesda system. Patients who tested HPV negative/NILM were asked to return for testing in 3 years versus the 5-year testing interval recommended nationally since 2012, and sensitivity analyses restricting to those returning in 5 or more years had risk estimates not much different from 3 years. Patients with HPV-negative/ASC-US or HPV-positive/NILM were monitored annually and referred to colposcopy for a subsequent abnormal cytology result or HPV positivity (after 2005). Histopathology results were ordered as normal, CIN stages 1, 2, and 3, AIS, or cancer, with < CIN 2 or < CIN 3 indicating results less severe than those thresholds and CIN 2+ or CIN 3+ indicating at least as severe as those thresholds.

### Human papillomavirus reporting: minimizing patient and laboratory risk [^112Gggw2]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Risk management efforts in the cytology laboratory must address the gap between what can be achieved with medical history's most effective cancer screening test, the Papanicolaou (Pap) test, and even higher entrenched public expectations. Data from the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASCUS)/Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study (ALTS) now provide level I clinical evidence from a large, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial that reflex human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing of ASCUS cases is generally the preferred method for initial assessment of the most prevalent category of abnormal Pap interpretation. The proposed combination of HPV DNA testing with cytologic Pap testing, the DNA Pap test, further shows the potential to nearly eliminate false-negative screening results, based on sensitivity and negative predictive values reported in available studies. Human papillomavirus DNA testing also appears to represent a significant enhancement for detection of endocervical adenocarcinomas, which are difficult to detect and prevent. Human papillomavirus DNA testing, when used in conjunction with cervical cytology, can significantly reduce risk to both the patient and the laboratory.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical cancer screening tests [^115dx48i]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

A group of 146 experts representing 29 organizations and professional societies met September 18–19, 2006, in Bethesda, MD, to develop revised evidence-based, consensus guidelines for managing women with abnormal cervical cancer screening tests. Recommendations for managing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) are essentially unchanged. Changes were made for managing these conditions in adolescents for whom cytological follow-up for 2 years was approved. Recommendations for managing high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and atypical glandular cells (AGC) also underwent only minor modifications. More emphasis is placed on immediate screen-and-treat approaches for HSIL. Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is incorporated into the management of AGC after their initial evaluation with colposcopy and endometrial sampling. The 2004 Interim Guidance for HPV testing as an adjunct to cervical cytology for screening in women 30 years of age and older was formally adopted with only very minor modifications.

### Review of triage strategies for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance among young women [^115Td2T1]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In the present study we reviewed the existing literature regarding management approaches for ASC-US and highlight their pros and cons. The ASC-US entity emerged from Bethesda classification 2001. We conducted this review using search words ASC-US triage, ASC-US management in young women, triage tests for ASC-US, and ASC-US outcome from the English literature. We included different cervical cancer policies (American, European and for WHO) and research articles published on ASC-US in young women from the year 2001. We searched in Google Scholar, PubMed, MEDLINE (NCBI) library, Embase (Elsevier), Wiley online library as well as Cochrane library. We defined young women as aged 30years and below. We identified 52 articles which focused on management approaches of ASC-US, seven articles focused on young women aged < 30years. Five of these articles combined ASC-US with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (ASC-US/LSIL) while only two addressed ASC-US as a standalone entity. The limited number of articles restricts the evidence base supporting the adoption of triage strategies. There is yet, no consensus in the literature regarding the management of ASC-US, more so in young women below the age of 30years. Researchers, however, agree on a few aspects, which include the necessity for applying a conservative strategy for managing ASC-US in young women, avoiding direct referral for colposcopy at the initial detection of ASC-US, and avoiding the use of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing on young women (unless living with HIV). Newer techniques such as HPV E6/E7 messenger RNA (mRNA), and dual staining p16/ki-67, may serve as better triage to identify cases of HPV persistence and integration which may subsequently lead to preinvasive or invasive lesions.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: updates through 2023 [^116Ax7ZN]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This Research Letter summarizes all updates to the 2019 Guidelines through September 2023, including: endorsement of the 2021 Opportunistic Infections guidelines for HIV+ or immunosuppressed patients; clarification of use of human papillomavirus testing alone for patients undergoing observation for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2; revision of unsatisfactory cytology management; clarification that 2012 guidelines should be followed for patients aged 25 years and older screened with cytology only; management of patients for whom colposcopy was recommended but not completed; clarification that after treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+, 3 negative human papillomavirus tests or cotests at 6, 18, and 30 months are recommended before the patient can return to a 3-year testing interval; and clarification of postcolposcopy management of minimally abnormal results.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: methods for risk estimation, recommended management, and validation [^116oe3JF]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

The new risk-based management consensus guidelines will use risk and clinical action thresholds to determine the appropriate course of management of cervical screening abnormalities. These risk-based management guidelines represent an evolution of the 2012 guidelines, which incorporated human papillomavirus (HPV) test results into an existing cytology-based management framework by benchmarking 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or higher (CIN 3+) after HPV-cytology cotest results to that of cytology-only results. Since 2013, screening has continued to evolve with HPV vaccination, the introduction of new screening technology, and new knowledge of how history of negative HPV testing changes the clinical meaning of test results. To address these changes while ensuring that future revisions to management guidelines are equitable and simple to apply, the 2019 guidelines will move from result-based management (e.g. "colposcopic referral for HPV-positive ASC-US cytology") to risk-based management (e.g. "colposcopic referral when immediate risk of having CIN 3+ is 4% or greater").

In this article, we described the additional data sources and improved risk estimation methods used to estimate risks that support the 2019 guidelines. For each management scenario and past/current test result combination, we produced a risk profile of CIN grade 2 or higher (CIN 2+), CIN 3+, and cancer risks from the time of the current test until 5 years after the current test. We formalized how risk is used to determine the recommended risk-based management through the use of clinical action thresholds. Finally, we validated risk estimates by examining portability of risk-based management to diverse settings, including underinsured and underserved patients, using risks estimated from 3 independent, previously unpublished cohorts/trials and one published comparison.

### Adherence to guidelines for follow-up of low-grade cytologic abnormalities among medically underserved women [^117Mk6Ft]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether women in the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) who had findings on a Papanicolaou (Pap) test of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) were followed up in accordance with the interim guidelines for management of abnormal cervical cytology.

Methods

For this study period, the guidelines for a Pap result of ASC-US or LSIL specified follow-up by Pap tests repeated every 4 to 6 months for 2 years. If a second report of ASC-US or LSIL was made, the patient was to have colposcopy. We analyzed data from 10,004 women who had a result of ASC-US or LSIL followed by a second ASC-US or LSIL from 1991–2000.

Results

As judged by the guidelines, 44% of women who had 2 low-grade abnormalities were followed up appropriately with colposcopy. Among women with 2 ASC-US results, those aged less than 30 years were more likely to receive colposcopy than the other age groups, while women who were aged 60 years and older were more likely to be followed up with a third Pap test. For each of the 4 result groups, American Indian or Alaska Native women had the highest percentages of a third Pap test, whereas Black or African-American women had a higher percentage of no follow-up.

Conclusion

More than one half of the women studied were not followed up in accordance with the established guidelines for managing abnormal cervical cytology. Factors such as age and race or ethnicity influence whether women with cytologic abnormalities receive appropriate follow-up.

### Risk of precancer and follow-up management strategies for women with human papillomavirus-negative atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [^1131ki4J]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the relative performances of follow-up cytology and carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing among carcinogenic HPV-negative women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), for detection of cervical precancer.

Methods

Twelve-month follow-up management strategies to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) or worse using cytology or HPV testing or both were compared among women with HPV-negative ASCUS in the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance-Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (ASCUS-LSIL) Triage Study.

Results

Overall only 22 of 1,559 (1.4%) HPV-negative ASCUS women developed CIN grade 3 or worse during follow-up compared with 269 of 1,767 (15.2%) HPV-positive ASCUS women (P < .001). Because of the low risk of disease among HPV-negative ASCUS women, only 7 cases of CIN3 were diagnosed between 12 and 24 months of follow-up, limiting power to distinguish meaningful differences in sensitivity among 12-month testing strategies. The specificity of HPV testing (84%) was significantly higher than cytology using an ASCUS threshold (71%) (P < .001). Cotesting with cytology and HPV testing at 12 months resulted in even lower specificity (61%). Because cases were uncommon, the positive predictive value for subsequent CIN3 or worse was low for cytology (2.6%), Hybrid Capture 2 (3.8%), and cotesting with cytology and HPV testing (2.2%). The negative predictive value for all three management strategies was very high (99.70%, 99.82%, and 100.0% for HPV testing, cytology, or cotesting, respectively.)

Conclusion

Women with HPV-negative ASCUS have very low absolute risk of subsequently detected CIN3 or worse in the subsequent 2 years, similar to women with a negative cytology in the absence of HPV testing. The results suggest that women with HPV-negative ASCUS should return to routine screening intervals which may be longer than 1 year depending on age and screening history. However, if increased surveillance is chosen, a single HPV test for carcinogenic types at 12 months has significantly higher specificity and lower referrals than cytology.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^111ASgEZ]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Atypical endocervical, endometrial, or glandular cells not otherwise specified (NOS) — postcolposcopy follow-up when HPV status is known: For women without CIN 2,3 or glandular neoplasia identified histologically, the recommended management is to repeat cytological testing combined with HPV DNA testing at 6 months if HPV DNA positive and at 12 months if HPV DNA negative (CII). Referral to colposcopy is recommended for women who subsequently test positive for high-risk (oncogenic) HPV DNA or who are found to have atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or greater on repeat cytology; if both tests are negative, women can return to routine cytological testing (BII).

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^1149h3vk]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

HPV-based prior results and high-quality colposcopy modify near-term management — after a documented negative HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, a new abnormal screening result has substantially reduced estimated risk of CIN 3+, often leading to surveillance rather than immediate colposcopy; in contrast, a previous negative cytology result alone does not similarly reduce risk. A colposcopic examination confirming low-grade or normal histology reduces estimated risk in the next 2 years and allows patients with HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL at their 1-year follow-up to return for repeat HPV or cotesting in 1 more year rather than immediately return to colposcopy.

### Cost-effectiveness of alternative triage strategies for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [^116cncq7]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Every year approximately 2 million US women are diagnosed as having a cervical cytological result of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US).

Objective

To determine the most efficient and cost-effective management strategy for women in the United States diagnosed as having ASC-US.

Design and Setting

Cost-effectiveness analysis of data from clinical trials, prospective studies, and other published literature. A computer-based model was used to compare 4 management strategies for a cytological result of ASC-US: immediate colposcopy; human papillomavirus (HPV) triage, which includes colposcopy if high-risk HPV types are detected; repeat cytology, which includes follow-up cytology at 6 and 12 months and referral for colposcopy if a repeat abnormal result occurs; and reclassifying ASC-US as normal in which a cytological result of ASC-US is ignored. Reflex HPV DNA testing uses either residual liquid-based cytological specimens or samples co-collected at the time of the initial screening for conventional cytology. Another method, referred to as the 2-visit HPV DNA triage, requires a woman with an ASC-US result to return within 1 month to provide another speciman sample.

Main Outcome Measures

Years of life saved (YLS), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.

Results

The least costly strategy for biennial screening was to reclassify ASC-US as normal, resulting in a reduction in total cancer incidence of 75% for conventional cytology and 84% for liquid-based cytology compared with no screening. The next least costly strategy was HPV DNA testing resulting in a reduction in total cancer incidence of 86% for conventional cytology and 90% for liquid-based cytology, followed by immediate colposcopy with a reduction of 87% and 91%, respectively. Compared with reflex HPV DNA testing, a strategy of repeat cervical cytology or delayed HPV testing costs more but is less effective. When all strategies were compared simultaneously, varying frequency and type of cytological test, biennial (vs every 3 years) liquid-based cytology with reflex HPV testing had a cost of $174 200 per YLS. In a similar comparison, liquid-based cytology with reflex HPV testing conducted every 3 years (vs every 5 years) had a cost of $59 600 per YLS and was more effective and less costly than a strategy of conventional cytology incorporating repeat cytology or immediate colposcopy conducted biennially.

Conclusion

Reflex HPV DNA testing provides the same or greater life expectancy benefits and is more cost-effective than other management strategies for women diagnosed as having ASC-US.

The management options and clinical action thresholds used to translate risks to management were determined by a consensus group of US experts. They are a value judgment that is appropriate for the setting of the United States; these same management options and choice of clinical action thresholds may not be appropriate for a different setting, such as a low-resource international setting or a country with a more conservative attitude toward screening. For instance, deviating management recommendations due to different tolerances for risk in Europe versus the United States were illustrated in the triage of mildly abnormal cytological abnormalities in a previously published meta-analysis. The principle of risk-based management might become a universal principle, but management options and clinical action thresholds will require local decision-making that reflect trade-offs in benefits, harms, and efficiency appropriate for that setting.

Validation consisted of comparing risk and risk-based management to 3 new cohorts/trials and 1 previous comparison. The KPNC cohort, CDC NBCEEDP cohorts, the Onclarity trial, the ATHENA study, and the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry differed by population characteristics (e.g. age, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic strata, prior access to screening, etc.) and by study protocols (e.g. the intensity of screening, whether cytology was read blinded/unblinded to the HPV results, the colposcopy referral algorithms, the use of random biopsies, the number of pathologists reviewing biopsies and ECCs, etc.). Although these differences will naturally result in variability of the estimated risks, they also help inform how portable risks and risk-based management from KPNC are to diverse settings in the United States.

### Is the human papillomavirus test in combination with the Papanicolaou test useful for management of patients with diagnoses of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance / low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions? [^112sbRyH]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is useful in the evaluation of patients diagnosed with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS)/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and whether the HPV test is appropriate as an alternative screening method.

Design

The results of Papanicolaou (Pap) tests and subsequent hybrid capture tube (HCT) II tests for high-risk-type HPV were analyzed for 457 patients. Among these tests, 208 histologic diagnoses were made and correlated with the results of Pap and HPV tests. The sensitivity and specificity of the Pap test, HPV test, and the combined method of Pap and HPV tests to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3 and all CIN were also measured.

Results

Sixty (63.8%) of 94 women with LSIL and 31 (26.3%) of 118 women with ASCUS tested positive for high-risk HPV. The sensitivity values for Pap tests in detecting all cases of CIN and CIN 2/3 were 91.4% and 92.9%, respectively. The sensitivity values of HCT II tests using the high-risk probe for detecting all cases of CIN and CIN 2/3 were 62.6% and 88.1%, respectively. Biopsies confirmed that 10 (22.7%) of 44 LSIL patients with high-risk HPV had CIN 2/3, but only 1 (4.5%) of 22 LSIL patients without high-risk HPV had CIN 2/3.

Conclusion

Testing for high-risk HPV with the HCT II test is useful in the detection of CIN 2/3 in LSIL groups and in the selection of patients for colposcopy in ASCUS groups, but it is not suitable for cervical cancer screening tests.

HPV-positive ASC-US management after colposcopy with less than CIN 2 — The corrected Figure 2 legend states that a patient with this minimally abnormal screening result "would be managed based on risk estimates". "The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.5%)". If colposcopy shows "less than CIN 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return)", and at the 1-year return a second HPV-positive ASC-US "has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return)". For the second postcolposcopy surveillance test, "if the HPV-based test performed for the second postcolposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended". If results are "either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of ASC-H or higher, colposcopy is recommended", and "Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASC-US or LSIL results". Similar management "would be recommended if the initial abnormality preceding colposcopy were any minimally abnormal test result (i.e., less severe than ASC-H)".

TABLE 1
Participating Organizations

Box 1. Essential Changes From Prior Management Guidelines

1) Recommendations are based on risk, not results.

Recommendations of colposcopy, treatment, or surveillance will be based on a patient's risk of CIN 3+ determined by a combination of current results and history (including unknown history). The same current test results may yield different management recommendations depending on the history of recent past test results. 2) Colposcopy can be deferred for certain patients.
Repeat HPV testing or cotesting at 1 year is recommended for patients with minor screening abnormalities indicating HPV infection with low risk of underlying CIN 3+ (e.g. low-grade cytologic abnormalities after a documented negative screening HPV test or cotest).
At the 1-year follow-up test, referral to colposcopy is recommended if results remain abnormal. 3) Guidance for expedited treatment is expanded (i.e. treatment without colposcopic biopsy).
Expedited treatment was an option for patients with HSIL cytology in the 2012 guidelines; this guidance is now better defined.
For nonpregnant patients 25 years or older, expedited treatment, defined as treatment without preceding colposcopic biopsy demonstrating CIN 2+, is preferred when the immediate risk of CIN 3+ is ≥ 60%, and is acceptable for those with risks between 25% and 60%. Expedited treatment is preferred for nonpregnant patients 25 years or older with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology and concurrent positive testing for HPV genotype 16 (HPV 16) (i.e. HPV 16–positive HSIL cytology) and never or rarely screened patients with HPV-positive HSIL regardless of HPV genotype.
Shared decision-making should be used when considering expedited treatment, especially for patients with concerns about the potential impact of treatment on pregnancy outcomes. 4) Excisional treatment is preferred to ablative treatment for histologic HSIL (CIN 2 or CIN 3) in the United States. Excision is recommended for adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). 5) Observation is preferred to treatment for CIN 1.
Treatment remains acceptable for patients with repeat diagnoses of CIN 1 persisting 2 years or more. 6) Histopathology reports based on Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST)/World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for reporting histologic HSIL should include CIN 2 or CIN 3 qualifiers, i.e. HSIL(CIN 2) and HSIL (CIN 3). 7) All positive HPV tests, regardless of genotype, should have additional reflex triage testing performed from the same laboratory specimen (e.g. reflex cytology).
Additional testing from the same laboratory specimen is recommended because the findings may inform colposcopy practice. For example, those with HSIL cytology and concurrent positive testing for HPV genotype 16 qualify for expedited treatment.
HPV 16 or 18 infections have the highest risk for CIN 3 and occult cancer, so additional evaluation (e.g. colposcopy with biopsy) is necessary even when cytology results are negative.
If HPV 16 and 18 testing is positive, and additional laboratory testing of the same sample is not feasible, the patient should proceed directly to colposcopy. 8) Continued surveillance with HPV testing or cotesting at 3-year intervals for at least 25 years is recommended after treatment of histologic HSIL, CIN 2, CIN 3, or AIS. Continued surveillance at 3-year intervals beyond 25 years is acceptable for as long as the patient's life expectancy and ability to be screened are not significantly compromised by serious health issues.
The 2012 guidelines recommended return to 5-year screening intervals and did not specify when screening should cease. New evidence indicates that risk remains elevated for at least 25 years, with no evidence that treated patients ever return to risk levels compatible with 5-year intervals.
Surveillance with cytology alone is acceptable only if testing with HPV or cotesting is not feasible. Cytology is less sensitive than HPV testing for detection of precancer and is therefore recommended more often. Cytology is recommended at 6-month intervals when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended annually. Cytology is recommended annually when 3-year intervals are recommended for HPV or cotesting. 9) Human papilloma virus assays that are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for screening should be used for management according to their regulatory approval in the United States. (Note: all HPV testing in this document refers to testing for high-risk HPV types only).
For all management indications, HPV mRNA and HPV DNA tests without FDA approval for primary screening alone should only be used as a cotest with cytology, unless sufficient, exceptionally rigorous data are available to support primary HPV testing in management.

Prevalence-incidence models require knowledge of each patient's history of test results to determine at which visits they had < CIN 3, CIN 3+, or an unknown < CIN 3/CIN 3+ status. We define prevalent CIN 3+ as CIN 3+ detected after colposcopic referral because of the baseline (current) test results. We define a patient as having < CIN 3 at a visit if the diagnosis was either (1) directly confirmed through histopathology or, in the absence of histopathologic outcomes, (2) if neither HPV nor cytology tests were positive (i.e. HPV negative/NILM or HPV negative/ASC-US). Condition (2) is useful to shorten intervals during which CIN 3+ onset could have plausibly occurred (thus increasing statistical efficiency of model estimates) and cause negligible bias because of the very high probability of an HPV negative with NILM or ASC-US cytologic result indicating concurrently histology < CIN 3. In contrast, patients with positive test results (HPV-positive or ≥ LSIL cytology results), but without histopathologic outcomes or a future < CIN 3 to rule out CIN 3+, are considered to have unknown (in statistical terms, "latent") histologic status at that screen.

These considerations allow us to define the shortest time intervals in which onset of detected CIN 3+ is likely to have occurred: (1) prevalent (left-censored at the current test), (2) incident (interval-censored between the last result < CIN 3 and the time of CIN 3+ detection), or (3) unknown prevalent or incident (CIN 3+ detected in follow-up but cannot rule out disease prevalence). Patients who never had CIN 3+ detected were considered right censored at the time of the last < CIN 3 visit. Individuals who were never defined as < CIN 3 or CIN 3+ at any time points did not contribute to risk estimation. Some illustrative examples of how patients' visit histories are used to define intervals are shown in the Appendix, Part C.

Risk-based management scenarios and eligibility after a prior HPV-negative screen are outlined as follows: Scenario 1 describes initial management of abnormal screening results; Table 1A addresses patients without a documented recent HPV test result, and to qualify for Table 1B, a patient's current abnormal screening test result must be preceded by a negative HPV test documented in the medical record within the past approximately 5 years (e.g., a normal screening interval); Scenario 2 describes surveillance after abnormal results not requiring immediate colposcopy referral, including management of current cotest results after a previous result of HPV-negative ASC-US, HPV-negative LSIL, and HPV-positive NILM; Scenario 3 describes management upon receipt of colposcopy/biopsy results; Scenario 4 describes management after a colposcopy at which CIN 2+ was not found, with Table 4a for low-grade index tests and Table 4b for high-grade index tests; Scenario 5 addresses management after treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3; and notably, HPV-positive ASC-US and LSIL preceded by a negative HPV test are now recommended to be followed-up in 1 year rather than immediately referred to colposcopy.

Human papillomavirus genotyping conducted on residual aliquots was available for almost 19,000 patients at KPNC who were also at NCI-KPNC Persistence and Progression (PaP) study conducted from 2006 to 2013. Selection occurred through a 2-phase stratified sampling design. In the first phase of sampling, patients at KPNC with a cotest within the PaP enrollment window (2006–2011) were selected for storage of residual HPV testing specimens; the collection included approximately 45,000 HPV-positive patients (representing > 3/4 of all HPV positive patients in that period) and a random group of approximately 10,000 HPV-negative patients. Approximately 8% of patients opted out, leaving 44,340 patients enrolled in the study. In the second phase of sampling, residual aliquots of patients in the PaP cohort were selected for genotyping using a complex stratified sampling design based on HPV results and histopathology outcomes (as of 2014) to maximize information yield. Typing focused primarily on HPV-positive patients, which included a random draw plus all unselected patients who were diagnosed with cancer or AIS, 500 unselected patients with CIN 3, and 500 unselected patients with CIN 2. Retesting by research typing assays of HPV-negative patients was restricted to a random group of 500 plus all unselected patients with rare outcomes suggesting elevated cancer risks (i.e. CIN 2+ histopathology or high-grade cytology). Both the KPNC and NCI-KPNC PaP studies have been reapproved yearly by both KPNC and NCI institutional review board committees.

Screening Tests and Clinical Management in the KPNC

Since 2001, patients at the KPNC have been tested with HPV to triage cytology results of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). Beginning in 2003, patients 30 years or older underwent screening with concurrent HPV and cytology cotests. In 2013, cotesting was extended to ages 25–29 years.

The clinical HPV testing was conducted using Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2; Qiagen, Germantown, MD) according to manufacturer's instructions. It reports HPV status as negative versus positive for infection with any of the 13 high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68) and also inadvertently detects through cross-reaction a percentage of closely related low-risk HPV types (e.g. 53, 66, 67, 70, 82, and 82).

### Findings to date from the ASCUS-LSIL triage study (ALTS) [^113N9BNs]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Controversy exists in the United States regarding the proper evaluation and management of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and equivocal (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASCUS, now ASC-US]) cervical cytologic interpretations. To address this issue, the National Cancer Institute initiated the ASCUS-LSIL Triage Study (ALTS). ALTS is a multicenter, randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate 3 alternative methods of management, namely, immediate colposcopy, cytologic follow-up, and triage by human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing. This article summarizes the major findings of ALTS that have been published to date. Patients with ASCUS (n = 3488) or LSIL (n = 1572) were randomly assigned to research arms between November 1996 and December 1998, and were monitored for 2 years. The disease outcome was histologic cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3/cancer. The prevalence of oncogenic HPV was too high to permit effective triage of LSIL using HPV DNA testing by Hybrid Capture 2. However, for the women referred with a cytologic interpretation of ASCUS, HPV triage proved useful, with sensitivity equivalent to immediate colposcopy and a halving of colposcopic referrals. Among older women with ASCUS, HPV testing remained sensitive for detecting CIN 3 and cancer, but the referral percentage was dramatically lower compared to younger women. ALTS yielded insight into the performance of cytology and histopathology; experienced pathologists differed significantly in their interpretations of cervical abnormalities, especially histologic CIN 1 and cytologic ASCUS. Nonetheless, it was possible to distinguish a relatively uncommon type of ASCUS, equivocal for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, that has a high positive predictive value for identifying women with underlying high-grade CIN. Many additional analyses are underway.

Posttreatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3 — first surveillance testing shows that most treated patients (82.3%, total 4,695) have a negative HPV test with immediate and 5-year CIN 3+ risks of 0.34% and 2.0%, leading to 1-year follow-up, and any abnormality on any follow-up test leads to referral to colposcopy, including HPV-positive ASC-US/LSIL cytology, HPV-negative high-grade cytology, and all HPV-positive results.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis based on the atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance / low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion triage study (ALTS) [^112ArzzW]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The ALTS (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASCUS] and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [LSIL] Triage Study) suggests that, for women diagnosed with ASCUS, human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing followed by referral to colposcopy of only those women with oncogenic HPV (i.e. HPV DNA testing) is as effective at detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 or cancer (CIN3+) as referring all women with ASCUS for immediate colposcopy. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of the ALTS trial to determine whether HPV DNA testing is a cost-effective alternative to immediate colposcopy or conservative management with up to three cytology examinations.

Methods

Data from the ALTS trial were used in conjunction with medical care costs in a short-term decision model. The model compared the incremental costs per case of CIN3+ detected as measured by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the following management strategies for women with ASCUS: immediate colposcopy, HPV DNA testing, and conservative management with up to three cytology examinations.

Results

The least costly and least sensitive strategy was conservative management with one repeat cytology examination using a threshold of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) for referral to colposcopy. Compared with this strategy, triage to colposcopy based on a positive HPV DNA test result had an ICER of 3517 dollars per case of CIN3+ detected. Immediate colposcopy and conservative management with up to three repeat cytology visits detected fewer cases of CIN3+ and were more costly than HPV DNA testing. Immediate colposcopy became cost-effective at 20,370 dollars compared with HPV DNA testing only if colposcopy and biopsy were assumed to be 100% sensitive.

Conclusions

HPV DNA testing is an economically viable strategy for triage of ASCUS cytology. The less than perfect sensitivity of colposcopy and biopsy needs to be accounted for in future clinical guidelines and policy analyses.

### Empiric vaginal metronidazole in the management of the ASCUS Papanicolaou smear: a randomized controlled trial [^116DXHQN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether empiric treatment with vaginal metronidazole in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) on Papanicolaou smear increases the number of cases that regress to normal on repeated cytologic studies.

Methods

A randomized double-masked trial was designed to compare women with ASCUS on screening Papanicolaou smear who received vaginal metronidazole, 37.5 mg twice daily, or placebo gel twice daily, for 5 days. Normalization of repeated Papanicolaou smear at 3 months was the primary end point. Regression to normal between the two groups was compared by chi2 analysis. Power analysis required 45 women per study arm to demonstrate a 50% improvement in regression to normal among the metronidazole-treated women, at alpha = 0.05 and 80% power.

Results

One hundred and six tubes of gel were dispensed, 54 metronidazole and 52 placebo. Eighty-four women (79%) returned for repeated cytologic examination at a mean of 6.5 months. Overall, 50 women (60%) had normal findings on repeated cytologic examination, and 34 (40%) had persistent abnormal findings. Twenty-two women had repeated ASCUS, and 11 had squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) on repeated cytologic examination. Regression to normal was found in 22 (54%) metronidazole-treated women and 28 (65%) placebo recipients. The number of cases of repeated ASCUS (31% versus 25%) or SIL (15% versus 10%) were similar between the two groups.

Conclusions

Empiric vaginal metronidazole does not improve the management of women with ASCUS on Papanicolaou smear and should be discouraged.

MINOR 2019 GUIDELINE UPDATES TO CORRECT TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS OR CLARIFY WORDING

1) Correction to Figure 7 clarifying that a total of 3 negative HPV-based tests are needed after treatment to return to a 3-year testing interval: The original Figure 7 of the 2019 Guidelines was updated. The revised Figure 7 in this report replaces the original Figure 7 and should be used for clinical management. The revised Figure 7 matches the information included in Table 5b of Egemen et aland the text of the guidelines article, which reads: "In patients treated for histologic or cytologic HSIL, after the initial HPV-based test at 6 months, annual HPV or cotesting is preferred until 3 consecutive negative tests have been obtained (AII)". Risk estimates for the 2019 Guidelines indicate that, following excisional treatment for histologic HSIL/CIN2–3, three consecutive negative HPV tests or cotests are needed at 1-year intervals to identify a group of patients at sufficiently low risk that they can safely return to 3-year testing interval. The 2019 Guidelines recommend that the first test occur 6 months after the excisional procedure. Figure 7 erroneously recommended an HPV test or cotest at 6 months followed by 3 consecutive annual HPV or cotests (a total of 4 consecutive negative tests). This has been corrected to recommend the first HPV test or cotest at 6 months followed by additional HPV or cotests at 18 months and 30 months. The figure has also been modified to clarify that follow-up should continue at 3-year intervals for a minimum of 25 years and through at least age 65 years and may continue for as long as the patient is in good health.
2) Prior Correction to Figure 2 Legend Published October 2020: The legend for Figure 2 of the original 2019 Guidelines articlewas updated to clarify the algorithm for management after a minimally abnormal screening test result followed by a colposcopy at which high-grade histology was not found. The figure legend is repeated here for clarity: "This figure demonstrates how a patient with a common minimally abnormal screening test result (HPV-positive ASC-US) would be managed based on risk estimates. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.45%). If colposcopy shows less than CIN 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). Note similar management would be recommended if the initial abnormality preceding colposcopy were any minimally abnormal test result (i.e. less severe than ASC-H). If the HPV-based test performed for the second postcolposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. If the second postcolposcopy surveillance test results are either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of ASC-H or higher, colposcopy is recommended. Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASC-US or LSIL results".

Precolposcopy screening — analysis population and prior-result strata are defined: Analyses were restricted to 1,546,426 patients with no known history of CIN 2+ or hysterectomy who were not missing HPV or cytology results at the initial screen, with insufficient and noncancer histology results excluded. Risks were estimated for a given testing round, and beginning with the second round risks informed precolposcopy management after immediately prior results of HPV negative, HPV positive/NILM, cotest negative, HPV negative/ASC-US, or HPV negative/LSIL; risk estimates were not provided for other prior abnormal results such as HPV positive/ASC-US or HPV positive/LSIL.

ASCCP risk-based management — limitations and special-case cytology handling: The risks for some rare combinations could not be estimated with confidence, and for rare high-grade cytology such as ASC-H, AGC, and HSIL+, risk estimation after diagnoses of CIN 1 or less was less reliable and results are managed cautiously. Anticipated vaccine-era effects are noted: HPV vaccination is expected to decrease prevalence in patients between ages 25–29 years, and once enough data accrue on the vaccinated population, risk scores will be re-evaluated to determine recommended management for the vaccinated population.

THE GENERAL APPROACH TAKEN TO CREATE THE NEW GUIDELINES

The ASCCP and NCI cooperatively planned and supported the consensus process, with administrative support provided by the ASCCP. The convening of the consensus group is described in the main guidelines article. Once convened, the major task of the participating representatives was to decide on durable clinical action thresholds, striving to represent US consensus as to what clinical actions are recommended for increasing severity of cervical screening abnormalities. The following axiomatic principles were followed: the main purpose of cervical screening in the United States is to find precancerous lesions ("precancer") that can be treated easily to prevent invasive cervical cancer. Putting aside temporarily whether precancer is best defined as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/CIN 3/AIS, or CIN 3/adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), or histologic high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/AIS, there are a limited number of clinical actions available to clinicians and patients when faced with a cervical screening abnormality. Logically, a patient known to be at very high risk of having precancer has the greatest need of preventive treatment; at the highest risk, expedited treatment might be preferred without need for colposcopic biopsy. At somewhat lower but still high risk, colposcopic biopsies are recommended to find or rule out precancer requiring treatment. At lower but nonnegligible risk, colposcopy is not needed, but surveillance at shortened intervals is prudent (1 and 3 years were maintained as the 2 levels of concern/attention) to reduce the risk of "interval cancers" occurring before the next testing visit. Women at very low risk provided by a negative human papillomavirus (HPV) test (or HPV and cytology cotest) are recommended to continue screening at the 5-year interval.

E.2 Clinical Action Threshold Leading to Recommendation of Colposcopy

Guideline: When patients have an estimated immediate risk of diagnosis of CIN 3+ of 4.0% or greater based on history and current results, referral to colposcopy is recommended (AII).

Rationale: The following principles were used to develop the Clinical Action Threshold for referral to colposcopy: (a) colposcopy visits recommended by the threshold should yield information useful for clinical decision-making. Thus, the threshold was based on the risk of diagnosing CIN 3+ upon immediate referral to colposcopy. (b) In the absence of a compelling rationale, the colposcopy threshold should be similar to 2012 referral recommendations that are generally accepted as an appropriate balance of benefits and harms.

The 2001 consensus guidelineswere the first to standardize the colposcopy referral threshold, referring patients with LSIL and HPV-positive ASC-US to colposcopy. This recommendation has been carried forward through revisions in 2006 and 2012. The workgroup reviewed frequently cited studies and noted that immediate risk (CIN 3+ found among patients referred directly to colposcopy) ranged from 3% to 7%. – Current KPNC data were reviewed, and it was noted that immediate CIN 3+ risk clustered in 3 groups: (a) high-grade test results (defined as cytology ASC-H, atypical glandular cell [AGC], HSIL, or higher) having high (> 25%) risk; (b) low-grade results (HPV-positive ASC-US or HPV-positive LSIL cytology with unknown previous screening history and HPV-positive NILM cytology occurring at 2 consecutive annual visits) having just over 4.0% risk; and (c) result combinations for which colposcopy has historically not been performed having risks below 4% (HPV-positive NILM cytology, HPV-negative LSIL cytology, and HPV-negative ASC-US cytology with unknown previous screening histories). The Clinical Action Threshold of a 4% immediate CIN 3+ risk was considered a reasonable balance of benefits and harms as, in a population with unknown screening history, it led to referral of HPV-positive patients with ASC-US or LSIL cytology, but not the large group of patients with HPV-positive NILM cytology.

Cytology results at KPNC were reported based on the 2001 Bethesda System, categorized as: negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM), atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), atypical squamous cells cannot exclude an high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H), atypical glandular cells (AGC) (note, subcategorization of AGC is described in Perkins et al.), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse (HSIL+), and inadequate.

We reported HPV status as negative versus positive for infection with any of the 13 pooled high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68), recognizing that HC2 also detects through cross-reaction a percentage of closely related HPV types (e.g. 53, 66, 67, 70, 82, and 82v). A subset of HC2-positive cervical specimens at KPNC had HPV typing, as part of the National Cancer Institute-KPNC Persistence and Progression Study. These results are reported separately by Demarco et al.

For the main analyses and consensus guidelines, precancer was defined as a histopathologic diagnosis of CIN 3+ (CIN 3/AIS/cancer). CIN 2 was de-emphasized because it is a less reliable histopathologic definition of precancer. However, ancillary analyses considered CIN 2+ (CIN 2/CIN 3/AIS/cancer) as an alternative definition of precancer and cancer by itself as an alternative outcome (please refer to the comprehensive tables available online at).

Statistical Analysis

We used prevalence-incidence mixture models. – The model is a mixture of logistic regression for events present at the time of the current visit (prevalent disease) and proportional hazards model for events occurring after the current visit (incident disease). We estimated risk of CIN 3+ at years 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5; most decisions considered the immediate risks at year 0 and the 5-year risks (see Figure 2 and Cheung et al. for details).

guidelines for management of screen-positive women

A woman with a high-grade cytological lesion, a repeated low-grade lesion or an equivocal cytology result and a positive HPV test should be referred for colposcopy. The role of colposcopy is to identify the location of the abnormal cells, to target taking of biopsies and to decide whether any treatment is required. Colposcopy should only be carried out by adequately trained health professionals.
Guidelines are provided for the management of ASC-US and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Guidelines for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) are difficult to delineate because current evidence does not indicate that any method of management is optimal. Repeat cytology or colposcopy are acceptable options, but HPV testing as an initial management option is not sufficiently selective for all women with LSIL. However, HPV testing in older women with LSIL can be considered.
Quality assurance and collection of data on patient management are important elements of the management and follow-up of women referred with an abnormal cervical smear.
Colposcopy is sometimes proposed as an alternative screening method, but its specificity (and probably also its sensitivity) in primary screening is too low for this purpose.

Management of adolescent women with ASC-US or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) — screening intervals and thresholds. The algorithm applies to "Adolescent Women with ASC-US or LSIL (females 20 years and younger)" and specifies "Repeat Cytology @ 12 months"; if cytology is " < HSIL", perform "Repeat Cytology @ 12 mos later", with "Negative" then leading to "Routine Screening". Separately, the text states that in adolescents with ASC-US, follow-up with annual cytological testing is recommended (BII).

### Detection of cervical neoplasia by human papillomavirus testing in an atypical squamous cells-undetermined significance population: results of the becton dickinson onclarity trial [^116fHtBp]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Atypical squamous cells-undetermined significance (ASC-US) is the most common cervical cytologic abnormality. The College of American Pathologists lists the median reporting rate of ASC-US among laboratories in the United States as 5.0% in the 2017 Cytopathology Checklist. Fortunately, only a small minority of women with ASC-US have a high-grade cervical cancer precursor (ie, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions [HSIL] and adenocarcinoma in situ) as well as invasive cervical cancers. Two recent large US cervical cancer screening trials reported an overall prevalence of high-grade cervical cancer precursors in women with ASC-US of 5.1% (n = 1,578)to 9.7% (n = 939); no invasive cervical cancers in women with ASC-US were identified in either study. Because most high-grade cervical cancer precursors and invasive cervical cancers are caused by 13 high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes, HPV testing has become the predominant approach to managing women with ASC-US, both in North America and Europe.HPV-positive women with ASC-US are referred for colposcopy, whereas HPV-negative women with ASC-US are followed-up with repeat testing in 12 months. This approach is recommended by US clinical management guidelines.

LIMITATIONS

Although we had high statistical confidence in most of our estimates, the measure "Recommendation confidence score" is given more as a warning when the percentage is low, signifying lack of confidence in the recommendation because of data limitations (lack of observations or small number of observed cases).

In addition, the risks for some rare combinations could not be estimated with confidence. The ASC-H, AGC, and HSIL+ are rare cytologic results, and CIN 2+ is found in the majority. Therefore, risk estimation subsequent to diagnoses of CIN 1 or less after these cytologic results were less reliable, and because of the concern for occult disease after any high-grade cytology, results are managed cautiously. In other situations, some current cytologic results are grouped together to avoid small categories with almost zero CIN 3+ cases, allowing for calculation of risk estimates.

Postcolposcopy Scenario

Patients identified as high risk in the precolposcopy scenario are recommended to colposcopy or expedited treatment. If the colposcopy does not detect the presence of CIN 2+, then these patients previously defined as high risk are in a postcolposcopy scenario. In the analysis of the postcolposcopy scenario, we restricted to patients with no known history of CIN 2+ or hysterectomy, who were referred to colposcopy for the first time in the KPNC, and whose colposcopy results were normal/CIN 1. We dichotomized the prior level of risk by whether patients were referred to colposcopy after low-grade abnormalities (i.e. HPV positive/NILM, ASC-US, or LSIL) or after a high-grade cytology result (i.e. ASC-H, AGC, or HSIL+). Risk estimates were used to determine management immediately after the < CIN 2 colposcopy and at the first postcolposcopy follow-up surveillance visit. The second and third surveillance rounds were used to determine when patients with multiple negative HPV or cotests results after a < CIN 2 colposcopy could safely extend their testing intervals.

ASCCP risk-based cervical screening management — framework and thresholds: The new risk-based management consensus guidelines will use risk and clinical action thresholds to determine management, representing an evolution from prior result-based approaches that benchmarked 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3+ after HPV–cytology cotesting. The 2019 guidelines will move from result-based management (e.g., "colposcopic referral for HPV-positive ASC-US cytology") to risk-based management, exemplified by "colposcopic referral when immediate risks of having CIN 3+ is 4% or greater". For each management scenario and past/current test result combination, risk profiles of CIN 2+, CIN 3+, and cancer are produced from the time of the current test until 5 years after the current test to link estimated risk to clinical action thresholds.

### Diagnosis and management of adenocarcinoma in situ: a Society of Gynecologic Oncology evidence-based review and recommendations [^113wgwya]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Literature Review

Nearly all AIS lesions are asymptomatic and thus are diagnosed during cervical cancer screening examinations. A cytologic diagnosis of AGC results in a diagnosis of AIS in 3–4% of cases and invasive cervical adenocarcinoma in 2%. However, any degree of cytologic atypia can be indicative of AIS, and one study showed AIS diagnosis is most often preceded by a low-grade cytologic abnormality (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). Moreover, because these lesions originate from inside the endocervix, the abnormal cells are often missed on cytology. The ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines provide individualized recommendations for evaluation of abnormal cytologic or positive HPV test results or both. Although not specified by the ASCCP management guidelines, given the high rate of HPV-18–positive AIS, endocervical sampling for any patient who tests positive for HPV-18 is acceptable. An endocervical sample can be obtained using an endocervical curette, which may provide cervical stroma to aid in grading of dysplasia, or an endocervical brush, which is less prone to insufficient sampling and may have higher sensitivity.

Adenocarcinoma in situ frequently coexists with squamous dysplasia. When concomitant AIS and CIN are diagnosed, management should proceed per the recommendations for AIS. When AIS is diagnosed on cervical biopsy, approximately 15% will be associated with an invasive adenocarcinoma. Therefore, the next step in evaluation is a diagnostic excisional procedure to confirm the diagnosis, assess the extent of disease, evaluate for coexisting squamous lesions, and exclude invasive adenocarcinoma before definitive management. A diagnostic excisional procedure is also recommended when cervical biopsies and endocervical curettage are negative in the setting of cytology results of AIS, AGC-favor neoplasia, or persistent AGC-not otherwise specified. A diagnostic excisional procedure before definitive management with hysterectomy is recommended to evaluate for invasive adenocarcinoma, which may require radical hysterectomy; if negative margins are not achieved on the first excision specimen, a second excisional procedure is recommended before hysterectomy to exclude an invasive cancer unless this cannot be performed safely.

Clinical Question 2

How should diagnostic or therapeutic excisional procedures be performed?

Recommendation 2.1

Excisional procedures optimally result in removal of an intact specimen to facilitate accurate interpretation of margin status. Thus, excision by cold knife conization is preferred unless the surgeon is able to consistently remove an intact ("top hat" endocervical excision is unacceptable) specimen of adequate length and width (AII).

### Benchmarking CIN 3 + risk as the basis for incorporating HPV and pap cotesting into cervical screening and management guidelines [^1149yzMT]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2012, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and a consensus of 25 organizations endorsed concurrent cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing ("cotesting") for cervical cancer screening. Past screening and management guidelines were implicitly based on risks defined by Pap-alone, without consideration of HPV test results. To promote management that is consistent with accepted practice, new guidelines incorporating cotesting should aim to achieve equal management of women at equal risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 and cancer (CIN 3+).

Methods

We estimated cumulative 5-year risks of CIN 3+ for 965,360 women aged 30 to 64 years undergoing cotesting at Kaiser Permanente Northern California over 2003 to 2010. We calculated the implicit risk thresholds for Pap-alone and applied them for new management guidance on HPV and Pap cotesting, citing 2 examples: HPV-positive/atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and HPV-negative/Pap-negative. We call this guidance process "benchmarking".

Results

A low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion result, for which immediate colposcopy is prescribed, carries a 5-year CIN 3+ risk of 5.2%, suggesting that test results with similar risks should be managed with colposcopy. Similarly, ASC-US (2.6% risk) is managed with a 6- to 12-month follow-up visit and Pap-negative (0.26% risk) is managed with a 3-year follow-up visit. The 5-year CIN 3+ risk for women with HPV-positive/ASC-US was 6.8% (95% confidence interval = 6.2%-7.6%). This is greater than the 5.2% risk implicitly leading to referral to colposcopy, consistent with current management recommendations that HPV-positive/ASC-US should be referred for immediate colposcopy. The 5-year CIN 3+ risk for women with HPV-negative/Pap-negative was 0.08% (95% confidence interval = 0.07%-0.09%), far below the 0.26% implicitly required for a 3-year return and justifying a longer (e.g., 5-year) return.

Conclusions

Using the principle of "equal management of equal risks", benchmarking to implicit risk thresholds based on Pap-alone can be used to achieve safe and consistent incorporation of cotesting.

### Cervical cancer screening: a review [^115hhbDe]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Each year in the US, approximately 100 000 people are treated for cervical precancer, 14 000 people are diagnosed with cervical cancer, and 4000 die of cervical cancer.

Observations

Essentially all cervical cancers worldwide are caused by persistent infections with one of 13 carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes: 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68. HPV vaccination at ages 9 through 12 years will likely prevent more than 90% of cervical precancers and cancers. In people with a cervix aged 21 through 65 years, cervical cancer is prevented by screening for and treating cervical precancer, defined as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix. High-grade lesions can progress to cervical cancer if not treated. Cervicovaginal HPV testing is 90% sensitive for detecting precancer. In the general population, the risk of precancer is less than 0.15% over 5 years following a negative HPV test result. Among people with a positive HPV test result, a combination of HPV genotyping and cervical cytology (Papanicolaou testing) can identify the risk of precancer. For people with current precancer risks of less than 4%, repeat HPV testing is recommended in 1, 3, or 5 years depending on 5-year precancer risk. For people with current precancer risks of 4% through 24%, such as those with low-grade cytology test results (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US] or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [LSIL]) and a positive HPV test of unknown duration, colposcopy is recommended. For patients with precancer risks of less than 25% (eg, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 [CIN1] or histologic LSIL), treatment-related adverse effects, including possible association with preterm labor, can be reduced by repeating colposcopy to monitor for precancer and avoiding excisional treatment. For patients with current precancer risks of 25% through 59% (eg, high-grade cytology results of ASC cannot exclude high-grade lesion [ASC-H] or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL] with positive HPV test results), management consists of colposcopy with biopsy or excisional treatment. For those with current precancer risks of 60% or more, such as patients with HPV-16-positive HSIL, proceeding directly to excisional treatment is preferred, but performing a colposcopy first to confirm the need for excisional treatment is acceptable. Clinical decision support tools can facilitate correct management.

Conclusions and Relevance

Approximately 100 000 people are treated for cervical precancer each year in the US to prevent cervical cancer. People with a cervix should be screened with HPV testing, and if HPV-positive, genotyping and cytology testing should be performed to assess the risk of cervical precancer and determine the need for colposcopy or treatment. HPV vaccination in adolescence will likely prevent more than 90% of cervical precancers and cancers.

ASCCP 2019 unsatisfactory cytology — management recommendations state: "For patients with an unsatisfactory cytology result and no, unknown, or a negative HPV test result, repeat age-based screening (cytology, cotest, or primary HPV test) in 2 to 4 months is recommended (BIII)". "Triage using HPV testing is not recommended (DIII)". "Before repeat cytology, treatment to resolve atrophy or obscuring inflammation when a specific infection is present is acceptable (CIII)". "For patients 25 years and older who are cotested and have unsatisfactory cytology and a positive HPV test without genotyping, repeat cytology in 2 to 4 months or colposcopy is acceptable (BII)". "If a positive HPV test with partial genotyping is positive for HPV 16 or HPV 18, direct referral for colposcopy is recommended (BII)". Figure 5 operationalizes this via "No HPV or unknown result (any age)", "HPV Negative (age ≥ 25 years)", and "HPV Positive (unknown genotype) (age ≥ 25 years)" leading to "Repeat Age-based Screening after 2 to 4 months", while "HPV 16 or 18 Positive" goes to colposcopy; the caption clarifies that "unknown genotype" includes both scenarios described.

K. SPECIAL POPULATIONS

Introduction: Guidelines described previously apply to the average risk individual with an intact cervix and are based primarily on screening and management data from patients aged 25 to 65 years in the KPNC population. However, several populations require special management considerations. Management of patients who are younger than 25 years, pregnant, immunosuppressed, posthysterectomy, and older than 65 years are detailed hereinafter.

K.1 Management of Patients Younger Than 25 Years

In the 2012 guidelines, patients aged 21 to 24 years were considered to be a special population. In the current guidelines, the consensus was to reference this group as "patients younger than 25 years".

Initial Management After an Abnormal Screening Test Result

Guideline: In patients younger than 25 years with low-grade cytology screening results of LSIL, ASC-US HPV-positive, or ASC-US without HPV testing, repeat cytology alone at 1 and 2 years after the initial abnormal result is recommended (BII). Colposcopy is recommended if high-grade cytology is found at any point (HSIL, ASC-H, AGC, AIS) or if low-grade cytology persists at the 2-year follow-up visit (BII). If reflex HPV testing for ASC-US is performed and the results are negative, repeat cytology in 3 years is recommended (BII). After 2 consecutive negative cytology results, return to routine age-based screening is recommended (BII). If colposcopy is performed and the results are less than CIN 2 (i.e. histologic LSIL [CIN 1] or less), repeat cytology in 1 year (BII), and manage as above (e.g. repeat cytology for ASC-US/LSIL, colposcopy for ASC-H or higher). Clinicians should switch to using risk estimates when patients reach the age of 25 years (see Figures 12, 13).

### Detection of cervical neoplasia by human papillomavirus testing in an atypical squamous cells-undetermined significance population: results of the becton dickinson onclarity trial [^112LzhYj]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Current management guidelines recommend HPV testing as a triage for women, aged 25 years or older, with ASC-US; women who are HPV positive should be referred to colposcopy and those who are HPV negative should be rescreened in 3 years. Current management guidelines do not recommend HPV genotyping for women with ASC-US. However, because of the very high risk of cervical disease associated with HPV 16, it is widely recognized that there is clinical benefit to knowing if an HPV-positive woman has HPV 16. Even if no lesion is found at the time of colposcopy, women who are HPV 16-positive are at higher risk for developing cervical disease in the future. Although women who are HPV 18/45-positive have a lower risk for CIN 3 than those with HPV 16, their risk for invasive cervical cancer (especially adenocarcinoma) is elevated compared to women with the 11 other HPV genotypes (non-16/18/45). Indeed, genotyping guidelines that recommend singling out women with HPV 18, and in some cases HPV 45, when cotesting or using primary screening, are based on the risk of invasive cervical cancer associated with these two genotypes, not the risk of CIN 2 or CIN 3. Because invasive adenocarcinomas typically arise in the endocervical canal and do not arise through progression of a CIN 3 lesion, clinicians may want to alter how they perform colposcopy in women positive for HPV 18 or 45, opting to perform an endocervical curettage even if cervical biopsies are not done.

Eventually, as genotyping assays become available that allow the identification of more individual high-risk HPV genotypes, it is likely that risk-based management guidelines will evolve such that women with ASC-US, who have HPV genotypes associated with a low risk of CIN 3+, will not be referred to colposcopy and instead followed up at some interval. The knowledge of past genotypes also permits persistence tracking after a prior ASC-US result at the time of the follow-up testing.

HPV-based testing: this term is used in this document to describe the use of either cotesting or primary HPV screening for surveillance after abnormalities. It does not apply to reflex HPV testing for triage of ASC-US cytology in this document. The HPV testing and positive HPV results discussed throughout this document refer to high-risk HPV types only.

Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST): this term refers to 2-tiered pathology criteria for evaluating histologic specimens obtained via colposcopic biopsy

Primary HPV testing: testing with HPV testing alone as a screening or surveillance test.

Reflex testing: this means that laboratories should perform a specific additional triage test in the setting of a positive screening test to inform the next steps in management. For example, an ASC-US cytology should trigger a reflex HPV test. New for these guidelines, a positive a positive primary HPV screening test should trigger both a reflex genotyping test (to determine the presence/absence of HPV 16/18 if that information is not included in the initial primary test result) and also a reflex cytology test to determine whether the patient would be a candidate for expedited management.

### Should atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) be subcategorized? Accuracy analysis of Papanicolaou smears using receiver operating characteristic curves and implications for the ASCUS / squamous intraepithelial lesion ratio [^112tSBd8]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

We correlated all Papanicolaou test diagnoses over a 6-month period with biopsy results and determined accuracy using receiver operating characteristic curves and biopsy as the "gold standard". Accuracies were calculated using all atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) cases or by eliminating subsets thereof. Retaining the ASCUS category resulted in significantly greater accuracy for the diagnosis of squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) on biopsy compared with eliminating it by diagnosing all such cases as negative. Subcategorization significantly improved the accuracy of the test only when all cases were included. The highest accuracy without subcategorization was achieved when ASCUS, favor reactive, cases were diagnosed as negative, but this threshold was significantly less sensitive than including all ASCUS cases. Increasing or decreasing the estimated ASCUS/SIL ratio from 2.4 without subcategorization significantly reduced accuracy. Similar results were obtained when high-grade SIL on biopsy was used as the gold standard. Use of the ASCUS category significantly improves the accuracy of the Papanicolaou test. Eliminating any subset of ASCUS reduces the ASCUS/SIL ratio but also significantly diminishes the sensitivity of the Papanicolaou test.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^116UPRPW]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

This patient has a history of treated CIN 3 and more than 1 negative follow-up test, therefore consult Table 5B. Her immediate CIN 3+ risk is less than 4%, so the 5-year risk is used. Her 5-year risk is 0.91%, which is above the 0.55% threshold for a 3-year return, so the recommended management is 1-year follow-up. In the KPNC database, 2,379 women had this result combination, among whom 12 had CIN 3+, leading to a recommendation confidence score of 91%.

Summary of Concepts Underlying Changes From 2012 Guidelines 1

Negative HPV tests reduce risk. An HPV-negative test is virtually as reassuring as a negative cotest. The only instance in which HPV-negative is not reassuring is when cytology is HSIL+. However, this test combination is extremely rare (0.01% of overall screens in Tables 1A, B).

As history, a negative HPV test followed by a positive HPV test suggests a new or reappearing infection, which is lower risk than a persistent infection. Therefore, a prior HPV-negative test leads to lower risks (see Table 1B) than unknown history (see Table 1A). For HPV-positive ASC-US and LSIL, this reduction in risks leads to a change of recommended management. A documented negative HPV test result before HPV-positive ASC-US and LSIL almost halves the immediate CIN 3+ risk (4.4%, 4.3%–2.0%, 2.1%, respectively) and changes the recommended management from immediate colposcopy to 1-year follow-up (see Table 1B).

Validation of Risk-Based Guidelines

A previous validation effort in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry found risks there to be largely similar to that of KPNC. However, we further validated risk-based management for the initial screen using 3 cohorts: (1) the CDC NBCCEDP, (2) the Onclarity Human Papillomavirus Trial, and (3) the ATHENA study.

The CDC's NBCCEDP was established to provide low-income patients (defined as family income at or less than 250% of the federal poverty level) access to screening and diagnostic examinations for breast and cervical cancer. The NBCCEDP analysis cohort consisted of 363,544 patients 30 years and older with nonmissing HPV and cytology test results and no history of CIN 2+ histology. This population includes both patients undergoing screening with cotesting and patients undergoing primary cytology screening who had an HPV test to triage an ASC-US result. Patients also reported whether they had previously been screened. Using estimated risks from the CDC NBCCEDP, we conducted separate validation studies for patients who reported having a prior cytology test in the past 5 years (well-screened) versus those who reported that their prior cytology test occurred more than 5 years ago, that they were never screened, or that they did not know when they were last screened (screened rarely/never/unknown). Because most patients in the cohort had only a single screen, only the immediate risk of positive test results (i.e. HPV positive/NILM, HPV positive/ASC-US, or LSIL+) was available.

ASCCP postcolposcopy scenario — patients identified as high risk in the precolposcopy scenario are recommended to colposcopy or expedited treatment; if colposcopy does not detect CIN 2+, these patients enter a postcolposcopy scenario restricted to those with no known history of CIN 2+ or hysterectomy, referred for the first time in the KPNC, and with normal/CIN 1 results. Prior risk was dichotomized by referral after lower-grade abnormalities (HPV positive/NILM, ASC-US, or LSIL) versus high-grade cytology (ASC-H, AGC, or HSIL+). Risk estimates were used to determine management immediately after the < CIN 2 colposcopy and at the first postcolposcopy follow-up, and second and third surveillance visits determined when multiple negative HPV or cotests results could safely extend testing intervals.

### Postcolposcopy management strategies for women referred with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or human papillomavirus DNA-positive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance: a two-year prospective study [^116r4wnN]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to compare postcolposcopy management strategies for women referred for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) or oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA-positive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1 or less found at initial colposcopy.

Study Design

A 2-year prospective follow-up of 1539 women was designed to assess the percentage sensitivity of different postcolposcopy management strategies to detect subsequent CIN grade 2 or 3 and percentage referral to repeat colposcopy.

Results

HPV testing at 12 months was sensitive (92.2%) for detection of CIN grade 2 or 3 with a referral rate to repeat colposcopy of 55.0%. Repeat semiannual cytology with referral to colposcopy at an ASCUS threshold demonstrated similar sensitivity (88.0%) but with a higher rate of referral to colposcopy (63.6%). Combining cytology and HPV testing did not increase sensitivity and hurt specificity. Baseline viral load and colposcopic impression were not helpful.

Conclusion

The most efficient test for identifying women with CIN grade 2 or 3 after colposcopy might be an HPV test alone at 12 months.

FIGURE 12
This figure describes management of cytologic abnormalities in patients younger than 25 years.

FIGURE 13
This figure describes management of histologic LSIL (CIN 1) in patients younger than 25 years.

Rationale: HPV vaccination became available in the United States in 2006, and patients at the target age for vaccination have now entered the younger than 25-year age group. Consequently, population-level risks of CIN 3+ for a given screening results are expected to decrease through a combination of individual and herd immunity. Observation is indicated for low-grade cytology results (ASC-US, LSIL), which are likely to represent non-16/18 HPV infections with a high probability for regression and low risk for rapid progression to cancer. Accurate risk estimation for this age group is very difficult because vaccination is rapidly changing population-level CIN 3+ risk and the conservative 2012 management guidelines recommend against colposcopy/biopsy for lesser cytology abnormalities, which limits the ability to accurately measure CIN 3+ rates in this age group. Therefore, in the absence of new compelling data to change management in this age group, the 2012 algorithms are carried forward. The guidelines outlined in this document are designed to adapt to changes in population vaccination coverage as well as new technologies, and we anticipate that incorporating HPV vaccination effects on the population-level prevalence of HPV infections will affect management recommendations in the near future.

Management of Cytology ASC-H and HSIL in Patients Younger Than 25 Years

Guideline: Colposcopy is recommended for patients younger than 25 years with ASC-H or HSIL cytology (AII). Immediate treatment without histologic confirmation is not recommended (see Figure 13).

Rationale: Although overall CIN 3+ prevalence is lower, cytology results of ASC-H are associated with higher risks of CIN 3+ than ASC-US, even in patients younger than 25. Therefore, colposcopy is warranted to evaluate the cervix for CIN 3+. Immediate treatment without histologic confirmation is not warranted in this population because of the high rate of resolution of CIN 2+ and the potential harms of treatment.

### Update on controversy over managing abnormal pap smears… [^112pDvAA]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Significant controversy surrounds the optimal management of abnormal squamous cells of undetermined significance reported on Papanicolaou screening for cervical cancer. The recommendations of the ASCUS LSIL Triage Study have been challenged. Solomon and colleagues address these challenges and reaffirm the recommended management options for patients with ASCUS. The initial ALTS protocol provided two treatment options for ASCUS: immediate referral for colposcopy or repeat cytology with referral for colposcopy if ASCUS were present on the second screening. Both options have serious limitations. Only 5 percent of women with ASCUS have severe cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer, resulting in multiple costly and uncomfortable examinations to detect few positives. Conversely, repeat Pap smears lack sensitivity and risk patients being lost to follow-up.

The authors summarized data from several sources to conclude that HPV testing triages 96 percent of CINIII, while referring 56 percent of women for colposcopy; using HSIL as the trigger for referral to colposcopy identifies 44 percent of CINIII but only refers 7 percent of women to colposcopy; using ASCUS or higher as the trigger for colposcopy refers 59 percent of women for colposcopy and identifies 85 percent of CINIII cases. After careful and critical reanalysis of all available data, the authors conclude that HPV testing is a viable option in the management of ASCUS. They disagree strongly with the strategy of follow-up cytology using HSIL as the threshold for referral to colposcopy. They describe this strategy as unsupported by the evidence and potentially dangerous. This controversy is likely to continue. An attached editor's note calls for solutions that are practical and cost-effective, and that will reduce the rate of invasive carcinoma of the cervix.

Above all, physicians must avoid losing patients to follow-up. Over 20 years, we may have come to regard cervical cancer as a nuisance on a positive Pap smear, but those of us who remember young women dying from this disease do not want to have to care for patients in those situations again. — a. d. w.

### The 2001 ASCCP management guidelines for cervical… [^115LfWBX]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

The ASCCP cytologic guidelines specifically considered management of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, atypical glandular cells, and atypical squamous cells. Several options are available for women with ASC-US, which may be evaluated in one of three ways. If the Papanicolaou test was collected using liquid-based cytology, reflex testing of residual cells using a test for 13 types of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA is the preferred management option. 6, 7 Women with a positive high-risk HPV DNA test result should be evaluated with colposcopy. Colposcopy is an acceptable management option in women with ASC-US because approximately 25 percent of these women will have a cervical neoplasia.

Serially repeated Pap tests also are an acceptable form of follow-up in women with ASC-US. If a repeat Pap test detects ASC-US or a more severe cytologic change, the patient should be examined by colposcopy. Serial cytologic evaluation is less robust than using a test for high-risk HPV DNA or colposcopy. Consequently, it is questionable whether serial cytologic testing will remain an acceptable option in future management guidelines. In the past, some women were monitored after colposcopy by serial cytologic testing or cytologic testing combined with colposcopy. Several new follow-up approaches are now recommended. In women with minor cytologic changes, only two negative Pap test results are required before patients can return to a routine testing interval. Because of the more ominous nature of glandular lesions, women with AGC must have four negative follow-up cytologic test results before resuming routine Pap testing. The management of AGC is vastly different from that of ASC.

Although both diagnoses refer to "atypical" cells, women with AGC must have a more aggressive evaluation with colposcopy, endocervical sampling and, in some cases, endometrial biopsy. Because of the more inaccessible nature of glandular cells within the endocervical canal and the colposcopic subtlety of these inconspicuous lesions, only experts should attempt to manage possible glandular neoplasia.

### Empiric care for minimally abnormal pap smears… [^1158cLgv]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

A significant number of Papanicolaou smears are obtained in the United States annually, and approximately 2. 5 million of them are reported to have low-grade cytologic abnormalities. Based on the Bethesda system for reporting Pap smear results, they are classified as minimally abnormal and include benign cellular changes, reactive cellular changes associated with inflammation, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Although these minimally abnormal Pap smear results are common, management strategies vary from treatment with topical or oral antibiotics to repeating the Pap smear in three to six months. Because recent data have shown a link between minimally abnormal Pap smears and bacterial vaginosis, treatment with antibiotics should, in theory, resolve the abnormality. Ferrante and colleagues studied the efficacy of 0.

75 percent metronidazole vaginal gel therapy in asymptomatic patients who had minimally abnormal Pap smear results. Study participants included women who had routine Pap smears with minimally abnormal results, defined as limited by inflammation, benign cellular changes, reactive cellular changes, or ASCUS, that did not favor any neoplastic process. Women who agreed to participate completed a questionnaire to elicit demographic information and risk factors for cervical cancer. Participants were randomized to receive treatment with 0. 75 percent metronidazole vaginal gel, one applicator-full at bedtime for five days, or no treatment. Pap smears were repeated three to four months after enrollment in the study. A follow-up questionnaire was completed at that time to collect data on risk factors for abnormal Pap smears and any side effects of the antibiotic treatment.

editor's note: When coping with abnormal Pap smear results, physicians face the dilemma of determining the best strategy for management. The fact that Pap smears with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions should be assessed by colposcopic examination of the cervix is not questioned in the literature. However, minimally abnormal Pap smear results do not have a clear-cut management strategy. The study by Ferrante and colleagues provides information about something that does not have an effect on abnormalities. Patients with minimal abnormalities can be followed with repeat Pap smears in four to 12 months, based on their risk factors. An important comment made by the authors is that the vast majority of invasive cervical cancers occur in women who have received no screening, so we should concentrate our efforts on that population. — k. e. m.

### Update on ASCCP consensus guidelines for abnormal… [^117GYYRf]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

If satisfactory colposcopy does not identify CIN 2, 3 and endocervical sampling is negative, management may include a diagnostic excisional procedure or cytology and colposcopy every six months until both are negative twice. 5, 6 If HSIL persists at six or 12 months, excision is recommended. 5, 6. Abnormal Cervical Histology in Adult Women CIN 1 If original cytology demonstrated ASC-US, ASC-H, or LSIL, follow-up with cytology at six and 12 months or HPV DNA testing at 12 months is recommended because of the low risk of cancer in women with CIN 1 on biopsy. 7, 8 If CIN 1 persists for at least two years, continued observation is still an option, as is treatment. 7, 8 Excision is preferred for women with unsatisfactory colposcopy, positive endocervical sampling, or previous treatment. 7, 8. For women with CIN 1 preceded by HSIL or AGC-NOS, closer follow-up is warranted because 84 to 97 percent of these women will have at least CIN 2 on excision.

26 Either a diagnostic excision or cytology and colposcopy every six months for 12 months are acceptable, provided colposcopy is satisfactory and the endocervical sampling is negative. 7, 8 Excision is recommended if the colposcopy is unsatisfactory or if HSIL repeats. 7, 8. 7, 8 If histologic AIS is confirmed, hysterectomy is preferred. 7, 8 Because of the high likelihood of missing an AIS lesion or of an incomplete excision, reexcision for positive margins or positive endocervical sampling is preferred if conservative management is planned. 7, 8, 36, 37 Conservative management includes reevaluation with cytology, HPV testing, and colposcopy with endocervical sampling in six months. 49 The rate of CIN 2, 3 is only 3. 7 percent on postpartum follow-up for women with prenatal ASC-US or LSIL. 49 Postpartum regression is common in women with CIN 1 and CIN 2, 3.

50, 51 Management of nonadolescent women with ASC-US or LSIL is the same as for nonpregnant women 5, 6; however, because of the low risk of cancer, the initial colposcopic evaluation can be deferred until at least six weeks postpartum.
