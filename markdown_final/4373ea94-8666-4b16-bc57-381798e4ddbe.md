## Question

what is DeGludec pen injection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what DeGludec Pen Injection is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the product actually is in terms of the molecule and the pen platform. Then, I should verify the pharmacology and kinetics that define its clinical behavior. Next, I will check the specific pen presentations and dose mechanics. After that, I need to confirm labeled uses, dosing, and flexibility data. Finally, I should review administration, safety, storage, and how it compares to other basal insulins.

> Let me first confirm the identity of the product. Degludec pen injection refers to insulin degludec supplied in a prefilled, disposable pen sold as Tresiba FlexTouch, so it is both the ultra‑long‑acting basal insulin molecule and the single‑patient‑use injector that delivers it [^114oYer1] [^111vaLcx]. I should double‑check the generic‑to‑brand mapping and labeling, and yes, insulin degludec is the active drug and Tresiba is the brand under which the FlexTouch pens are marketed in fixed concentrations for subcutaneous use [^116vj2NA] [^114TJuXp].

> Now, I will examine the pharmacology because that drives clinical use. Insulin degludec is engineered to form soluble multihexamer chains after subcutaneous injection, creating a depot that slowly releases monomers and yields a flat, peakless basal profile [^117N9dXE] [^116WCzyv]. Wait, let me verify the time parameters, because titration and hypoglycemia risk hinge on them. The half‑life is about 25 hours at therapeutic doses and the duration of action exceeds 42 hours at steady state, which explains its low day‑to‑day variability and flexibility in dose timing [^116VfCKN] [^113uZhmd].

> Next, I should review the pen presentations and mechanics to avoid a dosing mistake. The FlexTouch 100 units/mL pen contains 300 units and delivers 1 to 80 units per injection in 1‑unit steps, and the FlexTouch 200 units/mL pen contains 600 units and delivers 2 to 160 units per injection in 2‑unit steps, using NovoFine or NovoTwist needles and designed strictly for single‑patient use [^111vaLcx] [^114oYer1]. Hold on, I almost said the 200 units/mL pen delivers from 1 unit, but I should correct that, it dials in 2‑unit increments only and still displays actual units because the device internally corrects for concentration so no manual dose conversion is required when using the U‑200 pen itself [^1179MrTf]. I need to ensure the mechanical attributes are accurate, and FlexTouch uses a low‑force button that does not extend at any dose while maintaining high dose accuracy at low, medium, and high settings [^112rin7v].

> I will now confirm indications and basic dosing. Insulin degludec is a basal insulin indicated for improving glycemic control in adults with diabetes, and it is used across type 1 and type 2 diabetes in basal regimens or as part of basal‑bolus therapy as clinically appropriate [^116vj2NA]. For type 1 diabetes, a reasonable starting range is 0.2 to 0.4 units/kg once daily with subsequent individualized titration, which I should verify against drug information and that aligns with standard references [^117Nnqyw]. For insulin‑naive type 2 diabetes, a common start is 10 units once daily with treat‑to‑target titration, and I should confirm that this is consistent with trial programs evaluating degludec against glargine in insulin‑naive populations, which it is [^116WCzyv] [^1179MrTf].

> But wait, what if the timing of doses varies in real life. I need to check the flexibility data. Forced‑flex and free‑flex phase 3 programs demonstrated that once‑daily degludec maintains noninferior A1C with comparable hypoglycemia when dosing intervals vary markedly between 8 and 40 hours, supporting pragmatic flexibility when schedules are inconsistent, though routine practice still aims for a consistent time [^1156mJoo] [^116VfCKN]. I should confirm this is not just a single trial signal, and indeed multiple analyses corroborate the flexible‑timing profile tied to the long half‑life and flat PK/PD [^113j7EnM].

> Next, I should review comparative effectiveness and hypoglycemia. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from mechanism alone. Randomized trials in type 1 and type 2 diabetes show degludec achieves noninferior A1C versus insulin glargine with a consistent pattern of reduced nocturnal hypoglycemia in several analyses, aligning with its flatter basal action at steady state [^114Bhwku] [^115e1xKf]. The variable‑interval studies also showed similar glycemic control with either fixed or flexible dosing and no excess nocturnal hypoglycemia versus glargine, reinforcing the clinical relevance of its PK/PD profile [^1156mJoo].

> I need to check administration steps because pen technique affects dose accuracy and safety. Let me verify the labeled instructions. Before each injection, confirm the label, ensure the solution is clear and colorless, attach a new needle, prime the pen to remove air, select the prescribed dose, inject subcutaneously into abdomen, thigh, or upper arm with site rotation, and never share the pen even if you change needles [^111vaLcx] [^114oYer1]. I should also confirm priming guidance and dose window function. Priming is required before every injection to ensure accurate delivery, and doses are delivered as displayed in the window without external conversion in either concentration [^114oYer1] [^1179MrTf].

> Let me verify storage and handling because degludec's stability supports home use. Unused pens should be refrigerated before first use, and after first use they may be kept refrigerated or at room temperature for up to 56 days with the cap on and protected from heat and light, which I should double‑check across both pen strengths and the vial IFU to ensure consistency [^114oYer1] [^111vaLcx]. I need to ensure clarity on not extracting insulin with syringes from pens, as this can cause severe dosing errors due to concentration and scale mismatches, so patients should never withdraw insulin from a FlexTouch pen with a syringe [^114oYer1].

> Now, I should consider safety nuances and titration cadence. Hypoglycemia remains the most important risk, and because degludec's effect is prolonged, hypoglycemia can be extended in overdose, so I must emphasize cautious titration and monitoring, especially when changing doses or regimens [^1123WEZK]. I need to check optimal titration intervals, and due to the approximately 25‑hour half‑life and steady‑state kinetics, dose adjustments should generally occur no more frequently than every 3 to 4 days to avoid stacking and misinterpreting response [^1134oCHw] [^113uZhmd]. The pens are not recommended for use by blind or visually impaired individuals without trained assistance, which I should confirm in both 100 and 200 units/mL IFUs to ensure consistent labeling [^114oYer1] [^111vaLcx].

> Let me reconsider potential sources of dose confusion, because that is a common pitfall. The U‑200 FlexTouch pen internally accounts for concentration so patients dial true units rather than volumes, but pens of different concentrations should not be interchanged and doses should not be transferred to syringes, which prevents inadvertent overdose from scale mismatch and maintains device accuracy [^1179MrTf] [^114oYer1]. I should double‑check that the mechanical dosing ranges differ between strengths, and yes, U‑100 dials 1 to 80 units and U‑200 dials 2 to 160 units in 2‑unit steps, which I nearly misstated earlier before correcting myself [^111vaLcx] [^114oYer1].

> Final synthesis. Degludec pen injection is a single‑patient‑use prefilled FlexTouch pen delivering insulin degludec, an ultra‑long‑acting basal insulin that forms a subcutaneous multihexamer depot with a flat, peakless profile, approximately 25‑hour half‑life, and action beyond 42 hours, enabling once‑daily dosing with clinically validated flexibility in timing, noninferior glycemic control versus glargine, and reduced nocturnal hypoglycemia in several trials, available as 100 units/mL and 200 units/mL pens with defined dose ranges and device‑based concentration correction for safe, accurate use [^117N9dXE] [^116VfCKN] [^1156mJoo] [^114Bhwku] [^111vaLcx] [^114oYer1].

Before first use, refrigerate at 2–8°C; do not freeze. After first use, store at room temperature (≤ 30°C) or refrigerated, and **discard after 56 days**. Pens should not be shared, and a new needle must be used for each injection [^111vaLcx].

---

## Clinical benefits

- **Glycemic control**: Effective HbA1c reduction [^115e1xKf] and stable fasting glucose.

- **Hypoglycemia**: Lower risk, especially nocturnal, versus other basal insulins [^113rEVu8].

- **Flexibility**: Allows variable dosing times [^1156mJoo] without loss of control [^113rEVu8].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Hypoglycemia is the **most common adverse effect** and requires close monitoring. Injection-site reactions are rare and generally mild. Overdose can cause prolonged hypoglycemia given the long half-life; monitor and treat promptly [^1123WEZK].

---

## Patient considerations

Patients should receive **training on pen use**, injection technique, and site rotation [^111vaLcx]. Emphasize adherence to regular dosing and glucose monitoring. In renal or hepatic impairment, adjust the dose and monitor closely.

---

Insulin degludec pen injection is a **convenient, effective** basal insulin option with flexible dosing and a favorable hypoglycemia profile, supporting improved adherence and glycemic control.

### Understanding the clinical profile of insulin degludec, the latest basal insulin approved for use in Canada: a narrative review [^113rEVu8]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Degludec achieves a very long and stable glucose-lowering profile through a unique protraction mechanism. This translates into a low risk of hypoglycemia, the ability to dose in the morning or flexibility, and a 'forgiving' profile should doses be missed or mistimed. The scale of the hypoglycemia advantage with the newer analogues, degludec and glargine U300, is comparable to that demonstrated for glargine U100 and insulin detemir over NPH some 15 years ago, when the standard of care shifted away from NPH. The relative clinical advantages and disadvantages of degludec compared with glargine U300 require clarification and are currently under further investigation.

### Patients' preferences for insulin injection devices [^111mEtyc]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2017). Low credibility.

In this issue, Pohlmeier et al. report on a device assessment study in insulin-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes to investigate the ease of use and patient preference of the new prefilled U300 insulin glargine injection pen. Human factor studies are required by regulatory agencies and should ensure the proper use of the device in the context of the provided instructions. The patients found the device easy to learn and use, and they maintained stable treatment satisfaction despite the introduction of injection treatment. The lack of a control arm, the short duration, and the small sample size make it difficult to translate these results into clinical practice. It is encouraging to know, however, that the new pen is accepted by one of the intended patient populations.

### Insulin degludec, an ultra-longacting basal insulin, versus insulin glargine in basal-bolus treatment with mealtime insulin aspart in type 2 diabetes (BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type 2): a phase 3, randomised, open-label, treat-to-target non-inferiority trial [^115e1xKf]. Lancet (2012). Low credibility.

Basal insulin therapy does not stop the loss of β-cell function, which is the hallmark of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and thus diabetes control inevitably deteriorates. Insulin degludec is a new, ultra-longacting basal insulin. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec compared with insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

- **Methods**: In this 52-week, phase 3, open-label, treat-to-target, non-inferiority trial, undertaken at 123 sites in 12 countries, we enrolled adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) of 7.0–10.0% after 3 months or more of any insulin regimen (with or without oral antidiabetic drugs). We randomly allocated eligible participants in a 3:1 ratio to receive once-daily subcutaneous insulin degludec or glargine, stratified by previous insulin regimen, via a central interactive response system. Basal insulin was titrated to a target plasma glucose concentration of 3.9- < 5.0 mmol/L, self-measured before breakfast. The primary outcome was the non-inferiority of degludec to glargine, measured by change in HbA(1c) from baseline to week 52 (non-inferiority limit of 0.4%) by ANOVA in the full analysis set. We assessed rates of hypoglycaemia in all treated patients.

- **Findings**: 744 (99%) of 755 participants randomly allocated to degludec and 248 (99%) of 251 allocated to glargine were included in the full analysis set (mean age 58.9 years [SD 9.3], diabetes duration 13.5 years [7.3], HbA(1c) 8.3% [0.8], and fasting plasma glucose).

### Once-weekly insulin icodec vs once-daily insulin degludec in adults with insulin-naive type 2 diabetes: The ONWARDS 3 randomized clinical trial [^11318eFk]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Once-weekly insulin icodec could provide a simpler dosing alternative to daily basal insulin in people with type 2 diabetes. The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-weekly icodec versus once-daily insulin degludec in people with insulin-naive type 2 diabetes.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A randomized, double-masked, noninferiority, treat-to-target, phase 3a trial was conducted from March 2021 to June 2022 at 92 sites in 11 countries. Participants included adults with type 2 diabetes treated with any noninsulin glucose-lowering agents and with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 7%-11% (53–97 mmol/mol).

- **Interventions**: Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either once-weekly icodec and once-daily placebo (icodec group; n = 294) or once-daily degludec and once-weekly placebo (degludec group; n = 294).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26 (noninferiority margin, 0.3% percentage points). Secondary endpoints included change in fasting plasma glucose from baseline to week 26, mean weekly insulin dose during the last two weeks of treatment, body weight change from baseline to week 26, and number of level 2 (clinically significant; glucose level < 54 mg/dL) and level 3 (severe; requiring external assistance for recovery) hypoglycemic episodes.

- **Results**: Among 588 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 58 [10] years; 219 [37%] women), 564 (96%) completed the trial. Mean HbA1c level decreased from 8.6% (observed) to 7.0% (estimated) at 26 weeks in the icodec group and from 8.5% (observed) to 7.2% (estimated) in the degludec group.

### Understanding the clinical profile of insulin degludec, the latest basal insulin approved for use in Canada: a narrative review [^1134oCHw]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Although degludec has some unique pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties that require special consideration, it has optimal properties for use in primary care for type 2 diabetes (T2D) due to its low hypoglycemia risk and dose-time flexibility. The very constant glucose-lowering effect of degludec over 24 hours may be especially beneficial given the latest Diabetes Canada treatment guidelines, which encourage targeting low A1C values. This is achieved through more aggressive lowering of fasting glucose values, when needed, as well as postprandial glucose control:

- **Relevant recommendations from Diabetes Canada 2018 guidelines**: Modified from Imran et al.

In many respects, the use of degludec is similar to that of any other basal insulin, but prescribers must always be mindful of its very long half-life and hence the longer time required to reach a steady state and assess the impact of any dose adjustments. A drug dose will reach 90% of its steady-state level after three half-lives, equating to approximately three days for degludec; consequently, the recommended interval between dose increases is three to four days. In practice, however, our empirical view is that some patients might even find it more convenient to titrate degludec weekly based on once-weekly fasting glucose testing.

### Switching to insulin degludec/aspart Penfill reusable cartridges in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: Real-life outcomes [^114SokGU]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Low credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world study presenting the outcomes of switching and/or initiating the IDegAsp reusable cartridge insulin pen. The results demonstrated that switching from basal bolus, basal, or premixed insulin therapies with disposable insulin pens to the IDegAsp reusable cartridge insulin pen was associated with significant improvement in glycemic control, reductions in insulin dosage, and weight loss. Additionally, the transition from the prior disposable insulin pen injector (FlexTouch®) to the novel Penfill® cartridge showed noninferior outcomes, thus contributing to both clinical and environmental sustainability.

- **Impact on glycemic control**: One of the primary objectives of this study was to evaluate the impact of switching insulin delivery systems on glycemic control. Our findings revealed a significant improvement in HbA1c levels in patients who switched to the IDegAsp Penfill cartridge system, particularly in those previously using basal-bolus, basal insulin, and premixed insulin regimens. A reduction in HbA1c was observed within 3 months of the switch and continued to improve or remain stable for 6 months. These results are consistent with those of previous real-world studies that demonstrated the effectiveness of IDegAsp in improving glycemic control and reducing insulin requirements. The subgroup of patients who previously used the IDegAsp FlexTouch prefilled disposable pen demonstrated comparable outcomes, indicating that the transition to the reusable cartridge did not compromise the efficacy of insulin therapy.

### SPL drug information for insulin degludec [^116vj2NA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The drug insulin degludec, also known as Tresiba, is a long-acting insulin used to manage blood sugar levels in individuals with diabetes. Its unique formulation allows for a prolonged duration of action, providing more consistent control of blood glucose levels compared to some other insulin types. This property makes insulin degludec a beneficial option for patients who require a stable insulin regimen.

### Ozempic [^115CGHkW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **How supplied/storage and handling**: Ozempic is supplied as a clear, colorless solution available in prefilled, disposable, single-patient-use pens. The concentrations available are 0.68 mg/mL, 1.34 mg/mL, or 2.68 mg/mL of semaglutide. The 2 mg/1.5 mL (1.34 mg/mL) strength (NDC 0169–4132–12) is not currently marketed by Novo Nordisk Inc. Each Ozempic pen is for use by a single patient and must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Recommended storage**: Before first use, store Ozempic in a refrigerator at 36°F to 46°F (2°C to 8°C). Do not store it in the freezer or directly adjacent to the refrigerator cooling element, and do not freeze Ozempic. After the first use, the Ozempic pen can be stored for 56 days at controlled room temperature (59°F to 86°F; 15°C to 30°C) or in a refrigerator. Avoid freezing and keep the pen cap on when not in use. Protect Ozempic from excessive heat and sunlight.

- **Usage instructions**: Always remove and safely discard the needle after each injection. Store the Ozempic pen without an injection needle attached, and always use a new needle for each injection.

### The efficacy and safety of insulin degludec given in variable once-daily dosing intervals compared with insulin glargine and insulin degludec dosed at the same time daily: a 26-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, treat-to-target trial in individuals with type 2 diabetes [^1156mJoo]. Diabetes Care (2013). High credibility.

This 26-week, phase 3, treat-to-target trial in individuals with type 2 diabetes was designed to test extreme intervals for basal insulin administration with once-daily doses of insulin degludec (IDeg), using a forced dosing schedule that created alternating short (8–12 hours) and long (36–40 hours) intervals between doses. This rotating dosing regimen (IDeg OD Flex) is clearly not intended for clinical practice; rather, it was used to explore, from an efficacy and safety perspective, the impact of variable timing of basal insulin administration that might be encountered by patients with changing schedules. The trial population encompassed a broad range of individuals who were likely to benefit from either insulin initiation or intensification.

Overall, variable dosing intervals for insulin degludec (IDeg OD Flex) resulted in similar glycemic control, hypoglycemia risk, and weight gain to fixed dosing intervals for either insulin glargine (IGlar OD) or itself (IDeg OD). The lower fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level found for IDeg OD Flex compared with IGlar OD did not come at the expense of a higher incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia. Indeed, IDeg OD Flex was associated with a nonsignificant 23% numerically lower rate of nocturnal hypoglycemia than IGlar OD, consistent with findings from other studies. Because rates of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia were similar for IDeg OD Flex and IGlar OD, regardless of whether IDeg was dosed in the morning or evening, the lower overall rate of nocturnal hypoglycemia associated with IDeg Flex is thought to be due to the more consistent pharmacokinetic profile of IDeg.

### Biosimilar insulins: Guidance for data interpretation by clinicians and users [^113c6BDH]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Manufacturers of biosimilar insulins may develop their own disposable or reusable insulin pen-injectors or provide cartridges that could be marketed for use in reusable pen-injectors manufactured by either the original insulin manufacturer or a third party. Any new pen-injector will have to meet normal quality standards; for example, 5% precision down to a 20-unit injection, and ± 1 unit below this. Some pen-injectors are likely to perform better than this, and it may be that manufacturers will now be motivated to publish that information in an attempt to persuade clinicians of advantages in clinical performance, particularly at lower doses.

Compatibility of cartridges with existing and third-party pen-injectors is likely to be a requirement of regulatory approval. Other quality issues include design features such as the prevention of injection of a last dose for which the cartridge does not have remaining capacity, readability of the dial-up, and pressure of the injection button. Clinicians should ask for such data for novel pen-injectors.

For insulin pumps, data on insulin stability in use will need to be provided to regulators, including reassurance that infusion set occlusion will not become more of a problem than with the original insulin. Such issues are also affected by the excipients used in formulations. Normally, these issues will be covered by a comment in the label/summary of product characteristics indicating that pump use is appropriate. Without such a comment, clinicians might judge that such use is undesirable.

### Ease of use of the insulin glargine 300 U/mL pen injector in insulin-naïve people with type 2 diabetes [^114JGtqt]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2017). Low credibility.

Long-acting basal insulin analogs, including insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla-100, Lantus®, Sanofi, Paris, France), have been mainstays of diabetes treatment since their introduction more than 10 years ago. The efficacy and long-term safety of Gla-100 is well documented. Once-daily insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla-300; Toujeo®, Sanofi, Paris, France) has been approved for use in the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan, and Australia. Gla-300 has been shown to have more stable, prolonged pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles compared with Gla-100, resulting in comparable glycemic control with less hypoglycemia versus Gla-100 in people with type 2 (T2DM) and type 1 diabetes. Gla-300 contains the same active ingredient as Gla-100 and provides the same number of units but in one-third of the volume.

Gla-100 is usually administered using the disposable (prefilled) SoloSTAR® insulin pen (Sanofi, Paris, France). Because of the difference in volume between Gla-100 and Gla-300, this injector pen required modification to allow accurate Gla-300 administration. In addition, certain features have been enhanced to improve the experience of users. The Gla-300 SoloSTAR injector pen (Sanofi, Paris, France) provides accurate delivery of Gla-300, with low injection force. An initial survey suggested that both pen users and health care professionals who train people with diabetes in how to use pen devices find the Gla-300 injector pen easy to use.

This phase 3b study further investigated the ease of use/ease of learning of the Gla-300 injector pen, as well as treatment satisfaction.

### Will the next generation of basal insulins offer clinical advantages [^1151giJc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

The 21st century has seen the arrival of several insulin analogue products and the refinement of insulin regimens, with widespread advocacy of continuous titration algorithms and earlier initiation of supplementary insulin therapy (predominantly using basal insulins) in type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, many insulin-treated diabetes patients remain in poor glycaemic control. This might reflect insufficient titration effort or lax adherence, but these issues could in some cases result from concerns about hypoglycaemia. Certainly, there is scope for improving the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profile of basal insulin, and three new products offer this prospect.

- **Current advancements in basal insulins**: Insulin degludec, now in clinical use, and PEGylated insulin lispro, in development, have greatly extended action profiles that result from two very different, but unique, mechanisms. With once-daily dosing, these insulins produce stable PK/PD profiles at steady state, associated with a low incidence of hypoglycaemia. The feasibility of varied daily dose timing has also been confirmed with insulin degludec.

- **High strength formulations**: High strength formulations of insulin glargine and insulin degludec offer the prospect of a reduced injection number/volume in high dose users, and in the case of glargine, the PK/PD profile might also be favourably modified.

This review considers critically the clinical evidence and expectations we should have for these new basal insulins.

### Clinical benefits of switching to insulin degludec irrespective of previous basal insulin therapy in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes: Evidence from a European, multicentre, retrospective, non-interventional study (EU-TREAT) [^115vPhv1]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether the benefits of switching to insulin degludec, as observed in the European retrospective chart review study EU-TREAT, were dependent on the previous basal insulin used.

- **Methods**: Participants with type 1 or type 2 diabetes were switched to insulin degludec from other basal insulins at least 6 months before data collection. They were stratified into three groups based on their previous basal insulin: insulin glargine 100 units/ml (Type 1: n = 888; Type 2: n = 259); insulin detemir (Type 1: n = 726; Type 2: n = 415); and neutral protamine Hagedorn (Type 1: n = 53; Type 2: n = 95). The evaluation focused on their glycaemic control and hypoglycaemia incidence at 6 and 12 months post-switch versus pre-switch.

- **Results**: Significant reductions in HbA1c were achieved across all previous basal insulin groups for participants with type 1 diabetes [insulin glargine 100 units/ml: -2.08 mmol/mol (-0.19%); insulin detemir: -2.40 mmol/mol (-0.22%)] and those with type 2 diabetes [insulin glargine 100 units/ml: -5.90 mmol/mol (-0.54%); insulin detemir: -6.01 mmol/mol (-0.55%); neutral protamine Hagedorn: -2.73 mmol/mol (-0.25%)] at 6 months, with the exception of the relatively small neutral protamine Hagedorn group in type 1 diabetes [-1.75 mmol/mol (-0.16%)], where statistical significance was not reached. At 6 months in the type 1 diabetes group, switching to insulin degludec from insulin glargine 100 units/ml resulted in significantly lower hypoglycaemia rates across all hypoglycaemia categories. For the insulin detemir group, this significance was also observed in severe and nocturnal non-severe hypoglycaemia rates.

### Tresiba [^114TJuXp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Read this instructions for use before you start taking Tresiba and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.

The vial is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the assistance of a person trained in the proper use of the product and insulin syringe. Do not reuse or share syringes or needles with other people; you may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them.

- **Supplies you will need to give your Tresiba injection**: a 10 mL Tresiba vial, a U-100 insulin syringe and needle, 2 alcohol swabs, and 1 sharps container for throwing away used syringes and needles. See "Disposing of your used needles and syringes" at the end of these instructions.

- **Preparing your Tresiba dose**: Do not roll or shake the Tresiba vial. Shaking the Tresiba vial right before the dose is drawn into the syringe may cause bubbles or foam. This can cause you to draw up the wrong dose of insulin. The tamper-resistant cap should not be loose or damaged before the first use. Do not use if the tamper-resistant cap is loose or damaged before using Tresiba for the first time. Wash your hands with soap and water. Before you start to prepare your injection, check the Tresiba label to make sure that you are taking the right type of insulin.

### EADSG guidelines: Insulin therapy in diabetes [^1135c99Q]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Insulin can be administered via various methods such as vial and syringe, insulin pen, jet injectors, and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) using insulin pumps. Only inhaled insulin (Afrezza) is not injectable. In East Africa, vial and syringe, insulin pens, and insulin pumps are accessible. The choice of insulin delivery device should be individualized for patients.

- **Recommendation**: Health care authorities and planners should be alerted to the risks associated with syringe or pen needles 6 mm or longer in children (Grade A, LE II).

- **Insulin transport and storage**: Specific storage conditions provided by the manufacturer in the package inserts should be followed. Insulin should be stored for 28 days at 30 °C or 45 days at 25 °C. It is advised to transport insulin on an ice pack (Grade A, LE IV).

### Insulin degludec, an ultra-long-acting basal insulin, once a day or three times a week versus insulin glargine once a day in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 16-week, randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial [^116WCzyv]. Lancet (2011). Low credibility.

Insulin degludec is a new basal insulin that forms soluble multihexamer assemblies after subcutaneous injection, resulting in an ultra-long action profile. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec injected once a day or three times a week compared with insulin glargine once a day in insulin-naive people with type 2 diabetes, who were inadequately controlled with oral antidiabetic drugs.

- **Methods**: In this 16-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group phase 2 trial, participants aged 18–75 years with type 2 diabetes and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1C)) of 7.0–11.0% were enrolled and treated at 28 clinical sites in Canada, India, South Africa, and the United States. Participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1:1 ratio by computer-generated block randomization to receive insulin degludec either once a day or three times a week or insulin glargine once a day, all in combination with metformin. Investigators were masked at the time of writing until database release. The primary outcome was HbA(1C) after 16 weeks of treatment. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00611884.

- **Findings**: Of 367 patients screened, 245 were eligible for inclusion. 62 participants were randomly allocated to receive insulin degludec three times a week (starting dose 20 U per injection [1 U = 9 nmol]), 60 to receive insulin degludec once a day (starting dose 10 U [1 U = 6 nmol]; group A), 61 to receive insulin degludec once a day (starting dose 10 U [1 U = 9 nmol]; group B), and 62 to receive insulin glargine (starting dose 10 U).

### Low-volume insulin degludec 200 units/ml once daily improves glycemic control similarly to insulin glargine with a low risk of hypoglycemia in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes: a 26-week, randomized, controlled, multinational, treat-to-target trial: the BEGIN LOW VOLUME trial [^112GWbuM]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Basal insulins are an important treatment option for persons with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), with progressively higher doses of insulin required over the duration of the disease. Moreover, approximately 90% of those with T2DM in the U.S. are overweight, and obese patients often are less sensitive to exogenous insulin and therefore require higher doses to maintain good glycemic control. Globally, approximately 30% of patients with T2DM who use basal insulin require more than 60 units daily.

Use of a highly concentrated formulation of regular insulin, U-500 regular insulin (Humulin R U-500; Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN), was originally developed to address high insulin requirements. The frequency of use of U-500 regular insulin increased dramatically by more than 70% in the U.S. between 2007 and 2008, corresponding to the escalating number of people with T2DM and obesity.

Currently, marketed insulin pen devices only allow the administration of a maximum of 80 units per injection, and administration of larger volumes of insulin has typically required the use of a vial and syringe or the addition of a second injection. Very large doses of insulin delivered as a single injection with a syringe may be painful and cause discomfort at the site of injection. It can also be physically challenging to deliver such a large volume smoothly. Together, these limitations highlight the need for an insulin formulation with a higher concentration that allows administration of higher doses of insulin in a single injection.

Insulin degludec (IDeg) is an ultra-long-acting basal insulin that is in clinical development.

### Low-volume insulin degludec 200 units/ml once daily improves glycemic control similarly to insulin glargine with a low risk of hypoglycemia in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes: a 26-week, randomized, controlled, multinational, treat-to-target trial: the BEGIN LOW VOLUME trial [^1179MrTf]. Diabetes Care (2013). High credibility.

IDeg 200 units/mL contains the same number of units of insulin in half the volume compared with IDeg 100 units/mL and, when administered in the new FlexTouch pen device, can deliver as much as 160 units of insulin in a single injection. There is no dose correction or calculation necessary, because the FlexTouch pen internally corrects for the 200 units/mL concentration. Thus, only the injected volume of a given dose of insulin differs between the 200 units/mL pen device and other devices. This eliminates any potential dose confusion when changing between currently available 100 units/mL basal insulin products and the possibility of mistakenly interchanging IDeg 100 units/mL and 200 units/mL insulin pens upon their approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The purpose of this study was to compare efficacy and safety between IDeg 200 units/mL and IGlar, both administered once daily in combination with metformin with or without a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, in insulin-naïve patients with T2DM requiring an intensification of treatment.

### PlegridyPen [^112pzQ99]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Healthcare professionals should train patients in the proper technique for self-administering subcutaneous injections using the prefilled pen or syringe, or intramuscular injections using the prefilled syringe. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Advise patients and caregivers to rotate injection sites with each administration to minimize the likelihood of severe injection site reactions, including necrosis or localized infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Once removed from the refrigerator, PLEGRIDY should be allowed to warm to room temperature (about 30 minutes) prior to injection. Do not use external heat sources such as hot water to warm PLEGRIDY.

Each PLEGRIDY pen and syringe for subcutaneous injection is provided with the needle pre-attached. PLEGRIDY prefilled syringe for intramuscular injection is supplied as a prefilled syringe with a separate needle. Both intramuscular and subcutaneous prefilled syringes and subcutaneously administered prefilled pens are for one-time use in one patient only and should be discarded after use.

- **Premedication for flu-like symptoms**: Prophylactic use of analgesics and/or antipyretics may prevent or ameliorate flu-like symptoms sometimes experienced during treatment with PLEGRIDY.

### An assessment of the adequacy of suspension of insulin in pen injectors [^116Bs85h]. Diabetic Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Aims: To evaluate the completeness of insulin resuspension by users of neutral Hagedorn (NPH) insulin pens and premixed insulin pens and to relate this to how patients mix insulin before injecting.

Methods: Patients (n = 180) administering a medium duration or premixed insulin in cartridges in disposable pens were asked questions about mixing insulin, injection technique, and storing insulin. They were also asked to demonstrate how they mixed their insulin and to send in a half-used pen. The cloudy component equates to the complexed insulin, while the clear component is the diluting fluid or soluble insulin, depending on the type of insulin used. The optical density, a simple way of measuring cloudiness, was measured in each cartridge or disposable pen and was compared with the range obtained from a series of unused control pens. The results for 146 pens containing the most commonly used insulin were included. The 21 patients whose residual pen insulins showed optical densities greater than 5 standard deviations from the mean were re-interviewed and their medical records were examined in detail. Insulin in the pens was also measured by immunoassay to confirm the utility of optical density measurements.

Results: Only one patient mixed the insulin as the manufacturers recommended. In 58 out of 146 pens or cartridges (40%) the opacity of the insulin varied significantly from the expected value.

Conclusions: Most patients in Kirkcaldy do not mix insulin adequately. This may result in their giving different incorrect doses of insulin during the use of each pen. More emphasis should be given to teaching proper mixing techniques.

### Understanding the clinical profile of insulin degludec, the latest basal insulin approved for use in Canada: a narrative review [^113uZhmd]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

In recent years, the development of basal insulin therapies has focused on insulin analogues with longer durations of action and more predictable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profiles than their human insulin-based predecessors, such as neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin. These analogues, dosed once daily, can provide a more stable glucose-lowering action, clinically translating into a reduced risk of hypoglycemia. Insulin degludec (degludec) became available in Canada in 2017 and is the first basal insulin analogue to have a half-life exceeding the dosing interval.

The promise of an exceptionally flat PK/PD profile at steady state means insulin degludec can be dosed flexibly regarding the time of day, and it need not be taken at the same time each day. However, the approximately 25-hour half-life also has implications concerning dose titration. This article provides an up-to-date review of the study data describing the clinical profile of degludec and aims to give helpful and practical advice to prescribers about its use. While the clinical benefits of degludec are described, it is acknowledged that further study is required to better understand how its clinical performance compares with that of insulin glargine 300 units/mL.

### Switching to once-weekly insulin icodec versus once-daily insulin degludec in individuals with basal insulin-treated type 2 diabetes (ONWARDS 2): a phase 3a, randomised, open-label, multicentre, treat-to-target trial [^117BVxNZ]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Insulin icodec (icodec) is a once-weekly basal insulin currently under development. ONWARDS 2 aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of once-weekly icodec versus once-daily insulin degludec (degludec) in basal insulin-treated type 2 diabetes.

- **Methods**: This 26-week, randomised, open-label, active-controlled, multicentre, treat-to-target phase 3a trial was conducted in 71 sites across nine countries. Eligible participants with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on once-daily or twice-daily basal insulin, with or without non-insulin glucose-lowering agents, were randomly assigned (1:1) to once-weekly icodec or once-daily degludec. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to week 26 in HbA1c; the margin used to establish non-inferiority of icodec compared with degludec was 0.3 percentage points. Safety outcomes (hypoglycaemic episodes and adverse events) and patient-reported outcomes were also assessed. The primary outcome was evaluated in all randomly assigned participants. Safety outcomes were evaluated descriptively based on all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of trial product, with statistical analyses based on all randomly assigned participants. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04770532, and is now complete.

- **Findings**: Between March 5 and July 19, 2021, 635 participants were screened, of whom 109 were ineligible or withdrew, and 526 were randomly assigned to icodec (n = 263) or degludec (n = 263). From a mean baseline of 8.17% (icodec; 65.8 mmol/mol) and 8.10% (degludec; 65.0 mmol/mol), HbA1c was reduced.

### Ease of use of the insulin glargine 300 U/mL pen injector in insulin-naïve people with type 2 diabetes [^114xC5VC]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2017). Low credibility.

Insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla-300) contains the same active ingredient as glargine 100 U/mL (Gla-100) and provides the same number of units in one-third of the volume. The SoloSTAR ® injector pen has been modified to ensure accurate administration of this reduced volume and to improve user experience.

- **Methods**: Insulin- and pen-naïve adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) inadequately controlled with oral antihyperglycemic drugs, who had glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels of 7.0–11.0% (53–97 mmol/mol), were studied. They received once-daily Gla-300 in this 4-week, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study (NCT02227212). Ease of use/ease of learning (the primary endpoint), glycemic control, safety, and reliability of the disposable (prefilled) Gla-300 injector pen (secondary endpoints) were evaluated.

- **Results**: At week 4, 95.0% of 40 participating subjects assessed the pen as excellent/good, and none as poor/very poor; 97.5% would recommend it to others. Total Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire scores were stable throughout the study. Mean (SD) fasting plasma glucose levels decreased from 166.1 (35.0) mg/dL at baseline to 124.2 (41.1) mg/dL at week 4. No product technical complaints (PTCs) or adverse events (AEs) related to PTCs were reported. The number of subjects experiencing hypoglycemic events of any kind and the incidence of AEs were low. No serious AEs were reported.

The Gla-300 injector pen is easy to use and easy to learn to use, with demonstrable reliability and high degrees of acceptance and treatment satisfaction.

### Analysis: Desirable attributes of insulin injection pens that drive patient preference and compliance [^115zthfJ]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2011). Low credibility.

Insulin pens are used by approximately half of the worldwide insulin users. These pens have made insulin injections easier compared to traditional vial and syringe methods. In an article in this issue of the Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology, Dr. Asakura discusses several important design parameters considered during the design of refillable insulin-injection pens.

- **Ease of cartridge replacement**: Insulin-dose setting dial use, injection, and the prominence of audible clicks can all affect the overall dose accuracy and user-friendliness of insulin pens in patients suffering from diabetes and related comorbidities.

These parameters, along with patient introduction from prescribing physicians and the level of training provided, drive patient pen selection and injection-regimen compliance to control their blood sugar.

### Analysis of patient satisfaction with a prefilled insulin injection device in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes [^111vN6HF]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2011). Low credibility.

In this issue of the Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology, Hancu and colleagues present an observational 6–8-week Pan-European and Canadian prospective survey on patient satisfaction with a prefilled insulin injection device, the SoloSTAR pen device, in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes (n = 6542). The SoloSTAR pen is one of several up-to-date insulin pens of high quality and characteristics that fit many of our patients with diabetes. The mainly excellent-good votes of the participants for the SoloSTAR are not surprising, as we have seen continuous improvements with prefilled pens such as the SoloSTAR device.

Several years ago, patients, as well as healthcare providers, found considerable differences between the available pen options. Nowadays, as almost all pen providers have clearly improved their products, the differences are much smaller; we are closer to a "perfect" prefilled pen device. Nevertheless, there is a need for more randomized controlled trials, ideally sponsored not by just one manufacturer, to make clear statements toward different pen device aspects (e.g. accuracy of dosing, adherence to therapy, ease of use, and patient satisfaction). An additional handicap is the difficulty in achieving blinded study designs.

### Sterile diluent [^111qonB3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Priming your pen involves removing the air from the needle and cartridge that may accumulate during normal use, ensuring the pen functions correctly. Failing to prime before each injection may result in administering an incorrect dose of insulin.

- **Selecting your dose**: This pen is designed to deliver the dose shown in the dose window. Dial your usual dose as instructed by your healthcare provider. You can administer from 1 to 60 units in a single injection. If your dose exceeds 60 units, you will need to give more than one injection. For assistance in dividing your dose accurately, consult your healthcare provider. Always use a new needle for each injection and repeat the priming step.

The pen will not allow you to dial more than the remaining units in the pen. If your required dose exceeds the available units, you have two options: inject the remaining amount and then use a new pen for the rest of your dose, or procure a new pen and administer the full dose. It is common to notice a small amount of insulin left in the pen, which cannot be injected. Do not transfer this insulin into a syringe, as it may lead to severe overdose.

### Ease of use of the insulin glargine 300 U/mL pen injector in insulin-naïve people with type 2 diabetes [^111Vj6j5]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2017). Low credibility.

The total Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQs) score was relatively high at baseline (28.2), prior to the first Gla-300 dose. As the total DTSQs score can range from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 36 (very satisfied), this score indicates a good level of satisfaction with previous therapy. The total DTSQs score remained stable throughout the study, with a score at week 4 of 29.5 (5.6), suggesting no change in participants' perception of treatment burden was associated with Gla-300 therapy in combination with the Gla-300 injector pen in these previously insulin-naïve subjects. Moreover, from baseline to week 4, there were positive changes in scores for items relating to satisfaction (item 1: 0.26), recommendation (item 7: 0.26), and continuation of Gla-300 treatment (item 8: 0.28), although these were small relative to the range of possible scores (0 to 36).

- **Glycemic control and insulin dose**: Mean (SD) fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels decreased from 166.1 (35.0) mg/dL or 9.2 (1.9) mmol/L at baseline to 124.2 (41.1) mg/dL or 6.9 (2.3) mmol/L at week 4. Similarly, mean preinjection plasma glucose decreased from 206.0 (65.3) mg/dL or 11.4 (3.6) mmol/L at baseline to 178.3 (53.0) mg/dL or 9.9 (2.9) mmol/L over the same period. A comparable pattern was observed for HbA1c levels.

The mean daily basal insulin dose increased from 0.19 (0.03) U/kg/day (16.8 [4.0] U/day) at baseline to 0.34 (0.11) U/kg/day.

### Low-volume insulin degludec 200 units/ml once daily improves glycemic control similarly to insulin glargine with a low risk of hypoglycemia in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes: a 26-week, randomized, controlled, multinational, treat-to-target trial: the BEGIN LOW VOLUME trial [^113LYsfx]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The 200 units/mL formulation of insulin degludec (IDeg 200 units/mL) contains equal units of insulin in half the volume compared with the 100 units/mL formulation. We compared the efficacy and safety of IDeg 200 units/mL once daily with 100 units/mL insulin glargine (IGlar) in insulin-naïve subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) inadequately controlled with oral antidiabetic drugs.

- **Research design and methods**: In this 26-week, open-label, treat-to-target trial, subjects (n = 457; mean HbA1c 8.3% [67 mmol/mol], BMI 32.4 kg/m(2), and fasting plasma glucose [FPG] 9.6 mmol/L [173.2 mg/dL]) were randomized to IDeg 200 units/mL or IGlar. Both were given once daily in combination with metformin, with or without a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor. Basal insulin was initiated at 10 units/day and titrated weekly to an FPG target of < 5 mmol/L (< 90 mg/dL) according to mean pre-breakfast self-measured blood glucose values from the preceding 3 days.

- **Results**: By 26 weeks, IDeg reduced HbA1c by 1.30% and was not inferior to IGlar. Mean observed FPG reductions were significantly greater with IDeg than IGlar (-3.7 vs. -3.4 mmol/L [-67 vs. -61 mg/dL]; estimated treatment difference: -0.42 [95% CI -0.78 to -0.06], P = 0.02). Despite this difference, rates of overall confirmed hypoglycemia were not higher with IDeg than with IGlar (1.22 and 1.42 episodes/patient-year, respectively), as were rates of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia (0.18 and 0.28 episodes/patient-year, respectively). Mean daily basal insulin dose was significantly lower by 11% with IDeg 200 units/mL compared with IGlar.

### Insulin degludec: Overview of a novel ultra long-acting basal insulin [^117N9dXE]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

All the basal insulin products currently available have suboptimal pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, with none reliably providing a reproducible and peakless pharmacodynamic (PD) effect that endures over 24 hours from once-daily dosing. Insulin degludec is a novel acylated basal insulin with a unique mechanism of protracted absorption involving the formation of a depot of soluble multihexamer chains after subcutaneous injection. PK/PD studies show that insulin degludec has a very long duration of action, with a half-life exceeding 25 hours.

Once-daily dosing produces a steady-state profile characterized by a near-constant effect, which varies little from injection to injection in a given patient. Clinically, insulin degludec has been shown consistently to carry a lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia than once-daily insulin glargine, in both basal+bolus and basal-only insulin regimens. The constancy of the steady-state profile of insulin degludec also means that day-to-day irregularities at the time of injection have relatively little PD influence, thereby offering the possibility of greater treatment flexibility for patients.

### Insulin degludec: A significant advancement in ultralong-acting basal insulin [^111rioVN]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Major advances and developments have taken place in the field of insulin since its discovery nearly a century ago. The engineering of insulin analogs is one step in this journey of innovation. Insulin analogs are molecules that have been created by modifying the structure of insulin to achieve desired pharmacokinetic properties. Drugs such as insulin aspart, glulisine, and lispro act as rapid-acting insulins, while insulin detemir and glargine work as long-acting basal analogs. Premixed analogs, such as biphasic aspart and biphasic lispro, are also used in clinical practice.

### Safety and efficacy of insulin degludec/insulin aspart with bolus mealtime insulin aspart compared with standard basal-bolus treatment in people with Type 1 diabetes: 1-year results from a randomized clinical trial (BOOSTT1) [^114p6jge]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The proportion of participants entering and completing the extension phase was 91.7% (n = 233/254) for IDegAsp+IAsp and 92.6% (n = 113/122) for IDet+IAsp (Fig. 1). The proportion of participants who withdrew during the extension phase was 8.0% (n = 21/254) for IDegAsp+IAsp and 7.0% (n = 9/122) for IDet+IAsp, with no differences in the reasons and the time for withdrawals.

The baseline characteristics of participants in the extension phase compared with the core phase are summarized in Table S1.

A similar percentage of participants with IDegAsp+IAsp (73.8%; n = 267/362) and IDet+IAsp (70.6%; n = 127/180) reported treatment‐emergent adverse events, the majority of which were mild or moderate in severity. Injection‐site reactions (none of them serious) were reported by 1.9% (n = 7/362) of participants on IDegAsp+IAsp vs. 6.7% (n = 12/180) on IDet+IAsp. One participant on IDet+IAsp experienced the majority (n = 28) of non‐serious injection‐site events.

The rate of serious adverse events over the course of 52 weeks was similar between the IDegAsp+IAsp [0.24 events/patient‐years of exposure (PYE)] and IDet+IAsp groups (0.19 events/PYE). The most frequently reported serious adverse event possibly or probably considered to be related to treatment was hypoglycaemia [4.1% participants (0.08 events/PYE) with IDegAsp+IAsp vs. 5.0% participants (0.06 events/PYE) with IDet+IAsp], followed by hypoglycaemic unconsciousness.

The requirement to inject basal insulin analogs at a fixed time each day may complicate adherence and compromise glycemic control. This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of varying the daily injection time of insulin degludec (IDeg), an ultra-long-acting basal insulin.

- **Research design and methods**: This 26-week, open-label, treat-to-target trial enrolled adults (≥ 18 years) with type 2 diabetes who were either insulin naïve and receiving oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs; HbA(1c) = 7–11%) or previously on basal insulin ± OAD(s) (HbA(1c) = 7–10%). Participants were randomized to: 1) once-daily (OD) IDeg in a prespecified dosing schedule, creating 8–40-hour intervals between injections (IDeg OD Flex; n = 229); 2) once-daily IDeg at the main evening meal (IDeg OD; n = 228); or 3) once-daily insulin glargine at the same time each day (IGlar OD; n = 230). The primary outcome was noninferiority of IDeg OD Flex to IGlar OD in HbA(1c) reduction after 26 weeks.

- **Results**: After 26 weeks, IDeg OD Flex, IDeg OD, and IGlar OD improved HbA(1c) by 1.28, 1.07, and 1.26 percentage points, respectively, with an estimated treatment difference (IDeg OD Flex - IGlar OD) of 0.04 percentage points (-0.12 to 0.20), confirming noninferiority. No statistically significant differences in overall or nocturnal hypoglycemia were found between IDeg OD Flex and IGlar OD. Comparable glycemic control and rates of hypoglycemia were observed with IDeg OD Flex and IDeg OD. Adverse event profiles were similar across groups.

- **Conclusions**: The use of extreme dosing intervals of 8–40 hours demonstrates that the daily injection time of IDeg can be varied without compromising efficacy or safety.

### Safety and efficacy of insulin degludec/insulin aspart with bolus mealtime insulin aspart compared with standard basal-bolus treatment in people with type 1 diabetes: 1-year results from a randomized clinical trial (BOOSTT1) [^112uZBA6]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The BOOST® T1 was a 52-week study consisting of a core and an extension phase, each 26 weeks long. In the core phase of the BOOST T1 study (26 weeks), IDegAsp with bolus IAsp at additional mealtimes (IDegAsp+IAsp) improved glycaemic control and was non-inferior to the standard basal (IDet) and bolus (IAsp) regimen (IDet+IAsp) in participants with type 1 diabetes. IDegAsp+IAsp treatment was also associated with a lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia and fewer daily injections, indicating that IDegAsp+IAsp offers the potential for a simpler alternative compared with basal–bolus treatment in type 1 diabetes.

Here, we present the results after 52 weeks of treatment (BOOST T1 study) to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of IDegAsp+IAsp vs. IDet+IAsp in type 1 diabetes.

### Safety and efficacy of insulin degludec/insulin aspart with bolus mealtime insulin aspart compared with standard basal-bolus treatment in people with Type 1 diabetes: 1-year results from a randomized clinical trial (BOOSTT1) [^114othK7]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of a simplified basal-bolus regimen of once-daily insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) with additional IAsp against a standard basal-bolus insulin regimen of insulin detemir (IDet) with IAsp in adults with Type 1 diabetes.

- **Methods**: This was an open-label trial comprising a 26-week core phase followed by a 26-week extension phase. Participants were randomized to IDegAsp once daily at the main meal and IAsp at remaining meals (IDegAsp+IAsp), or IDet (once or twice daily) and IAsp at all meals (IDet+IAsp). Insulins were titrated to target plasma glucose of < 5 mmol/l (< 90 mg/dl) at pre-breakfast (IDegAsp and IDet) and at pre-meal (IAsp).

- **Results**: After 52 weeks, the overall confirmed hypoglycemia rate was 31.8 episodes/patient-years of exposure (PYE) with IDegAsp+IAsp and 36.7 episodes/PYE with IDet+IAsp. The rate of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia was significantly lower with IDegAsp+Asp than with IDet+IAsp (3.1 vs. 5.4 episodes/PYE, respectively; P < 0.05). Adverse event rates were comparable between groups. Mean HbA1c decreased from baseline by 0.7% (IDegAsp+IAsp) and 0.6% (IDet+IAsp), achieving 60 or 61 mmol/mol (7.6% or 7.7%, respectively), at Week 52. The mean total daily insulin dose was lower with IDegAsp+IAsp than with IDet+IAsp (ratio: 0.87; 95% CI 0.79–0.95; P = 0.0026).

- **Conclusions**: Once-daily treatment with IDegAsp and IAsp as bolus insulin for remaining meals was associated with a significantly lower risk of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia, improved glycemic control, and showed non-inferiority compared to the standard basal-bolus insulin regimen.

### Insulin degludec overdose may lead to long-lasting hypoglycaemia through its markedly prolonged half-life [^1123WEZK]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Overdose of insulin often causes long-lasting severe hypoglycaemia. Insulin degludec has the longest duration of action among the available insulin products; thus, an overdose can lead to prolonged hypoglycaemia. In this paper, we report a case involving a woman with long-lasting hypoglycaemia attributable to insulin degludec overdose and its markedly prolonged half-life.

- **Case report**: A 64-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy was taken to an emergency department due to disturbed consciousness 21 hours after self-injecting 300 units of insulin degludec (4.34 units/kg). Her plasma glucose level was 2.3 mmol/l. She received repeated intravenous boluses of dextrose for 43 hours with continuous intravenous infusion, yet no improvement in hypoglycaemia or consciousness was observed. Considering possible adrenal insufficiency, intravenous dexamethasone was administered, resulting in plasma glucose levels remaining above 5.5 mmol/l without the need for dextrose boluses. She gradually regained consciousness. Thirty-four hours post-overdose, her plasma immunoreactive insulin levels were markedly increased and then gradually declined over approximately 400 hours. The insulin degludec half-life was calculated to be 40.76 hours.

- **Conclusion**: Although the reported half-life of insulin degludec in the body is about 25 hours when administered in standard doses (0.4–0.8 units/kg), no study has investigated its half-life post-overdose. In this case, the half-life was approximately 1.6 times longer than expected.

### An analysis of patient acceptance and safety of a prefilled insulin injection device [^1112mDb1]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

This article summarizes and interprets the findings of Carter and colleagues in this issue of the Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology. It is a study of the real-world use of a prefilled insulin pen device. In this observational study, people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes rated their experience with the SoloSTAR pen device after 6–10 weeks of use. Data on patient satisfaction, product technical complaints, and adverse effects were reported. Randomized, controlled trials are needed to compare the various pen devices and the vial/syringe in terms of dosing accuracy, adherence to therapy, and ease of use (including patient perception of injection force required) to assess whether a particular insulin delivery method or pen delivery device provides a clinical advantage over another.

### Comparison of the dose accuracy of prefilled insulin pens [^115amUgv]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

Prefilled insulin pens have become a convenient and accurate way for diabetes patients to inject insulin. Their ease of use has helped reduce resistance among patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes in the United States and Europe towards the initiation of insulin therapy. This study compared the dosing accuracy of two prefilled insulin pens: the SoloStar((R)) from Sanofi Aventis, Berlin, Germany, and the Next Generation (NG) FlexPen((R)) from Novo Nordisk, Mainz, Germany.

- **Methods**: The dosing accuracy was tested for both pens with 24 x 10 international units of insulin (IU) and 9 x 30 IU injection volumes to investigate whether the pens comply with the acceptable International Organization for Standardization (ISO) limits of 10% (± 1 IU) for 10 IU and 5% (± 1.5 IU) for 30 IU. The doses were each applied with a new needle strictly according to the instructions for use by the pen manufacturers. A sensitive pharmaceutical balance was used for the assessment of the applied volumes, and the results were corrected for the specific density of the insulin formulations. We used 18 insulin pens (from two different production lots each) for the two volumes, respectively, resulting in a total of 432 doses per pen with 10 IU and 162 doses per pen with 30 IU.

- **Results**: Both pens showed a very good performance, which was better for the 10 IU dose than in comparative previous studies. The NG FlexPen (mean absolute percent deviation 10 IU/30 IU: 1.63 ± 0.84%/1.23 ± 0.76%) was even more accurate than the SoloStar (2.11 ± 0.92%/1.54 ± 0.84%, p < .001/p < .05).

### Insulin degludec, an ultra-longacting basal insulin, versus insulin glargine in basal-bolus treatment with mealtime insulin aspart in type 1 diabetes (BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type 1): a phase 3, randomised, open-label, treat-to-target non-inferiority trial [^114Bhwku]. Lancet (2012). High credibility.

Intensive basal-bolus insulin therapy has been shown to improve glycaemic control and reduce the risk of long-term complications associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Insulin degludec is a new ultra-longacting basal insulin. Therefore, we compared the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec and insulin glargine, both administered once daily with mealtime insulin aspart, in basal-bolus therapy for type 1 diabetes.

- **Methods**: In an open-label, treat-to-target, non-inferiority trial, undertaken at 79 sites (hospitals and centres) in six countries, adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with type 1 diabetes (glycated haemoglobin [HbA(1c)] ≤ 10% [86 mmol/mol]), who had been treated with basal-bolus insulin for at least 1 year, were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio with a computer-generated blocked allocation sequence to insulin degludec or insulin glargine without stratification by use of a central interactive response system. The primary outcome was non-inferiority of degludec to glargine, assessed as a reduction in HbA(1c) after 52 weeks, with the intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00982228.

- **Findings**: Of 629 participants, 472 were randomly assigned to insulin degludec and 157 to insulin glargine; all were analyzed in their respective treatment groups. At 1 year, HbA(1c) had fallen by 0.40 percentage points (SE 0.03) with insulin degludec and by 0.39 percentage points (SE 0.07) with insulin glargine (estimated treatment difference -0.01 percentage points [95% CI -0.14 to 0.11]; p < 0.0001 for non-inferiority testing).

### Degludec: The new ultra-long insulin analogue [^115rzooo]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

The development of extended-action insulin analogues was motivated by the unfavorable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the conventional long-acting insulin formulations, generally associated with marked inter- and intra-patient variability and site- and dose-dependent effect variation. The new ultra-long insulin analogue degludec (IDeg) shares the same amino acid sequence as human insulin, except for the removal of threonine in position 30 of the B chain (Des-B30, "De") and the attachment, via a glutamic acid linker ("glu"), of a 16-carbon fatty diacid (hexadecanoic diacid, "dec") to lysine in position 29 of the B chain.

These modifications enable IDeg to precipitate in the subcutaneous tissue after transitioning from the pharmaceutical formulation to a subcutaneous environment, forming a depot that undergoes a highly predictable gradual dissociation. As a result, once-daily dosing of IDeg yields a low peak-to-trough ratio, with consequent low intra-individual variability and plasma concentrations that are less critically dependent on the timing of injections.

The clinical development program of IDeg (BEGIN) comprised nine therapeutic confirmatory trials of longer duration (26–52 weeks) and demonstrated that the efficacy of IDeg is comparable to insulin glargine in both type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) diabetes patients across different age, body mass index, and ethnic groups. This new ultra-long insulin analogue offers advantages in flexibility in dose timing and a lower risk of hypoglycemia.

### Understanding the clinical profile of insulin degludec, the latest basal insulin approved for use in Canada: a narrative review [^113j7EnM]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Two 26-week randomized TTT trials, one in type 1 diabetes (T1D) and one in type 2 diabetes (T2D), demonstrated the versatility of degludec concerning the dosing interval, offering patients the prospect of freedom from very strict dose times. In the T1D trial, degludec administered in a 'Force-Flex' schedule using varied dosing intervals (alternating intervals of a minimum of 8 hours and maximum of 40 hours between doses) was compared with degludec or glargine U100 given at the same time each day (Free-Flex regimen). At 26 weeks, A1C had decreased in all treatment arms, and the Force-Flex regimen met the noninferiority criteria compared with both Free-Flex regimens. The rates of confirmed hypoglycemia were similar in all treatment arms at weeks 26 and 52, but nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia was lower with the degludec Forced-Flex regimen than with the degludec Free-Flex regimen (37% lower; p = 0.003) and the glargine U100 Free-Flex regimen (40% lower; p = 0.001).

In the T2D trial, using the degludec Force-Flex regimen, degludec given once daily in the evening (degludec OD), and glargine U100 given at the same time each day (glargine OD), A1C improved for all three dosing regimens at 26 weeks, and noninferiority was also demonstrated for the Forced-Flex regimen compared with glargine OD. There were no statistically significant differences in overall or nocturnal hypoglycemia rates between the degludec Force-Flex regimen and the other regimens. Similar levels of glycemic control and hypoglycemia rates were also obtained in a Japanese study that compared deg…

### Analysis of symposium articles on insulin pen devices and alternative insulin delivery methods [^111oHHTX]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2010). Low credibility.

Insulin therapy is a fundamental component of diabetes management, yet there is often resistance to insulin initiation by both prescribers and patients. A barrier to insulin use is the perceived shortcomings with the traditional vial-and-syringe administration method, such as inconvenience, difficulty of use, and association with disease and addiction. This symposium in the journal discusses the advantages of alternative insulin delivery methods, primarily insulin pen devices. Although these administration methods, especially insulin pens, have some clear advantages over the vial and syringe, there are also limitations to their use. Careful patient selection and education are still needed.

### Safety and efficacy of insulin degludec/insulin aspart with bolus mealtime insulin aspart compared with standard basal-bolus treatment in people with type 1 diabetes: 1-year results from a randomized clinical trial (BOOSTT1) [^1164B3JG]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Individuals with Type 1 diabetes are dependent on insulin treatment, typically requiring four or more injections per day to cover basal and prandial needs. The risk of hypoglycemia continues to be a concern with intensive basal–bolus insulin regimens, with recent observational data indicating that the risk of severe hypoglycemia strongly correlates with the duration of Type 1 diabetes. In parallel, the requirement for multiple daily injections can constrain day‐to‐day activities, with increasing injections leading to a higher treatment burden and the potential for skipped injections. Insulin treatment combinations that provide efficacious and well‐tolerated basal and prandial glycemic coverage, with fewer daily injections, would be beneficial to reduce treatment burden and improve treatment adherence in people with Type 1 diabetes.

The combination of a basal and a prandial insulin has historically proven elusive, as the basal insulin analogues such as insulin detemir (IDet) and insulin glargine (IGlar) could not be formulated with rapid‐acting insulin analogues without adversely affecting the pharmacodynamic properties of the rapid‐acting component. The development of insulin degludec (IDeg), a basal insulin that forms stable dihexamers in solution at physiological pH, has allowed for the possibility of co‐formulation with another insulin analogue.

Insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) is a soluble co‐formulation of IDeg and insulin aspart (IAsp) in a 70:30 ratio. The distinct basal and prandial pharmacodynamic characteristics of IDegAsp provide effective glycemic control with a reduced number of injections, potentially enhancing treatment adherence and reducing the burden for patients with Type 1 diabetes.

### Dose accuracy, injection force, and usability assessment of a new half-unit, prefilled insulin pen [^116MMe7p]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2018). Low credibility.

- **Research design and methods**: Dose accuracy testing was performed according to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard for needle-based injection systems for medical use (ISO 11608–1:2014) using a semiautomated test system. Devices were tested under a standard, cool, or warm atmosphere (23°C, 5°C, or 40°C, respectively). Automated collection of all measurements was performed by the test system. Pens were preconditioned, then visually and functionally inspected. The investigator attached 31-gauge, 5-mm needles (Becton Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and the devices were primed according to the instructions for use (IFU) and test system requirements prior to testing.

- **Testing process**: Sixty pens were used for each temperature variation. Three different doses of insulin lispro (0.005, 0.15, and 0.3 mL [0.5, 15, and 30 units, respectively]) were dispensed from each pen from cartridges that were full, 2/3 full, or 1/3 full (20 each) according to a prespecified sequence (180 doses) to confirm accurate dosing over the dose range from full or partially filled pens. The investigator manually dialed each test dose, then a linear actuator ejected the dose with a 5-second hold time (per the IFU) directly into a catch-cup/pan assembly placed on a precision balance.

- **Measurement and confirmation**: The expelled dose was gravimetrically measured in grams, and the weights were converted to volume (milliliters) using the density (ρ, grams/milliliter) of the test fluid at environmental conditions. Confirmation of dose accuracy followed various conditioning scenarios, including free fall.

### The efficacy and safety of insulin degludec given in variable once-daily dosing intervals compared with insulin glargine and insulin degludec dosed at the same time daily: a 26-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, treat-to-target trial in individuals with type 2 diabetes [^116VfCKN]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Insulin degludec (IDeg) is an ultra-long-acting basal insulin analog that forms a soluble depot of multihexamers after subcutaneous injection, with subsequent slow release of monomers into the circulation. It has a long half-life (∼25 h) and a consistent glucose-lowering effect of over 42 hours at steady state. Given these attributes, we reasoned that it should be possible to vary the time of day at which once-daily injections of IDeg are given without impacting glycemic control or safety, thereby allowing for greater flexibility in the timing of injections.

The principal aim of this 26-week, phase 3 trial was to compare the efficacy and safety of once-daily IDeg given in a prespecified, "forced", rotating morning-and-evening dosing regimen to create 8–40-hour intervals between injections, with that of insulin glargine (IGlar) dosed at the same time each day (i.e. according to label) as well as IDeg given at the same time each day. Dosing intervals of 8–40 hours were chosen for IDeg because these were considered to reflect the potential extreme ranges in once-daily basal insulin dosing that patients might encounter when routines are disrupted by everyday life.

### Understanding the clinical profile of insulin degludec, the latest basal insulin approved for use in Canada: A narrative review [^111r42Fm]. Diabetes Therapy (2020).

In recent years, the development of basal insulin therapies has focused on insulin analogues that have longer durations of action and more predictable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profiles than their human insulin-based predecessors, such as neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin. Dosed once daily, such analogues can provide a more stable glucose-lowering action, which translates clinically into a reduced risk of hypoglycemia. Insulin degludec (degludec) became available in Canada in 2017 and is the first basal insulin analogue to have a half-life exceeding the dosing interval.

This characteristic offers the promise of an exceptionally flat PK/PD profile when at a steady state, meaning that insulin degludec can be dosed with some flexibility regarding the time of day, and it need not be taken at the same time each day. However, the approximately 25-hour half-life also has some implications concerning dose titration.

This article provides an up-to-date review of the study data describing the clinical profile of degludec and aims to give helpful and practical advice to prescribers about its use. While the clinical benefits of degludec are described, it is also acknowledged that further study is required to better understand how its clinical performance compares with that of insulin glargine 300 units/mL.

### Rationale and design of the phase 3a development programme (ONWARDS 1–6 trials) investigating once-weekly insulin icodec in diabetes [^111jgzdM]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

- **Initiation of treatments**: Across all trials, participants in the icodec intervention arm will receive icodec (700 units [U]/ml; prefilled pen injector) once-weekly subcutaneously. Participants will be instructed that injections should be administered on the same day each week (at any time of day) throughout the treatment period. In participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D), if necessary, the administration day can be changed by up to 3 days, with a minimum of 4 days between injections. One unit of icodec has a comparable glucose-lowering effect to one unit of comparator basal insulin; therefore, at randomization, the 'once‐weekly' dose of icodec corresponds to seven times the 'once‐daily' dose of comparator basal insulin (the once‐daily basal insulin dose is multiplied by seven). A summary of comparator interventions is provided in Table 1.

- **Trials in insulin‐naive people**: In ONWARDS 1, 3, and 5, once-weekly icodec will be initiated at a starting dose of 70 U/week. In ONWARDS 1 and 3, comparator basal insulin will be initiated at a starting dose of 10 U/day, while in ONWARDS 5, the starting doses will be in accordance with the locally approved label. In ONWARDS 3, to maintain the double blinding, treatments will be provided in visually identical prefilled pen injectors, and once-daily placebo and once-weekly placebo will be administered to participants in the icodec and degludec arms, respectively.

- **Switch trials in previously insulin‐treated people**: In ONWARDS 2 and 4, when switching participants from once- or twice-daily basal insulin, the icodec dose will be adjusted accordingly.

### Ease of use of the insulin glargine 300 U/mL pen injector in insulin-naïve people with Type 2 diabetes [^114TpqV3]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2017). Low credibility.

When assessing the individual functions of the Gla-300 injector pen relating to the setup and administration of Gla-300 injections, after 4 weeks of treatment, all items from the ease of use/ease of learning questionnaire were rated as "excellent" or "good" by at least 85.0% (range: 85.0–97.5%) of subjects. The functions most consistently rated by participating subjects as "excellent" or "good" were "Ease of selecting the dose" (38/40; 95.0%), "Ease of correcting a misdialed dose" (39/40; 97.5%), and "Force/effort needed to inject insulin" (38/40; 95.0%).

- **Overall assessment**: The Gla-300 injector pen was rated very highly by subjects, with 95.0% (38/40) assessing the pen as "excellent" or "good" after 4 weeks, compared to 89.7% (35/39) at baseline. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) overall assessment score was 1.7 (0.7) at baseline and 1.5 (0.6) at week 4. No subjects assessed the pen as "poor" or "very poor" overall at any visit.

- **Ease of learning and general ease of use**: Consistent with these findings, 95.0% (38/40) and 97.5% (39/40) of subjects rated the "Ease of learning" to use the pen and the "General ease of use" of the pen, respectively, as "excellent" or "good" at week 4. Furthermore, the mean (SD) scores for these two items generally improved over the study period, decreasing from 1.6 (0.7) and 1.6 (0.6), respectively, at baseline to 1.4 (0.6) and 1.5 (0.6) at week 4.

### Flextouch: A prefilled insulin pen with a novel injection mechanism with consistent high accuracy at low- (1 U), medium- (40 U), and high- (80 U) dose settings [^112rin7v]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2011). Low credibility.

FlexTouch® is the only prefilled insulin pen that utilizes an easy touch button that does not extend at any dose in place of a push-button extension. Rigorous testing has shown that the new FlexTouch pen accurately and consistently delivers insulin doses.

- **Methods**: This study assessed dose accuracy of FlexTouch, KwikPen®, and SoloSTAR®. Dose accuracy for minimum, medium, and maximum doses of each pen type (1, 40, and 80 U for FlexTouch and SoloSTAR and 1, 30, and 60 U for KwikPen) was assessed.

- **Results**: FlexTouch delivered all doses consistently, as demonstrated by low standard deviations. FlexTouch showed similar accuracy to KwikPen at 1 U and to SoloSTAR at 40 and 80 U. However, FlexTouch was significantly more accurate at delivering 1 U of insulin than SoloSTAR (p < .0001).

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrates that FlexTouch, a new prefilled pen, delivers insulin accurately and consistently at low, medium, and high doses. In addition, FlexTouch is currently the only prefilled pen that has a push button that does not extend at any dose, making FlexTouch easier to use than other pens.
