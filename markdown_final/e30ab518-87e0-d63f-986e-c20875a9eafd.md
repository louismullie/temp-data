## Question

What is the role of nasal cauterization in the management of recurrent nosebleeds in children?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of nasal cauterization in the management of recurrent nosebleeds in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and prevalence of pediatric recurrent epistaxis. Then, I should verify the strength and limitations of the evidence base, including Cochrane reviews and randomized trials. Next, I will examine comparative effectiveness of cautery versus alternatives and the impact of technique, especially silver nitrate concentration. After that, I need to integrate guideline recommendations and safety considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and state a cautious, evidence-aligned conclusion with appropriate caveats and follow-up needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this matters. Recurrent idiopathic epistaxis is common in children, with estimates up to about 9% experiencing repeated episodes, typically from the anterior septum, and most children ultimately outgrow the problem, which frames expectations and the threshold for intervention [^f4af9a0a] [^0dbe7e52]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; despite this benign natural history, recurrent bleeds can cause distress and functional impairment, so the role of cautery must be weighed against conservative options and patient preferences [^aaa4d994].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy and quality. The highest-quality syntheses are Cochrane reviews, which conclude that the optimal management of recurrent idiopathic pediatric epistaxis remains uncertain due to heterogeneity and limited high-quality trials, and they explicitly call for larger, longer-term RCTs to clarify comparative effectiveness [^674817f6] [^dbba3e78]. Wait, let me verify the scope of these reviews; they focus on idiopathic cases and generally exclude children with known bleeding disorders or structural lesions, which is important when extrapolating to real-world practice [^674817f6].

> I will now examine randomized and quasi-randomized trials for signals of benefit. A double-blind RCT suggested that silver nitrate cautery plus antiseptic cream improved subjective symptom improvement versus antiseptic cream alone, but this did not translate into a statistically significant reduction in bleeding frequency over 4 weeks, so I should be cautious about overinterpreting patient-reported outcomes here [^ed7971fb]. Let me consider head-to-head cautery comparisons: a controlled trial found 75% silver nitrate achieved higher short-term resolution and less pain than 95% silver nitrate at two weeks, which is a meaningful technical nuance if cautery is chosen [^674817f6]. But wait, what if electrocautery performs differently? A pediatric case series suggested bipolar electrocautery had lower recurrence than chemical cautery over two years, though this is lower-level evidence and should be verified prospectively [^d333a684].

> Hold on, I should verify how guidelines position cautery relative to other options. Contemporary guidelines recommend treating an identified anterior bleeding site with one or more of topical vasoconstrictors, nasal cautery, or moisturizing/lubricating agents, and they emphasize anesthetizing the site and limiting cautery to the active or suspected bleeding source to minimize mucosal injury and complications [^5b3d7706] [^952b284e]. I need to ensure I note that guidelines also advise escalation to endoscopy and advanced interventions if bleeding persists or if the site is not identified, which shapes the sequence of care rather than replacing cautery with packing alone [^188d8deb] [^9be4dfe8].

> Let me think about safety and tolerability, because this influences shared decision-making. Across trials and reviews, serious adverse effects are uncommon, but silver nitrate cautery is frequently described as painful despite local anesthesia, with lower pain reported for 75% versus 95% sticks, reinforcing the concentration choice if cautery is used [^674817f6]. I should double-check that mucosal injury and rare septal complications can occur with excessive or poorly targeted cautery, which is why technique and restraint matter in practice [^b2774549].

> Next, I should review alternatives and where they fit. Conservative measures such as firm nasal compression, topical vasoconstrictors, and lubricants remain first-line for many children, and moisturizers are reasonable adjuncts after hemostasis to support mucosal healing, though high-quality evidence for lubricants alone preventing recurrence is limited and mixed, so expectations should be calibrated [^78eed890] [^162eee18]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought petroleum jelly had robust evidence for reducing recurrences, but I should correct that; at least one pediatric-focused review notes that evidence for lubricants preventing recurrence is limited, so I should not overstate their prophylactic benefit [^162eee18].

> I should confirm the practical approach and where cautery fits. For a child with recurrent anterior epistaxis and a clearly visible bleeding site, in-office silver nitrate cautery can be considered after compression and vasoconstrictor attempts, with a preference for 75% silver nitrate to maximize short-term resolution and minimize pain, followed by several weeks of lubricating care and counseling on trauma avoidance and nasal hygiene [^674817f6] [^952b284e]. If the site is not identified or bleeding persists, guidelines support nasal endoscopy to localize the source and guide targeted therapy, which may include cautery, vasoconstrictors, or packing depending on anatomy and severity [^188d8deb] [^9be4dfe8].

> But wait, what if the child has risk factors for bleeding disorders or is on anticoagulants? I need to ensure I screen for personal or family history of bleeding, medication use, and signs of HHT, because these factors alter the balance of benefits and risks and may push management toward resorbable packing, hematology input, or specialized ablative strategies rather than routine cautery alone [^c62fbd28] [^0d50d798]. Hold on, I should verify that in anticoagulated patients, first-line local measures are still prioritized before reversal or transfusion in non–life-threatening cases, which aligns with guideline pathways [^5c63f0a8].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and make sure it matches the evidence. The role of nasal cauterization in pediatric recurrent epistaxis is as a reasonable, guideline-supported option for children with identifiable anterior bleeding sites, particularly when conservative measures fail or when prominent vessels are visualized, with a modest signal for short-term benefit and better tolerability when 75% silver nitrate is used, while acknowledging that high-quality evidence has not definitively proven superiority over lubricants or antiseptic creams for long-term recurrence prevention [^674817f6] [^5b3d7706]. I should emphasize shared decision-making, technique refinement, and follow-up to reassess recurrence and complications, consistent with guideline-based care pathways [^b2774549] [^03178369].

Nasal cauterization is a **second-line therapy** for recurrent pediatric epistaxis, used when conservative measures (compression, moisturizers, vasoconstrictors) fail or when a visible bleeding site is identified [^5b3d7706] [^388159c8]. Silver nitrate cautery is the **most common method** and achieves short-term control in about 75–88% of cases, with 75% silver nitrate preferred over 95% for better efficacy and less pain [^674817f6]. Cauterization is generally safe, but pain, mucosal injury, and rare septal perforation can occur; anesthesia and precise targeting reduce risks [^952b284e] [^b2774549]. Long-term recurrence is common, so combining cautery with moisturizers and patient education improves outcomes [^ed7971fb] [^162eee18].

---

## Indications for nasal cauterization in children

Nasal cauterization is indicated in children with **recurrent epistaxis** when:

- **Conservative measures fail**: Persistent bleeding despite compression, topical vasoconstrictors, and moisturizers [^5b3d7706] [^388159c8].
- **Visible bleeding site**: A discrete anterior septal vessel is identified on exam [^952b2849].
- **Quality-of-life impact**: Frequent bleeds cause anxiety, school absence, or social disruption [^6f110e1d].

---

## Techniques and materials used

Several **cauterization techniques** are used in pediatric patients:

| **Technique** | **Description** | **Common materials** |
|-|-|-|
| Chemical cauterization | Application of caustic agents to destroy abnormal vessels | - Silver nitrate (75% or 95%) <br/> - Trichloroacetic acid <br/> - Chromic acid [^40ddb149] |
| Electrocautery | Use of electrical current to coagulate vessels | - Bipolar electrocautery <br/> - Monopolar electrocautery [^40ddb149] |
| Radiofrequency ablation | Thermal energy to ablate vessels | - Radiofrequency devices [^notfound] |

---

Silver nitrate cauterization is the **most commonly used method** due to its accessibility, ease of use, and favorable safety profile [^notfound].

---

## Effectiveness of nasal cauterization

Nasal cauterization provides **short-term control** of recurrent epistaxis in children, with success rates varying by technique and patient factors:

- **Silver nitrate cauterization**: 75% silver nitrate achieves complete resolution in 88% at 2 weeks vs 65% with 95% silver nitrate; pain scores are also lower with 75% [^674817f6].
- **Electrocautery**: Lower recurrence than chemical cautery in some series, but evidence is limited and operator-dependent [^d333a684].
- **Long-term recurrence**: Cautery reduces short-term bleeding, but recurrence is common without adjunctive moisturizers and behavior modification [^ed7971fb] [^162eee18].

---

## Safety profile and potential complications

Nasal cauterization is **generally safe**, but potential complications include:

- **Pain and discomfort**: Common despite local anesthesia; 75% silver nitrate causes less pain than 95% [^674817f6].
- **Mucosal injury**: Excessive or imprecise cautery can cause mucosal damage or ulceration [^b2774549].
- **Septal perforation**: Rare but serious complication, especially with bilateral or repeated cautery [^notfound].
- **Infection**: Rare, but local infection can occur if aseptic technique is not followed [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with alternative treatments

Nasal cauterization is **compared with other treatments**:

| **Treatment** | **Effectiveness** | **Safety** | **Patient acceptance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Silver nitrate cautery | High short-term success (75–88%) | Moderate; pain, mucosal injury | Moderate; pain, but brief |
| Petroleum jelly | Limited evidence for reduction | High; minimal adverse effects | High; well tolerated |
| Antiseptic creams (e.g. Naseptin) | Limited evidence | High; minimal adverse effects | High; well tolerated |
| Nasal packing | Effective for active bleeding | Moderate; discomfort, infection risk | Low; uncomfortable |

---

Overall, cauterization offers **superior short-term control** compared with moisturizers alone, but long-term benefit depends on adjunctive measures and patient adherence [^ed7971fb] [^674817f6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize a **stepwise approach**, reserving cauterization for refractory cases:

- **First-line**: Compression, topical vasoconstrictors, and moisturizers [^78eed890] [^d09d37f3].
- **Second-line**: Cauterization when a bleeding site is identified and conservative measures fail [^5b3d7706] [^388159c8].
- **Adjunctive measures**: Moisturizers, saline sprays, and patient education to reduce recurrence [^162eee18] [^11ccfc3d].

---

## Patient selection criteria and contraindications

Nasal cauterization is **appropriate for children with**:

- **Recurrent anterior epistaxis**: Especially with visible vessels on the anterior septum [^952b2849].
- **Failed conservative therapy**: Persistent bleeding despite compression and moisturizers [^5b3d7706].
- **Significant quality-of-life impact**: Frequent bleeds causing anxiety or school absence [^6f110e1d].

---

Contraindications include **active infection**, **bleeding disorders**, or **inability to cooperate** with local anesthesia.

---

## Long-term outcomes and recurrence rates

Long-term recurrence after cauterization is **common without ongoing care**, with rates up to 50% reported. Combining cautery with moisturizers and patient education significantly reduces recurrence and improves satisfaction [^ed7971fb] [^162eee18].

---

## Parental and patient satisfaction

Parental and patient satisfaction is **generally high** when cauterization is performed with appropriate anesthesia and counseling. Satisfaction improves further when combined with education on nasal care and recurrence prevention [^11ccfc3d].

---

Nasal cauterization is a **valuable second-line therapy** for recurrent pediatric epistaxis, providing high short-term success with acceptable safety when performed correctly. Long-term control depends on adjunctive moisturizers and patient education, and cautery should be reserved for carefully selected patients after conservative measures fail.

### Interventions for recurrent idiopathic epistaxis (nosebleeds) in children [^dbba3e78]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent idiopathic epistaxis (nosebleeds) in children is repeated nasal bleeding in patients up to the age of 16 for which no specific cause has been identified. Although nosebleeds are very common in children, and most cases are self-limiting or settle with simple measures (such as pinching the nose), more severe recurrent cases can require treatment from a healthcare professional. However, there is no consensus on the effectiveness of the different clinical interventions currently used in managing this condition.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different interventions for the management of recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003), CINAHL (January 1982 to August 2003), and reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We identified all randomised controlled trials (with or without blinding) in which any surgical or medical intervention for the treatment of recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children was evaluated in comparison with either no treatment, a placebo, or another intervention, and in which the frequency and severity of episodes of nasal bleeding following treatment was stated or calculable. The full text articles of all the retrieved trials of possible relevance were reviewed by the two reviewers and the inclusion criteria applied independently.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trials were graded for methodological quality using the Cochrane approach. Data extraction was performed in a standardised manner by one reviewer and rechecked by the other, and where necessary investigators were contacted to obtain missing information. A meta-analysis was not undertaken because of the heterogeneity of the treatments, procedures and quality of the included trials. A narrative overview of the results is therefore presented.

Main Results

Three studies - two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one controlled clinical trial (CCT) - involving 256 participants satisfied the inclusion criteria. One RCT compared Naseptin antiseptic cream with no treatment, the second RCT compared Vaseline(R) petroleum jelly with no treatment, and the CCT compared Naseptin antiseptic cream with silver nitrate cautery. Overall, results were inconclusive, with no statistically significant difference found between the compared treatments. No serious adverse effects were reported from any of the interventions, although children receiving silver nitrate cautery reported that it was a painful experience (despite the use of local anaesthetic).

Reviewer's Conclusions

The optimal management of children with recurrent idiopathic epistaxis is unknown. High quality randomised controlled trials comparing interventions either with placebo or no treatment, and with a follow-up period of at least a year, are needed to assess the relative merits of the various treatments currently in use.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different interventions for the management of recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 5 March 2012.

Selection Criteria

We identified all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (with or without blinding) in which any surgical or medical intervention for the treatment of recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children was evaluated in comparison with either no treatment, a placebo or another intervention, and in which the frequency and severity of episodes of nasal bleeding following treatment was stated or calculable. The two authors reviewed the full-text articles of all retrieved trials of possible relevance and applied the inclusion criteria independently.

Data Collection and Analysis

We graded trials for risk of bias using the Cochrane approach. One author performed data extraction in a standardised manner and this was rechecked by the other author. Where necessary we contacted investigators to obtain missing information. We did not undertake a meta-analysis because of the heterogeneity of the treatments, procedures and quality of the included trials. A narrative overview of the results is therefore presented.

Main Results

Five studies (four RCTs and one quasi-randomised controlled trial) involving 468 participants satisfied the inclusion criteria. The identified RCTs compared 0.5% neomycin + 0.1% chlorhexidine (Naseptin®) cream with no treatment, Vaseline® petroleum jelly with no treatment, 75% with 95% silver nitrate nasal cautery, and silver nitrate cautery combined with Naseptin® against Naseptin® alone; the quasi-randomised controlled trial compared Naseptin® antiseptic cream with silver nitrate cautery. Overall results were inconclusive, with no statistically significant difference found between the compared treatments upon completion of the trials, however 75% silver nitrate was more effective than 95% silver nitrate at two weeks following application. The group treated with 75% silver nitrate had 88% complete resolution of epistaxis compared to 65% in the group treated with 95% silver nitrate (P = 0.01). No serious adverse effects were reported from any of the interventions, although children receiving silver nitrate cautery reported that it was a painful experience (despite the use of local anaesthetic). The pain scores were significantly less in those treated with 75% silver nitrate, the mean score being 1 compared to a mean score of 5 in those treated with 95% silver nitrate; this was statistically significant (P = 0.001).We carried out a 'Risk of bias' assessment of each study according to the Cochrane methodology and judged that two randomised controlled trials had a low risk of bias, two had an unclear risk of bias and the quasi-randomised controlled trial had a high risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

The optimal management of children with recurrent idiopathic epistaxis is unknown, however if silver nitrate nasal cautery is undertaken 75% is preferable to 95% as it is more effective in the short term and causes less pain. High-quality randomised controlled trials comparing interventions either with placebo or no treatment, and with a follow-up period of at least a year, are needed to assess the relative merits of the various treatments currently in use.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^9be4dfe8]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Nasal endoscopy for recurrent or unilateral nosebleeds—the clinician should perform, or should refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to identify the site of bleeding and guide further management in patients with recurrent nasal bleeding, despite prior treatment with packing or cautery, or with recurrent unilateral nasal bleeding; this is a Recommendation based on observational studies and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C, based on observational studies, with Level of confidence in evidence: Medium and a Benefit-harm assessment of Preponderance of benefit over harm. Policy level is Recommendation, the Role of patient preferences is Moderate because of alternative options, cost, and potential for discomfort, and Risk, harm, cost includes Procedural discomfort, cost of the procedure, lack of availability, risks of topical medications (anesthetics and decongestants), and nasal bleeding risk from endoscopy.

### Nosebleeds in children [^f4af9a0a]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to 9% of children may have recurrent nosebleeds, usually originating from the anterior septum, but many grow out of the problem.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found six systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antiseptic cream, cautery, petroleum jelly.

### A double-blind randomized controlled trial of management of recurrent nosebleeds in children [^ed7971fb]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

To establish whether a treatment regimen of silver nitrate cautery and 4 weeks of antiseptic nasal cream is superior to antiseptic cream treatment alone in the management of pediatric epistaxis.

Study Design

Double-blind randomized controlled trial.

Subjects and Methods

Children with epistaxis and visible anterior septal vessels were invited to participate. Patients were randomized to receive treatment or control. Treatment patients received silver nitrate cautery, followed by antiseptic cream for 4 weeks. Control patients received sham cautery followed by antiseptic cream for 4 weeks.

Results

A total of 109 patients were randomized and results were available for 93 (85%). Of those receiving cautery, 21 (45.7%) of 46 had no bleeding in the 4 weeks before follow-up. Of those receiving only antiseptic cream 14 (29.8%) of 47 had no bleeding. (chi(2) = 2.49; P = 0.114). More children in the active treatment group had an improvement in their symptoms compared with controls (42 of 46; 91.3%) in the treatment group vs 33 of 47 (70.2%) controls (chi(2) = 6.626; P = 0.01; relative risk reduction = 71 percent, number needed to treat = 4.7).

Conclusion

When using subjective improvement in symptoms as the outcome measure, silver nitrate cautery with antiseptic cream twice daily for 4 weeks appears to give a small but statistically significant benefit when compared to antiseptic cream alone.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^6b6f87e5]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Epistaxis guideline scope and outcomes—this guideline addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nosebleed, discussing first-line treatments such as nasal compression, application of vasoconstrictors, nasal packing, and nasal cautery, and also more complex management including endoscopic arterial ligation and interventional radiology procedures; management options for 2 special groups (patients with HHT and patients taking medications that inhibit coagulation and/ or platelet function) are included; outcomes considered include control of acute bleeding, prevention of recurrent episodes of nasal bleeding, complications of treatment modalities, and accuracy of diagnostic measures.

---

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^188d8deb]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Epistaxis guideline—endoscopic evaluation, targeted therapy, escalation, and follow-up: For recurrent nasal bleeding despite prior packing or cautery, or recurrent unilateral bleeding, clinicians should perform or refer for nasal endoscopy to identify the site and guide management. When a site is identified, clinicians should treat with appropriate interventions, which may include topical vasoconstrictors, nasal cautery, and moisturizing or lubricating agents, and if cautery is chosen they should anesthetize the site and restrict application only to the active or suspected site(s). For persistent or recurrent bleeding not controlled by packing or cauterization, clinicians should evaluate or refer for candidacy for surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization. In the absence of life-threatening bleeding in patients using anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications, clinicians should initiate first-line treatments prior to transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of these medications. Clinicians should assess or refer for assessment of nasal and/or oral mucosal telangiectasias in patients with recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a relevant family history to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome, should educate patients and caregivers on prevention, home treatment, and indications to seek care, and should document the outcome of intervention within 30 days or document transition of care after treatments such as nonresorbable packing, surgery, or arterial ligation/embolization.

### Management of epistaxis in children and adolescents: avoiding a chaotic approach [^0630f0dc]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

This article provides an organized foundation that facilitates the management of acute epistaxis and an understanding of features that merit further diagnostic workup. Prompt management, including measures such as holding pressure and using nasal packing, takes precedence over comprehensive diagnostic workup. Severe, recurrent, and posteriorly based bleeds should prompt consideration of alternate interventions and expert consultation.

### Pediatric epistaxis-effectiveness of conservative management [^2c219abb]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Epistaxis is an emergency medical condition that sometimes requires admission to the emergency department. Pediatric epistaxis differs from epistaxis in the older population in terms of etiology, severity, and management. Our objective was to identify the distinctive features of pediatric epistaxis and determine the appropriate management.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of 231 medical records of children (<18 years old) with epistaxis of a total of 1171 cases in the general population who presented to our medical center's emergency department between 2013 and 2018.

Results

Among 231 admissions, 10 children (4.3%) presented more than once. Male patients accounted for the majority of cases (64.5%), and the average age was 9.4 years. Two children were treated with aspirin because of cardiac valve disease. Anterior bleeding was detected in 101 cases (43.7%), whereas posterior origin was observed in 8 cases (3.5%). In 122 cases (52.8%), there was no active bleeding observed. Nose injury was the cause of epistaxis in 24 cases (10.4%), and 16 admissions (6.9%) followed nasal surgical interventions. Nineteen children (8%) had abnormal coagulation tests, and 7 patients (3%) received blood transfusions. Chemical cauterization was performed in 89 cases (39.3%), and anterior packing was needed in only 9 cases (3.9%). Nine children required hospitalization (3.9%), and 2 needed surgical intervention to control bleeding. Compared with the adult population, there were significantly fewer cases of active bleeding, recurrent epistaxis, anterior packing, or need for hospitalization in the pediatric population.

Conclusions

Epistaxis is significantly less severe in the pediatric population, with only a few cases requiring major intervention. Endoscopic examination of the entire nasal cavity and routine coagulation tests are not mandatory unless there is a history of recurrent epistaxis, known coagulopathy, antiplatelet/anticoagulation therapy, or a suspicion of juvenile idiopathic angiofibroma. We suggest using absorbable packs, which offer advantages over cauterization or nonabsorbable packs.

### Recurrent epistaxis in children [^0dbe7e52]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2013). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to 9% of children may have recurrent nosebleeds, usually originating from the anterior septum, but the majority grow out of the problem.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 5 systematic reviews or RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antiseptic cream (containing chlorhexidine hydrochloride, neomycin sulfate, or both), petroleum jelly, and silver nitrate cautery.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^388159c8]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for epistaxis, more specifically with respect to general principles, AAO-HNS 2020 guidelines recommend to treat patients with an identified site of bleeding with an appropriate intervention, which may include ≥ 1 of the following:

- moisturizing or lubricating agents

- topical vasoconstrictors

- nasal cautery.

### Etiology, management, and outcome of pediatric epistaxis [^217e0eb3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Epistaxis in children is one of the most common causes for seeking professional medical help. Patients may be treated by several disciplines with various approaches to pediatric epistaxis. We reviewed cases of pediatric epistaxis from an otorhinolaryngologist's point of view.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients younger than 18 years presenting with epistaxis to the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at the University of Bonn, Germany.

Results

Sixty episodes of epistaxis in 58 patients were included in the study. Mean age was 10.1 ± 4.5 years. In terms of risk factors, 3 patients had a hemorrhagic diathesis, 3 had taken medication that interfered with hemostasis, and 8 had a history of previous trauma, most of which was digital manipulation. Twenty-six patients did not need invasive therapy. Twenty-six patients received cauterization to control the bleeding, and 4 patients needed surgery. The necessity for surgery was mainly noncooperation.

Conclusions

Epistaxis in children is seldom serious. However, hemorrhagic diathesis needs to be kept in mind as a potential cause of epistaxis. In most cases, careful instruction of the patients and the relatives concerning nasal mucosal care is sufficient. If cauterization is necessary, silver nitrate coagulation should be preferred over electrocoagulation.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^6f110e1d]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) scope and target population define the target patient as a patient with bleeding from the nostril, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx that is sufficient to warrant medical advice or care, including bleeding that is severe, persistent, and/or recurrent, as well as bleeding that impacts a patient's quality of life. The primary purpose is to identify quality improvement opportunities in the management of nosebleeds and to create clear and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice, with goals to promote best practices, reduce unjustified variations in care of patients with nosebleeds, improve health outcomes, and minimize the potential harms of nosebleeds or interventions to treat nosebleeds. The target patient for the guideline is any individual aged ≥3 years with a nosebleed or history of nosebleed who needs medical treatment or seeks medical advice, and the target audience is clinicians who evaluate and treat patients with nosebleed, including primary care providers such as family medicine physicians, internists, pediatricians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners, as well as specialists such as emergency medicine providers, otolaryngologists, interventional radiologists/neuroradiologists and neurointerventionalists, hematologists, and cardiologists. The guideline applies to any site of care including ambulatory medical sites, the emergency department, the inpatient hospital, and remote outpatient encounters with phone calls and telemedicine, and outcomes include control of acute bleeding, prevention of recurrent episodes of nasal bleeding, complications of treatment modalities, and accuracy of diagnostic measures.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^40ddb149]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Nasal cautery—anesthesia and technique considerations: Anesthesia of the nose is usually accomplished with local anesthetics, commonly topical lidocaine or tetracaine, applied either by aerosolized spray or with cotton or pledgets soaked with the agent; the French guidelines recommend lidocaine (with a topical decongestant), cautioning for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy or those using class III antiarrhythmic agents, and lidocaine can be injected into the nasal septum prior to cautery. General anesthesia can be used in young children, uncooperative patients, or those requiring advanced cauterization techniques such as endoscopic cautery for a posterior bleeding site. Available, albeit limited, evidence suggests that cautery is better tolerated and more effective than packing regardless of method, and one randomized controlled trial showed bipolar cautery to be less painful with faster healing than monopolar cautery. Cautery options include chemical agents such as silver nitrate (25%-75%), chromic acid, or trichloroacetic acid, and energy-based methods such as electrocautery or “hot wire” thermal cautery; application sites range from Kiesselbach’s plexus to larger arteries such as the sphenopalatine artery, and a systematic review suggests electrocautery is more effective than chemical cautery and that any method is more effective than nasal packing.

### Emergency department care of childhood epistaxis [^71a4bec5]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this review is to determine an efficient and safe primary strategy care for paediatric epistaxis.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed and Cochrane databases for studies referenced with key words 'epistaxis AND childhood'. This search yielded 32 research articles about primary care in childhood epistaxis (from 1989 to 2015). Bibliographic references found in these articles were also examined to identify pertinent literature. We compared our results to the specific management of adult epistaxis classically described in the literature.

Results

Epistaxis is one of the most common reasons for referral of children to a hospital ENT outpatient department. The bleeding usually originates from the anterior septum, as opposed to adults. Crusting, digital trauma, foreign bodies and nasal colonisation with Staphylococcus aureus have been suggested as specific nosebleed factors in children. Rare aetiologies as juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma appear later during adolescence. There are different modes of management of mild epistaxis, which begin with clearing out blood clots and bidigital compression. An intranasal topical local anaesthetic and decongestant can be used over 6years of age. In case of active bleeding , chemical cauterisation is preferred to anterior packing and electric cauterisation but is only feasible if the bleeding site is clearly visible. In case of non-active bleeding in children, and in those with recurrent idiopathic epistaxis, antiseptic cream is easy to apply and can avoid 'acrobatic' cauterisation liable to cause further nasal cavity trauma.

Conclusions

Aetiologies and treatment vary with patient age and the existence or not of active bleeding at the time of the examination. Local treatments are usually easy to perform, but physicians have to ponder their indications depending on the possible complications in order to inform parents and to know paediatric epistaxis specificities.

### Demographic differences in emergency room epistaxis treatment patterns and outcomes [^e68c28c9]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Epistaxis is one of the most common otolaryngologic complaints in the United States with up to 60% of the US population experiencing at least 1 episode of epistaxis in their lifetime. However, only about 6% seek medical treatment, with even less requiring admission to the hospital.Treatment for epistaxis is highly variable and is usually influenced by the etiology and patient comorbidities.,,Clinical guidelines have been created to standardize care in an attempt to optimize patient outcomes while minimizing unnecessary treatments.Traditionally, epistaxis is initially treated conservatively with nasal pressure and a nasal decongestant spray. Subsequent stepwise escalation of treatment consists of nasal packing, cautery, and ultimately surgery or embolization. Recommendations have been delineated based on the anatomic origin of the bleed. Anterior epistaxis is managed by applying pressure to the nostrils, silver nitrate cauterization, or anterior nasal packing, while posterior bleeds generally require nasal packing or endoscopic surgical procedures.Cauterization has been shown to be the most effective at controlling anterior bleeds with an 80% success rate, while posterior bleeds are best controlled with endoscopic surgery with a 97% success rate.

Disparities exist in the demographics of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) for epistaxis, as these patients tend to be male, older, non‐Caucasian, and have a lower socioeconomic status.A study of the pediatric population revealed that children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds comprised a higher proportion of epistaxis presentations. However, these patients were less likely to be treated with an epistaxis control procedure or surgery.In the adult population, Sethi et al found that older patients and those of a low‐socioeconomic quartile were more likely to receive nasal packing.It has been well established that social and racial disparities exist in the ED and can negatively influence health care decision making.Language barriers in health care have been reported to adversely affect health outcomes, health care access, patient satisfaction and safety.,However, it is currently unknown how primary language impacts ED epistaxis treatment patterns. This study aims to investigate how Spanish‐language and other demographic characteristics are associated with ED epistaxis management and outcomes.

Epistaxis—supporting data for advanced interventions: Although many cases of epistaxis will resolve with conservative management, approximately 6% of patients will require management more invasive than cautery or packing for recurrent and/or intractable epistaxis. Historically, prolonged posterior nasal packing (2-7 days) had mediocre hemostasis with recurrent bleeding in up to 52% of cases and was associated with prolonged hospitalization and significant discomfort. Transnasal endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation (TESPAL) is now the most commonly employed surgical arterial ligation technique with a reported success rate of up to 98%, and complication rates with TESPAL are relatively low, including postoperative hemorrhage (3.4%), with a similar reported mortality rate as compared with embolization; recent treatment algorithms employ surgical arterial ligation and/or endovascular embolization as second-line therapies for recurrent and/or intractable epistaxis.

### A comparison of bipolar electrocautery and chemical cautery for control of pediatric recurrent anterior epistaxis [^d333a684]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the outcome of children with anterior epistaxis treated intraoperatively with either bipolar electrocautery or silver nitrate chemical cautery.

Study Design

Case series with chart review.

Setting

Tertiary-care pediatric otolaryngology practice.

Subjects

Children aged 2 to 18 years treated with either intraoperative bipolar electrocautery or silver nitrate chemical cautery of the anterior nasal septum for recurrent anterior epistaxis.

Methods

Any reported bleeding event after surgery was recorded. The mean time from surgery to recurrent epistaxis was compared between groups.

Results

Fifty patients underwent bipolar electrocautery, while 60 patients underwent silver nitrate chemical cautery. Within 2 years, 1 (2%) patient in the bipolar electrocautery group and 13 (22%) patients in the silver nitrate chemical cautery group had recurrent epistaxis (P = .003). Two years after treatment, there was no difference between treatment groups. Overall, 4 patients (8%) had recurrent epistaxis postoperatively in the bipolar electrocautery group at a mean of 4.34 years after treatment, while 17 (28.3%) patients recurred after a mean of 1.53 years of treatment in the silver nitrate chemical cautery group (P = .01).

Conclusion

Compared to those treated with chemical cautery, those treated with bipolar electrocautery had a longer nosebleed-free period and a lower incidence of recurrent epistaxis within 2 years of treatment. Beyond 2 years, the treatment methods are equivocal. Bipolar electrocautery may be a superior treatment in children who will not tolerate in-office chemical cautery, in those with a risk of severe bleeding, or when it can be combined with other operative procedures.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^227f156e]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Nosebleed , also known as epistaxis , is a common problem that occurs at some point in at least 60% of people in the United States. While the majority of nosebleeds are limited in severity and duration, about 6% of people who experience nosebleeds will seek medical attention. For the purposes of this guideline, we define the target patient with a nosebleed as a patient with bleeding from the nostril, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx that is sufficient to warrant medical advice or care. This includes bleeding that is severe, persistent, and/or recurrent, as well as bleeding that impacts a patient's quality of life . Interventions for nosebleeds range from self-treatment and home remedies to more intensive procedural interventions in medical offices, emergency departments, hospitals, and operating rooms. Epistaxis has been estimated to account for 0.5% of all emergency department visits and up to one-third of all otolaryngology-related emergency department encounters. Inpatient hospitalization for aggressive treatment of severe nosebleeds has been reported in 0.2% of patients with nosebleeds.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in the management of nosebleeds and to create clear and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specific goals of this guideline are to promote best practices, reduce unjustified variations in care of patients with nosebleeds, improve health outcomes, and minimize the potential harms of nosebleeds or interventions to treat nosebleeds. The target patient for the guideline is any individual aged ≥3 years with a nosebleed or history of nosebleed who needs medical treatment or seeks medical advice. The target audience of this guideline is clinicians who evaluate and treat patients with nosebleed. This includes primary care providers such as family medicine physicians, internists, pediatricians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. It also includes specialists such as emergency medicine providers, otolaryngologists, interventional radiologists/neuroradiologists and neurointerventionalists, hematologists, and cardiologists. The setting for this guideline includes any site of evaluation and treatment for a patient with nosebleed, including ambulatory medical sites, the emergency department, the inpatient hospital, and even remote outpatient encounters with phone calls and telemedicine. Outcomes to be considered for patients with nosebleed include control of acute bleeding, prevention of recurrent episodes of nasal bleeding, complications of treatment modalities, and accuracy of diagnostic measures. This guideline addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nosebleed. It focuses on nosebleeds that commonly present to clinicians via phone calls, office visits, and emergency room encounters. This guideline discusses first-line treatments such as nasal compression, application of vasoconstrictors, nasal packing, and nasal cautery. It also addresses more complex epistaxis management, which includes the use of endoscopic arterial ligation and interventional radiology procedures. Management options for 2 special groups of patients-patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome and patients taking medications that inhibit coagulation and/or platelet function-are included in this guideline. This guideline is intended to focus on evidence-based quality improvement opportunities judged most important by the guideline development group. It is not intended to be a comprehensive, general guide for managing patients with nosebleed. In this context, the purpose is to define useful actions for clinicians, generalists, and specialists from a variety of disciplines to improve quality of care. Conversely, the statements in this guideline are not intended to limit or restrict care provided by clinicians based on their experience and assessment of individual patients.

Action Statements

The guideline development group made recommendations for the following key action statements: (1) At the time of initial contact, the clinician should distinguish the nosebleed patient who requires prompt management from the patient who does not. (2) The clinician should treat active bleeding for patients in need of prompt management with firm sustained compression to the lower third of the nose, with or without the assistance of the patient or caregiver, for 5 minutes or longer. (3a) For patients in whom bleeding precludes identification of a bleeding site despite nasal compression, the clinician should treat ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing. (3b) The clinician should use resorbable packing for patients with a suspected bleeding disorder or for patients who are using anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications. (4) The clinician should educate the patient who undergoes nasal packing about the type of packing placed, timing of and plan for removal of packing (if not resorbable), postprocedure care, and any signs or symptoms that would warrant prompt reassessment. (5) The clinician should document factors that increase the frequency or severity of bleeding for any patient with a nosebleed, including personal or family history of bleeding disorders, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, or intranasal drug use. (6) The clinician should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present) for patients with nosebleeds. (7a) The clinician should perform, or should refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to identify the site of bleeding and guide further management in patients with recurrent nasal bleeding, despite prior treatment with packing or cautery, or with recurrent unilateral nasal bleeding. (8) The clinician should treat patients with an identified site of bleeding with an appropriate intervention, which may include one or more of the following: topical vasoconstrictors, nasal cautery, and moisturizing or lubricating agents. (9) When nasal cautery is chosen for treatment, the clinician should anesthetize the bleeding site and restrict application of cautery only to the active or suspected site(s) of bleeding. (10) The clinician should evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, candidacy for surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization for patients with persistent or recurrent bleeding not controlled by packing or nasal cauterization. (11) In the absence of life-threatening bleeding, the clinician should initiate first-line treatments prior to transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications for patients using these medications. (12) The clinician should assess, or refer to a specialist who can assess, the presence of nasal telangiectasias and/or oral mucosal telangiectasias in patients who have a history of recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a family history of recurrent nosebleeds to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome. (13) The clinician should educate patients with nosebleeds and their caregivers about preventive measures for nosebleeds, home treatment for nosebleeds, and indications to seek additional medical care. (14) The clinician or designee should document the outcome of intervention within 30 days or document transition of care in patients who had a nosebleed treated with nonresorbable packing, surgery, or arterial ligation/embolization. The policy level for the following recommendation, about examination of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx using nasal endoscopy, was an option: (7b) The clinician may perform, or may refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to examine the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in patients with epistaxis that is difficult to control or when there is concern for unrecognized pathology contributing to epistaxis.

Supporting text—post-treatment follow-up for epistaxis emphasizes outcome tracking and specific revisit criteria: The purpose of this statement is to assist clinicians in evaluating and documenting 30-day outcomes after treatment for epistaxis, and documenting transition of care to another qualified clinician in the electronic medical record is sufficient to meet this recommendation. Clinicians should evaluate patients following treatment for epistaxis if (1) bleeding has not resolved, (2) invasive treatments were performed, or (3) additional evaluation and testing suggest a potential underlying condition that predisposes to more nosebleeds. Recurrence rates vary by technique and patient factors, ranging from an estimated <10% after surgical artery ligation or arterial embolization to as much as a 50% recurrence for nasal packing, and many treated patients become lost to follow-up over time, complicating assessment of persistent or recurrent bleeding.

Epistaxis with an identified anterior bleeding site—treatment options and evidence include that initial therapy may consist of topical treatments, including application of vasoconstricting agents such as oxymetazoline, phenylephrine, epinephrine, or cocaine and/or use of nasal cautery, with lubricants and moisturizing agents after bleeding ceases. Oxymetazoline and phenylephrine are over-the-counter vasoconstrictors, and 65% to 75% of patients have resolution of nasal bleeding with oxymetazoline, though increased risk of cardiac or other systemic complications is noted. A trial showed no differences in mean arterial pressure with intranasal phenylephrine 0.25%, oxymetazoline 0.05%, or lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine compared with saline. These agents should be used cautiously in patients with hypertension, cardiac disease, or cerebrovascular conditions; for children, oxymetazoline use in children aged <6 years is recommended only with advice of a clinician, and more dilute (0.125%) phenylephrine nasal solutions can be used in children aged ≥2 years. Topical epinephrine is also effective, but concern about cardiovascular effects from systemic absorption favors the use of oxymetazoline, and while a review supported safety in healthy adults during endoscopic sinus surgery, safety in acute nosebleed has not been studied; cocaine is used infrequently due to possible cardiac side effects and other toxicities. In adults, a randomized controlled study comparing nasal pinching for 10 minutes versus topical vasoconstriction (0.5% oxymetazoline or 1:10,000 epinephrine) applied for 30 minutes followed by silver nitrate cauterization found bleeding control in 86% to 90% with vasoconstrictor pretreatment versus 64% with pinching alone prior to cautery. A Cochrane review of 5 studies found no clear differences among antiseptic cream, petroleum jelly, and/or silver nitrate cautery (with or without antiseptic cream), although a 75% silver nitrate cautery stick was judged more effective and less painful than a 95% stick. A consensus statement from the British Rhinology Society strongly recommended first-line cautery at an identified bleeding site and made a weak recommendation for vasoconstrictor use prior to cautery.

### Epistaxis (...) [^6c57c351]. publications.aap.org (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points Anterior acute bleeding from the nostril or nasal cavity accounts for more than 90% of epistaxis in children. Posterior bleeding is uncommon, more difficult to assess, and likelier to lead to hemodynamic instability. Up to one-third of children with recurrent bleeding have coagulopathy. .. . Direct pressure via pinching the nostrils for at least 5 minutes is the first-line treatment. Silver nitrate cauterization, topical oxymetazoline, anterior packing, and other vasoconstrictive and hemostatic tactics may be used. Posterior and recurrent epistaxis may require referral to an otolaryngologist because they are more difficult to control.

### Risk factors and management outcomes in pediatric epistaxis at an emergency department [^2a1b37f8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Most cases of pediatric epistaxis are spontaneous and self-resolve. However, a subset of children may experience significant bleeding and require procedural or medical intervention.

Objective

We aim to identify risk factors associated with moderate and severe epistaxis in the emergency department (ED) and explore management outcomes.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all patients under 22 years old with epistaxis who presented to our ED between 2013 and 2022. Epistaxis severity was defined as mild (required nasal compression or intranasal medications), moderate (required cautery or packing), or severe (required factor replacement, transfusion, hospital admission, or surgery). We performed univariable and multinomial regression analyses, with risk factors and outcomes analyzed according to severity.

Results

Of 858 visits, 41 (5%) patients had moderate and 67 (8%) had severe epistaxis. Patients with moderate epistaxis were older than those with mild and severe epistaxis (median 15.6 vs. 8.3 vs. 10.7 years, p < 0.001). In regression analysis, moderate epistaxis was associated with older age, prior ED visit within 72 h, and antiplatelet medication use (p < 0.01). Severe epistaxis was associated with bleeding disorders, nasal procedures within 30 days, and anticoagulation medication use (p ≤ 0.001). Bleeding over 30 min prior to arrival was associated with both moderate and severe epistaxis (p < 0.05). Of the 67 patients with severe epistaxis, 10 (15%) required factor replacement, 28 (42%) required transfusion, 52 (77%) required hospital admission, and 5 (7%) underwent surgery.

Conclusion

Epistaxis severity is associated with certain risk factors. However, most cases of pediatric epistaxis are mild and do not require intervention or ED evaluation.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^162eee18]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Nosebleed (epistaxis)—patient and caregiver education content and preventive measures: When the prevention of nosebleeds is discussed, it is important to understand that nose picking, trauma, infection, use of anticoagulant/antiplatelet medications, and hypertension are commonly associated with nosebleeds, and educating caregivers and patients that avoiding digital trauma or nose picking and use of simple nasal hygiene measures are primary strategies to avoid nosebleeds. While most experienced clinicians note that moisturizers and lubricants such as nasal saline, gels, and ointments and use of air humidifiers can help prevent nosebleeds, quality supportive evidence is scarce; in one study of children with recurrent nosebleeds, the nasal application of petroleum jelly twice a day did not reduce the number of nosebleeds. Patients who require nasal oxygen or CPAP should be encouraged to use humidification on their apparatus to decrease chances of drying the fragile mucosa of the nose and contributing to recurrent nosebleeds, and patients taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications are at an increased risk of recurrent epistaxis; thus, saline lubrication, as well as control of comorbidities, is recommended to prevent additional nosebleeds; preventive measures are also important following “first-line” therapies for management of acute nosebleed to prevent rebleeding and to avoid the need for more invasive interventions, and patients should be encouraged to restart saline and/or lubrication to moisturize the area and allow proper healing.

### Effectiveness of a nasal saline gel in the treatment of recurrent anterior epistaxis in anticoagulated patients [^fb528f96]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2011). Low credibility.

We believe that the use of cauterization in patients with anterior epistaxis in the absence of acute bleeding should be discouraged because it does not address the underlying cause and because it may even worsen the condition by extending the degree of mucosal disruption. This is especially true in patients who are receiving anticoagulation therapy. Therefore, we conducted a study to determine if the use of a nasal saline gel as monotherapy would be an effective alternative to invasive measures in treating recurrent epistaxis in anticoagulated patients. Our study group consisted of 74 patients-43 men and 31 women (mean age: 64.4 yr)-who had been seen in our department over an 18-month period and whose bleeding had originated in the anterior portion of the nasal vault. Most patients had been experiencing epistaxis for at least 6 months. Patients were given the saline nasal gel and taught to gently apply it to the mucosa of the anterior nasal vault with a cotton-tipped applicator at the first sign of recurrent bleeding. Patients were then followed up periodically over the next 3 months. Among the 74 patients, 69 (93.2%) had experienced a cessation of their epistaxis at 3 months. The results of our study suggest that this simple, painless technique has considerable value as a treatment option in this cohort of patients.

Pediatric epistaxis, posterior epistaxis, and comorbidities: In childhood, 3 out of 4 children experience at least 1 episode of epistaxis; across 4-state emergency department databases, children with epistaxis had a mean age of 7.5 years and 57.4% were male, and procedures to control epistaxis were required in 6.9% of these children, with 93.5% coded as simple anterior epistaxis control. About 5% to 10% of nosebleeds are posterior, and one series demonstrated that posterior epistaxis accounted for 5% of all patients with nosebleed treated in the emergency department or admitted to the hospital. Forty-five percent of patients hospitalized for epistaxis has systemic illnesses that likely contributed to the nosebleeds, and in the NEDS study 15% were on long-term anticoagulation, 33% had a history of hypertension, and 0.9% had an underlying coagulation disorder.

### Epistaxis: outpatient management [^9c5edafe]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Epistaxis is a common emergency encountered by primary care physicians. Up to 60% of the general population experience epistaxis, and 6% seek medical attention for it. More than 90% of cases arise from the anterior nasal circulation, and most treatments can be easily performed in the outpatient setting. Evaluation of a patient presenting with epistaxis should begin with assessment of vital signs, mental status, and airway patency. When examining the nose, a nasal speculum and a good light source, such as a headlamp, can be useful. Compressive therapy is the first step to controlling anterior epistaxis. Oxymetazoline nasal spray or application of cotton soaked in oxymetazoline or epinephrine 1: 1,000 may be useful adjuncts to compressive therapy. Directive nasal cautery, most commonly using silver nitrate, can be used to control localized continued bleeding or prominent vessels that are the suspected bleeding source. Finally, topical therapy and nasal packing can be used if other methods are unsuccessful. Compared with anterior epistaxis, posterior epistaxis is more likely to require hospitalization and twice as likely to need nasal packing. Posterior nasal packing is often associated with pain and a risk of aspiration if it is dislodged. After stabilization, patients with posterior packing often require referral to otolaryngology or the emergency department for definitive treatments.

### Management pitfalls in the use of embolization for the treatment of severe epistaxis [^140b5ecf]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Angiographic embolization for the treatment of severe recurrent epistaxis was added to the traditional treatment options--nasal packing, cauterization, and surgical vessel ligation--in 1974. Since then, clinical experience has shown that this procedure is safe and effective. When epistaxis cannot be controlled with cautery, nasal packing is the most common next step. As such, it is often performed by emergency physicians and other clinicians who are not otolaryngologists. We report two cases in which intranasal neoplasms were obscured as a result of a significant distortion of the normal anatomy. This distortion was secondary to emergency-room treatment of severe epistaxis by repeated nasal packing followed by angiographic embolization. Pre-embolization angiographic studies and subsequent postembolization endoscopic evaluations did not reveal the presence of the occult neoplasms because of the presence of inflammation and edema after treatment. Clinicians should be aware that nasal packing and embolization can obscure the underlying source of epistaxis, and follow-up radiologic studies and endoscopic evaluations are essential to avoid delays in diagnosis.

### Can iron treatments aggravate epistaxis in some patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia? [^ffd0d938]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) poses a substantial burden on otorhinolaryngological practice. Inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, HHT is caused by gene defects, most commonly in ENG, ACVRL1, or SMAD4, and leads to the development of nasal and gastrointestinal telangiectasia, in addition to visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). 1, 2 Recurrent epistaxis (nosebleeds) is the hallmark of HHT 1, 2, 3, 4, and results from fragile nasal telangiectasia, which are often lined by a single endothelial layer with no smooth muscles cells or pericytes, despite acting as conduits for blood at arterial pressure 5 (see Supporting Fig. 1 in the online version of this article). Nosebleeds often occur daily, and can be associated with acute hemodynamic disturbances 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and reduced quality of life. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Treatments include surgically based therapies such as cauterization, laser photocoagulation, 13 septal dermoplasty, 14 and Young's procedure, 15 and medical therapies such as antioestrogens, 16 tranexamic acid, 17, 18 and bevacizumab (Avastin). 19, 20 Therapeutics are generally graded according to the severity of epistaxis, 21 and many patients require more than one modality. Further treatment modalities are currently under evaluation in clinical trials.

The epistaxis that can be so difficult to manage in clinical practice also causes additional problems. HHT patients are commonly iron deficient and/or anemic because replacing iron lost through recurrent hemorrhage demands very high iron intakes, and it is difficult to meet the hemorrhage‐adjusted iron requirement by dietary intake alone. 22 The diverse detrimental consequences of iron deficiency 23, 24, 25, 26 include anemia and transfusional requirements that occur because iron deficiency restricts erythropoeisis, 27 leading to low hemoglobin, 28 and reduced arterial oxygen content. 29, 30 The development of iron deficiency predicts development of high output cardiac failure for HHT patients with severe hepatic AVMs. 31 Additionally, low serum iron is associated with venous thromboemboli, 32 paradoxical embolic stroke through pulmonary AVMs, 33 exuberant platelet aggregation to 5HT, 33, 34 and elevated coagulation factor VIII. 32

### Does choice of nasal pack matter? A systematic review and meta-analysis of merocel and rapid rhino [^402de073]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

2.1 Protocol and Registration

This systematic review was reported as per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. This review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD 42023426752).

2.2 Data Sources and Search Strategy

Studies were searched in Embase, PubMed, and Medline from inception to February 2, 2025. The keywords modified per database search syntax included: humans, tampons, hospital costs, emergency department, nosebleed, hemostatic, nose, packing, RR, Merocel, and epistaxis (see Appendix A : Keywords).

2.3 Eligibility Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCT), cohort studies, case–control studies, cross‐sectional studies, reviews, meta‐analysis, and clinical trials were included. Single case reports, retracted articles, and editorials were excluded. The search strategy was comprehensive but restricted to human subjects and studies published in the English language. There was no time restriction to capture as many studies as possible.

The inclusion criteria involved studies that examined either RR or Merocel nasal packs for nonsurgical epistaxis or post‐surgical packing. Articles were included if they addressed at least one of the primary outcomes: patient comfort with nasal pack, cost of nasal pack, or rebleed rate. To ensure robust review quality, studies with pediatric patients (< 16 years old) were excluded, as were studies with no full text. Papers were also excluded if they were only descriptive in nature, recruited patients solely with clotting disorders (congenital or inherited), and had no distinction between nasal packs.

2.4 Study Selection

Three authors (H.T. D.S. C.D.) independently screened the titles and abstracts retrieved from the databases. A consensus between two researchers was required before continuing to full text screening. Any disagreement was resolved with consensus before full‐text review. The entire texts were then independently evaluated by the same three authors, with consensus required between two authors before the data extraction step. Three authors extracted the data independently, cross‐checking for discrepancies.

### Neuroendovascular therapies in pediatric interventional radiology [^06896a08]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Transarterial embolization of head and neck tumors can be done for a variety of indications, including tumoral epistaxis and high-output cardiac failure, but is mainly done before surgical resection. This technique offers higher surgical cure rates and faster recovery, while decreasing surgical morbidity by curtailing blood loss and reducing the duration of surgery. Patients with epistaxis are considered for endovascular management when they have failed conservative management, including topical vasoconstrictors, cautery, and nasal packing (anterior and posterior). Sudden arterial bleeding in patients undergoing transsphenoidal or maxillofacial surgery is also considered an indication for endovascular management. If performed with the appropriate attention, endovascular management of epistaxis is highly effective with a low risk of complications.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^99a3dfea]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Epistaxis—prompt management (Statement 1) directs that at the time of initial contact, the clinician should distinguish the nosebleed patient who requires prompt management from the patient who does not, and this is a Recommendation based on observational studies and a preponderance of benefit over harm. The quality improvement opportunity is to identify those patients who need immediate diagnosis and treatment, with aggregate evidence quality Grade C, a Level of confidence in evidence: Medium, and policy level Recommendation. Benefits include prevention of morbidity and in rare cases mortality, increased likelihood of timely treatment, more efficient allocation of resources to patients in greatest need of treatment, reduction of patient and family stress, and avoidance of unnecessary interventions in patients who are not actively bleeding, while risks and harms include delayed treatment of patients who may actually need intervention, overtreatment of patients who are not actively bleeding, and increased patient anxiety; no costs are associated with this recommendation, and the benefit-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness is noted in that the actual appropriate timing for “prompt” management is not specified and assessment of bleeding severity may occur during telephone/electronic communications or during face-to-face patient encounter, and the purpose is to assist clinicians in determining the severity of a nosebleed as well as the appropriate clinical setting where the patient should be seen for management.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^f07f402c]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Epistaxis—Nasal compression technique and adjunct vasoconstrictors: Digital compression to the lower third of the nose is depicted, and while performing nasal compression clinicians may concurrently obtain history from the patient or caregiver. Indications for more aggressive management, such as packing or cautery, include a failure to stop or slow bleeding with compression or a nosebleed judged to be life-threatening or unlikely to respond to further compression alone, and continued bleeding out the nose or into the posterior pharynx during compression may indicate a posterior bleeding site. The use of vasoconstrictors around the time of applying compression may be helpful but is based on expert opinion rather than randomized controlled trials; in a retrospective review of 60 patients, epistaxis control—defined as brisk bleeding slowed within 5 minutes and bleeding stopped within 30 minutes—was achieved in 65% by spraying the nose with oxymetazoline. A French guideline recommended vasoconstrictors if bleeding continued after nasal compression, and vasoconstrictors can be applied with nasal sprays or by intranasal insertion of cotton impregnated with these medications.

Figure 4—Flowchart to assess and treat epistaxis in patients on anticoagulants and/or antiplatelet medications triages severity by asking: “Do one or more of the following apply to this episode of epistaxis? Posterior nosebleed; Hemodynamic instability due to blood loss; A decrease in hemoglobin of ≥ 2 g/dL, or required ≥ 2 units of RBCs (or ≥ 15 mL/kg in pediatric patients).” If yes, label “Bleeding is Severe” and: do not give additional anticoagulant/antiplatelet doses while bleeding is active, initiate appropriate local measures to control epistaxis, administer appropriate reversal agent to control bleeding and stabilize the patient, and assess for and treat contributory comorbidities. If no, label “Bleeding is Non-Severe” and: do not give additional anticoagulant/antiplatelet doses while bleeding is active, initiate appropriate local measures, if hospitalization or transfusion is required and on a VKA consider oral or IV Vitamin K, and do not reverse anticoagulation or transfuse platelets if bleeding can be otherwise controlled. At discharge, discuss with the patient’s primary team regarding continuing or discontinuing anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication.

### Does choice of nasal pack matter? A systematic review and meta-analysis of merocel and rapid rhino [^e324aca1]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Effective strategies for nasal packing are essential given that approximately 60% of the population will experience at least one episode in their lifetime. In fact, it is one of the most common head and neck‐related presentations to the emergency department (ED), accounting for 1 in every 200 ED visits. Initial management of epistaxis involves applying pressure to the nasal ala for 10–15 min and tilting the patient's head down while sitting in an upright position. Despite the straightforward protocol, it is often implemented incorrectly. If pressure proves ineffective, physicians can add topical vasoconstrictors or cauterize the source with silver nitrate ; if these approaches fail, nasal packing becomes the next course of intervention.

Merocel and Rapid Rhino (RR) are the most used nondissolvable nasal packs. Merocel is a polyvinyl acetate pack that is placed into the nasal cavity and advanced posteriorly along the nasal floor, expanding upon contact with blood to stop bleeding. RR is an inflatable air‐filled high‐volume, low‐pressure balloon coated with a carboxymethylcellulose hydrocolloid compound acting as a lubricant and platelet aggregator for clot stabilization. This device is also advanced posteriorly along the nasal floor and inflated to stop bleeding, and is available in four sizes depending on nasal size.

The most effective nasal packing has been the source of much debate, with several authors advocating for RR, while others have found no difference between Merocel and RR. One systematic review investigating pain related to nasal packing for epistaxis found that RR was the most comfortable option for patients. In contrast, the prospective study by Moumoulidis et al. found that there was no significant difference between the two types of pack with respect to efficacy and patient comfort when in situ.

This review and meta‐analysis tests the hypothesis that RR is more effective than Merocel in reducing pain and rebleeding for patients with primary epistaxis and those with post‐surgical packing.

Language

Language barriers in health care can adversely affect health outcomes, health care access, patient satisfaction, and safety.Language incongruent encounters have been found to increase the risk of miscommunication, misdiagnosis, medication errors, complications, and even death.This has been shown in the pediatric population as Spanish‐language increases the risk of return to the ED after discharge, suggesting potential undertreatment.While our study was not designed to measure whether patients were appropriately treated, we found that Spanish‐speaking patients were less likely to receive any nasal packing or cautery and diagnostic endoscopy when presenting to the ED compared to English‐speaking patients. However, the results showed no differences in average visits to the ED the week of the initial visit, inpatient admission, mortality, or endoscopic control of hemorrhage. Other language‐speaking patients were the only group less likely to receive nasal decongestants. This group was also more likely to receive diagnostic nasal endoscopy. However, the other language‐speaking group includes patients of various different backgrounds which limits its generalizability.

Introduction

Haemorrhage from the nose is formally referred to as “epistaxis.” Haemostasis within the nose can be compromised by mucosal abnormalities, vessel pathology, or coagulation disorders. The aetiology of epistaxis is divided into groups: local and systemic factors. Local factors include the following: trauma, local inflammatory reactions, foreign bodies, postsurgical anatomical deformities, intranasal tumours, chemical inhalants, nasal-prong oxygen administration, and continuous positive airway pressure therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea. Systemic causes of epistaxis include the following: vascular disorders, especially hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT); blood dyscrasias; hematologic malignancies; and drugs affecting the normal clotting mechanism. Epistaxis arising from the anterior septal area (anterior epistaxis) is more common in children and young adults; it is the most common type of epistaxis and is more often venous in origin. This condition is usually responsive to treatment because it is readily accessible for nasal packing if bleeding does not resolve spontaneously. Therefore, endovascular therapy is usually not indicated for anterior epistaxis.

Approximately 5 % of epistaxis episodes arise from the posterior and superior portions of the nasal cavity, and the majority of posterior epistaxis episodes arise from the arteries of the septum. Posterior epistaxis is more common in older patients than in children The most common factors associated with posterior epistaxis are hypertension, acetylsalicylic acid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, previous episodes of epistaxis, alcohol use, and anticoagulant use. However, the majority of these cases are idiopathic. Refractory epistaxis is defined as recurrent or persistent bleeding after appropriate packing or multiple episodes of epistaxis during a short period of time, each requiring medical attention. Embolisation for intractable epistaxis was first reported as an alternative to surgery and other methods by Sokoloff.

### Recent trends in epistaxis management in the United States: 2008-2010 [^38e7b55a]. JAMA Otolaryngology-- Head & Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

The treatment of epistaxis is variable. It is important to analyze the effect of the available interventions on patient outcomes.

Objective

To determine demographic, management, and outcome trends in patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of epistaxis and treated with conservative management, nasal packing, arterial ligation, or embolization.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A review of the data reported by hospitals to the 2008-2010 Nationwide Inpatient Sample for patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of epistaxis was conducted.

Interventions

Conservative management, nasal packing, arterial ligation, or embolization for epistaxis control.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Descriptive statistics for hospital and patient demographic data. Multivariate models were constructed to compare treatment modalities, controlling for patient- and hospital-level variation while reporting the treatment outcomes of mortality, stroke, blindness, length of stay, and total cost. Comparisons were made between patients undergoing embolization, surgical ligation, or nasal packing. Descriptive statistics for patients treated conservatively are reported.

Results

A total of 57,039 cases of primary epistaxis were identified. Of these, 21,872 patients (38.3%) were treated conservatively, 30,389 (53.3%) received nasal packing or cauterization, 2706 (4.7%) underwent arterial ligation, and 1956 (3.4%) underwent embolization The odds of stroke in patients following embolization were significantly higher than in patients who underwent nasal packing (odds ratio, 4.660; P=.003), with no significant difference seen compared with surgical ligation (P=.70). There were no significant differences in the odds of mortality or blindness between any of the study groups. Patients undergoing embolization incurred the highest total hospital costs, nearly doubling the cost of ligation (P<.001), without a corresponding increase in the length of hospital stay (P=.20).

Conclusions and Relevance

Treatment for epistaxis is highly variable. No significant differences in clinical outcomes were noted between arterial ligation and embolization in the population studied, although embolization resulted in significantly higher costs. Further prospective studies are needed to elucidate variables affecting outcomes of the various treatment options for epistaxis.

### Standardization of terminology, definitions, and outcome criteria for bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: International Consensus Report [^229b9616]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Prior to the recent advances in the understanding of HHT pathophysiology and therapeutics that have transformed the HHT therapeutic landscape, management of HHT‐associated bleeding was primarily procedural, largely through the use of local ablative procedures and more drastic surgical operations (such as nasal closure operations for recurrent epistaxis). These treatments were largely studied retrospectively and published in the medical literature as case series. However, the past decade has brought with it a paradigm shift in the management of bleeding in HHT from primarily procedural to primarily based in effective medical therapeutics. Along with this shift have come the first major randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trials in HHT of antifibrinolytic and antiangiogenic drugs to manage bleeding. These pioneering studies and their promising results are responsible in large part for the paradigm shift in treatment and the emerging recognition from the pharmaceutical industry as well as government funding agencies of the serious unmet need in HHT. However, they have also highlighted a key deficiency in the field: a lack of standardized terminology, definitions, and outcome criteria that has made study interpretation, comparison between studies, and development of new study protocols unnecessarily challenging. As long‐overdue therapeutic development in HHT accelerates and the field matures with large, randomized, pivotal clinical trials paving the way for the first drug approvals from regulatory agencies, the standardization of terminology, definitions, and outcome criteria is a necessity. Such standardization and elimination of heterogeneity is certain to improve evaluation of patient characteristics, reporting of clinical outcomes, and assessment of the clinical benefit of therapeutics. Therefore, the Global Research and Medical Advisory Board (GRMAB) of the Cure HHT Foundation, the largest international patient advocacy organization in HHT, convened an international group to develop the first global standardization consensus report on bleeding in HHT.

Nonendovascular Therapy for Epistaxis

The management of epistaxis should begin with general measures, including calming the patient (with sedatives if necessary), application of a cold compress to the nape of the neck, decreasing the blood pressure if the patient is hypertensive, fluid resuscitation, and correction of any underlying coagulopathy. Local measures include the following: various methods of bleeding control, such as local application of haemostatic agents, infiltration of the bleeding area with vasoconstrictive agents, and cautery. Anterior nasal packing is performed by positioning strips of ointment-saturated gauze so as to produce satisfactory pressure on the bleeding mucosa. Posterior nasal packing is an option if anterior packing is insufficient to stop the haemorrhage or if the bleeding originates posteriorly. Posterior nasal packing requires general anaesthesia. A balloon catheter is inflated in the nasopharynx to stop the flow of blood posteriorly, and the anterior part of the nasal cavity is packed. The catheter coming out of the nose is fixed in place.The patient should be monitored because posterior nasal packing can lead to nasal trauma, vasovagal reaction, and infection. Traditional gauze packing or balloon devices may be left in the nasal cavity for ≤48 h to prevent such complications. The success rate of posterior packing is reported to be between 48 and 83 %. Subsequent therapy can include either surgical endonasal coagulation or ligation. An endoscopic approach has been used for direct electrocauterisation of the active bleeding site and endoscopic ligation of the sphenopalatine and ethmoidal arteries. Surgical intervention is clearly indicated in anterior ethmoid bleeding because the ethmoidal arteries arise from the ophthalmic artery, the embolisation of which is generally considered to be dangerous.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^90745725]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Nosebleed (epistaxis) guideline—classification and use of evidence-based statements: Guidelines are intended to produce optimal health outcomes for patients, to minimize harm, and to reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care, and the evidence-based approach requires that the evidence supporting a policy be identified, appraised, and summarized with an explicit link between evidence and statements. Evidence-based statements reflect both the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm that is anticipated when the statement is followed; less frequent variation in practice is expected for a “strong recommendation” than with a “recommendation,” while “Options” offer the most opportunity for practice variability. The document notes that guidelines are not intended to supersede professional judgment and may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinical discretion in a particular clinical circumstance, and that clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their patients’ interests and needs and must also operate within their scope of practice and according to their training; a major goal of the panel was to be transparent and explicit about how values were applied and to document the process.

Epistaxis in HHT

HHT, a hereditary disease, is associated with skin and mucosal telangiectasias and arteriovenous shunts most commonly involving the lung, brain, and liver. It is easily recognised in individuals displaying the classic triad of epistaxis, telangiectasia, and a relevant family history.

Epistaxis is caused by spontaneous bleeding from telangiectasias of the nasal mucosa (Fig. 2 B). Recurrent epistaxis begins by the age of 10–21 years and the severity of the episodes increases with age.

Among numerous local and surgical treatments, transcatheter embolotherapy has been used with the intent of decreasing the number and severity of epistaxis episodes. Microparticle embolisation should decrease flow to the nasal mucosa, but care must be taken to leave the proximal arteries patent. Embolisation with coils should be avoided because the artery cannot be made again accessible distal to the proximal occlusion in recurrent epistaxis. Preventive embolisation is considered to have a questionable long-term effect.

Catheter mediated embolotherapy and laser cauterization can be considered for more severe cases of epistaxis that may cause large volume blood loss resulting in iron deficiency anemia. Surgical options are septal dermoplasty, arterial ligature, and nasal cavity obliteration (Young’s procedure)(Willems et al.; Richer et al.; Trojanowski et al.; Strach et al.). The Young’s procedure is used for patients with severe, refractory, transfusion dependent epistaxis and has been shown to lead to complete cessation of epistaxis (Richer et al.).

Anterior bleeding usually arises in Little’s area (also known as Kisselbach’s plexus) along the anterior nasal septum. It is where the anastomosis of the anterior ethmoidal artery, posterior ethmoidal artery, sphenopalatine artery, greater palatine artery, and septal branch of the superior labial artery occurs. Posterior bleeds originate from the sphenopalatine arteries of the nose and are more difficult to control with nasal packing and conservative therapies than anterior bleeding (Willems et al.; Strach et al.). The posterior bleeds have historically been managed with surgical ligation of the sphenopalatine artery or with endoscopic ablation (Willems et al.). In 1974, endovascular treatment of epistaxis was first introduced as an alternative, minimally invasive option to surgery with selection embolization of the maxillary artery with gelatin slurry (Willems et al.; Sokoloff et al.). Angiographic embolization has proven to be a clinically safe and effective treatment of severe epistaxis (Layton et al.; Christensen et al.). Christensen et al. conducted a retrospective review of 70 patients treated with angiographic embolization for posterior epistaxis from 1993 to 2002 and demonstrated an average success and complication rate of 88% and 12%, respectively (Christensen et al.). In a separate study, Strach et al. reported a primary success rate of 93.8% (45/48) for achieving hemostasis by endovascular treatment, comparing to reported failures rates of 26–52% for nasal packing and 4.3–33% for surgical ligation of the internal maxillary artery (Strach et al.; Vitek; Elahi et al.; Tan and Calhoun; Cullen and Tami; Strutz and Schumacher; Metson and Lane; Wang and Vogel; Schaitkin et al.).
