## Question

How should a 24-year-old with a history of bariatric surgery 5 months ago, now in the first trimester, with an iron saturation level of 15 and ferritin 65 be interpreted?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret iron studies in a first-trimester pregnancy five months after bariatric surgery with TSAT 15% and ferritin 65 mcg/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to interpret TSAT and ferritin in early pregnancy and in inflammatory states. Then, I should verify how bariatric surgery alters iron absorption and the timing-to-conception considerations. Next, I will examine pregnancy-specific risks and diagnostic thresholds. After that, I need to outline an evidence-based treatment and monitoring plan, including when to escalate to IV iron and trimester-specific safety. Finally, I should ensure counseling and multidisciplinary coordination are addressed and cited appropriately [^112xfTyX] [^113gSjPj] [^116if1iK] [^114wtGXx].

> Let me first confirm the laboratory interpretation: a TSAT of 15% is below the 20% threshold commonly used to indicate iron-restricted erythropoiesis or functional iron deficiency, especially when ferritin is between 30–100 mcg/L and inflammation may confound ferritin, so this profile is compatible with iron depletion despite a "normal" ferritin of 65 mcg/L [^112xfTyX].

> Wait, let me verify ferritin behavior in early pregnancy: physiologic, trimester-specific analyses suggest first-trimester ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency are around 25 mcg/L, so a ferritin of 65 mcg/L is not "low" by that standard; however, because ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and can be elevated by inflammation or recent surgery, TSAT often becomes the more reliable early indicator of functional deficiency, so I should weigh TSAT more heavily here [^113gSjPj] [^112xfTyX].

> Hold on, I should verify how bariatric surgery changes iron absorption: reduced gastric acid, bypass of proximal small bowel, and rapid transit all impair iron solubilization and uptake after RYGB and, to a lesser degree, sleeve gastrectomy, placing pregnant patients at high risk of iron deficiency and anemia, warranting intensified surveillance and supplementation during pregnancy [^1147gEAP] [^112rka4m].

> Let me consider timing-to-conception nuance: most programs advise waiting at least 12 months after surgery to conceive to stabilize nutrition, but I should double-check whether earlier conception is uniquely risky for anemia; interestingly, some observational data suggest higher anemia rates with longer surgery-to-pregnancy intervals (> 18 months or ≥ 4 years), so the anemia risk persists across intervals, meaning this 5-month conception is still high risk for deficiency, but not necessarily less risky than later intervals for anemia progression [^114V5j5X] [^115G4822] [^114pSNSG].

> Next, I should review pregnancy-specific risks and thresholds: maternal iron deficiency and anemia increase risks of low birth weight, prematurity, and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes; obstetric guidance recommends CBC screening in the first trimester and again at 24–28 weeks, with treatment of iron deficiency to maintain hemoglobin ≥ 11.0 g/dL in the first trimester while recognizing hemodilution accelerates later and may unmask deficiency [^116if1iK] [^112851YH] [^113MnAQh].

> I will now state the clinical interpretation: this pattern represents functional iron deficiency with early iron depletion in a high-risk, post-bariatric, first-trimester pregnancy; despite ferritin 65 mcg/L appearing "reassuring", the TSAT of 15% indicates insufficient iron availability and a high likelihood of progression to iron deficiency anemia without intervention [^112xfTyX].

> Let me think about immediate treatment: first-line therapy in pregnancy is oral iron, and ferrous sulfate is a cost-effective standard; starting with 65 mg elemental iron once daily or every other day is reasonable given similar efficacy and improved tolerability with intermittent dosing, acknowledging that absorption may be impaired post-bariatric and thus response must be assessed promptly [^111yT1Xa] [^113oF832] [^111ydfYN] [^117E4iu3].

> I should confirm baseline status and monitoring cadence: obtain a CBC with indices and reticulocyte count now to document hemoglobin status and repeat surveillance frequently in this high-risk context; obstetric guidance supports first-trimester screening and repeat at 24–28 weeks, but with post-bariatric malabsorption I would recheck CBC, TSAT, and ferritin in about 4 weeks to ensure response, considering CRP if ferritin-TSAT discordance persists due to inflammation [^116if1iK] [^111vWshC] [^112xfTyX].

> I need to ensure clear response criteria: a meaningful early response would include TSAT rising above 20% and stable or increasing hemoglobin; failure to improve TSAT or a hemoglobin decline despite adherence should prompt early escalation planning given the malabsorption risk [^112xfTyX].

> Hold on, I should verify IV iron indications and first-trimester safety: escalate to parenteral iron if oral iron is not tolerated, not absorbed, or ineffective after a short trial, or if anemia becomes moderate to severe or time is short; most guidance advises avoiding IV iron in the first trimester if possible due to limited developmental safety data, with greater comfort using agents such as ferric carboxymaltose or derisomaltose after 12 weeks, noting the ferric derisomaltose label advises avoiding first-trimester use when alternatives exist [^116HGRXx] [^116if1iK] [^116ra1zg] [^114Rrkbt].

> Let me outline second-trimester adjustments: as iron needs rise, treatment doses often increase to 60–120 mg elemental iron daily for IDA if tolerated, with a low threshold to switch to IV iron if absorption remains inadequate; repeat labs around 20–24 weeks and again at 24–28 weeks to maintain hemoglobin near or above trimester-specific targets, implementing standardized anemia protocols where available [^116if1iK] [^111vWshC] [^117RgxGp].

> Next, I should review late-pregnancy planning: intensify surveillance in the third trimester, aim to avoid hemoglobin < 10.5 g/dL approaching delivery, and schedule IV iron early if oral therapy underperforms to reduce transfusion risk near term in this high-risk, post-bariatric context [^112851YH] [^116HGRXx].

> I will now examine broader micronutrient risks: concurrent deficits in B12, folate, vitamin D, thiamine, zinc, and copper are more common after bariatric surgery, so a comprehensive micronutrient panel and dietitian-guided supplementation are appropriate parts of care, alongside a bariatric-appropriate prenatal multivitamin regimen [^1147gEAP] [^112rka4m].

> But wait, what about symptom management and adherence? To enhance iron absorption, take doses away from calcium, coffee, or tea and consider vitamin C if tolerated; if nausea and vomiting of pregnancy worsen with iron, short-term use of lower-iron or iron-free prenatal alternatives may improve tolerability while therapeutic iron is timed separately, with careful follow-up to ensure repletion [^111ydfYN] [^1179pkEq].

> Hold on, I should verify screening recommendations variability: although the USPSTF cites insufficient evidence for routine screening to improve hard outcomes, obstetric societies recommend universal anemia screening and iron supplementation policies, and this patient's high-risk post-bariatric status justifies proactive testing and treatment despite the USPSTF uncertainty [^115AkUP8] [^116if1iK].

> Finally, I need to ensure coordinated care: involve maternal-fetal medicine for high-risk pregnancy management, communicate with the bariatric surgery team for operative details affecting malabsorption, and integrate obstetrics and nutrition services to align monitoring, supplementation, and IV iron readiness if needed [^1147gEAP].

> In summary, I should confirm that this is functional iron deficiency in early pregnancy after bariatric surgery, where a TSAT of 15% with ferritin 65 mcg/L is a red flag for impending anemia; initiate optimized oral iron with early reassessment, maintain aggressive surveillance, and escalate to IV iron after organogenesis if oral therapy fails or intolerance/malabsorption is evident to protect maternal and fetal outcomes [^112xfTyX] [^116if1iK] [^116ra1zg] [^114Rrkbt].

This patient has **functional iron deficiency** (TSAT 15% with ferritin 65 µg/L) in early pregnancy after bariatric surgery, reflecting inadequate iron supply despite normal stores [^112xfTyX] [^111CX2fR]. Begin **oral ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily** with vitamin C, separate from calcium and PPIs; if not tolerated or if Hb < 10.5 g/dL, use IV iron (prefer ferric carboxymaltose or iron sucrose) [^111ydfYN]. Monitor CBC, ferritin, and TSAT every 4–6 weeks, and maintain ferritin > 30 µg/L and TSAT > 20% [^112xfTyX] [^11541yGz]. Coordinate care with obstetrics, bariatric surgery, and nutrition to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes.

## Clinical significance of iron saturation and ferritin levels

- **Iron saturation (TSAT)**: TSAT < 20% indicates functional iron deficiency, where iron supply is inadequate despite normal or elevated ferritin [^112xfTyX] [^111CX2fR].

- **Ferritin**: Ferritin 30–100 µg/L with TSAT < 20% suggests possible iron deficiency or depletion, especially with inflammation or recent surgery [^112xfTyX].

- **Pregnancy-specific considerations**: Pregnancy increases iron demand, and bariatric surgery heightens deficiency risk due to reduced intake and absorption [^112rka4m].

---

## Recommended management strategies

### Initial assessment and monitoring

For initial assessment and monitoring, the **baseline laboratory evaluation** should include CBC, ferritin, TSAT, CRP, vitamin B12, folate, and vitamin D. Regular monitoring entails rechecking **CBC, ferritin, and TSAT every 4–6 weeks** to guide therapy and detect emerging anemia.

---

### Iron supplementation

#### Oral iron supplementation (first-line therapy)

- **Preferred formulation**: Ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg elemental iron) once daily, taken with vitamin C to enhance absorption [^113oF832].

- **Administration guidelines**: Take on an empty stomach or with vitamin C; separate from calcium, PPIs, and antacids to improve absorption.

- **Tolerability**: If GI side effects occur, use alternate-day dosing or switch to ferrous fumarate or gluconate [^113oF832].

---

#### Intravenous iron supplementation (second-line therapy)

- **Indications**: Use if oral iron is not tolerated, not absorbed, or if Hb < 10.5 g/dL with persistent low TSAT.

- **Preferred formulations**: Ferric carboxymaltose or iron sucrose; avoid ferric derisomaltose in the first trimester due to limited safety data [^116ra1zg].

- **Safety considerations**: IV iron is generally safe in pregnancy, but monitor for hypersensitivity reactions.

---

### Multidisciplinary care

A **team-based approach** coordinates obstetric, bariatric, and nutrition care to ensure adequate supplementation, monitor weight gain, and address deficiencies [^112rka4m]. Dietary counseling should emphasize **iron-rich foods** and strategies to enhance absorption.

---

## Potential maternal and fetal risks

### Maternal risks

Maternal risks include an increased likelihood of **anemia** with fatigue and impaired quality of life, a higher risk of postpartum anemia and transfusion, and a greater risk of multiple micronutrient deficiencies.

---

### Fetal risks

Fetal risks include an increased likelihood of low birth weight, small-for-gestational-age infants, and preterm delivery, with potential for **impaired neurodevelopment** due to fetal iron deficiency.

---

## Recommended follow-up and monitoring

Regular laboratory monitoring includes **CBC, ferritin, and TSAT every 4–6 weeks**. Clinical monitoring should track maternal symptoms, fetal growth, and overall pregnancy progress. Postpartum follow-up should continue monitoring and supplementation to restore iron stores and prevent anemia.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Parameter** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Iron supplementation | - Ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily with vitamin C <br/> - Consider IV iron if oral not tolerated or Hb < 10.5 g/dL |
| Monitoring | - CBC <br/> - Ferritin <br/> - TSAT every 4–6 weeks |
| Multidisciplinary care | - Obstetrician <br/> - Bariatric surgeon <br/> - Nutritionist |

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of anemia in chronic kidney disease, specifically concerning diagnostic criteria, the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend considering the use of a transferrin saturation below 20% along with a normal or elevated ferritin level to define functional iron deficiency. This applies to patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD or those maintained on peritoneal dialysis, as well as those receiving hemodialysis. It is crucial to recognize that normal or high serum ferritin values do not exclude iron deficiency, as they could be due to other causes such as infection or inflammation.

### Anemia in pregnancy: ACOG practice bulletin, number 233 [^116if1iK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the use of ferrous sulfate PO in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it is generally acceptable for use. Maternal anemia increases the risk of low birth weight, premature delivery, and impaired cognitive and behavioral development. The ACOG recommends screening all pregnant women for anemia with a CBC in the first trimester and again at 24–28 weeks of gestation. Low-dose iron supplementation is recommended starting in the first trimester to reduce the prevalence of maternal anemia at delivery. Oral iron preparations are the preferred first-line treatment for iron deficiency in pregnancy.

### Oral iron supplementation: New formulations, old questions [^111ydfYN]. Haematologica (2024). High credibility.

Iron-deficiency anemia and pre-anemic iron deficiency are among the most frequent pathologies. The first line of treatment involves oral iron supplementation. The simplest, least expensive, and most commonly prescribed drug is ferrous sulfate; however, other ferrous salts and ferric complexes with polysaccharides or succinylated milk proteins are also widely used.

In recent years, novel iron formulations have been developed, such as the lipophilic iron donor ferric maltol and nanoparticle encapsulated sucrosomial® iron. Oral iron supplementation is generally efficacious in correcting iron-deficiency anemia and replenishing iron stores, but it can cause gastrointestinal side effects that reduce compliance. When oral iron supplementation is contraindicated, intravenous iron therapy can rapidly achieve therapeutic targets without gastrointestinal complications. We critically review literature on the relative efficacy and tolerability of currently available oral iron supplements and summarize recent data on optimal dosage and frequency.

### Screening for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy: A structured review and gap analysis against UK national screening criteria [^115ZNouK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

The test should be simple, safe, precise, and validated for screening. In clinical practice, low haemoglobin and low mean cell volume are widely used indicators to identify iron deficiency anaemia. However, these indicators are not specific and may also be present in other conditions such as thalassaemia trait and chronic disease. WHO/CDC technical guidance, based on systematic review evidence, suggests that in the absence of infections, serum ferritin or serum transferrin receptor in combination with haemoglobin provides the best approach to measuring iron status in general populations. Despite this guidance, serum transferrin receptor is not widely available or used in clinical practice in many countries.

A formal study is underway to assess the accuracy of diagnostic tests for iron deficiency. This includes research to determine the diagnostic accuracy of erythrocyte indices and ferritin in predicting therapeutic responsiveness to oral iron therapy during pregnancy. Recent advances in the understanding of iron metabolism may lead to new screening test options. Hepcidin, a novel peptide hormone that decreases in iron deficiency, facilitates iron uptake from the small intestine. Low hepcidin levels could potentially be used to predict the absorption response of oral iron. An additional benefit of using hepcidin as an indicator is that, unlike ferritin, low hepcidin levels indicating iron deficiency are not affected by inflammation.

### Optimizing diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in women and girls of reproductive age: Clinical opinion [^116dVjra]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) is the world's most common disorder and one of the top five causes of years lived with disability. Whereas low serum ferritin is diagnostic of ID, ferritin — an acute phase reactant — may be elevated in inflammatory states and the first trimester of pregnancy even if ID exists. Consequently, in early pregnancy or chronic inflammation, percent transferrin saturation (TSAT) measurement is the best indicator of iron status. Unfortunately, guidelines do not recommend routine screening for ID in either pregnant or nonpregnant women in the absence of anemia. This circumstance should be urgently reviewed based on available data.

While oral formulations have long been the standard for iron replacement therapy and are widely available and inexpensive, oral iron is frequently associated with adverse gastrointestinal effects for the majority. This is a major reason for poor adherence, inadequate repletion, and persisting ID symptoms and sequelae. Although safe intravenous iron administration was introduced in the mid-1950s, formulations with cores binding the elemental iron more tightly became available in the 2000s. These allow complete and safe replacement, even in a single setting. Prospectively acquired neonatology evidence reports oral iron's failure to reach the developing fetus when the mother is iron deficient. Consequently, while oral iron remains frontline in the first trimester because of insufficient safety data for intravenous iron, the author recommends that the intravenous route should be the gold standard for second-trimester ID when hemoglobin concentration.

In conclusion, to prevent unintended pregnancy pre-operatively, patients of reproductive age should be provided appropriate referrals and counseled by a family planning physician on each contraceptive method's risks, benefits, and alternatives, and have a plan in place prior to surgery. Pregnancy should be excluded confidently on the day of surgery using a reliable and sensitive test. In the case of pregnancy and a woman's desire to continue it, close monitoring of maternal-fetal wellbeing is necessary.

### Sex, lies, and iron deficiency: a call to change ferritin reference ranges [^115PFf6Y]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2023). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is a very common and treatable disorder. Of all the tests available to diagnose iron deficiency, serum ferritin is the most capable of discriminating iron deficiency from other disorders. However, the reference range for ferritin in many laboratories leads to the underdiagnosis of iron deficiency in women. Studies have shown that 30%-50% of healthy women have no marrow iron stores, so basing ferritin cutoffs on the lowest 2.5% of sampled ferritins is not appropriate. Additionally, several lines of evidence suggest that the physiological ferritin cutoff is 50 ng/mL. Work is needed to establish more realistic ferritin ranges to avoid underdiagnosing a readily treatable disorder.

### The benefits and harms of oral iron supplementation in non-anaemic pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115gmg3w]. Family Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency during pregnancy poses a significant risk to both maternal and fetal health. International guidelines provide discrepant advice on antenatal iron supplementation for non-anaemic women.

- **Objective**: We aimed to quantify the benefits and harms of routine antenatal supplementation in non-anaemic women.

- **Methods**: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and clinical trial registries were searched for randomized controlled trials and observational studies comparing oral iron supplementation with placebo or no supplement in non-anaemic pregnant women. Risk of bias was assessed for each study, and the results were synthesized via meta-analysis.

- **Results**: Twenty-three eligible studies were identified with 4,492 non-anaemic pregnant women. Supplemented groups had higher haemoglobin [mean difference = 6.95 g/l, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.81–9.09, P < .001, moderate certainty, I² = 91%] and ferritin (mean difference = 12.22 ng/ml, 95% CI: 6.92–17.52, P < .001, moderate certainty, I² = 87%) and were at lower risk of anaemia (relative risk = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.34–0.74, P < .001, high certainty, I² = 42%, number needed to treat (NNT) = 10). There was no difference in birth weight, preterm birth, and rate of caesarean section. Reporting on harms was inconsistent and there was insufficient evidence to determine an association between iron supplements and any negative outcome.

- **Discussion**: Prophylactic iron supplementation likely results in a large reduction in maternal anaemia during pregnancy. Future research should qualify the impact of this benefit on women's quality of life.

### Longitudinal evaluation of iron status during pregnancy: A prospective cohort study in a high-resource setting [^114DNyf7]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Iron deficiency affects a large proportion of pregnant women worldwide, posing potentially serious consequences for perinatal and infant outcomes. However, well-powered, comprehensive analyses of longitudinal iron status during pregnancy are scarce.

- **Objectives**: This study aimed to evaluate the longitudinal changes in iron biomarkers across pregnancy and prevalence of iron deficiency in primiparous women in a high-resource setting. Additionally, it sought to propose early pregnancy iron status cutoffs that predict iron deficiency in the third trimester.

- **Methods**: In a prospective cohort of primiparous women with low-risk, singleton pregnancies in Ireland, iron biomarkers [ferritin, soluble transferrin receptors (sTfR), total body iron (TBI)] and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, α-glycoprotein) were measured at three study visits: 15, 20, and 33 weeks of gestation. Women with anemia (hemoglobin < 11.0 g/dL) were excluded. For this group, iron deficiency defined by sTfR > 4.4 mg/L generated similar prevalence data as ferritin < 15 μg/L, at 7.2%, 12.6%, and 60.9% for each visit, respectively. Using TBI of less than 0 mg/kg, deficiency rates were lower than using ferritin or sTfR (P < 0.001). A cutpoint analysis method was employed.

### Retrospective audit compares screening and treatment of pregnancy-related anaemia in regional New South Wales with Australian guidelines [^113YqMjQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

Treatment involved both oral and intravenous iron supplementation.

Figure 4 illustrates iron supplementation recommendations versus prescription rates. In the first trimester, 67.4% were advised to take oral iron due to low ferritin or hemoglobin (Hb), a drop of more than 15 g/L in Hb, or previous postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). However, only 37% were prescribed iron. In the third trimester, less than half of the recommended women received prescriptions. Intravenous (IV) iron was recommended for 10.2% but was prescribed in about 14.4% of cases.

- **Iron prescription rates**: Figure 4 shows iron prescription rates compared to recommended guidelines. 42% received prescribed oral iron, while 6.0% either didn't require it based on guidelines or lacked documented screening. Additionally, 9.3% received intravenous infusions, despite guidelines suggesting otherwise or lacking screening. In the third trimester, 10.2% were recommended intravenous iron due to non-response, intolerance, or non-compliance with oral therapy, with 58.3% completing the infusion.

- **Compliance with treatments**: Out of 51 women prescribed oral iron during pregnancy, only 7.8% (n = 4) had documented records of medication tolerance and compliance. Among these, 3 reported non-compliance: 2 forgot to take the medication, 1 discontinued use due to constipation, while another reported constipation but continued using the supplement. None reported immediate adverse effects, and all completed their infusion successfully.

- **Postpartum complications**: PPH occurred in 40 women (26.7%), with 85% (n = 34) during vaginal deliveries.

### Management of prepregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum obesity from the FIGO pregnancy and non-communicable diseases committee: A FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) guideline [^1147gEAP]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Low credibility.

As discussed previously, women with a history of bariatric surgery are at risk of myriad vitamin and mineral deficiencies during pregnancy and are at higher risk of pregnancy complications. They should therefore have appropriate nutritional and other surveillance during pregnancy and receive consultant-led care where possible. They should also receive sufficient nutritional care, including supplementation appropriate for their specific needs, and may benefit from dietetic support where available.

- **Recommendation B.3**: All women with obesity should be advised of the risk of obesity and excess gestational weight gain on pregnancy, childbirth, and long-term health, including the risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) for them and their children.

Recent evidence suggests that nearly a quarter (23.9%) of the risk of any pregnancy complication can be attributed to maternal overweight or obesity. In LMICs, the population-attributable risk of overweight and obesity to gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, and pre-eclampsia is between 14%–35%. Women with obesity should receive accurate and accessible information on the risks associated with obesity in pregnancy and the options for managing these risks.

Risks to the mother of obesity during pregnancy include cardiometabolic disease (gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy), sepsis, venous thromboembolism, stillbirth, preterm delivery, large-for-gestational-age infant, and obstructive sleep apnea. For the fetus, they include congenital anomalies or adverse birth outcomes, including infant death.

### Physiologically based trimester-specific serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency in US pregnant women [^113kAJDa]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

- **Figure 1**: Flowchart of the selection of a healthy sample of pregnant women (15–49 years) participating in the NHANES 1999 to 2010 and 2015 to 2018. Pregnant women with an SF > 150 μg/L were excluded from the healthy sample because of an increased risk of iron overload. Total and by each trimester (first, second, third, and unknown).

- **Statistical analysis**: We first log-transformed SF (log10[ferritin]) data to normalize the distributions, calculated geometric means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and described the SF distributions by characteristics. We described the SF distributions (geometric means, 50th [median], 5th, and 95th percentiles) for survey cycle, age groups, trimesters, parities, racial/ethnic groups, education, and family income. For the basic characteristics, SF distribution analysis and prevalence estimates, we used SUDAAN (version 11.0.1; Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) with sample examination weights (2-year examination weights to calculate the overall weight across the years 1999 to 2010 and 2015 to 2018) and design variables to account for the complex sample design. We calculated both crude and adjusted geometric means for SF, and we used multiple linear regression models for the calculation of adjusted mean SF. A Bonferroni adjustment was used to correct the P-values for the significance test for multiple comparisons across each sociodemographic characteristic in SF.

### Identification and management of preoperative anaemia in adults: A British Society for Haematology guideline update [^112SyKaQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

In perioperative care, particularly concerning the management of preoperative anemia thresholds, the BSH 2024 guidelines recommend viewing ferritin levels below 30 mcg/L as the threshold for absolute iron depletion or deficiency that is likely to benefit from iron supplementation.

### Physiologically based trimester-specific serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency in US pregnant women [^115ZQmSM]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

These changes in the serum ferritin (SF) physiological thresholds for iron deficiency (ID) track those of hepcidin, the iron-regulatory hormone that controls the mobilization of iron stores. The molecular mechanisms underlying the suppression of hepcidin during the second and third trimesters have not been characterized but have been suggested to be of placental origin. Hepcidin was not measured during the NHANES surveys, but the pattern of changes during pregnancy is well described. During the first trimester, the mean hepcidin concentration remains relatively unchanged from prepregnancy levels because early minor increases with the cessation of menstruation are offset by later decreases with the acceleration of erythropoiesis and of fetal and placental growth. During the second and third trimesters, mean hepcidin concentrations plummet to similar nadirs. The physiologically based SF thresholds for ID parallel the behavior of hepcidin concentrations, not differing from prepregnancy values during the first trimester and then declining to similar concentrations in the second and third trimesters. Comparable parallels are found between SF thresholds for ID and hepcidin levels because both increase when comparing children with nonpregnant women.

Both the epidemiological evaluation of iron status in pregnancy and clinical management are currently hindered by the substantial variation in SF thresholds to define ID. As noted above, the WHO 2020 guidelines (first trimester only) and the CDC 1998 guidelines recommend SF ≤ 15 μg/L as the threshold for ID in pregnancy.

### Anemia during pregnancy after silastic ring Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: Influence of time to conception [^114pSNSG]. Obesity Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Bariatric surgery before pregnancy may help prevent obesity-related gestational complications. However, maternal malnutrition is not without potential risks during pregnancy. The objective was to evaluate the influence of time to conception after silastic ring Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (SRYGB) on maternal anemia.

- **Methods**: Patients who underwent SRYGB for morbid obesity and who subsequently became pregnant were followed up at the prenatal stage. Thirty pregnancies occurred between July 2001 and September 2009. The patients were analyzed according to time to conception after bariatric surgery: 17 patients with time to conception < 4 years (48 months) and 13 patients with ≥ 4 years.

- **Results**: First trimester hemoglobin levels were significantly lower in patients with time to conception ≥ 4 years (median 9.6 g/dL, range 5.8–13.2 g/dL) than in patients with time to conception < 4 years (median 11.1 g/dL, range 9.8–13.6 g/dL; p = 0.047). The need for intravenous iron therapy or packed red cell transfusion was significantly more frequent among women who became pregnant ≥ 4 years after SRYGB compared to < 4 years (30.8% vs. 0%, p = 0.026).

- **Conclusion**: Pregnancy after 4 years of SRYGB is associated with maternal anemia and the need for more strict iron supplementation.

We studied longitudinal data on haematinics in 353 patients, comprised of 257 (72.8%) women. The mean (standard error of the mean) age was 46.0 (0.56) years, and BMI was 53.1 (0.38) kg/m² at baseline. Among the participants, 129 (36.5%) patients had type 2 diabetes. Additionally, 252 patients (71.4%) had undergone gastric bypass (GB), and 101 (28.6%) had undergone sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Women had significantly lower ferritin, iron, and haemoglobin levels compared to men at baseline.

- **Baseline characteristics of participants by sex and type of primary bariatric surgery**: Values are reported as mean (standard error of the mean).

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^113o74P7]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

Iron-deficiency anemia and pre-anemic iron deficiency are among the most frequent pathologies. The first line of treatment involves oral iron supplementation. The simplest, least expensive, and most commonly prescribed drug is ferrous sulfate, while other ferrous salts and ferric complexes with polysaccharides or succinylated milk proteins are also widely used.

In recent years, novel iron formulations have been developed, such as the lipophilic iron donor ferric maltol and nanoparticle encapsulated sucrosomial® iron. Oral iron supplementation is usually efficacious in correcting iron-deficiency anemia and replenishing iron stores but causes gastrointestinal side effects that reduce compliance. When oral iron supplementation is contraindicated, intravenous iron therapy can rapidly achieve therapeutic targets without gastrointestinal complications.

Herein, we critically review literature on the relative efficacy and tolerability of currently available oral iron supplements and summarize recent data on optimal dosage and frequency.

### Becoming pregnant within the first year after bariatric surgery adversely affects postoperative weight loss [^114V5j5X]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Approximately 80% of the patients undergoing bariatric surgery are female, with half of them undergoing surgery during their reproductive years. Most guidelines recommend that women wait at least 12 months after surgery before becoming pregnant. No previous studies have investigated whether becoming pregnant in the first or second year after surgery affects weight loss.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this study was to assess whether pregnancy within the first or second year after bariatric surgery affects weight loss up to 5 years after surgery.

- **Setting**: A single institution.

- **Methods**: This study is a retrospective study of women who underwent primary bariatric surgery between 2012 and 2016. Weight outcomes were measured until 5 years after surgery. A linear mixed model was used to assess the effect of the time between surgery and conception in groups on the basis of percentage total weight loss.

- **Results**: A total of 55 patients undergoing a primary bariatric procedure was included. Forty-seven women underwent a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (85.5%), and 8 underwent a sleeve gastrectomy (14.5%). The median time between surgery and estimated conception was 22 months (range: 0–51 months). Women who became pregnant between 12 and 24 months after bariatric surgery (n = 18) and women who became pregnant after 24 months (n = 24) had significantly more weight loss (β = 3.95, P = 0.020, and β = 4.09, P = 0.024, respectively) than women who became pregnant within 12 months after bariatric surgery (n = 12).

Our results suggest that pregnancy within 12 months after…

### Haemoglobin and hematinic status before and after bariatric surgery over 4 years of follow-up [^113T2sjP]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Bariatric surgery is associated with deficiencies of vitamins and minerals, and patients are routinely advised to take supplements postoperatively. We studied the prevalence of vitamin B12, folate, and iron deficiencies, as well as anemia, before and after bariatric surgery over 4 years of follow-up.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 353 people with obesity, including 257 (72.8%) women, who underwent gastric bypass (252, 71.4%) or sleeve gastrectomy (101, 28.6%) at our National Health Service bariatric center in Northwest England.

- **Results**: At baseline, the mean (standard error) age was 46.0 (0.6) years and body mass index was 53.1 (0.4) kg/m². Serum vitamin B12 was 400.2 (16.4) pg/L, folate was 7.7 (0.2) μg/L, iron was 12.0 (0.3) μmol/L, ferritin was 118.3 (8.4) μg/L, and hemoglobin was 137.9 (0.8) g/L. The frequency of low vitamin B12 levels reduced from 7.5% preoperatively to 2.3% at 48 months (P < 0.038). Mean folate levels increased from baseline to 48 months by 5.3 μg/L (P < 0.001), but the frequency of low folate levels increased from 4.7% preoperatively to 10.3% (P < 0.048). Ferritin levels increased from baseline to 48 months by 51.3 μg/L (P < 0.009). The frequency of low ferritin levels was greater in women (39.1%) than in men (8.9%) at baseline (P < 0.001) and throughout the study period. Hemoglobin was low in 4.6% of all patients at baseline with no significant change over the study period.

- **Conclusion**: There were notable rates of hematinic insufficiencies in bariatric surgical candidates preoperatively. Our study lends further support to regular supplementation with vitamin B12.

### Management of prepregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum obesity from the FIGO Pregnancy and Non-Communicable Diseases Committee: A FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) guideline [^11274yKZ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Low credibility.

Obesity influences many body systems. The preconception period is an ideal time to assess and manage conditions that could influence the health of the mother and fetus during pregnancy. According to the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC), baseline preconception health screening in women with obesity, where available and indicated, could include renal, liver, and thyroid function, lipids, and diabetes screen. Additional considerations include cardiovascular health (e.g. blood pressure, echocardiogram) and pulmonary function tests (including sleep apnea where relevant). For further information, see the FIGO position paper on preconception health.

- **Recommendation A.3**: All women with obesity should be encouraged to lose weight through diet and adopting a healthy lifestyle, including moderate physical activity. If indicated and available, other weight management interventions might be considered, including bariatric surgery.

Women should be encouraged to enter pregnancy with a BMI < 30 and ideally in the healthy range. There is evidence that preconception weight loss, achieved through one or more nonsurgical or surgical interventions, has the potential to improve maternal health and reduce the risk of pregnancy complications, even when the weight loss is small. Losing weight before pregnancy can have positive effects, such as reduced risk of obesity in children and improved fertility.

A realistic target is weight loss generally considered to be 5%–10% of original body weight over a period of 6 months.

### Aurora: Bariatric surgery registration in women of reproductive age - a multicenter prospective cohort study [^113fvGWp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Inclusion is possible at four different time points: 1) before surgery, 2) after surgery, 3) at the beginning of pregnancy, and 4) in the immediate postpartum period (day 3–4). The bariatric surgeon and team are responsible for recruitment before and after surgery. Fertility specialists and obstetricians providing preconception care assist with the recruitment of non-pregnant women with a history of bariatric surgery. Recruitment at the beginning of pregnancy is done by obstetricians and midwives at the participating centers. Recruitment of lactating women with previous bariatric surgery is done by researchers and midwives at the maternity units.

The exact scheme of data collection depends on the time of inclusion as summarized below:

- **Data collection scheme**: A total of five measuring moments are foreseen for a woman being recruited before surgery. Four additional measuring moments are foreseen in a subsequent pregnancy and two measuring moments in the postpartum period. A maximum follow-up of 11 measuring points is aimed for when recruiting a woman before surgery and following her until a subsequent pregnancy and six-month postpartum period, amounting to a follow-up duration of approximately two and a half years. Women recruited at the start of pregnancy have a total of six measuring moments, corresponding to a follow-up duration of one to one and a half years.

Women who gave birth within UZ Leuven are given the opportunity to investigate the macronutrient content of their breast milk.

### Iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy [^117Vr9jF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a low red blood cell count, a low hematocrit, or a low hemoglobin concentration. In pregnancy, a hemoglobin concentration of less than 11.0 g/dL in the first trimester and less than 10.5 or 11.0 g/dL in the second or third trimester (depending on the guideline used) is considered anemia. Anemia is the most common hematologic abnormality in pregnancy. Maternal anemia is associated with adverse fetal, neonatal, and childhood outcomes, but causality is not established. Maternal anemia increases the likelihood of transfusion at delivery. Besides hemodilution, iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in pregnancy.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends screening for anemia with a complete blood count in the first trimester and again at 24 0/7 to 28 6/7 weeks of gestation. Mild anemia, with a hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL or higher and a mildly low or normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV), is likely iron deficiency anemia. A trial of oral iron can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Mild anemia with a very low MCV, macrocytic anemia, moderate anemia (hemoglobin 7.0–9.9 g/dL), or severe anemia (hemoglobin 4.0–6.9 g/dL) requires further investigation.

Once a diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed, first-line treatment is oral iron. New evidence suggests that intermittent dosing is as effective as daily or twice-daily dosing with fewer side effects. For patients with iron deficiency anemia who cannot tolerate, cannot absorb, or do not respond to oral iron, intravenous iron is preferred.

### Implementation of a protocol for management of antepartum iron deficiency anemia: a prospective cohort study [^117RgxGp]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2022). Low credibility.

In randomized trials, antepartum intravenous iron sucrose is effective at improving predelivery hemoglobin in iron deficiency anemia. Yet, there is a gap between this knowledge and its implementation into care.

- **Objective**: We aimed to determine if the implementation of a standardized protocol for the management of antepartum anemia outside of a clinical trial improves intravenous iron sucrose utilization and clinical outcomes.

- **Study design**: We performed a prospective cohort study evaluating the incorporation of an anemia protocol into routine clinical care for women with antepartum hemoglobin < 11.0 g/dL. Our protocol, developed with multidisciplinary stakeholders, included (1) serial third-trimester hemoglobin assessment, (2) oral iron supplementation for antepartum hemoglobin 9.5–11 g/dL, and (3) antepartum intravenous iron sucrose use (300 mg weekly for 3 weeks) for hemoglobin < 9.5 g/dL. We compared 6-months preimplementation (January 2018 to June 2018) to 6-months postimplementation (January 2019 to June 2019). The outcomes evaluated were antepartum intravenous iron sucrose utilization, the number of intravenous iron sucrose dosages, predelivery hemoglobin, and blood transfusion.

- **Results**: A total of 1423 women were included (pre = 778; post = 645) without significant baseline differences. The antepartum hemoglobin nadir was no different between the groups (pre: 10.2; interquartile range [9.6–10.6] vs. post: 10.2; interquartile range [9.6–10.6]; p = 0.77). The implementation of a standardized protocol for the management of antepartum anemia was associated with 80% increase.

### Suboptimal iron deficiency screening in pregnancy and the impact of socioeconomic status in a high-resource setting [^1114sSmG]. Blood Advances (2021). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) anemia in pregnancy is associated with poor maternal and childhood outcomes, yet ferritin testing, the standard test for ID, is not considered part of routine prenatal bloodwork in Canada. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 44,552 pregnant patients with prenatal testing at community laboratories in Ontario, Canada, to determine the prevalence of ferritin testing over five years. Secondary objectives were to determine the prevalence and severity of ID and to identify clinical and demographic variables that influence the likelihood of ID screening.

A total of 59.4% of patients had a ferritin checked during pregnancy; 71.4% were ordered in the first trimester, when the risk of ID is lowest. Excluding patients with abnormally elevated ferritins, 25.2% were iron insufficient (30–44 µg/L) and 52.8% were iron deficient (≤ 29 µg/L) at least once in pregnancy. A total of 8.3% were anemic (hemoglobin < 105 g/L). The proportion of anemic patients with a subsequent ferritin test in pregnancy ranged from 22% to 67% in the lowest and highest anemia severity categories, respectively.

Lower annual household income was negatively associated with the odds of a ferritin test. Compared with those in the fifth (i.e. highest) income quintile, the odds of ferritin testing for patients in the first, second, and fourth quintiles were 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.74–0.91), 0.82 (95% CI, 0.74–0.91), and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.77–0.97), respectively. These data highlight gaps in prenatal care and issues of health equity that warrant harmonization of obstetrical guidelines to improve outcomes.

### Intermittent oral iron supplementation during pregnancy [^117E4iu3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Anaemia is a frequent condition during pregnancy, particularly among women in low- and middle-income countries. Traditionally, gestational anaemia has been prevented with daily iron supplements throughout pregnancy. However, adherence to this regimen has been limited due to side effects, interrupted supply of the supplements, and concerns about safety among women with an adequate iron intake. Intermittent supplementation (i.e. two or three times a week on non-consecutive days) has been proposed as an alternative to daily supplementation.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of intermittent supplementation with iron alone or in combination with folic acid or other vitamins and minerals to pregnant women on neonatal and pregnancy outcomes.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 July 2015), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (31 July 2015), and contacted relevant organisations for the identification of ongoing and unpublished studies (31 July 2015).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised or quasi-randomised trials.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We assessed the methodological quality of trials using standard Cochrane criteria. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, and conducted checks for accuracy.

- **Main results**: This review includes 27 trials from 15 countries, but only 21 trials (with 5490 women) contributed data to the review. All studies compared daily versus intermittent iron supplementation.

### Physiologically based trimester-specific serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency in US pregnant women [^113gSjPj]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

A recent review highlighted the need for gestational age-specific reference intervals for appropriate clinical decision-making. The physiologically based method estimates the mean serum ferritin (SF) threshold concentrations for iron deficiency (ID) during each trimester of pregnancy.

After a clinically recognized pregnancy, the arrest of menstruation decreases iron losses to a basal level for much of the first trimester. Initially, a reduction in erythropoiesis may slightly reduce the circulating red blood cell mass and increase iron stores and hepcidin concentrations. In the latter portion of the first trimester, erythropoiesis starts to increase, fetal and placental growth accelerate, and plasma volume expansion begins. Over the entire first trimester, the mean SF does not change significantly from prepregnancy concentrations. The SF threshold for ID of about 25 μg/L is about the same as that for nonpregnant women of reproductive age.

During the second trimester, as fetal and placental growth increase, hepcidin concentrations are greatly decreased, allowing iron stores to be mobilized to support the steady expansion in the red blood cell mass. Despite the increased red blood cell mass, the circulating hemoglobin (Hb) concentration falls because of the greater proportional increase in plasma volume.

In the third trimester, fetal and placental growth, together with the expansion of the red blood cell mass and plasma volume, continue rising to a peak in the latter portion of the trimester. Hepcidin concentrations remain extremely decreased, allowing remaining iron stores to be used to meet the steadily increasing iron needs.

### Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose for anaemia in pregnancy [^114Rrkbt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is a common nutritional deficiency among women of childbearing age. Peri-partum iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with significant maternal, fetal, and infant morbidity. Options for treatment are limited: these include oral iron supplementation, which can be ineffective and poorly tolerated, and red blood cell transfusions, which carry an inherent risk and should be avoided. Ferric carboxymaltose is a new treatment option that may be better tolerated. The study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) correction with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose in pregnant women with mild, moderate, and severe anemia in the second and third trimester.

- **Methods**: Prospective observational study; 65 anemic pregnant women received ferric carboxymaltose up to 15 mg/kg between 24 and 40 weeks of pregnancy (median 35 weeks gestational age, SD 3.6). Treatment effectiveness was assessed by repeat hemoglobin (Hb) measurements and patient reports of well-being in the postpartum period. Safety was assessed by analysis of adverse drug reactions and fetal heart rate monitoring during the infusion.

- **Results**: Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose infusion significantly increased Hb values (p < 0.01) above baseline levels in all women. Increased Hb values were observed at 3 and 6 weeks post-infusion and up to 8 weeks post-infusion. Ferritin values increased significantly after the infusion. Only 4 women had repeat ferritin values post-partum which remained above baseline levels. Fetal heart rate monitoring did not indicate any issues.

### Lifestyle after bariatric surgery: A multicenter, prospective cohort study in pregnant women [^112KrBxF]. Obesity Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

To ensure a good pregnancy outcome after bariatric surgery, a healthy lifestyle and multidisciplinary prenatal follow-up are recommended. This prospective multicenter trial aimed to compare the diet quality and physical activity (PA) of pregnant women who have undergone bariatric surgery with lifestyle recommendations.

- **Methods**: Pregnant women (> 18 years, pre-pregnancy BMI 28 ± 6 kg/m², 39% nulliparae, 25% smokers) with a history of bariatric surgery were recruited and allocated into two groups according to surgery type: restrictive (N = 18) and bypass group (N = 31). One 7-day dietary record and one Kaiser questionnaire on PA were collected during the first and second trimester. Dietary quality was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index.

- **Results**: The diet quality did not change during pregnancy (restrictive group p = 0.050; bypass group p = 0.975) and was comparable between groups (first trimester p = 0.426; second trimester p = 0.937). During the first trimester, 15% of the pregnant women had a healthy diet quality, 82% had a diet that needed improvement, and 3% had a poor diet quality. This was independent of surgery type and was comparable in the second trimester (p = 0.525). No difference between groups was observed for PA level, but the PA level in the bypass group significantly decreased from the first to the second trimester (p = 0.033).

- **Conclusions**: Nutritional advice and lifestyle coaching in this high-risk population seem recommendable since only 15% of the pregnant women had a healthy diet quality, 25% were smoking at the beginning of pregnancy, and the rest require further focus to improve outcomes.

### Physiologically based serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency among women and children from Africa, Asia, Europe, and Central America: A multinational comparative study [^111tZ19f]. The Lancet Global Health (2025). High credibility.

The diagnosis of iron deficiency commonly relies on the measurement of serum ferritin concentrations. WHO guidelines identify serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency among healthy individuals of less than 15 μg/L for women and less than 12 μg/L for children under 5 years, based on expert opinion. We report thresholds for iron deficiency for apparently healthy non-pregnant women and young children based on physiological indicators.

- **Methods**: We performed secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from women (aged 15–49 years) and children (aged 6–59 months) from 12 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Central America using available surveys (2007–19). Using haemoglobin and soluble transferrin receptor concentrations as individual-level indicators of iron deficiency, we identified country-specific serum ferritin thresholds. We conducted multivariate meta-analysis using individual participant data to assess multinational heterogeneity and intercountry consistency.

- **Findings**: Data were collected from July 2007 to March 2019. A total of 18,251 individuals (13,864 women and 4,387 children) were included in the final analysis. The thresholds of pooled serum ferritin levels corresponding to the starting point of decline in circulating haemoglobin concentrations were 24.8 μg/L (95% CI, 24.4–25.2) for women and 22.1 μg/L (20.8–23.4) for children based on national survey data from 12 countries. The thresholds were consistent among countries (p for heterogeneity: women = 0.73, children = 0.43), but median serum ferritin concentrations and lower 5% reference ranges differed.

### Physiologically based trimester-specific serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency in US pregnant women [^116imVMA]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

In pregnant women, physiological ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency are approximately 25 μg/L in the first trimester and approximately 20 μg/L in the second and third trimesters. These physiologically identified ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency closely track concentrations of hepcidin, the iron-regulatory hormone.

### Effects of iron supplements on heme scavengers in pregnancy [^11254SAA]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

To address maternal anemia attributed to malnutrition and hemolytic events, pregnant women are routinely prescribed iron to meet the increased demands required by pregnancy. WHO guidelines recommend daily iron and folate to reduce anemia and poor pregnancy outcomes. However, there is controversy about iron supplementation, especially in malaria-endemic regions. Reports show that the effects of supplementation in pregnant women are inconsistent and may have negative side effects, including gastroenteritis, oxidative stress, and decreased absorption of nonheme iron. Although reports show both positive and negative maternal and neonatal outcomes, many clinical trials have failed to show clear agreement on the association between iron supplementation and birth outcomes in malaria-endemic areas.

These complications may be further exacerbated due to the clinical practice of presumptive iron supplementation without prior screening for ferritin levels in pregnant women. According to WHO, iron overload is defined as serum ferritin over 150 micrograms per liter and iron deficiency as under 15 micrograms per liter. Evaluating these levels before iron supplementation may be critical in assessing a pregnant woman's risk for parasite-associated adverse birth outcomes.

There is a growing body of evidence indicating that low iron stores may protect against plasmodial infection during pregnancy and that iron can paradoxically enhance parasitemia in pregnant women and children. Furthermore, iron supplementation may potentially lead to subsequent adverse birth and perinatal outcomes.

### Successful pregnancy and weight loss management in a woman unknowingly pregnant at the time of bariatric surgery: a case report [^11758d3i]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

A 35-year-old female with an initial weight of 103.4 kg and body mass index of 35.8 kg/m² was considered for bariatric surgery due to significant impairment of quality of life and failure of intensive lifestyle modification to maintain weight loss for 1 year. Her past medical history was notable for hypothyroidism, which was controlled with 0.5 mg of Levothyroxine daily. She did not have diabetes, hypertension, or any other obesity-related co-morbidities, except fatty liver grade 1 with an increased liver span of 18.3 cm found on abdominal ultrasonography. Nutritional evaluation, including micronutrient measurements, was unremarkable.

Her menstrual cycles had been regular, and she had no history of infertility. Her obstetric history was significant for one full-term pregnancy ended by an uncomplicated elective cesarean section 7 years ago, and one first-trimester spontaneous abortion 6 months ago. She was also found to have a negative serum β-hCG level 1 week before surgery.

She underwent successful and uncomplicated laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, creating a gastric tube over a 36-F bougie with the exclusion of 80% of the stomach, and was discharged on postoperative day two. She missed her first menses on the third week following surgery and was found to have positive serum β-hCG levels at that time. She discontinued oral hormonal contraceptives 3 months before surgery for personal reasons, and her last menstrual period was precisely 11 days before surgery. Retrospectively, she acknowledged a history of unprotected sexual intercourse 3 days before surgery.

### Maternal nutritional status and pregnancy outcomes post-bariatric surgery [^112rka4m]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

In a normal pregnancy, the requirements for vitamins and minerals such as folate, iron, vitamins B1, B6, B12, and fat-soluble vitamins are increased. Deficiencies may result if these micronutrients are not consumed adequately. Different types of bariatric surgeries result in varying levels of micronutrient deficiencies during pregnancy. For example, a study showed higher gestational anemia among women who underwent bariatric malabsorptive surgeries (e.g. RYGB) compared to restrictive surgeries (e.g. LSG).

Micronutrient supplementation is usually recommended to prevent deficiencies in post-bariatric surgery patients during pregnancy. In a retrospective study of 168 post-bariatric surgery pregnancies, three post-bariatric pregnant women were diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum, which increases the risk of malnutrition and the need for oral supplements.

Numerous studies showed that post-bariatric, pregnant women are more susceptible to developing anemia due to increased demand and inadequate intake. For instance, twenty-four women were grouped under the four bariatric surgeries they underwent; 69% developed anemia and had undergone malabsorptive bariatric surgery (e.g. RYGB and LSG with duodenojejunal bypass) compared to AGB and LSG.

Similarly, an observational study investigated 150 pregnancy outcomes of women who underwent three different bariatric surgeries: LSG, BPD, and RYGB. Among the 150 women, 24.2% developed anemia post-BPD and 15.6% post-RYGB pregnancy. A systematic review recently found an increased risk of anemia in these populations.

### Cost-effectiveness of ferritin screening thresholds for iron deficiency in reproductive-age women [^115xsKCn]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). High credibility.

We also recognize several limitations in our model. First, we do not account for states of increased iron demand throughout women's reproductive lifespan, namely pregnancy, where more than 80% of women have ferritin levels below 30 μg/L in the third trimester. We recognize that such states will bring about a concomitant increase in the risk of ID, particularly if needs are not met through either diet or additional supplementation. This represents an important avenue for future research, particularly given evidence of the detrimental fetal and maternal effects of ID in pregnancy despite the USPSTF finding insufficient justification for screening of asymptomatic pregnant persons.

Second, our model does not explore all possible formulations of iron supplementation for the treatment of ID, nor the clinical reality of heterogeneous treatment across both routes of administration with formulations differing in cost and administration. However, we chose commonly used oral and IV products in our dual base-case analyses.

Third, since no on-treatment specific utility data have been reported for women with ID undergoing iron supplementation using generic preference-based measures of health-related quality of life suitable for health economic analyses, we estimated the utility of the ID and perfect health states from a prospective cohort of Finnish women with ID without anemia, standardized for time period and geography using validated EQ-5D norms for US women. This was further addressed in extensive sensitivity and threshold analyses.

### SPL drug information for ferric derisomaltose [^116ra1zg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of ferric derisomaltose IV (also known as Monoferric) in pregnant patients during the first trimester, it is advised to avoid use. Evidence from animal studies indicates fetal harm. While published studies on intravenous iron use during pregnancy have not reported an association with adverse developmental outcomes, they cannot definitively establish or exclude a drug-related risk, as they were not designed to assess the risk of major birth defects. Untreated iron deficiency anemia (IDA) during pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes, such as postpartum anemia, and poses an increased risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight.

- **Animal studies**: Research involving iron complexes has shown teratogenic effects and embryocidal outcomes in non-iron depleted pregnant animals. Studies of iron isomaltoside administered during organogenesis resulted in adverse developmental outcomes, including structural abnormalities and embryofetal mortality, at doses ranging from 0.09 to 0.4 times the maximum recommended human dose.

Many cases of iron deficiency anemia in the first trimester can be treated with oral iron; therefore, it is advisable to consider restricting the use of this drug to the second or third trimester if the benefits outweigh the risks. Rare cases of fetal bradycardia have been observed with maternal hypersensitivity reactions. Ferric derisomaltose IV is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for medicines prescribed during pregnancy. This classification indicates that the drug has been administered to a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an observed increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects.

Women with obesity are more likely to have nutritional deficiencies, such as in vitamin D, iron, and vitamin B12, compared to women with lower BMIs. This may be due to reduced diet quality. Dietary advice for women with obesity before pregnancy should focus on achieving weight loss or preventing further weight gain through nutrient‐dense foods, following local dietary practices and guidelines that are appropriate for age, medical history, and other characteristics of the woman, such as dietary practices, allergies, intolerances, or other specific requirements. The specific foods to recommend will vary depending on national guidance, cultural practices, and other considerations. Detailed information on diet before conception can be found in the FIGO recommendations on adolescent, preconception, and maternal nutrition.

Due to insufficient safety data, medications and surgery for weight loss are not recommended around the time of conception, though they should be considered as part of the management of obesity in women who are planning a pregnancy in the future, especially for those with comorbidities and greater severity obesity. The degree of weight loss achievable with different interventions varies, and practitioners and pregnant women should be aware of this in managing expectations for weight management. Despite this, health benefits such as improved fertility are likely even with small amounts of weight loss, and therefore all weight loss should be encouraged, even when achieving a healthy BMI before pregnancy is not possible.

### From bariatric surgery to conception: The ideal timing to optimize fetal weight [^114PdP9x]. Obesity Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

- **Results**: From a total of 47 singleton pregnancies with complete follow-up, four (8.5%) resulted in spontaneous abortion and one (2.1%) in fetal demise at 30 weeks. Excluding these, we obtained a total of 42 pregnancies that led to 39 term births and 3 preterm births: 1 extremely preterm and 2 moderate to late preterm.

As presented in Table 1, the most common bariatric surgery procedures were Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (40.5%) and sleeve gastrectomy (38.1%), followed by adjustable gastric banding (AGB) (16.7%) and biliopancreatic diversion (4.8%). All patients were followed by an endocrinologist and received individualized supplementation with folic acid, iron, calcium, and vitamin D according to measured analytes. Additionally, 77.5% were also supplemented with multivitamins (68.2% of patients with restrictive procedures and 88.9% of patients with malabsorptive procedures).

Mean maternal age was 34.3 ± 4.5 years, and mean BMI at conception was 30.0 ± 5.5 kg/m². The mean BMI reduction from surgery to conception was 14.9 ± 7.4 kg/m², leading to a normal BMI at conception in 21.4% of the women, overweight in 28.6%, and obesity in 50.0% (33.3% class I, 11.9% class II, and 4.8% class III).

The time from bariatric surgery to conception (BSCI) ranged from a minimum of 4 to a maximum of 144 months. Six pregnancies (14.3%) were conceived within the first 12 months after bariatric surgery, six (14.3%) between 12 and 24 months, and 30 (71.4%) after more than 24 months.

Mean fetal birth weight was 3103 g (interquartile range [IQR] 2780–3361 g); 10 neonates were small for gestational age (SGA) (28.3%) and one was large for gestational age (LGA) (2.4%). All SGA neonates were born at term, with a median gestational age of 38 weeks (IQR 38–39 weeks) and a mean birth weight of 2.

### The contribution of iron deficiency to the risk of peripartum transfusion: a retrospective case control study [^111ai6GU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

At our institution, 70% of pregnant women had ferritin levels checked, and only 65% with documented iron deficiency were prescribed oral iron supplementation. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and World Health Organization (WHO) all recommend screening asymptomatic pregnant women for iron deficiency anemia (IDA) using serum hemoglobin and ferritin levels and endorse universal iron supplementation during pregnancy with a dose of 30–60 mg/day of elemental iron. In anemic women, they suggest increasing the dose to 60–120 mg/day of elemental iron.

A consensus statement from the Network for the Advancement of Patient Blood Management, Haemostasis, and Thrombosis (NATA) suggests daily oral iron (30–60 mg) supplementation in areas with a high prevalence of anemia in pregnancy and recommends screening for iron deficiency in all non-anemic women at risk of ID. The U.S. Preventative Task Force cites a lack of evidence to support routine screening or routine iron supplementation in pregnancy. Perhaps as a result of this ambiguity, less than one third of American obstetrician-gynecologists have been shown to provide routine iron supplementation to their pregnant patients.

The NATA consensus statement also supports considering intravenous iron in women with iron deficiency and hemoglobin levels < 80 g/L or in newly diagnosed IDA after 34 weeks' gestation. In our study patients, however, we noted a delay in the initiation of intravenous iron in pregnancy: three-quarters of intravenous iron was administered within 3 weeks of delivery, leaving little time for erythropoiesis to correct the red cell mass.

### Reevaluating optimal weight changes across the stages of pregnancy [^112nJhZb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

While the National Academy of Medicine, formerly known as the Institute of Medicine, recommends the optimum weight change in the second and third trimesters combined, the ideal weight change range per week according to trimesters remains unexplored.

- **Objective**: To determine the optimal rates of weight change per week that are associated with decreased adverse pregnancy outcomes for each trimester stratified by prepregnancy body mass index categories.

- **Study design**: This was a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study using data from the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be (2010–2014). Our exposure was the weight change per week, defined as weight change (kg) divided by gestational weeks interval. We examined weight change per week for each trimester: early pregnancy (early first trimester to second trimester); second trimester (second trimester to third trimester); and third trimester (third trimester to delivery). Our primary outcome was a composite of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preterm birth, spontaneous preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and stillbirth.

To explore potential nonlinear associations between pregnancy weight change and adverse pregnancy outcomes, we applied restricted cubic spline functions with five knots. We calculated adjusted relative risks with 95% confidence intervals using generalized linear models with Poisson distribution and robust error variance, controlling for confounders. We estimated adjusted relative risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes related to weight changes across different trimesters.

### Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose for anaemia in pregnancy [^114ht568]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

The data from this prospective case series is consistent with existing retrospective data that ferric carboxymaltose administration in the second and third trimester of pregnancy is likely to be safe and effective. In our study, ferric carboxymaltose successfully corrected IDA prior to delivery. The intervention prevented significant postpartum anaemia in all women, resulting in postpartum haemoglobin values higher than their pre-treatment antenatal values. Despite moderate to severe anaemia at presentation, labour-associated blood loss was tolerated well, resulting in low peripartum RBC transfusion rates. No serious adverse events were recorded. Well-being also improved for the majority of women after the infusion.

### Treatments for iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy [^1134doj3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia in pregnancy worldwide. Iron treatment can be administered orally, intramuscularly, or via intravenous injection. Alternatively, blood transfusions and recombinant erythropoietin are also utilized.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of different treatments for iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy (defined as haemoglobin less than 11 g/dl) on maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Specialised Register of Trials was searched. Date of last search: December 2000.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing treatments for iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The search identified 54 trials. Five trials, involving approximately 1,234 women, met the inclusion criteria. Trial quality was assessed, and study authors were contacted for additional information.

- **Main results**: Oral iron treatment in pregnancy was assessed in one small trial (n = 125), where it was compared with a placebo. This trial showed a reduction in the number of women with haemoglobins under 11 g/dl (odds ratio (OR) 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.24) and a greater mean haemoglobin level of 11.3 g/dl compared to 10.5 g/dl (weighted mean difference 0.80, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.98). However, there were no data on clinically relevant outcomes. When comparing different iron treatments, the intravenous (IV) route of administration was associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis (1 trial, n = 74). Iron dextran intramuscularly (IM) versus IV (n = 49) OR 0.13, 95%.

### Hematological variables and iron status in abdominoplasty after bariatric surgery [^115gHo9H]. Obesity Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Abdominoplasty, the treatment for abdominal wall deformity stemming from weight loss after bariatric surgery, can cause postoperative anemia. Moreover, bariatric surgery has been associated with iron deficiency, which by itself can compromise erythropoiesis. The objective of this research is to describe the development of anemia after postbariatric abdominoplasty.

- **Methods**: The study group consisted of 32 adult women who had received bariatric surgery. The treatment group included 20 patients who were undergoing postbariatric abdominoplasty, while the control group included 12 patients waiting for abdominoplasty. Values of hemoglobin, reticulocytes, iron, ferritin, and the transferrin saturation were obtained on the evening before abdominoplasty and during the first, fourth, and eighth postoperative weeks. Hemoglobin was measured at 48 hours.

- **Results**: Mean hemoglobin levels for the treatment group decreased from 12.98 to 10.8 g/dL after 48 hours, increased on day 7 to 11.53 g/dL, but did not increase further after day 7. The reticulocyte number increased in the first week. Serum iron and transferrin saturation index fell during the first week and remained low. Ferritin levels increased non-significantly from 29.77 to 37.24 ng/mL at week 1, then fell until they decreased to 16.44 ng/mL by day 56.

- **Conclusions**: As expected, hemoglobin fell after abdominoplasty. However, following a one-third recovery of hemoglobin concentrations by week 1 postoperative, they failed to return to preoperative levels by the eighth week. Additionally, by the eighth postoperative week, 45% of abdominoplasty patients…

### Association of prenatal maternal anemia with neurodevelopmental disorders [^113MnAQh]. JAMA Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are common during pregnancy, with an estimated prevalence of 30% to 50% for iron deficiency and 15% to 20% for iron deficiency anemia. Iron demands increase in pregnancy to support the growing fetus and placenta and expand the maternal red blood cell mass. Severe maternal iron shortage can lead to fetal and neonatal iron deficiency. Children with neonatal anemia experience cognitive and behavioral deficits, whereas previous animal studies indicate irreversible neurologic effects of prenatal iron deficiency. Studies of maternal supplemental iron and offspring risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), have been mixed, with one study indicating a protective association of high intakes of supplemental iron (> 86 mg/d), compared with lower levels of iron supplementation (< 30 mg/d). Another study reported no consistent association between iron supplementation and risk of ASD.

Often, ASD co-occurs with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and intellectual disability (ID). This comorbid presentation could be the result of shared causes that involve heritable and nonheritable factors occurring during neurodevelopmentally relevant windows. The aim of this study was to examine the association between prenatal anemia diagnoses in mothers and offspring risk of ASD, ADHD, and ID. To assess critical windows of development, we considered the timing of anemia diagnosis.

### Retacrit [^114R1Kbf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Important dosing information**:

- **Evaluation of iron stores and nutritional factors**: Evaluate iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

- **Monitoring of response to therapy**: Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc) before initiating Retacrit. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.

- **Selection of formulation**: In pregnant women, lactating women, neonates, and infants use only single-dose vials (the benzyl alcohol-free formulation) [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2, and 8.4)].

- **Patients with chronic kidney disease**: In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of Retacrit sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against th…

### Iron status in pregnant women and women of reproductive age in Europe [^112hB6Pp]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Understanding the iron status in pregnant women in Europe provides a foundation for considering the role of iron screening and supplementation. However, available reports and studies have used different approaches that challenge the devising of overall summaries. Moreover, data on pregnant women are limited, and thus, data on women of reproductive age provide useful background information, including baseline iron stores in pregnant women.

This review considered data that are available from over 15 European countries, including national surveys and relevant clinical studies. In European women of reproductive age, median or geometric mean serum ferritin (SF) concentrations were estimated to be 26–38 μg/L. Approximately 40–55% of this population had small or depleted iron stores (i.e. SF concentration ≤ 30 μg/L), while 45–60% had apparently replete iron stores. The prevalence of iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) was 10–32% and 2–5%, respectively, depending on the cutoffs used. Approximately 20–35% of European women of reproductive age had sufficient iron stores (SF concentration > 70 μg/L) to complete a pregnancy without supplementary iron.

During pregnancy, European women in controlled supplementation trials who were not receiving iron supplements displayed increasing prevalences of ID and IDA, which peaked in the middle to late third trimester. Available evidence has suggested that, in gestational weeks 32–39, the median or geometric mean SF concentrations were 6–21 μg/L, and prevalences of ID and IDA were 28–85% and 21–35%, respectively.

### Comment on: "Pregnancy outcomes after bariatric surgery: Importance of maternal ferritin on birth weight" [^112ZAo65]. Obesity Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Of all the available therapies, in adequately selected patients, bariatric surgery (BS) is the most effective treatment for severe obesity and its complications. Despite the numerous benefits of BS, even in reproductive performance, women who have undergone BS have higher rates of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) fetuses and preterm births than non-intervened women with the same body mass index (BMI). The mechanisms involved are not known, but nutritional deficiencies, common after BS, have been identified as one of the factors that could contribute to these pregnancy complications.

In this issue of Obesity Surgery, Lecot-Conann and colleagues present an interesting retrospective, single-center observational cohort study based on 120 French pregnant women (mean age 32.6 years [SD 5.3]) with a history of prior BS. The types of surgery included 61% gastric bypass, 18% adjustable gastric banding, 15% sleeve gastrectomy, and 6% one anastomosis gastric bypass. Each participant had at least one nutritional assessment during pregnancy, including evaluations for hemogram, ferritin, calcium, 25OH vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, fasting glucose, albumin, prealbumin, vitamin A, vitamin B12, folic acid, and zinc. The study analyzed maternal and neonatal outcomes and their possible associations with the nutritional variables evaluated.

The authors showed that ten (8%) women gave birth prematurely, while 22 (19%) newborns were SGA. The study adds to the existing evidence that SGA and preterm birth are more prevalent after BS than in non-intervened women. This finding has relevant implications given the potential link with the development.

### A time interval of more than 18 months between a pregnancy and a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass increases the risk of iron deficiency and anaemia in pregnancy [^115G4822]. Obesity Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of the study is to explore the impact of time between Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and pregnancy on obstetrical outcomes and nutritional derangements. In a retrospective cross-sectional study of pregnant women admitted for antenatal care at two tertiary hospitals, we examined 153 women with RYGB and a singleton pregnancy of at least 24 weeks. The women were stratified according to a pregnancy < 18 months (40 women) or ≥ 18 months (113 women) after RYGB. Main outcome measures were nutritional parameters and glycated haemoglobin 1Ac (HbA1c) in the second and third trimester of pregnancy, gestational hypertension, length of pregnancy, mode of delivery, and fetal birth weight.

The two groups were comparable regarding age, parity, and pre-pregnancy body mass index. The frequency of iron deficiency anaemia (ferritin < 12 μg/L and haemoglobin < 6.5 mmol/L/10.5 g/dL) was significantly higher in the late group, 29% vs. 8% in the early group, p = 0.010. No differences were found for vitamin B12, vitamin D, and zinc. Median HbA1c was significantly higher in the late group than in the early group (33 vs. 31 mmol/mol, p = 0.027). There were no significant differences in the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes or birth weight between the two groups.

A long surgery-to-pregnancy time interval following a RYGB increases the risk of iron deficiency anaemia but not of other nutritional deficits. The time interval does not seem to have an adverse effect on the obstetrical outcome, including intrauterine growth restriction. Specific attention is needed on iron deficiency.

### Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose for anaemia in pregnancy [^115C8fvP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

This is the first prospective study reporting on ferric carboxymaltose infusions in pregnancy. The key finding of our study is that in women presenting with IDA relatively late in pregnancy, a ferric carboxymaltose infusion prior to delivery significantly increased haemoglobin levels and improved iron stores. Further, we demonstrate that ferric carboxymaltose appears to be a safe and effective treatment modality for the correction of IDA, as no serious adverse events and only a few minor adverse events were reported. Reassuringly, patient satisfaction ratings and improvement in perceived wellbeing assessed in the postnatal period were high.

Many women develop iron deficiency during pregnancy, a condition that can have serious maternal and fetal implications. In our cohort, first-trimester booking bloods showed only discrete anaemia with a mean Hb of 113.4 g/L, but all women studied developed moderate to severe IDA. The low mean ferritin at booking of 17 μg/L represents profound iron deficiency and reiterates the importance of ferritin as a screening tool. This finding should generally result in the initiation of iron supplementation.

For some women, oral iron supplementation appears to be sufficient to maintain adequate iron stores. However, many women develop moderate to severe IDA despite oral iron supplementation, as demonstrated in the study where 48% of women were on oral iron, or due to drug intolerance (15% in the study), non-adherence, or pre-disposing pathology such as malabsorption or inflammatory bowel disorders. For those women, intravenous iron administration may be necessary.

### Identification and management of preoperative anaemia in adults: A British Society for Haematology guideline update [^114stzej]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, particularly in patients undergoing surgery, the BSH 2024 guidelines recommend interpreting ferritin levels of 30–100 mcg/L with low transferrin saturation (< 20%) as indicative of possible iron depletion or deficiency. This condition, especially in the context of inflammation, may benefit from iron supplementation.
