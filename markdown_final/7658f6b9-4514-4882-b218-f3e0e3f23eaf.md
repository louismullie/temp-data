## Question

Bumex vs lasix

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a comparison of bumetanide (Bumex) versus furosemide (Lasix), including potency, pharmacokinetics, indications, safety, special populations, and practical prescribing guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic class and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify potency and dose equivalence. Next, I will compare pharmacokinetics and bioavailability. After that, I need to review labeled indications and off-label uses. I will then examine safety, adverse effects, and boxed warnings. I should also consider special populations, including renal and hepatic disease, pregnancy, pediatrics, and dialysis. Finally, I will synthesize practical prescribing recommendations and highlight key clinical scenarios where one agent may be preferred over the other, anchoring to guidelines and pivotal studies where possible.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic class and mechanism. Both bumetanide and furosemide are loop diuretics that inhibit the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, producing natriuresis and diuresis; bumetanide also antagonizes the more widely distributed NKCC1, which contributes to ototoxicity risk and underpins off-label neuropsychiatric interest, though CNS penetration is limited in adults [^116ieMGH] [^1172BShK].

> I need to verify potency and dose equivalence. Multiple authoritative sources consistently state that 1 mg of bumetanide is approximately equivalent to 40 mg of furosemide in diuretic effect; this 1:40 ratio is used in FDA labeling and nuclear medicine guidance and is reflected in heart failure dosing schemas, so I should anchor conversions to this equivalence while remembering that clinical response varies with phenotype and renal function [^113QZvwE] [^1174KiTc] [^112hdvS4] [^114qdCDK].

> Next, I should review pharmacokinetics and bioavailability. Bumetanide has a rapid onset of action (oral onset ~30–60 minutes, IV onset within minutes), peaks at 1–2 hours, and a short duration of 4–6 hours; its oral bioavailability is high and oral-to-IV diuretic response is nearly equivalent, which matters when absorption is uncertain. Furosemide has a slower oral onset (~1 hour), peaks at 1–2 hours, and lasts 6–8 hours, with oral bioavailability around 60–64% and notable interpatient variability; this variability can contribute to diuretic resistance in edematous states and in older adults with altered absorption or albumin binding [^113QZvwE] [^114BbqYW].

> Hold on, I should verify labeled indications. Both agents are indicated for edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic disease, and renal disease including nephrotic syndrome; furosemide is also indicated for hypertension and as adjunctive therapy in acute pulmonary edema, whereas bumetanide's hypertension use is off-label in U.S. practice, though guidelines list loop diuretics as options for hypertension in selected patients, particularly with CKD or thiazide-induced hyponatremia [^112bQzVF] [^112r3S1P] [^111qvBza] [^117JZ2ik] [^112e7zPg].

> I will now examine safety and adverse effects. Both drugs share class effects: hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia, hyperuricemia, volume depletion, and metabolic alkalosis; boxed warnings emphasize careful monitoring to avoid profound fluid and electrolyte losses. Ototoxicity is a key concern with high IV doses, rapid administration, renal impairment, or concomitant ototoxic drugs; animal data suggest bumetanide may be more ototoxic per milligram, but given its far greater potency, clinically relevant ototoxic levels are less commonly achieved, though vigilance remains essential. Rare hematologic effects, including thrombocytopenia, have been reported with bumetanide, and both agents can precipitate gout or worsen hyperuricemia [^1123i26U] [^115Ro773] [^112MzpkX] [^1164GdrV] [^115mYtcS].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with renal disease. In moderate-to-severe CKD, loop diuretics are preferred over thiazides; bumetanide and furosemide generally require no dose adjustment solely for reduced eGFR, though higher doses may be needed as kidney function declines. In dialysis, both agents can be used when residual kidney function exists, recognizing limited utility once urine output ceases; large doses may still be tried if clinically indicated, with awareness of diminishing returns and ototoxicity risk. I should double-check that bumetanide's higher potency can reduce pill burden in advanced CKD, which may aid adherence, though careful electrolyte monitoring is non-negotiable [^117JZ2ik] [^115Mfcre] [^1169uYzm] [^116rQbaU] [^114zrMqX].

> Now hepatic disease. In cirrhosis and ascites, both agents can precipitate encephalopathy via rapid shifts in electrolytes and volume; start low, titrate slowly, and consider spironolactone to mitigate hypokalemia and alkalosis. I need to ensure we avoid use in hepatic coma and monitor closely for encephalopathy during initiation or dose escalation, particularly with IV therapy [^1123i26U] [^1121DXKY] [^117WS7Co] [^115KFaDP].

> Pregnancy requires caution. Both bumetanide and furosemide are Category C; use only if benefits outweigh risks, with close maternal-fetal monitoring, particularly for electrolytes and volume status. I should confirm that neither agent is considered first-line for edema in pregnancy unless compelling indications exist, and alternatives should be prioritized when feasible [^113Uw3MY] [^113UZ9Mg] [^114niZN1].

> Pediatrics is another area where I need to check specifics. Bumetanide lacks established safety and efficacy in children under 18, and in vitro data show it can displace bilirubin, raising kernicterus concerns in critically ill or jaundiced neonates; therefore, pediatric use should be exceptional and carefully justified. Furosemide has pediatric labeling and is commonly used in neonates and infants with appropriate monitoring, but the same electrolyte and volume cautions apply [^1159xgKd] [^112bQzVF].

> Elderly patients warrant lower starting doses and slower titration due to higher rates of renal impairment, orthostatic hypotension, and electrolyte disturbances; I should confirm that both labels advise starting at the low end of the range and monitoring renal function and electrolytes frequently in this group [^1159xgKd] [^114BbqYW].

> But wait, what about drug interactions and monitoring. I initially thought both agents carry a formal boxed warning for ototoxicity with aminoglycosides; let me verify and correct that. The boxed warnings for bumetanide and furosemide emphasize fluid and electrolyte depletion, not aminoglycoside interaction per se, though both labels caution about additive ototoxicity with aminoglycosides and other ototoxic drugs, so clinical vigilance is warranted even if not a boxed interaction warning. Probenecid can blunt bumetanide's natriuretic effect, and NSAIDs can attenuate loop diuretic response; frequent electrolytes, renal function, and volume status checks are essential during titration and with comorbidities [^1123i26U] [^114F3hby] [^113QZvwE].

> Next, I should review practical prescribing guidance. For acute decompensated heart failure, consensus pathways allow bumetanide 0.5–4 mg IV every 8–12 hours up to about 12 mg/day or 0.5–2 mg/h infusion, and furosemide 40–160 mg IV every 8–12 hours up to 200 mg per dose or 5–20 mg/h infusion; sequential nephron blockade with a thiazide can be layered if diuretic resistance emerges. For chronic heart failure, typical oral ranges are bumetanide 0.5–2 mg once or twice daily (max 10 mg/day) and furosemide 20–80 mg once or twice daily (max 600 mg/day); dose to the lowest effective amount to maintain euvolemia with close lab surveillance [^114qdCDK] [^112vggss] [^111WAU5z].

> Let me synthesize clinical scenarios. Choose bumetanide when you need rapid, predictable diuresis with reliable oral bioavailability, in patients with suspected absorption issues, or when pill burden reduction is important; its potency and short duration also facilitate tight titration in the inpatient setting. Choose furosemide when familiarity, availability, or cost considerations dominate, or when a slightly longer duration is desirable to sustain diuresis; its extensive experience and multiple formulations, including subcutaneous options, can be advantageous in some outpatient or transitional care settings. If hypertension is the target, furosemide is FDA-approved, whereas bumetanide is off-label but guideline-listed as a loop option in CKD or thiazide-related hyponatremia, with torsemide often preferred for once-daily dosing and CKD coverage [^113QZvwE] [^112bQzVF] [^117JZ2ik] [^112e7zPg].

> I should double-check emerging data that might shift practice. A natriuresis-guided strategy in acute heart failure used bumetanide and achieved protocolized intensification based on spot urine sodium, resulting in higher cumulative diuretic dosing but improved decongestion metrics; this supports using objective natriuresis to guide titration rather than relying solely on clinical appearance. Observational comparative effectiveness suggests torsemide may have modest mortality and readmission advantages over furosemide and bumetanide, but these are nonrandomized data and should be interpreted cautiously; head-to-head randomized trials are still needed to confirm outcome differences across loop agents [^111chuoe] [^112c1CeQ].

> Finally, I need to ensure key pearls are explicit. The 1:40 bumetanide-to-furosemide potency ratio is a reliable anchor for conversions, but clinical response must guide final dosing; monitor electrolytes within 24–48 hours of initiation or dose change; anticipate higher diuretic requirements in advanced CKD; and remember that in dialysis patients, loop diuretics only work when there is residual urine output, so expectations should be adjusted accordingly. If diuretic resistance occurs, reassess adherence, absorption, sodium intake, and consider sequential nephron blockade or strategies to augment renal blood flow before simply escalating loop doses indefinitely [^113QZvwE] [^116rQbaU] [^114qdCDK].

Bumex (bumetanide) and Lasix (furosemide) are both loop diuretics used for edema and hypertension, but **Bumex is about 40 times more potent than Lasix** [^113QZvwE], allowing lower doses and a smaller pill burden [^116tVebD]. Bumex has higher oral bioavailability and a faster onset, but a shorter duration of action than Lasix [^112vggss], which may require more frequent dosing. Both can cause hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and ototoxicity [^1123i26U]; however, **Bumex may have a lower risk of ototoxicity at therapeutic doses** [^116rQbaU]. Lasix is more widely available and less expensive, whereas Bumex may be preferred in patients with poor absorption or diuretic resistance [^116tVebD].

| **Feature** | **Bumex (bumetanide)** | **Lasix (furosemide)** |
|-|-|-|
| Potency | ~40× more potent than furosemide [^113QZvwE] | Lower potency |
| Bioavailability | High (~80–100%) [^notfound] | Lower (~40–60%) [^notfound] |
| Onset of action | Rapid (oral: 30–60 min; IV: 2–5 min) [^113QZvwE] | Slower (oral: 30–60 min; IV: 5–15 min) [^114BbqYW] |
| Duration of action | Shorter (4–6 h) [^113QZvwE] | Longer (6–8 h) [^114BbqYW] |
| Ototoxicity risk | Lower at therapeutic doses [^116rQbaU] | Higher, especially at high IV doses [^116rQbaU] |
| Availability/cost | Less available, more expensive | Widely available, less expensive |
| Clinical considerations | Preferred in diuretic resistance or poor absorption [^116tVebD] | Preferred first-line due to availability and cost |

---

Overall, **Bumex is more potent and has better bioavailability**, but Lasix is more accessible and cost-effective; choose Bumex for potency or resistance and Lasix for availability or cost.

Introduction

Loop diuretics such as bumetanide and furosemide, which are marketed as Bumex and Lasix, respectively, are cornerstones of clinical management of edema and hypertension –, with more than 30 million prescriptions each year in the United States. Bumetanide inhibits the renal-specific cation-chloride cotransporter (CCC) NKCC2, thereby reducing salt and water retention by the kidney to exert diuretic and anti-hypertensive effects. Bumetanide (and other existing loop diuretics) also antagonize a more widely distributed paralogous transporter NKCC1, which accounts for their side-effect of ototoxicity. This side effect is consistent with the genetic studies that NKCC1 −/− animals are profoundly deaf because NKCC1 contributes to maintenance of unusually high extracellular [K +] of endolymph in inner ear.

An antagonistic action of bumetanide on neuronal NKCC1 may also produce beneficial effects in the treatment of various brain disorders and psychiatric conditions as demonstrated in recent off-label studies –. NKCC1 may function as a major Cl − importer in neurons and thus contributes to maintenance of an outward-directed Cl − electrochemical gradient in immature neurons and some peripheral sensory neurons in adults –. Consequently, inhibitory neurotransmitters (e.g. γ -aminobutyric acid; GABA) stimulate Cl − efflux via pentameric ligand-gated Cl − channels, resulting in depolarization of these neurons. Bumetanide may restore GABA inhibition in patients with neurological disorders by blocking NKCC1-mediated Cl − accumulation in neurons. However, bumetanide barely crosses the blood brain barrier to reach neuronal NKCC1 target and has the diuretic liability associated with off-target inhibition of the closely related NKCC2 transporter.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Individualize dosage with careful monitoring of patient response.

Oral Administration

The usual total daily dosage of Bumex tablets is 0.5 mg to 2 mg and in most patients is given as a single dose.

If the diuretic response to an initial dose of Bumex tablets is not adequate, in view of its rapid onset and short duration of action, a second or third dose may be given at 4- to 5-hour intervals up to a maximum daily dose of 10 mg. An intermittent dose schedule, whereby Bumex tablets are given on alternate days or for 3 to 4 days with rest periods of 1 to 2 days in between, is recommended as the safest and most effective method for the continued control of edema. In patients with hepatic failure, keep the dosage to a minimum.

Because cross-sensitivity with furosemide has rarely been observed, bumetanide can be substituted at approximately a 1:40 ratio of bumetanide in proportion to furosemide in patients allergic to furosemide.

Parenteral Administration

Bumetanide injection may be administered parenterally (intravenously and intramuscularly) to patients in whom gastrointestinal absorption may be impaired or in whom oral administration is not practical.

Terminate parenteral treatment and institute oral treatment as soon as possible.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Bumex tablets are indicated for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome.

Almost equal diuretic response occurs after oral and parenteral administration of bumetanide. Therefore, if impaired gastrointestinal absorption is suspected or oral administration is not practical, bumetanide should be given by the intramuscular or intravenous route.

Successful treatment with Bumex tablets following instances of allergic reactions to furosemide suggests a lack of cross-sensitivity.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Bumex is a loop diuretic with a rapid onset and short duration of action. Pharmacological and clinical studies have shown that 1 mg Bumex has a diuretic potency equivalent to approximately 40 mg furosemide. The major site of Bumex action is the ascending limb of the loop of Henle.

The mode of action has been determined through various clearance studies in both humans and experimental animals. Bumex inhibits sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, as shown by marked reduction of free-water clearance (CH2O) during hydration and tubular free-water reabsorption (TCH2O) during hydropenia. Reabsorption of chloride in the ascending limb is also blocked by Bumex, and Bumex is somewhat more chloruretic than natriuretic.

Potassium excretion is also increased by Bumex, in a dose-related fashion.

Bumex may have an additional action in the proximal tubule. Since phosphate reabsorption takes place largely in the proximal tubule, phosphaturia during Bumex induced diuresis is indicative of this additional action. This is further supported by the reduction in the renal clearance of Bumex by probenecid, associated with diminution in the natriuretic response. This proximal tubular activity does not seem to be related to an inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Bumex does not appear to have a noticeable action on the distal tubule.

Bumex decreases uric acid excretion and increases serum uric acid. Following oral administration of Bumex the onset of diuresis occurs in 30 to 60 minutes. Peak activity is reached between 1 and 2 hours. At usual doses (1 mg to 2 mg) diuresis is largely complete within 4 hours; with higher doses, the diuretic action lasts for 4 to 6 hours. Diuresis starts within minutes following an intravenous injection and reaches maximum levels within 15 to 30 minutes.

Several pharmacokinetic studies have shown that bumetanide, administered orally or parenterally, is eliminated rapidly in humans, with a half-life of between 1 and 1½ hours. Plasma protein-binding is in the range of 94% to 96%.

Oral administration of carbon-14 labeled Bumex to human volunteers revealed that 81% of the administered radioactivity was excreted in the urine, 45% of it as unchanged drug. Urinary and biliary metabolites identified in this study were formed by oxidation of the N-butyl side chain. Biliary excretion of Bumex amounted to only 2% of the administered dose.

### A comprehensive review of the loop diuretics: should furosemide be first line? [^112DYoKj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature regarding the pharmacokinetic profiles, comparative safety and efficacy, and comparative costs of loop diuretics to evaluate the current clinical usefulness of furosemide.

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE (1966-June 2009) was conducted using the terms furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide, ethacrynic acid, and loop diuretics. Articles were limited to those written in English.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles identified from the data sources were reviewed. Studies were eligible if they encompassed pharmacokinetics, comparative safety and efficacy, or comparative costs of the loop diuretics.

Data Synthesis

In patients with heart failure (HF), torsemide demonstrated decreased mortality compared with furosemide in 1 study (2.2% vs 4.5% in the furosemide group; p < 0.05), decreased hospitalizations in 1 study (23 in the torsemide group vs 61 in the furosemide group; p < 0.01), and improved New York Heart Association functional classifications in 2 studies. In the first, 45.8% with torsemide versus 37.2% with furosemide demonstrated improvement in at least one functional class (p = 0.00017). In the second, 40.2% with torsemide and 30.7% with furosemide demonstrated improvement in at least one functional class (p = 0.014). In 2 of 3 studies of patients with cirrhosis, torsemide increased natriuresis and total volume diuresed compared with furosemide in patients with cirrhosis; however, no significant difference between the agents with respect to plasma renin and aldosterone concentrations was demonstrated. In patients with pulmonary hypertension, central venous pressure, capillary wedge pressure, and stroke volume significantly improved from baseline among patients who received torsemide, but not in those who received furosemide, although the intergroup analysis failed to reach statistical significance. Among patients with chronic kidney disease, no significant differences were noted with respect to natriuresis and blood pressure control between the 2 agents; however, in patients with acute kidney injury, patients who received furosemide had a significant improvement in urine output versus the torsemide group. Additionally, 2 trials comparing bumetanide with furosemide were identified, although the results were conflicting. In patients with nephrotic syndrome, bumetanide significantly improved weight loss in the first 4 weeks and in week 20, compared with furosemide. In patients with HF, significant improvement in dyspnea at rest and on exertion was exhibited in the bumetanide group, but not in the furosemide group; no significant difference was noted between the 2 groups when evaluating global assessment.

Conclusions

Growing evidence demonstrates more favorable pharmacokinetic profiles of torsemide and bumetanide compared with furosemide. Furthermore, torsemide may be more efficacious and safer than furosemide in patients with HF. A trial comparing all 3 drugs would be required to confirm torsemide as the primary loop diuretic in patients with HF, but based upon limited current evidence, we recommend torsemide over furosemide. Currently, little evidence exists to support either torsemide or bumetanide as first-line treatment over furosemide in patients with other edematous disease states.

### Bumetanide (Bumex) [^1123i26U]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Volume and Electrolyte Depletion

The dose of Bumex should be adjusted to the patient's need. Excessive doses or too frequent administration can lead to profound water loss, electrolyte depletion, dehydration, reduction in blood volume and circulatory collapse with the possibility of vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients.

Hypokalemia

Hypokalemia can occur as a consequence of Bumex administration. Prevention of hypokalemia requires particular attention in the following conditions: patients receiving digitalis and diuretics for congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, states of aldosterone excess with normal renal function, potassium-losing nephropathy, certain diarrheal states, or other states where hypokalemia is thought to represent particular added risks to the patient, i.e., history of ventricular arrhythmias.

In patients with hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, sudden alterations of electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy and coma. Treatment in such patients is best initiated in the hospital with small doses and careful monitoring of the patient's clinical status and electrolyte balance. Supplemental potassium and/or spironolactone may prevent hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis in these patients.

Ototoxicity

In cats, dogs and guinea pigs, bumetanide has been shown to produce ototoxicity. In these test animals bumetanide was 5 to 6 times more potent than furosemide and, since the diuretic potency of bumetanide is about 40 to 60 times furosemide, it is anticipated that blood levels necessary to produce ototoxicity will rarely be achieved. The potential exists, however, and must be considered a risk of intravenous therapy, especially at high doses, repeated frequently in the face of renal excretory function impairment. Potentiation of aminoglycoside ototoxicity has not been tested for bumetanide. Like other members of this class of diuretics, bumetanide probably shares this risk.

Allergy to Sulfonamides

Patients allergic to sulfonamides may show hypersensitivity to Bumex.

Thrombocytopenia

Since there have been rare spontaneous reports of thrombocytopenia from postmarketing experience, patients should be observed regularly for possible occurrence of thrombocytopenia.

### Bumetanide for core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (BAMBI): a single center, double-blinded, participant-randomized, placebo-controlled, phase-2 superiority trial [^114Bix53]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Recent trials have indicated positive effects of bumetanide in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We tested efficacy of bumetanide on core symptom domains using a single center, parallel-group, participant-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase-2 superiority trial in a tertiary hospital in the Netherlands.

Method

Unmedicated children aged 7 to 15 years with ASD and IQ ≥ 55 were block-randomized 1:1 to oral-solution bumetanide versus placebo, titrated to a maximum of 1.0 mg twice daily for 91 days (D91), followed by a 28-day wash-out period. The primary outcome was difference in Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2) total score at D91, analyzed by modified intention-to-treat with linear mixed models.

Results

A total of 92 participants (mean age 10.5 [SD 2.4] years) enrolled between June 2016 and December 2018. In all, 47 children were allocated to bumetanide and 45 to placebo. Two participants dropped out per treatment arm. After 91 days, bumetanide was not superior to placebo on the primary outcome, the SRS-2 (mean difference -3.16, 95% CI = -9.68 to 3.37, p = .338). A superior effect was found on one of the secondary outcomes, the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (mean difference -4.16, 95% CI = -8.06 to -0.25, p = .0375), but not on the Sensory Profile (mean difference 5.64, 95% CI = -11.30 to 22.57, p = .508) or the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability Subscale (mean difference -0.65, 95% CI = -2.83 to 1.52, p = .552). No significant wash-out effect was observed. Significant adverse effects were predominantly diuretic effects (orthostatic hypotension (17 [36%] versus 5 [11%], p = .007); hypokalemia (24 [51%] versus 0 [0%], p < .0001), the occurrence of which did not statistically influence treatment outcome.

Conclusion

The trial outcome was negative in terms of no superior effect on the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes suggest efficacy on repetitive behavior symptoms for a subset of patients.

F. Bumetanide — If furosemide is not available, bumetanide is an acceptable alternative; like furosemide, bumetanide requires delivery into the tubular fluid for access to its site of action. One milligram of bumetanide is equivalent to approximately 40 mg of furosemide.

Hypertension

Therapy should be individualized according to the patient's response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain the therapeutic response.

Adults — The usual initial dose of LASIX for hypertension is 80mg, usually divided into 40mg twice a day. Dosage should then be adjusted according to response. If response is not satisfactory, add other antihypertensive agents.

Changes in blood pressure must be carefully monitored when LASIX is used with other antihypertensive drugs, especially during initial therapy. To prevent excessive drop in blood pressure, the dosage of other agents should be reduced by at least 50% when LASIX is added to the regimen. As the blood pressure falls under the potentiating effect of LASIX, a further reduction in dosage or even discontinuation of other antihypertensive drugs may be necessary.

Geriatric patients — In general, dose selection and dose adjustment for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

### Optimal initial intravenous loop Diuretic Dosing in acute decompensated heart Failure [^112d2Nyr]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Although there may not be differences in clinical outcomes associated with different loop diuretic medications, there are relevant and important pharmacokinetic differences in relative potencies and bioavailability. These differences dictate relative conversions between loop diuretics and as shown in the current analysis, as the magnitude of dose increases, the likelihood of receiving optimal initial IV dosing decreases. This finding may reflect either a discomfort in practice when selecting an initial dose that surpasses a particular threshold or inadequate pharmacokinetic equipotent conversions between loop diuretics. Both potential mechanisms are further supported in our study by the 20 to 25% lower probability of optimal dosing with the use of bumetanide as a home oral diuretic or as an initial IV diuretic. This may indicate a misinterpretation of pharmacokinetic equivalences between bumetanide and furosemide. Furthermore, results remained consistent in our sensitivity analysis with an alternative diuretic dosing conversion. While these mechanisms may be driven by the goal of minimizing medication-related side effects, there are limited reports of adverse events from exceeding dosing thresholds for IV loop diuretics in patients with ADHF. Hearing loss or tinnitus, rare side effects of loop diuretics, are only notable in rapid IV bolus doses exceeding 500 mg of FEs, which is rarely seen within current HF management. Furthermore, acute kidney injury in the setting of volume overload and diuresis is not associated with long-term worsening renal function, which diverges from the pedagogical "nephrotoxicity" side effect of loop diuretics during initial ADHF volume management. In fact, a retrospective analysis of the Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart Failure trail demonstrated that worsening acute kidney injury biomarkers among those with ADHF were associated with an improvement in survival vs those without acute kidney injury biomarker changes.

### Structural basis for inhibition of the cation-chloride cotransporter NKCC1 by the diuretic drug bumetanide [^1172BShK]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Here we reveal the mechanism of action of bumetanide on NKCC1, five decades after it was first developed for the clinical management of fluid overload and hypertension. Inhibition of NKCC1 by bumetanide and other loop diuretics is a double-edged sword in clinical medicine. On the one hand, antagonizing neuronal NKCC1 represents an emerging attractive strategy for the treatment of a wide range of brain disorders such as seizure and autism. On the other hand, inhibition of NKCC1 also causes side effect of ototoxicity in the treatment of edema/hypertension. We now show that bumetanide targets the extracellular ion translocation path that constitutes a set of residues almost invariant in human NKCC1 and NKCC2, explaining why bumetanide (and other loop diuretics) cannot discriminate these two closely related paralogues (Supplementary Fig. 22). Our studies suggest that isoform-specific inhibitors of NKCCs could be better crafted by interfering with their respective regulatory mechanisms which must have adapted to fulfill their divergent roles. One such enticing strategy would be to develop small molecules (or biologics) that can modulate the strength of association between their N-terminal phosphoregulatory segment and C-terminal domain.

### Is it safe to use a diuretic to treat seizures early in development? [^114aUuaE]. Epilepsy Currents (2011). Low credibility.

There has been considerable interest in using bumetanide, a diuretic chloride importer NKCC1 antagonist, to reduce intracellular chloride ([Cl⁻]ᵢ) in epileptic neurons, thereby shifting the polarity of GABA from excitatory to inhibitory and ameliorating the actions of GABA-acting antiepileptic drugs. However, a recent study raises the important issue of potential deleterious actions of bumetanide on immature neurons, because reduction of (Cl⁻)ᵢ also alleviates a major source of excitation in developing neurons, upon which GABA exerts a trophic action. This review considers the importance of separating intrauterine from postnatal effects of bumetanide in normal versus pathologic neurons.

Loop diuretics in dialysis patients — Large doses of potent loop diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide, or torsemide) can be administered to promote loss of sodium and water, but therapy is effective only when RKF is high enough to provide daily urine output of at least 100 mL and its effectiveness may not last long. Loop diuretics should be used with caution because of the possibility of ototoxicity, with the incidence appearing greater with furosemide and much less with bumetanide or torsemide.

### Novel intranasal loop Diuretic [^115gPph8]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Intranasal bumetanide was safe and generally well-tolerated with no overt signs of nasal irritation across the study population. Following intranasal or oral administrations, bumetanide was absorbed with a median time to maximum plasma concentration (t max) ranging from 1.02 to 1.50 hours post dose. Plasma bumetanide concentration remained steady between 1.0 and 2.0 hours post dose, followed by a slow decline. Increases in bumetanide exposure seemed to be dose proportional over the 0.5- to 2.0-mg dose range after intranasal administration. Furthermore, bumetanide exposure after a 2.0-mg intranasal administration was similar to a 1.0-mg intravenous or a 2.0-mg oral dose. For intranasal vs oral administration, particularly in the 2.0 mg intranasal group, the intranasal t max did occur sooner compared to oral, although differences in t max were not statistically significant. There is no significant difference in the maximum concentration and area under the curve 0-last between the intranasal route and the oral route at the 2.0-mg dose level (Figure 1B). An exploratory observation of the study demonstrated similar urine output for the intranasal arms as compared with the oral and intravenous cohorts.

### Natriuresis-guided diuretic therapy in acute heart failure: a pragmatic randomized trial [^111chuoe]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Decongestive treatment

Median daily total dose of intravenous loop diuretic at the start of treatment was 4 [2–8] mg of bumetanide in the natriuresis-guided group compared with 4 [2–8] mg of bumetanide in the standard of care (SOC) group (P = 0.8082). The total cumulative administered inhospital diuretic dose was greater in the natriuresis-guided group (26 [15.5–44] mg of bumetanide) compared with the SOC group (15 [8.5–32] mg of bumetanide), P < 0.0001). In the natriuresis-guided group, in 128/150 individual patients (85%) diuretic treatment was intensified according to protocol (Extended Data Fig. 1) at any timepoint during the first 36 h (Fig. 2). Extended Data Table 1 displays the number of patients requiring treatment intensification at the different timepoints and the number of patients with an insufficient natriuretic response at these timepoints. In patients requiring treatment intensification, insufficient spot urinary sodium was the reason for intensified treatment in 100% (n = 28) of patients at t = 2, in 80% (n = 39) of patients at t = 6, in 63% (n = 47) of patients at t = 12, in 72% (n = 34) of patients at t = 18, and in 90% (n = 45) of patients at t = 36 (Extended Data Table 1). Response was most frequently insufficient 12 h after start of intravenous loop diuretic therapy (at t = 12), where 58% of patients in the natriuresis-guided arm had an insufficient response.

### Effect of the combination of bumetanide plus chlorthalidone on hypertension and volume overload in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 4–5 KDIGO without renal replacement therapy: a double-blind randomized HEBE-CKD trial [^114zrMqX]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Our findings could have a positive clinical impact in management of volume overload in the chronic kidney disease population, whose prognosis has already been proven to improve with a reduction in volume overload. Szu-Chun Hung et al. employed a model to predict mortality based on patients' extracellular water to total body water ratio. This ratio expresses the amount of extracellular water that exists compared to total body water. In healthy people, the index is between 0.36 and 0.39, however, it has been observed that it is increased in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and has been associated with multiple adverse outcomes. Patients were classified into two groups based on the extracellular water to total body water ratio with a cutoff of ± 48%, and after four years of follow-up, they observed twice the mortality rate in those with levels ≥ 48%. These results could be of particular interest when applied to this trial since, before the intervention, both groups had an ECW/TBW ratio > 50%; however, at the end of follow-up, only the combined treatment group exhibited a reduction to 46%, which could be impactful as a possible benefit in terms of mortality in this population.

Another finding was that treatment with loop diuretics alone was insufficient for blood pressure and volume overload control compared with bumetanide plus chlorthalidone. This was evidenced by the fact that in our trial, all patients had a history of chronic loop diuretic use (most were on furosemide); however, when they were randomized, furosemide was changed to bumetanide, a more potent loop diuretic with a dose equivalent to 160 mg furosemide QD. This protocol, along with our findings, allowed us to demonstrate that high doses of loop diuretics are not sufficient by themselves to achieve adequate blood pressure and volume overload in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease without renal replacement therapy. When employing high doses of bumetanide, the possibilities of poor efficacy of the loop diuretic secondary to pharmacokinetic processes associated with diuretic resistance, such as insufficient dosage, reduced absorption, low bioavailability, and interaction with uremic toxins, are diminished. We consider that this difference could be explained by chronic loop diuretic use and previously described adaptive changes at the distal convoluted tubule, in which patients exhibit higher sodium reabsorption, lower natriuresis, and, as a consequence, loss of loop diuretic efficacy.

3.6 Sensitivity analyses

Findings of sensitivity analyses were generally consistent with the primary results. In brief, after constraining sampling to individuals with heart failure, the association between bumetanide use and AD remained non‐significant, regardless of whether bumetanide use was measured as ever use (Table S2 in supporting information) or as number of years of use (Table S3 in supporting information). Ever use of bumetanide, however, remained associated with increased risk of all‐cause dementia (Table S4 in supporting information).

When constraining the sample to individuals ≤ 70 years of age at baseline, ever use of bumetanide was associated with a slightly increased risk of AD; however, the number of years of bumetanide use was not significantly associated with AD (Tables S2 and S3). Bumetanide use, like furosemide and torsemide use, was associated with increased risk of all‐cause dementia, regardless of the functional form of the variable (Tables S4 and S5 in supporting information).

When constraining the sample to individuals with an index date before January 2010, which extended the average follow‐up period available in the sample, the association between bumetanide use and AD remained non‐significant, regardless of whether bumetanide use was measured as ever use (Table S2) or as number of years of use (Table S3). Use of bumetanide, furosemide, or torsemide was associated with increased risk of all‐cause dementia (Tables S4 and S5).

When reproducing the base case analyses on the overall sample with the addition of a history of traumatic brain injury and the number of other CMS chronic conditions as covariates, the association between bumetanide use and AD remained non‐significant, regardless of whether bumetanide use was measured as ever use (Table S2) or as number of years of use (Table S3). Use of bumetanide, furosemide, or torsemide was associated with increased risk of all‐cause dementia (Tables S4 and S5).

### Bumetanide [^113Wy93w]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Bumetanide is a loop diuretic with a rapid onset and short duration of action. Pharmacological and clinical studies have shown that 1 mg bumetanide has a diuretic potency equivalent to approximately 40 mg furosemide. The major site of bumetanide action is the ascending limb of the loop of Henle.

The mode of action has been determined through various clearance studies in both humans and experimental animals. Bumetanide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, as shown by marked reduction of free-water clearance (CH2O) during hydration and tubular free-water reabsorption (TCH2O) during hydropenia. Reabsorption of chloride in the ascending limb is also blocked by bumetanide, and bumetanide is somewhat more chloruretic than natriuretic.

Potassium excretion is also increased by bumetanide, in a dose-related fashion.

Bumetanide may have an additional action in the proximal tubule. Since phosphate reabsorption takes place largely in the proximal tubule, phosphaturia during bumetanide induced diuresis is indicative of this additional action. This is further supported by the reduction in the renal clearance of bumetanide by probenecid, associated with diminution in the natriuretic response. This proximal tubular activity does not seem to be related to an inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Bumetanide does not appear to have a noticeable action on the distal tubule.

Bumetanide decreases uric acid excretion and increases serum uric acid. Following oral administration of bumetanide the onset of diuresis occurs in 30 to 60 minutes. Peak activity is reached between 1 and 2 hours. At usual doses (1 mg to 2 mg) diuresis is largely complete within 4 hours; with higher doses, the diuretic action lasts for 4 to 6 hours. Diuresis starts within minutes following an intravenous injection and reaches maximum levels within 15 to 30 minutes.

Several pharmacokinetic studies have shown that bumetanide, administered orally or parenterally, is eliminated rapidly in humans, with a half-life of between 1 and 1½ hours. Plasma protein-binding is in the range of 94% to 96%.

Oral administration of carbon-14 labeled bumetanide to human volunteers revealed that 81% of the administered radioactivity was excreted in the urine, 45% of it as unchanged drug. Urinary and biliary metabolites identified in this study were formed by oxidation of the N-butyl side chain. Biliary excretion of bumetanide amounted to only 2% of the administered dose.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Edema

LASIX is indicated in adults and pediatric patients for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome. LASIX is particularly useful when an agent with greater diuretic potential is desired.

Hypertension

Oral LASIX may be used in adults for the treatment of hypertension alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Hypertensive patients who cannot be adequately controlled with thiazides will probably also not be adequately controlled with LASIX alone.

### Bumetanide (Bumex) [^1159xgKd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 have not been established.

In vitro studies using pooled sera from critically ill neonates have shown bumetanide to be a potent displacer of bilirubin (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pediatric Pharmacology). The administration of bumetanide could present a particular concern if given to critically ill or jaundiced neonates at risk for kernicterus.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of Bumex did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

### The daily challenges to patients posed by diuretic therapy: what they are and what do patients do? [^117PzgNh]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Diuretics play a central role in the management of patients with heart failure. In fact, they are used to achieve and maintain euvolaemia through adequate fluid balance. The effects, clinical benefits and implications of diuretic therapy are well established. However, little is known about the inconveniences posed to patients by diuretics and the adaptations adopted by them to counteract these challenges.

We conducted a study to investigate the patient impact of diuretic therapy.

A comprehensive questionnaire was formulated and distributed to patients with established heart failure (with reduced and preserved ejection fraction) attending a specialized heart failure service. Questionnaires were given to patients once they had been established on heart failure disease‐modifying therapy and diuretic therapy for at least 3 months and had received self‐care education including information on medication and adherence to drug regimens. Patients were established either on oral furosemide or bumetanide with doses ranging from 20 to 80 mg daily and 0.5 to 6 mg daily, respectively. The questionnaire encompassed information on inconvenience from the use of diuretics, what those manifestations were (if any) and what the patients did to overcome the inconvenience (if something was done). The patients also commented on whether they felt that the benefits were worth the inconvenience of the diuretics.

Table 13 — FDA-approved drugs for treatment of hypertension — Loop diuretics (alternative agents) include bumetanide 0.5–2 mg/d (daily frequency 2), furosemide 20–80 mg/d (daily frequency 2), and torsemide 5–10 mg/d (daily frequency 1). These are preferred diuretics in patients with symptomatic HF. They are preferred over thiazide-type diuretics in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (eg, GFR < 30 mL/min). The longer-acting choice of torsemide is preferred for treatment of hypertension. A loop diuretic is an option for patients who develop thiazide-type diuretic associated hyponatremia.

### Comparative effect of loop diuretic prescription on mortality and heart failure readmission [^112c1CeQ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Loop diuretics are a standard pharmacologic therapy in heart failure (HF) management. Although furosemide is most frequently used, torsemide and bumetanide are increasingly prescribed in clinical practice, possibly because of superior bioavailability. Few real-world comparative effectiveness studies have examined outcomes across all 3 loop diuretics. The study goal was to compare the effects of loop diuretic prescribing at HF hospitalization discharge on mortality and HF readmission. We identified patients in Medicare claims data initiating furosemide, torsemide, or bumetanide after an index HF hospitalization from 2007 to 2017. We estimated 6-month risks of all-cause mortality and a composite outcome (HF readmission or all-cause mortality) using inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for relevant confounders. We identified 62,632 furosemide, 1,720 torsemide, and 2,389 bumetanide initiators. The 6-month adjusted all-cause mortality risk was lowest for torsemide (13.2%), followed by furosemide (14.5%) and bumetanide (15.6%). The 6-month composite outcome risk was 21.4% for torsemide, 24.7% for furosemide, and 24.9% for bumetanide. Compared with furosemide, the 6-month all-cause mortality risk was 1.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.7, 1.0) lower for torsemide and 1.0% (95% CI: -1.2, 3.2) higher for bumetanide, and the 6-month composite outcome risk was 3.3% (95% CI: -6.3, -0.3) lower for torsemide and 0.2% (95% CI: -2.5, 2.9) higher for bumetanide. In conclusion, the findings suggested that the first prescribed loop diuretic following HF hospitalization is associated with clinically important differences in morbidity in older patients receiving torsemide, bumetanide, or furosemide. These differences were consistent for the effect of all-cause mortality alone, but were not statistically significant.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Investigations into the mode of action of LASIX have utilized micropuncture studies in rats, stop flow experiments in dogs and various clearance studies in both humans and experimental animals. It has been demonstrated that LASIX inhibits primarily the absorption of sodium and chloride not only in the proximal and distal tubu but also in the loop of Henle. The high degree of efficacy is largely due to the unique site of action. The action on the distal tubule is independent of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase and aldosterone.

Recent evidence suggests that furosemide glucuronide is the only or at least the major biotransformation product of furosemide in man. Furosemide is extensively bound to plasma proteins, mainly to albumin. Plasma concentrations ranging from 1 μg/mL to 400 μg/mL are 91% to 99% bound in healthy individuals. The unbound fraction averages 2.3% to 4.1% at therapeutic concentrations.

The onset of diuresis following oral administration is within 1 hour. The peak effect occurs within the first or second hour. The duration of diuretic effect is 6 to 8 hours.

In fasted normal men, the mean bioavailability of furosemide from LASIX Tablets and LASIX Oral Solution is 64% and 60%, respectively, of that from an intravenous injection of the drug. Although furosemide is more rapidly absorbed from the oral solution (50 minutes) than from the tablet (87 minutes), peak plasma levels and area under the plasma concentration-time curves do not differ significantly. Peak plasma concentrations increase with increasing dose but times-to-peak do not differ among doses. The terminal half-life of furosemide is approximately 2 hours.

Significantly more furosemide is excreted in urine following the IV injection than after the tablet or oral solution. There are no significant differences between the two oral formulations in the amount of unchanged drug excreted in urine.

Geriatric Population

Furosemide binding to albumin may be reduced in elderly patients. Furosemide is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine. The renal clearance of furosemide after intravenous administration in older healthy male subjects (60 to 70 years of age) is statistically significantly smaller than in younger healthy male subjects (20 to 35 years of age). The initial diuretic effect of furosemide in older subjects is decreased relative to younger subjects (s ee PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

### Novel intranasal loop Diuretic [^1164zF9L]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Preclinical and first-in-human results indicate that bumetanide nasal spray could prove to be a valuable outpatient therapeutic option, which in theory offers to help selected patients avoid hospital admissions and readmissions thus potentially reducing the cost of care and improving outcomes. Corstasis plans to conduct the pivotal trial for bumetanide nasal spray in 2023.

More than 6.5 million Americans have heart failure (HF), with nearly 1 million new cases diagnosed annually. HF accounts for 1 out of every 8 deaths and costs an estimated $30.7 billion. In 2018 1,250,000 patients were discharged after a HF-related admission. Furthermore, the national 30-day readmission rate for HF is 23%, making it 1 of the 6 high-priority conditions included in Medicare's Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program and value-based purchasing program.

HF is a complex and multifaceted syndrome. Edema, congestion, and fluid overload are synonymous classic clinical features of patients presenting with HF. Oral loop diuretics such as furosemide, bumetanide, and torsemide are the cornerstone of outpatient therapy for the management of fluid volume in patients with HF. However, patients with HF frequently experience diminished response to oral diuretics, resulting in hospital admission for intravenous diuretic administration. Recent data suggest that gut congestion and gastrointestinal impairment are important mechanisms underlying oral diuretic resistance impacting patients suffering from fluid overload in both in- and outpatient settings.

Oral diuretics are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, and any impairment of gastrointestinal motility can lead to delayed and reduced absorption of these medications. Accumulating data suggest that the need to intensify outpatient oral diuretic therapy is associated with a substantial risk of morbidity and mortality. A recent analysis of the Danish registry found intensification was common and associated with a 75% higher relative risk of 1-year mortality.

### Structural basis for inhibition of the cation-chloride cotransporter NKCC1 by the diuretic drug bumetanide [^112zygMu]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

At the mouth of the extracellular ion entryway, bumetanide's sulfamyl group interacts with Ile493 of TM6a, possibly explaining why non-sulfonamide loop diuretics (e.g. ethacrynic acid) are significantly less potent than bumetanide (Fig. 1d, e and Supplementary Fig. 13a). Beneath this top layer of interaction, the phenoxyl and carboxyl groups project toward opposite sides of the ion translocation path and interact with residues residing on TM1b, TM3, and TM10. Here on one side, the phenoxyl group packs against Val385 residing on TM3, and Leu671 (Cys671 in the NKCC1 iii construct) and Ala675 located at TM10. In furosemide, this phenoxyl group is replaced by a chlorine atom, likely explaining why it is ~ 50-fold less potent in inhibiting NKCCs than bumetanide (Supplementary Fig. 13a). Indeed, our 3.4 Å NKCC1 ii /furosemide structure, which almost superimposes with the outward-open NKCC1/bumetanide structures, confirmed a general binding site for loop diuretics in NKCC1, but the precise pose for furosemide could not be determined based on the current map (Supplementary Fig. 15). On the other side, the carboxyl group forms hydrogen bonds with Val302 and Met303 located on TM1b, and Ala497 residing on TM6a; it also replaces a Cl − ion in the Cl − site1 and establishes ionic interaction with the K + ion. Deeper toward the central ion binding sites, the butylamino group establishes hydrophobic interactions with Met382 and Tyr383 located on TM3, and Pro496 and Thr499 residing on TM6a. This explains why substitution of Met382 to tryptophan abolishes inhibition of NKCC1 by bumetanide.

We performed molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to validate the binding pose of bumetanide seen in our NKCC1/bumetanide structures. We found that bumetanide maintains the experimental pose during 1000 ns simulations with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of ~1 Å (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 13b). Taken together, we showed that bumetanide, and probably other chemically-related loop diuretics as well, inhibit NKCC1 by selectively plugging the extracellular ion entry pathway created in an outward-open state and sterically hinder the transporter from isomerization into other transport states.

### Pharmacoepidemiology evaluation of bumetanide as a potential candidate for drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease [^113x9T6j]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

There were no significant associations between the cumulative number of years of bumetanide use, furosemide use, or torsemide use and AD risk (Figure 3, left). A 1‐year increase in the use of non‐loop diuretics was associated with 3.6% decreased risk of AD (HR, 0.964 per 1‐year increment; 95% CI, 0.959–0.969). The number of years of non‐diuretic antihypertensive use was significantly associated with AD risk, but the magnitude of the association was small (HR, 1.009 per 1‐year increment; 95% CI, 1.005–1.014).

FIGURE 3
Adjusted hazard ratios of AD and all‐cause dementia, per 1‐year increment in drug use. Cumulative use of medications was defined with continous time‐dependent variables, and was measured at each interval as the cumulative number of 30‐day intervals that each subject had used a specific medication. To improve interpretability, the variable was expressed per 1‐year increments. For example, the hazard ratio of AD associated with bumetanide can be interpreted as follows: For each 1‐year increment in the use of bumetanide, the hazards of AD increased by 0.1% (95% CI, –1.6% to 1.9%). Non‐loop diuretics included diuretic drugs that are not loop diuretics (thiazides and potassium‐sparing diuretics).

### Pharmacoepidemiology evaluation of bumetanide as a potential candidate for drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease [^115aDUM8]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

To overcome the limitations of prior work, we used a retrospective cohort design, which ensured that drug use was measured prior to the development of dementia. We incorporated time‐dependent variables to account for changes in medication use over time as well as duration of drug use. In sensitivity analyses, we further controlled for the number of CMS Chronic Condition Data Warehouse priority conditions, which enabled us to control for potential differences in the underlying health status of patients. To minimize the risk of confounding by indication, we performed a sensitivity analysis restricting the sample to individuals with chronic heart failure, the leading indication for bumetanide. Then, to rule out the possibility that bumetanide may be protective of AD when individuals are exposed earlier in life, we performed sensitivity analyses constraining sampling to individuals who were ≤ 70 years of age at baseline. None of these analyses yielded findings suggestive of an association between bumetanide and decreased AD risk. We further evaluated the association between bumetanide use and two negative control outcomes (cataract surgery and non‐melanoma skin cancer) to evaluate the potential for residual confounding. Bumetanide use was not significantly associated with either of the negative control outcomes; however, there was a minor increase in the hazards of cataract surgery and non‐melanoma skin cancer associated with furosemide, which may be indicative of residual confounding in those analyses.

Pharmacotherapy

On admission there were no differences in the prescription rates of ACE inhibitors (ACE-I), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), ACE-I and/or ARB, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) or loop diuretics between the pre-HFT and post-HFT groups, respectively (table 2). There was a significantly higher proportion of patients taking thiazides on admission in the post-HFT group.

Table 2
Admission medications

On discharge, the prescription rates of both medications with known prognostic benefit (ACE-I, ACE-I and/or ARB, and MRA) and medications with a symptomatic benefit (loop and thiazide diuretics) were significantly higher in patients in the post-HFT cohort (table 3). During their hospital stay, post-HFT patients were more likely to receive intravenous loop diuretics, more likely to be discharged on a diuretic and were discharged on higher doses of loop diuretic. Intravenous loop diuretic was used in 76% of pre-HFT versus 88% of post-HFT patients (p < 0.002). Eighty-four per cent of the pre-HFT patients were discharged on a loop diuretic (70% furosemide and 14% bumetanide) compared with 98% of post-HFT patients (54% furosemide and 45% bumetanide) (p < 0.0001).

Table 3
Discharge medications

Post-HFT patients received higher doses of oral diuretics on discharge: the mean bumetanide equivalent dose (bumetanide 1 mg = furosemide 40 mg) was 2.4 mg in the post-HFT cohort versus 1.6 mg in the pre-HFT cohort (p < 0.001). Discharge prescription rates of thiazide diuretics were also more frequent in the post-HFT patients: 5% pre-HFT versus 17% post-HFT (p < 0.001).

2.3 Exposure

To define the exposures of interest, we extracted all prescriptions for drugs of interest starting on the index date and throughout the follow‐up period. The drugs of interest included the loop diuretics bumetanide, furosemide, and torsemide, which were assessed independently, and non‐loop diuretics, and non‐diuretic antihypertensives, which were assessed as a class. Non‐loop diuretics included thiazides and potassium‐sparing diuretics. Non‐diuretic antihypertensives included angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta‐blockers, and non‐dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (list of drugs in Table S1 in supporting information). Using the prescription fill date and the days of supply, we created a supply diary. The supply diary assessed whether beneficiaries had possession of bumetanide, furosemide, torsemide, non‐loop diuretics, or non‐diuretic antihypertensives each day of the exposure assessment window. If patients filled a prescription before the previous one ran out, it was assumed that they began using the new prescription after completing the previous one.

We defined time‐dependent exposures using two different approaches used in peer‐reviewed literature. In the first set of analyses, for each 30‐day interval, we evaluated whether an individual had possession of each of the drug groups of interest (bumetanide, furosemide, torsemide, non‐loop diuretics, and non‐diuretic antihypertensives). An individual was considered to have used a drug in a given 30‐day interval if they had possession of the drug at least 1 day of the interval, regardless of the dose used. In this manner, we created time‐dependent indicator variables denoting use of bumetanide, furosemide, torsemide, non‐loop diuretics, and non‐diuretic antihypertensives for each 30‐day interval of the study period. In the second set of analyses, we summed the number of 30‐day intervals that a patient had used each drug group of interest, thus creating a variable that represented total months of possession of each of the drug groups up to that point. This approach enabled us to code time‐dependent continuous cumulative exposure variables denoting the number of 30‐day intervals that an individual had used these medications. We divided the resulting variables by 12 to express the cumulative use of medications in 1‐year increments and improve interpretability of the findings.

WARNINGS

Volume and Electrolyte Depletion

The dose of bumetanide should be adjusted to the patient's need. Excessive doses or too frequent administration can lead to profound water loss, electrolyte depletion, dehydration, reduction in blood volume and circulatory collapse with the possibility of vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients.

Hypokalemia

Hypokalemia can occur as a consequence of bumetanide administration. Prevention of hypokalemia requires particular attention in the following conditions: patients receiving digitalis and diuretics for congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, states of aldosterone excess with normal renal function, potassium-losing nephropathy, certain diarrheal states, or other states where hypokalemia is thought to represent particular added risks to the patient, i.e., history of ventricular arrhythmias.

In patients with hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, sudden alterations of electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy and coma. Treatment in such patients is best initiated in the hospital with small doses and careful monitoring of the patient's clinical status and electrolyte balance. Supplemental potassium and/or spironolactone may prevent hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis in these patients.

Ototoxicity

In cats, dogs and guinea pigs, bumetanide has been shown to produce ototoxicity. In these test animals bumetanide was 5 to 6 times more potent than furosemide and, since the diuretic potency of bumetanide is about 40 to 60 times furosemide, it is anticipated that blood levels necessary to produce ototoxicity will rarely be achieved. The potential exists, however, and must be considered a risk of intravenous therapy, especially at high doses, repeated frequently in the face of renal excretory function impairment. Potentiation of aminoglycoside ototoxicity has not been tested for bumetanide. Like other members of this class of diuretics, bumetanide probably shares this risk.

Allergy to Sulfonamides

Patients allergic to sulfonamides may show hypersensitivity to bumetanide.

Thrombocytopenia

Since there have been rare spontaneous reports of thrombocytopenia from postmarketing experience, patients should be observed regularly for possible occurrence of thrombocytopenia.

### Loop diuretics for patients receiving blood transfusions [^1124mxyD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Blood transfusions are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Prophylactic administration of loop diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide, ethacrynic acid, or torsemide) is common practice, especially among people who are at risk for circulatory overload, pulmonary oedema or both.

Objectives

This review aimed to determine if the prophylactic administration of loop diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide, ethacrynic acid, or torsemide) provides a therapeutic advantage (that is, a favourable risk benefit ratio) in adults and children who are recipients of any blood product transfusion versus placebo, no treatment, or general fluid restriction measures.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 13 January 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing a loop diuretic in patients receiving any blood transfusion were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Results were to be expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Mean effect sizes were to be calculated using the random-effects models.

Main Results

We included four studies that involved 100 participants. Furosemide was the only diuretic investigated in all four studies. None of the included studies assessed the clinically important outcomes noted in our protocol. The studies focused on various markers of respiratory function. An improvement in fraction of inspired oxygen (in favour of furosemide) was noted in one study. An improvement in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (in favour of furosemide) was noted in two studies.

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence to determine whether premedicating people undergoing blood transfusion with loop diuretics prevents clinically important transfusion-related morbidity. Due to the continued use of prophylactic loop diuretics during transfusions, and because this review highlights the absence of evidence to justify this practice, well-conducted RCTs are needed. Given the high mortality, severe morbidity and increasing incidence of transfusion-associated circulatory overload, determining the therapeutic utility of pre-transfusion loop diuresis is an urgent need.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) — volume overload and diuretic management — states that approximately 70% of patients with ADHF have signs and symptoms of elevated ventricular filling pressures, and that loop diuretics such as furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide are the mainstay of treatment for volume overload; HF specialists should select the most appropriate agent, dose, and route, recognize the deleterious effects of excessive diuretic use and select the lowest effective dose, and when resistance occurs must reassess the plan, adjust dose, use synergistic diuretics, and initiate therapies that augment cardiac output and renal blood flow, while balancing chronic neurohumoral blockade against hemodynamic derangements during ADHF.

1.3 Heart failure

Heart failure prevalence is as high as 13% in patients over the age of 80. 30 Treatment guidelines for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, LVEF < 40%) recommend chronic use of RAAS inhibitors (ie, ACE‐i, ARB, Angiotensin Receptor‐Neprilysin Inhibitor [ARNI], aldosterone antagonists) and beta‐blockers to reduce morbidity and mortality. 30, 38 However, treatments for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, LVEF > 50%) rely largely on fluid management with diuretics and optimization of associated comorbidities. Standard therapy for HFrEF may not provide any benefit for HFpEF but seems adequate for patients with intermediate LVEF (40%‐50%). 30 On‐going assessment of treatment benefits and tolerability is necessary, along with revisiting goals of care.

Diuretics: Although loop diuretics (eg, furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide) have not demonstrated survival benefit, they remain a cornerstone of fluid management, regardless of left ventricular ejection fraction. 30 Furosemide has highly variable oral bioavailability, and switching to a more potent agent, for example, torsemide or bumetanide, may overcome diuretic resistance and reduces pill burden. 39 Maintenance diuretic therapy should be adjusted to maintain euvolemia with the use of intermittent metolazone as indicated (see Table 1). Thiazide agents may not be effective in the setting of low eGFR (less than 40 mL/min), and should be assessed for discontinuation.

RAAS inhibitors: ACE‐i/ ARBs/ARNI/aldosterone antagonists: This class of agents provides significant benefits in HFrEF; however, their role in HFpEF is limited to the management of underlying co‐morbidities (eg, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction). 30 Therapy discontinuation or pause and re‐assessment may be necessary in acute renal dysfunction, hyperkalemia or hypotension in advanced heart failure. Patients with HFrEF who tolerate an ACE‐i or ARB are highly encouraged to switch to the combination of ARB/ARNI (valsartan/sacubitril) for an additional 20% reduction in cardiovascular mortality and heart failure hospitalizations. 40

### Fracture risk in patients treated with loop diuretics [^115QFy8H]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Loop diuretics (LD) increase renal calcium excretion. Discrepant results on associations between LD and fracture risk have been reported.

Objective

To assess the fracture risk in users of LD.

Design and Subjects

A population-based pharmaco-epidemiological case-control design with fracture in year 2000 as outcome and use of LD during the previous 5 years as exposure variable. We used nationwide computerized registers to assess individual use of LD and related these data to individual fracture data and information on potential confounders. We compared 64,699 cases aged 40 years or more who sustained a fracture during year 2000 with 194,111 age- and gender-matched controls.

Results

A total of 44,001 subjects used LD. Ever use of LD was associated with a crude 51% (OR 1.51; 95% CI 1.48–1.55) increased risk of any fracture and a 72% (OR 1.72; 95% CI 1.64–1.81) increased risk of hip fracture. The risk estimates were reduced after confounder adjustment, i.e. adjusted risk of any fracture was increased by 4% (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01–1.07) and risk of hip fracture by 16% (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.10–1.23). In current users, a tendency towards a decreased fracture risk with increased dose was observed, whereas in former users risk of fracture increased with increased dose. Use of furosemide was associated with higher risk estimates than use of bumetanide.

Conclusion

Treatment with LD affects fracture risk. Special attention should be paid to patients in whom treatment with LD is initiated or stopped, as they may be at an increased risk of fracture.
