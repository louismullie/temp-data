## Question

What are the most common complications of untreated scarlet fever in pediatric patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most common complications of untreated scarlet fever in pediatric patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of scarlet fever and how antibiotics modify risk. Then, I should categorize complications into suppurative versus nonsuppurative sequelae. Next, I will quantify frequencies from high-quality surveillance and outbreak data to rank the most common complications. After that, I should verify age-specific risks and the timing of onset for nonsuppurative sequelae. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful ranking and note key modifiers like household transmission and strain virulence, while double-checking that I am not overstating rare events as common.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and why treatment matters. Scarlet fever reflects a toxin-mediated group A Streptococcus pharyngitis with an erythrogenic rash; antibiotics shorten illness, reduce transmission, and prevent complications, which is precisely why guidelines recommend treating even mild cases, so I need to ensure I frame complications as risks that rise when treatment is delayed or omitted [^17a37ccc] [^4cee3f9c].

> I will now examine the two major complication buckets: suppurative complications from local or hematogenous spread, and nonsuppurative sequelae from immune-mediated injury. Suppurative complications include peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, cervical lymphadenitis, otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia, and invasive GAS disease such as bacteremia, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, whereas nonsuppurative sequelae include acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which occur weeks after the initial infection and are driven by immune cross-reactivity rather than direct bacterial invasion [^17a37ccc] [^34150006] [^a052589a].

> Next, I should review frequency data to rank the most common complications. Wait, let me verify the best sources: large outbreak series and national surveillance provide the most reliable denominators. In the 2011 Hong Kong outbreak of 996 cases, 9 children had complications, including toxic shock syndrome, sepsis, parapharyngeal abscess, rheumatic fever, quinsy (peritonsillar abscess), and hepatitis; this implies a complication rate around 0.9%, though ascertainment may be imperfect and some sequelae manifest later than the 3-week follow-up window used in some studies, so I should be cautious not to undercount delayed-onset sequelae [^0e41d1cf]. In England's population-based surveillance during the 2014–2016 resurgence, hospital admissions for scarlet fever increased by 97%, with about 1 in 40 cases admitted for the condition or potential complications; this signals clinically significant morbidity even if not every admission maps to a distinct complication category, reinforcing that suppurative complications and severe toxin-mediated disease are the dominant drivers of hospitalization in contemporary outbreaks [^63b266e3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about rarity without context. I should double-check the timing of nonsuppurative sequelae. Acute rheumatic fever typically emerges 1 to 5 weeks after the streptococcal infection, and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis around 1 to 3 weeks, so short-follow-up outbreak studies may miss these events; nonetheless, in high-income settings, ARF incidence is very low, on the order of 0.04–0.06 per 100,000 children, whereas in LMICs and high-risk populations it remains substantial, which explains why guidelines still emphasize antibiotic treatment to prevent ARF despite low absolute risk in many HIC contexts [^01299270] [^6b844acc] [^36504142].

> Let me synthesize the most common complications in pediatric patients when scarlet fever is untreated or undertreated, keeping frequency and clinical relevance in mind. First, suppurative complications predominate: peritonsillar and retropharyngeal abscesses, cervical lymphadenitis, otitis media, and sinusitis are the recurring themes in clinical series and guidelines, with invasive GAS disease (bacteremia, cellulitis, pneumonia, necrotizing fasciitis, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome) representing the most severe, albeit less frequent, outcomes; these align with the Hong Kong outbreak profile and the English surveillance showing marked increases in hospitalizations during upsurges [^0e41d1cf] [^63b266e3] [^17a37ccc]. Second, among nonsuppurative sequelae, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is more frequently reported than acute rheumatic fever in contemporary pediatric series from high-income settings, though both are uncommon but clinically important because of potential chronic morbidity; ARF remains a major concern globally and in high-risk populations, with rheumatic heart disease as the principal long-term burden [^d5369654] [^01299270] [^bfc926a3].

> I should confirm age-related patterns and household risk, because these modify both absolute risk and prevention strategies. Scarlet fever peaks in children 3–8 years, and invasive GAS risk is highest in infants and the elderly; importantly, household contacts of scarlet fever cases have a roughly 12-fold increased risk of iGAS over 60 days, with sepsis and cellulitis the most common manifestations, which underscores why clinicians should counsel families and maintain a low threshold for evaluating symptomatic contacts [^63b266e3] [^d28379bc] [^b5b9b478].

> But wait, what if I am overstating the frequency of toxic shock syndrome? I need to check the denominator and context. In the Hong Kong outbreak, 6 of 996 cases had TSS, including 2 fatalities, which places TSS at about 0.6% of cases; while rare, it is disproportionately severe and often requires ICU-level care, so it remains a critical complication to recognize early, particularly during outbreaks with virulent emm types such as emm1 and emm12 [^0e41d1cf] [^6433d717] [^7f14bf21].

> Final ranking, keeping in mind that frequencies vary by setting and follow-up: the most common complications of untreated or undertreated scarlet fever in children are suppurative head and neck infections, namely peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, and cervical lymphadenitis, followed by otitis media and sinusitis; next in frequency are invasive GAS presentations including cellulitis, pneumonia, bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome; among nonsuppurative sequelae, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is more commonly observed than acute rheumatic fever in high-income settings, whereas ARF remains a major preventable complication globally and in high-risk populations, with rheumatic heart disease as the principal long-term consequence [^0e41d1cf] [^63b266e3] [^d5369654] [^01299270] [^bfc926a3].

---

Untreated scarlet fever in children most often leads to **suppurative complications** (peritonsillar/retropharyngeal abscess, otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia, and invasive GAS disease) [^17a37ccc] and **nonsuppurative sequelae** (acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis) [^a052589a]. Suppurative complications are more common and can occur within days to weeks, whereas nonsuppurative sequelae typically appear 1–5 weeks after infection [^01299270]. Early antibiotic therapy **reduces the risk** of these complications [^7bd28471].

---

## Suppurative complications

Suppurative complications result from **local or hematogenous spread** of GAS and are the most common complications of untreated scarlet fever [^notfound].

- **Peritonsillar abscess**: A collection of pus between the tonsil and the surrounding capsule, causing severe throat pain, drooling, trismus, and muffled voice.

- **Retropharyngeal abscess**: A deep neck space infection that can cause airway compromise, dysphagia, and systemic toxicity.

- **Otitis media**: Middle ear infection presenting with ear pain, fever, and hearing loss.

- **Sinusitis**: Infection of the paranasal sinuses, causing facial pain, nasal congestion, and purulent discharge.

- **Pneumonia**: Lung infection with cough, fever, and respiratory distress.

- **Invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) disease**: Includes bacteremia, sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), which are life-threatening conditions with high mortality rates [^bfc926a3].

---

## Nonsuppurative complications

Nonsuppurative complications are **immune-mediated** and typically occur 1–5 weeks after the initial infection [^01299270].

- **Acute rheumatic fever (ARF)**: An autoimmune reaction affecting the heart, joints, skin, and brain. It can lead to chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD), causing permanent valvular damage and heart failure [^ff8f2f91].

- **Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN)**: An immune complex-mediated kidney disease characterized by hematuria, proteinuria, edema, and hypertension. It can lead to chronic kidney disease in severe cases [^notfound].

---

## Frequency and severity of complications

The frequency and severity of complications vary depending on geographic location, socioeconomic factors, and access to healthcare. In high-income countries, **suppurative complications are more common**, whereas nonsuppurative complications are rare due to prompt antibiotic treatment [^6b844acc]. In contrast, in low- and middle-income countries, nonsuppurative complications such as ARF and PSGN remain significant public health concerns [^bfc926a3].

---

## Impact of antibiotic treatment

Early antibiotic treatment significantly **reduces the risk** of both suppurative and nonsuppurative complications [^7bd28471]. Antibiotics shorten the duration of illness, reduce transmission, and prevent the development of complications [^17a37ccc].

---

## Summary of complications

| **Complication type** | **Examples** | **Frequency** | **Severity** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Suppurative | - Peritonsillar abscess <br/> - Retropharyngeal abscess <br/> - Otitis media <br/> - Sinusitis <br/> - Pneumonia <br/> - iGAS disease | Common | Moderate to severe |
| Nonsuppurative | - Acute rheumatic fever <br/> - Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis | Rare in high-income countries <br/> Common in low-income countries | Severe |

---

Untreated scarlet fever in children can lead to significant complications, including suppurative infections and immune-mediated sequelae. Early diagnosis and **antibiotic treatment** are essential to prevent these complications and reduce morbidity and mortality [^17a37ccc].

### Managing scarlet fever [^4cee3f9c]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

Scarlet fever, an infection caused by toxin-producing strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, was associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality when epidemics were common in the 18 th and 19 th centuries throughout Europe and the USA. 1 Although this disease nearly disappeared during the 20 th century, several countries, including the UK, have recently experienced a re-emergence of scarlet fever. 1–3 However, the reason for these new outbreaks remains unclear. 1,4 Despite a general move to reduce the use of antibiotics for many mild self-limiting infections (e.g. tonsillitis, sinusitis), national guidance recommends treating people with scarlet fever with antibiotics regardless of severity of illness to speed recovery, to reduce the length of time the infection is contagious and to reduce the risk of complications. 5,6 Here, we discuss the management of scarlet fever in the UK.

### An appraisal of the clinical features of pediatric enteric fever: systematic review and meta-analysis of the age-stratified disease occurrence [^4a35550c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

CLINICAL FEATURES AND COMPLICATIONS

The clinical features of pediatric enteric fever are nonspecific and overlap with a variety of infective etiologies in endemic settings. The proportion of cases clinical suspected with enteric fever may be as low as 4% at initial presentation in ultimately blood culture–confirmed cases in children. Clinical features, complications, and outcomes differ between adults and children; even among children, differences exist between infants and older children as well as between children in Africa and Asia. A recent systematic review of clinical and laboratory features of enteric fever indicated that the risk of mortality from enteric fever is 4 times higher in children < 5 years compared with those > 5 years of age.

Generalized Systemic Features

A typical febrile response usually occurs between 5 and 15 days after exposure to the organism as demonstrated in the challenge model in adult subjects. Evidence from a recently published systematic review reported that fever is a consistent feature of pediatric enteric fever, in 97%–100% of cases, not uncommonly being the sole manifestation, presenting as a fever of unknown origin with inconclusive laboratory results. Conversely, younger children with enteric fever may sometimes present with hypothermia [Supplementary Reference 41]. The widespread and poorly regulated use of antibiotics and antipyretics in low- to middle-income country settings not only confounds the clinical picture but also serves for the origin and propagation of MDR strains of Salmonella. If untreated, the febrile response reaches its peak in the second week of illness in a characteristic "stepladder" pattern [Supplementary Reference 42]. Chills and rigors are 4 times more common in adults than in children. Relative bradycardia, a classical finding in enteric fever, is identifiable in 11%–30% of children [Supplementary References 43–47] and appears to be 15 times more likely to occur in African children than the children in Asia.

### An outbreak of scarlet fever in a primary school [^3ed6462b]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Scarlet fever, due to infection with an erythrogenic toxin-producing Group A streptococcus, is an uncommon and generally mild illness, although serious sequelae do occur. In March 2009, 57 of the 126 (45%) pupils in a primary school in Lancashire, UK developed scarlet fever over a 4-week period. Infection was transmitted via direct contact between pupils, particularly among the youngest pupils. A significant degree of transmission also occurred between siblings. The median number of days absent from school was 3 (range 1–10 days). No children were hospitalised. Control measures, including hygiene advice to the school and exclusion of pupils for 24h while initiating penicillin treatment, were ineffective. The outbreak occurred against a background of an unusually high incidence of invasive Group A streptococcal infection. While there are national guidelines for the control of invasive disease, none exist for the control of scarlet fever outbreaks. This prolonged outbreak of scarlet fever highlights the need for an evidence based approach to outbreak management.

### Resurgence of scarlet fever in england, 2014–16: a population-based surveillance study [^63b266e3]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

After decades of decreasing scarlet fever incidence, a dramatic increase was seen in England beginning in 2014. Investigations were launched to assess clinical and epidemiological patterns and identify potential causes.

Methods

In this population-based surveillance study, we analysed statutory scarlet fever notifications held by Public Health England from 1911 to 2016 in England and Wales to identify periods of sudden escalation of scarlet fever. Characteristics of cases and outbreaks in England including frequency of complications and hospital admissions were assessed and compared with the pre-upsurge period. Isolates from throat swabs were obtained and were emm typed.

Findings

Data were retrieved for our analysis between Jan 1, 1911, and Dec 31, 2016. Population rates of scarlet fever increased by a factor of three between 2013 and 2014 from 8.2 to 27.2 per 100000 (rate ratio [RR] 3.34, 95% CI 3.23–3.45; p < 0.0001); further increases were observed in 2015 (30.6 per 100000) and in 2016 (33.2 per 100000), which reached the highest number of cases (19206) and rate of scarlet fever notifcation since 1967. The median age of cases in 2014 was 4 years (IQR 3–7) with an incidence of 186 per 100000 children under age 10 years. All parts of England saw an increase in incidence, with 620 outbreaks reported in 2016. Hospital admissions for scarlet fever increased by 97% between 2013 and 2016; one in 40 cases were admitted for management of the condition or potential complications. Analysis of strains (n = 303) identified a diversity of emm types with emm3 (43%), emm12 (15%), emm1 (11%), and emm4 (9%) being the most common. Longitudinal analysis identified 4-yearly periodicity in population incidence of scarlet fever but of consistently lower magnitude than the current escalation.

Interpretation

England is experiencing an unprecedented rise in scarlet fever with the highest incidence for nearly 50 years. Reasons for this escalation are unclear and identifying these remains a public health priority.

### Evaluation of poststreptococcal illness [^a052589a]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, scarlet fever, and rarely asymptomatic carrier states are associated with a number of poststreptococcal suppurative and nonsuppurative complications. As in streptococcal pharyngitis, acute rheumatic fever, pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection, and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis most often occur in children. The hallmarks of rheumatic fever include arthritis, carditis, cutaneous disease, chorea, and subsequent acquired valvular disease. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders encompass a subgroup of illnesses involving the basal ganglia in children with obsessive-compulsive disorders, tic disorders, dystonia, chorea encephalitis, and dystonic choreoathetosis. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is most frequently encountered in children between two and six years of age with a recent history of pharyngitis and a rash in the setting of poor personal hygiene during the winter months. The clinical examination of a patient with possible poststreptococcal complications should begin with an evaluation for signs of inflammation (i.e., complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) and evidence of a preceding streptococcal infection. Antistreptolysin O titers should be obtained to confirm a recent invasive streptococcal infection. Other important antibody markers include antihyaluronidase, antideoxyribonuclease B, and antistreptokinase antibodies.

### Clinical guidance for scarlet fever… [^17a37ccc]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Many pathogens can cause acute pharyngitis with a rash.
- A scarlet fever diagnosis requires testing for group A Streptococcus.
- Confirm a negative rapid antigen detection test with a throat culture for symptomatic children aged 3 years or older.
- Treat scarlet fever with antibiotics. Other symptoms The face may appear flushed and the area around the mouth may appear pale. A yellowish white coating with red papillae may initially cover the tongue. The eventual disappearance of the coating can result in a "strawberry tongue". Negative RADT Children older than 3 years: Healthcare providers should follow up a negative RADT with a throat culture. Have a mechanism in place to contact the family and initiate antibiotics if the back-up throat culture is positive. Giving antibiotics to children with confirmed scarlet fever with pharyngitis can reduce their risk of developing acute rheumatic fever.

All other ages: Throat culture after a negative RADT isn't routinely indicated. Acute rheumatic fever is very rare in these age groups. Treatment Patients with scarlet fever, regardless of age, who have a positive RADT or throat culture need antibiotics. Don't treat pharyngitis with a viral exanthema with antibiotics. Benefits of antibiotics Using a recommended antibiotic regimen to treat scarlet fever:

- Shortens the duration of symptoms
- Reduces the likelihood of transmission to close contacts
- Prevents the development of complications. Complications Rarely, complications can occur after scarlet fever. Suppurative complications Suppurative complications result from local or hematogenous spread of the organism. They can include:

- Cervical lymphadenitis
- Invasive group A strep disease
- Peritonsillar abscesses
- Retropharyngeal abscess.

Nonsuppurative sequelae When occurring with group A strep pharyngitis, nonsuppurative sequelae of scarlet fever include: Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can also occur after scarlet fever associated with group A strep skin infections. These complications occur after the original infection resolves and involve sites distant to the initial group A strep infection site. They're thought to be the result of the immune response and not of direct group A strep infection.

### Management of fever in infants and children [^afdb2b81]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

There is no question that fever is a source of great consternation for parent and physician alike; however, it is impossible to predict with certainty the outcome of every febrile illness. Inherent in the words diagnostic impression is a degree of uncertainty. The only question remaining is how much uncertainty is in the best interest of the child. Physicians try to use the existing scientific data to best determine the prevalence of disease and outcome. At the same time, they must recognize the limitations of both the data and their ability to be generalized to every population. Everything clinicians do has risks and costs, which they must balance against the incidence of complications and the benefits of testing. To take away clinical judgment makes physicians technicians not clinicians.

### The impact of national guidelines on the diagnostics of sore throat in children [^6b844acc]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pharyngitis is a common reason for seeking medical advice. The majority of pharyngitis cases are caused by viruses, and approximately 24–37% of children's pharyngitis is caused by Group A β-haemolytic streptococci (GAS). In high-income countries, rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease are rare complications of GAS infections, but they still impose a large disease burden in low-income countries. GAS pharyngitis can lead to suppurative complications, such as peritonsillar and retropharyngeal abscess, as well as toxin-mediated complications, scarlet fever, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. These complications are rare in high-income countries, and GAS is usually self-limited; therefore, antibiotic treatment should not be started to only prevent suppurative complications or relieve symptoms in patients with mild symptoms.

The Finnish treatment guidelines for sore throat were updated in June 2020, and the Centor score was presented as a diagnostic tool for GAS pharyngitis. According to the Centor criteria, one point is given for each of the following symptoms and clinical findings: absence of cough, tender and swollen submandibular lymph nodes, tonsillar exudate or swollen tonsils, and fever ≥ 38˚C. In the guideline update Centor score is recommended to use to direct antibiotic treatment to patients with more severe symptoms and higher likelihood of GAS. Patients with mild symptoms and Centor score (0–2) are recommended to be treated symptomatically and patients with severe symptoms (3–4) are recommended to be treated based on microbiological test results. A new guideline for microbiological testing of GAS was also provided. The new guidelines recommend using a rapid antigen detection test in patients with a Centor score of 3 or more. Throat culture should only be used in patients with prolonged symptoms or in epidemic situations. The guidelines also recommend against using C-reactive protein (CRP) tests in the diagnosis of pharyngitis, as they are ineffective at distinguishing viral from bacterial pathogens.

The aim of this study was to determine how the publication of the updated Finnish Current Care Guidelines affected treatment for pediatric patients, particularly the use of the Centor criteria, CRP tests, and microbiological testing in the diagnosis of GAS tonsillitis.

### Invasive group A streptococcal disease [^7a147cb9]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

We report on two children who had presented in a poor clinical state after an initial bout of cough, sore throat and fever for a few days. Both of them had multisystemic involvement with fluid-refractory septic shock requiring ionotropic support, intubation and care in the paediatric intensive care unit. Recent significant rise in scarlet fever has led to a significant increase in the number of invasive group A streptococcal infections with increased mortality in paediatric patients. Both of them had co-infection with influenza, which could have led to an increased risk of invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) infection. After prompt treatment, including early initiation of antibiotics, they both recovered well. To our knowledge, there are no reported cases of iGAS infection from the UK in any medical journal though the fatal cases have been reported to the health statistics department by various National Health Service trusts individually.

### Scarlet fever epidemic, hong kong, 2011 [^9b02647e]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Scarlet fever is caused by infection with Streptococcus pyogenes and mainly affects children. An upsurge of scarlet fever occurred in Hong Kong, People's Republic of China, in 2011, exceeding baseline annual incidence rates for the previous 2 decades. We investigated possible changes in clinical severity, transmissibility, and characteristics of the causative pathogen for this outbreak.

### Scarlet fever epidemic, hong kong, 2011 [^2a926b26]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

In June 2011, the Department of Microbiology of the University of Hong Kong announced the discovery of a unique 48-kb insertion sequence in the genome of S. pyogenes isolated from a blood specimen from a 7-year-old girl who died of scarlet fever. We tested for this insert in a sample of strains collected during 2008–2011 using the method provided by the University of Hong Kong.

During January 1–July 31, 2011, a total of 996 cases of scarlet fever were reported, greatly exceeding the annual number of cases reported during 2008 (235), 2009 (187), and 2010 (128). Outbreak activity in 2011 peaked at week 26 (week ending June 25) (Figure 1). During the outbreak period (January–July 2011), the annualized incidence rate was 24.0/100,000 population, ≈9× higher than the average annualized incidence rate of 2.62/100,000 population during the baseline period of 2008–2010. During the previous 2 decades, baseline annual incidence rates ranged from 0.0351 to 3.37 cases/100,000 population.

Figure 1
Weekly number of scarlet fever cases, by onset date, Hong Kong, January–July 2011. White bars indicate clinically diagnosed but not laboratory-confirmed cases; solid bars indicate laboratory-confirmed cases. Solid triangle indicates May 30 dissemination of press release about first fatal case (in a 7-year-old girl); open triangle indicates June 21 dissemination of press release about second fatal case (in a 5-year-old boy); circle indicates June 23 launch of health education campaign.

Table 1 compares the epidemiologic features, clinical features, and laboratory results for scarlet fever cases reported during 2011 and 2008–2010. Highest incidence (547 cases/100,000 population) was reported for children 4–7 years of age (Table 1). Clinical features, complications, and case-fatality rate for cases reported in 2011 were largely comparable to those reported during the baseline period. The proportion of case-patients requiring hospitalization during 2011 was lower, and mean duration of hospital stay was ≈0.5 days shorter than for the baseline period. Details of the 9 complicated cases are shown in Table 2.

### Maternal mastitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome risk from breastfeeding children with scarlet fever: case report and literature review [^80a247da]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Lactational mastitis is a common condition during breastfeeding, which, in rare cases, can progress to life-threatening necrotising mastitis, particularly in cases where Streptococcus pyogenes is involved. The development of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is associated with a fatality rate of approximately 50%. In this Grand Round, we present the case of a healthy mother, aged 35 years, breastfeeding a child diagnosed with scarlet fever. The mother subsequently developed lactational mastitis, with a high load of S pyogenes, culminating in skin necrosis and STSS. This case, along with six more case reports identified in a thorough literature search, underscores the severity of lactational S pyogenes mastitis. In all cases, the only identifiable risk factor for invasive S pyogenes disease was close contact to individuals exhibiting symptoms of scarlet fever. During breastfeeding, the direct contact of the nipple to the child's pharynx, containing S pyogenes in the case of scarlet fever, presents a probable route of transmission, especially when considering the pathogenicity of the bacterium. Although breastfeeding is generally encouraged, the current literature lacks sufficient guidance regarding breastfeeding practices in children with scarlet fever. This Grand Round proposes a simple strategy to minimise maternal risks, offering valuable insights into clinical management and prevention.

### Early diagnosis and treatment of toxic shock syndrome in paediatric burns [^92d2f9ee]. Burns (2005). Low credibility.

Young children with burns are at risk of developing toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which is an exotoxin mediated disease usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The diagnosis of TSS is difficult because in the early stages the signs and symptoms resemble other common childhood illnesses such as scarlet fever. If the condition is not treated promptly it has a high mortality. The South West Regional Paediatric Burns Unit at Frenchay Hospital admits 150–200 burns per year. We have designed a protocol to facilitate the early diagnosis and treatment of TSS. We report our experience over a 3-year period in which almost one quarter of cases of TSS were admitted from home or another hospital. During this period all children with TSS survived and none needed ventilatory support. Typical cases presented within 2 days of thermal injury, in a child under 2 years old with a burn of less than 10% of body surface area (BSA).

### Epidemiology of reemerging scarlet fever, hong kong, 2005–2015 [^0c1ac13c]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Scarlet fever cases continued to occur in Hong Kong at elevated incidence rates for 5 consecutive years after a major epidemic in 2011. Scarlet fever incidence is higher among younger children entering schools and during school days. School-based control measures, especially for boys 3–5 years of age, could be particularly important in scarlet fever control. A limitation of our study is that we relied on reported cases to study scarlet fever epidemiology, and subclinical infections might have occurred. Moreover, some uncaptured or unobserved factors not considered in this study might have influenced the trend observed. Further community-based studies, including serologic studies, might further elucidate the epidemiology of this reemerging disease.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^9c735ae0]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Chronic Q fever — risk groups and predominant syndromes are summarized as follows: persons who are at high risk for development of chronic Q fever include persons with preexisting valvular heart disease, vascular grafts, or arterial aneurysms; infection during pregnancy and immunosuppression (e.g., from chemotherapy) are both conditions that have been linked to chronic Q fever development; endocarditis and infections of aneurysms or vascular prostheses are the most common forms of chronic Q fever and generally are fatal if untreated; chronic Q fever is rarely reported in children; and in contrast with adults, osteomyelitis is one of the most common findings in children with pediatric chronic Q fever.

### Increased risk for invasive group A Streptococcus disease for household contacts of scarlet fever cases, england, 2011–2016 [^d28379bc]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The incidence of scarlet fever in England and Wales is at its highest in 50 years. We estimated secondary household risk for invasive group A Streptococcus (iGAS) disease within 60 days after onset of scarlet fever. Reports of scarlet fever in England during 2011–2016 were matched by residential address to persons with laboratory-confirmed iGAS infections. We identified 11 iGAS cases in ≈189,684 household contacts and a 60-day incidence rate of 35.3 cases/100,000 person-years, which was 12.2-fold higher than the background rate (2.89). Infants and contacts > 75 years of age were at highest risk. Three cases were fatal; sepsis and cellulitis were the most common manifestations. Typing for 6 iGAS cases identified emm 1.0 (n = 4), emm 4.0 (n = 1), and emm 12.0 (n = 1). Although absolute risk in household contacts was low, clinicians assessing household contacts should be aware of the risk to expedite diagnosis and initiate life-saving treatment.

### Increased risk for invasive group A Streptococcus disease for household contacts of scarlet fever cases, england, 2011–2016 [^765dfde5]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

We used clinical reports of scarlet fever and recognized that a proportion of reported cases might have had other infections, which has the potential to influence the risk estimate in either direction. Although only ≈50% of scarlet fever consultations in primary care in England are formally reported, this finding would not influence the risk estimate because it was based on iGAS cases that occurred in contacts of only the reported cohort. We did not capture the burden of disease associated with severe noninvasive GAS infections (GAS isolated from a nonsterile site), although these infections are estimated to comprise only 1% of all severe GAS infections.

We assessed the risk for secondary iGAS infection for household contacts to be low. However, potential severity is high. The prodrome for iGAS infection can be nonspecific, and the disease can progress rapidly; therefore, increasing the index of suspicion in specific circumstances or groups at increased risk might expedite diagnosis and commencement of life-saving treatment. Offering antimicrobial drug prophylaxis to household contacts to eradicate carriage and treat incipient infection could reduce the risk for iGAS infection. However, the unintended consequences of large-scale increased use of antimicrobial drugs, heightened patient anxiety, the effect on GP workload, and the lack of evidence on effectiveness make this option disproportionate given the low overall risk estimated. Antimicrobial drug prophylaxis could be targeted to high-risk contacts, such as elderly persons and infants. However, there is considerable uncertainty for the risk estimate for these groups because of the small number of secondary iGAS cases. Providing information on signs and symptoms of iGAS infection to patients or parents at the point of scarlet fever diagnosis to accelerate self-referral for medical assessment could be effective but has the potential to increase anxiety for many persons and increase presentations of worried healthy persons to GPs and emergency departments at scale. Increasing awareness among frontline clinicians assessing patients of this increased risk to improve early identification and treatment of cases is perhaps the most proportionate and feasible response on the basis of available data. Information could also be made available to the public through patient-facing websites provided that messages are worded carefully so as not to increase anxiety.

### Scarlet fever upsurge in england and molecular-genetic analysis in north-west london, 2014 [^7f14bf21]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Emm 4 isolates are associated with pharyngitis in children; these isolates are entirely acapsular, a phenotype linked to enhanced adhesion to surfaces. Whether this characteristic can increase persistence and transmission is unknown. Surges in scarlet fever are believed to require a population susceptible to pharyngeal infection with specific strain types and specific superantigens. Both emm 3 and emm 4 strains in our study possessed 2 prophage-associated superantigens, either SPEA and SSA, or SPEC and SSA. Although these toxin genes were found in emm 3 and emm 4 strains not associated with scarlet fever, the probability of triggering scarlet fever may be enhanced through production of 2 such superantigens. An association between these superantigens and scarlet fever has been reported.

Periodic increases in scarlet fever are well recognized, although the magnitude of the upsurge in the United Kingdom was unexpected. Consultation rates for sore throat diminished in the 1990s, and the 2008 UK national guidelines advise against diagnostic testing and recommend a policy of nonprescribing or delayed prescribing for sore throat when the Centor score is < 3. These recommendations contrast with those of North America and of some European countries. Whether exceeding a threshold level of community S. pyogenes transmission is required for such a marked upsurge is unclear; increased scarlet fever activity was not reported elsewhere in Europe, to our knowledge. Apart from natural fluctuations in population immunity, emergence of hypertransmissible lineages, acquisition of novel phage-encoded toxins, or antimicrobial drug resistance may contribute to scarlet fever surges. Notably, isolates we found associated with scarlet fever were not resistant to common antimicrobial agents.

As part of the national response, clinicians were advised to treat scarlet fever to minimize complications and reduce transmission. Whether use of more refined molecular diagnostics could assist future community prevention and management of S. pyogenes infection will require careful evaluation. Increased scarlet fever activity has continued in England in 2015 and 2016, underscoring the need for ongoing surveillance and further investigation.

### Are invasive group A streptococcal infections preventable by antibiotic therapy? a collaborative retrospective study [^21b61b8e]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The only other data we are aware of that also investigated whether the invasive GAS disease may have been prevented by antibiotic therapy of preceding GAS-compatible illness is reported from the pediatric children's hospital in Bern, Switzerland. The authors found that 5 (10%) of 51 children had a physician visit because of pharyngitis and/or scarlet fever within > 24 hours before invasive GAS hospitalization. Like our study, only 2 of these 5 patients (ie, 4% of the total) did not receive an antibiotic; one could argue that these 2 instances had been missed opportunities to prevent later hospitalization for invasive GAS.

Our study has some limitations, mainly its retrospective design and the limited number of patients. Another limitation is a possible recall bias regarding the information obtained from the parents through structured telephone interviews. To reduce this bias, we first interviewed the parents and if there was uncertainty, we called the treating pediatrician for the missing information. Despite the use of several available data sources (medical records, parents and pediatricians), the completeness of the data varied, which may limit interpretation of our findings. However, with regards to the main study objective, we believe that we did not miss a meaningful number of missed treatment opportunities for local GAS disease preceding invasive GAS disease. Strengths of the study are the multidisciplinary approach with 3 different pediatric centers and the focus on the association of GAS-compatible diseases preceding invasive GAS.

### Scarlet fever epidemic, hong kong, 2011 [^ab57f174]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The Study

Scarlet fever is a statutory notifiable disease in Hong Kong. A clinical case is defined as illness in a person who has clinical features of scarlet fever (fever and fine, sandpaper rash of characteristic distribution that blanches on pressure, with or without strawberry tongue, desquamation, or sore throat). A confirmed case is defined as a clinical case with positive throat or wound culture for S. pyogenes or antistreptolysin titer > 200.

Epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected by standard questionnaire for every reported case. A cluster was defined as > 2 cases in persons sharing the same residential or school address within the incubation period. We compared epidemiologic, clinical, and microbiological features of the scarlet fever cases from January–July 2011 (outbreak period) with features of those reported during 2008–2010 (baseline period). We used SPSS version 14.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) for analyses; p < 0.05 was considered significant.

For comparison, we performed a retrospective review of hospital discharge records kept by public hospitals. We extracted records of patients hospitalized during January 2008–July 2011 who had diagnoses that are known complications of scarlet fever, including toxic shock syndrome, acute rheumatic fever, and acute glomerulonephritis. These cases were reviewed to determine whether the complications were related to scarlet fever.

Bacterial culture of S. pyogenes was performed on diagnostic specimens in hospital laboratories and the Public Health Laboratory Centre of the Department of Health; the latter serves as the diagnostic and public health reference laboratory in Hong Kong. Antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing, emm typing, and detection of various virulence genes were performed at the Public Health Laboratory Centre on S. pyogenes isolates received during 2011 and archived during 2008–2010. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed on the basis of the gram-positive protocol, and PFGE profiles were analyzed by using BioNumerics 5.0 software (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium).

### Are invasive group A streptococcal infections preventable by antibiotic therapy? a collaborative retrospective study [^4bde53f8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Patient Characteristics and Clinical Findings on Admission

We identified a total of 78 patients hospitalized for invasive GAS, of which 63 fulfilled the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1).

FIGURE 1.
Flowchart of patient selection.

Patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. Denominators vary because the available information was not complete for all patients. Six (10%) of 62 had an underlying disease but none was immunosuppressed. The most common clinical feature of invasive GAS disease was fever (95%), with a median duration of 4 days and a range of 0 to more than 10 days before admission. Signs and symptoms suggestive of local GAS infections, such as sore throat or typical rash for scarlet fever, were less common than unspecific signs and symptoms (Table 1).

TABLE 1.
Characteristics and Clinical Presentation on Hospital Admission

Seven (16%) of 43 patients with iGAS disease had a known contact with GAS, usually in a family member, but none had contact with a case of iGAS disease.

Clinical and Microbiologic Diagnosis

The predominant presentations of invasive GAS disease were bloodstream infections, pneumonia (mostly with pleura empyema; 12/14 cases) and mastoiditis (Table 1). About 21 (33%) of 63 patients had more than 1 invasive GAS disease manifestation.

Invasive GAS disease was confirmed by the isolation of GAS from the following specimens of sterile body sites: surgical soft tissue samples, that is, abscesses (n = 25); positive cultures of blood (n = 18); pleural fluid (n = 12); bone samples (n = 6); joint fluid (n = 5); muscle tissue (n = 4); and cerebrospinal fluid (n = 1). In 10 patients GAS was isolated from 2 body sites.

In 3 patients with the clinical presentation of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, GAS was only isolated from a nonsterile site, that is, the pharynx (n = 3).

### "Sickle cell disease in the emergency department: atypical complications and management" [^19777461]. Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited blood disorder in the United States. This disorder of hemoglobin structure leads to a chronic hemolytic anemia and complex chronic disease manifested by sudden, severe, and life-threatening complications. These acute complications can occur in any organ system beginning in early childhood and lasting throughout life. The intermittent nature and acuity of these complications lend the emergency department to be an important site of care. The hallmark of sickle cell disease is the vasoocclusive painful event. Other more "typical" complications include fever, acute chest syndrome, priapism, and ischemic stroke. Children with sickle cell disease can also present with other "atypical" complications that can have devastating consequences if they are unrecognized. Detailed discussion of these "atypical" sickle cell disease complications, organized by organ system involved, will be the focus of this article.

### Strep A: challenges, opportunities, vaccine-based solutions, and economics [^36504142]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Streptococcus pyogenes (also referred to herein as Strep A or S. pyogenes) is estimated to be the fifth-leading cause of infectious disease deaths globally, behind the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Plasmodium falciparum, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (although the advent of SARS-CoV-2 has likely pushed it to sixth place). Infections from Strep A occur across the entire age spectrum and result in perhaps the most diverse range of acute and chronic clinical manifestations of any known pathogen –. These include pharyngitis, impetigo, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, sepsis, maternal sepsis, scarlet fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, acute rheumatic fever (ARF), and rheumatic heart disease (RHD).

While Strep A infections are common globally, the burden of Strep A diseases varies widely according to country income level, socioeconomic and demographic composition of the local population, health system quality, and other factors. In high-income settings, for example, Strep A infection commonly manifests as pharyngitis (sore throat), which is typically treated with antibiotics quite effectively. Successful treatment of pharyngitis at this early stage can prevent rheumatic fever and may reduce the risk of invasive disease transmission to household contacts, although evidence that it can prevent other serious Strep A diseases is lacking. Recent major upsurges in invasive Strep A infections have shown that penicillin alone will not control major outbreaks, and real-life experience in New Zealand shows that intensive antibiotic treatment of Strep A sore throat can reduce, at best, only about one-quarter of ARF episodes, at a cost that is unaffordable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In addition, the proliferation of antibiotics used to treat pharyngitis presumed to be caused by Strep A introduces the real risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) both in the target Strep A organism but also in bystander pathogens where AMR is an even greater concern. Worse still, severe Strep A manifestations, such as RHD, disproportionately affect populations in low-resource settings and, consequently, perpetuate social inequities. During 2015–2017 in Australia, for example, the incidence rate of new first diagnosis of RHD among Indigenous people younger than 45 years of age was roughly 50 times higher than that of non-Indigenous people (45.5 vs. 0.9 cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively). Overall, the incidence of invasive Strep A infection has increased in several regions of the world during the past two decades –, and the health burden of Strep A is similar to, or higher than, that of other pathogens for which vaccines have recently been developed and successfully implemented (e.g. meningococcus).

### High diagnostic accuracy of automated rapid strep A test reduces antibiotic prescriptions for children in the United Arab Emirates [^c41cd981]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a rapidly-growing global health threat. Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens increase the burden of both healthcare-associated and community-acquired infections, leading to increased healthcare utilization and high mortality. Inappropriate antibiotic use in community and healthcare settings is a major driver of antibiotic resistance worldwide.

Recent estimates suggest that over 700,000 people die annually from antibiotic-resistant infections globally. International agencies have warned that in the absence of a coordinated global response to this epidemic, the death toll from drug-resistant infections could climb to 10 million annually, forcing 24 million people globally into extreme poverty (World Health Organization. New report calls for urgent action to avert antimicrobial resistance crisis. 2019).

Children are often prescribed antibiotics for potential streptococcal pharyngitis when in fact their signs and symptoms are suggestive of viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). It has been demonstrated that antibiotic prescribing practices vary by country and by provider specialty. Inappropriate antibiotic use results in increased rates of AMR and increased healthcare utilization due to adverse drug reactions.

Acute pharyngitis due to Streptococcus pyogenes or group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS) is diagnosed in up to 37% of children with pharyngitis and requires antibiotic treatment. This has been traditionally thought of as an infection of school-age children; however, a recent meta-analysis estimated the prevalence of GAS pharyngitis in children under 5 years at 25%, supporting diagnostic testing in this age group when clinically indicated.

GAS is a leading global pathogen of infectious diseases. The spectrum of GAS disease extends from superficial infections (pharyngitis, impetigo) to invasive disease (abscesses, cellulitis, sepsis), toxin-mediated manifestations (scarlet fever, toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis) and autoimmune sequelae (acute rheumatic fever [ARF], poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and rheumatic heart disease [RHD]). The most frequent manifestation of GAS infection is pharyngitis, with over 600 million new cases diagnosed per year and complications from invasive GAS disease resulting in 500,000 deaths globally.

Results

Comparison of the 2011 Epidemic and 2006–2010 Cluster Outbreaks

According to NNIDSS, the annual number of scarlet fever cases in Beijing during 2006–2010 ranged from 1,193 to 2,264, and annual incidence rates ranged from 7.0 cases to 14.3 cases/100,000 population. In 2011, however, the number of scarlet fever cases in Beijing rose to 6,152, and the incidence rate rose to 31.4 cases/100,000 population. Peak monthly incidence rates in 2011 were 2.9–6.7 times those in 2006–2010. During the epidemic and during 2006–2010, scarlet fever cases peaked twice yearly: 1 peak occurred in early summer, and a second, less pronounced peak occurred in winter, except in 2010, when the winter peak was more pronounced (Figure, panel A).

Figure
Scarlet fever incidence, Beijing, China, 2006–2011, as reported in the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Surveillance System. A) Number of cases and incidence rate by month. B) Incidence rate by age. C) Incidence rate by sex.

Scarlet fever primarily affected children 3–8 years of age during the epidemic and nonepidemic years (Figure, panel B). During these years, the ratio of males to females in Beijing was 1.5:1.8, respectively, and the annual incidence of scarlet fever was persistently higher among males than females (Figure, panel C).

In Beijing, a cluster of scarlet fever was defined as onset of > 2 clinical cases within a 7-day period in a school or kindergarten. According to this definition, 37–131 clusters (85–316 cases) occurred during 2006–2010 in Beijing, and 401 clusters (1,116 cases) occurred during 2011. In addition, case-patient follow-up showed that all cases reported during May–December, 2011, were fully resolved 3 weeks after illness onset without complications.

### Editorial commentary: step on the GAS: are we almost there for clindamycin and intravenous immunoglobulin? [^72a40462]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Recent outbreaks of scarlet fever, and increased maternal deaths due to invasive streptococcal disease are poignant reminders that group A Streptococcus (GAS) remains a global threat to human health. Thankfully, GAS remains susceptible to penicillin, which is usually sufficient for the majority of patients infected with GAS. However, what to do in the minority of patients who develop severe invasive GAS (iGAS), typified by streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and necrotizing fasciitis, remains an enigma. The questions facing treating physicians are what adjunctive therapy should be administered, and at what point during the course of the illness? Two particular therapies for severe iGAS infection have been debated over the last 2 decades: clindamycin and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The other area of ambiguity is whether clinicians should provide antibiotics for close contacts of patients with iGAS. Secondary iGAS may have devastating consequences; however, there is much variation in the recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis. A study by Carapetis et al, in the current issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases, hopes to clarify these controversies. The authors admirably set out to answer 3 questions: (1) Does the addition of clindamycin to a β-lactam antibiotic improve mortality? (2) Does additional IVIG improve mortality? (3) Does the risk of secondary iGAS in close contacts justify use of prophylaxis?

### Group A streptococcal septicaemia presenting as an acute abdomen in a child [^b4176e74]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

Group A streptococcus is one of the most frequent pathogens in humans, a normal upper respiratory tract commensal in 5–15% of normal individuals, responsible for a broad spectrum of clinical entities, the most commonly occurring illnesses being streptococcal tonsillitis, scarlet fever and more rarely, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). First described at the end of the last century, STSS (Group A streptococcal infection associated with the early onset of shock and organ failure.) carries a significant morbidity and mortality (up to 70%), is more common in adults than children and is increasingly being reported in patients who have no predisposing factors. Over the last 15 years however, there has been a significant increase in the incidence and severity of infections caused by Group A Strep, including STSS seen in children, thought to be a response to more virulent and resistant strains of the bacteria evolving. It is more likely to mimic peritonitis than appendicitis, and is therefore an essential differential to be borne in mind when confronted with a peritonitic, rapidly deteriorating previously well child following an initial upper respiratory tract infection, which has failed to improve despite simple medical management.

There are very few case reports of children with Group Strep A. presenting as Appendicitis. We have come across only 3–4 case reports in English literature from 1965. Hence we would like to re-emphasis the need to keep this medical condition on our differential diagnosis while treating appendicitis.

Q fever — Chronic clinical features and risk groups highlight that persons who are at high risk for development of chronic Q fever include persons with preexisting valvular heart disease, vascular grafts, or arterial aneurysms. Infection during pregnancy and immunosuppression (e.g., from chemotherapy) are both conditions that have been linked to chronic Q fever development. Endocarditis and infections of aneurysms or vascular prostheses are the most common forms of chronic Q fever and generally are fatal if untreated. Chronic Q fever is rarely reported in children, and in contrast with adults, osteomyelitis is one of the most common findings in children with chronic Q fever.

Fever is the most common reason that children and infants are brought to emergency departments. Emergency physicians face the challenge of quickly distinguishing benign from life-threatening conditions. The management of fever in children is guided by the patient's age, immunization status, and immune status as well as the results of a careful physical examination and appropriate laboratory tests and radiographic views. In this article, the evaluation and treatment of children with fevers of known and unknown origin are described. Causes of common and dangerous conditions that include fever in their manifestation are also discussed.

### Panton-valentine leukocidin is associated with exacerbated skin manifestations and inflammatory response in children with community-associated staphylococcal scarlet fever [^e69d7c92]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Staphylococcal scarlet fever (SSF), a rare disease, was first described in 1900. The clinical features and outcomes in children with SSF caused by Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-positive and PVL-negative Staphylococcus aureus strains have not been compared prospectively.

Methods

The demographic data, selected clinical features, laboratory values, and outcomes for 49 consecutive children with community-acquired S. aureus SSF prospectively identified during an 11-year period were collected for analysis.

Results

The male-to-female ratio was 1.88, and the median age of the patients was 37 months. Cutaneous abscesses predominated among children with SSF. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) caused SSF in 26 and 23 children, respectively. Twenty-four isolates had results that were positive for PVL (5 MSSA and 19 MRSA isolates), and 25 had results that were negative for PVL (21 MSSA and 4 MRSA isolates). Polymerase chain reaction revealed that most (92%) contained only staphylococcal enterotoxin B (23 MSSA and 22 MRSA isolates). By multivariate analysis, children with PVL-positive isolates had significantly larger abscess sizes, higher white blood cell counts, higher C-reactive protein levels, and longer durations of fever, generalized scarlatiniform rashes, and hospital stays. Most (17 isolates; 89%) of the 19 PVL-positive MRSA isolates carried the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec V(T) and all were multilocus sequence type 59.

Conclusion

SSF caused by PVL-positive S. aureus strains were associated with more-exacerbated skin manifestations and a greater systemic inflammatory response, compared with those cases caused by PVL-negative S. aureus. Clinical improvement after incision and drainage was achieved for most children with SSF caused by PVL-positive MRSA strains, despite treatment with an ineffective antibiotic.

### Anterior uveitis as an early diagnostic marker in incomplete Kawasaki disease [^399257e8]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Kawasaki disease (KD) is a challenging vasculitis affecting children, characterized by systemic inflammation and a predilection for the coronary arteries, leadin to significant acquired heart disease. Timely diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications such as coronary artery lesions (CALs) and myocardial infarction. However, incomplete Kawasaki disease (IKD), presenting with fewer classical symptoms, poses a diagnostic dilemma, often delaying appropriate management. The current diagnostic criteria for KD include fever lasting ≥ 5 days accompanied by at least four of the following: mucosal changes, conjunctival injection, rash, extremity changes, and cervical lymphadenopathy.

One of the major challenges in diagnosing IKD is the variability in clinical presentations, particularly in younger patients. These patients often exhibit nonspecific symptoms that overlap with other pediatric febrile illnesses, making it difficult to distinguish IKD from conditions such as viral infections, bacterial sepsis, or scarlet fever. Furthermore, in the absence of clear-cut diagnostic criteria, many cases are only recognized after coronary artery involvement has developed, complicating treatment and increasing the risk of long-term cardiac sequelae. Hence, there is a critical need for additional diagnostic tools that can help detect IKD earlier in its course, even before the classical symptoms or complications arise. Given these challenges, there is a need for additional diagnostic markers to aid in the identification of IKD.

Anterior uveitis (AU), although uncommon in KD, has garnered interest as a potential diagnostic adjunct for IKD due to its possible association with earlier diagnosis. AU presents as inflammation of the anterior segment of the eye, which can be detected via slit-lamp examination. While AU is not typically one of the primary symptoms of KD, its presence in some IKD cases could signal an underlying systemic inflammation related to KD, potentially manifesting before other classical signs. Therefore, it may serve as a unique and early clinical clue in patients with IKD, helping to differentiate it from other febrile illnesses and triggering earlier diagnostic consideration for KD. By identifying this ocular manifestation, physicians may be able to diagnose and treat IKD more promptly, which could prevent the progression to coronary artery involvement. Its inclusion in diagnostic algorithms may assist in identifying IKD cases with fewer typical features, potentially facilitating earlier treatment initiation and reducing the risk of CALs.

### Epidemiology of reemerging scarlet fever, hong kong, 2005–2015 [^4317333e]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The Study

Scarlet fever is a notifiable disease in Hong Kong. We collected individual data, including age, sex, dates of illness onset, and travel history, from 7,266 local case-patients < 14 years of age (with 3,304 having laboratory-confirmed cases) reported to the Department of Health during 2005–2015. The 2011 upsurge was characterized by a sharp peak (Figure 1, panel A). During that year, 1,438 cases (incidence 17.5/10,000 children < 14 years of age) were reported, exceeding the total number of 1,117 cases (average incidence 2.1/10,000 children < 14 years of age) in the previous 6 years (2005–2010). Since then, the annual number of reported cases has remained at a relatively high level, with an average of 14.5 cases/10,000 children < 14 years of age during 2012–2015. The elevated pattern was more apparent in children < 5 years of age; among this age group, annual incidence averaged 3.3/10,000 children during 2005–2010, jumped to 23.9/10,000 in 2011, and dropped slightly to 18.1/10,000 during 2012–2015.

Among the 996 scarlet fever cases reported during January–July 2011, S. pyogenes isolates from samples from 90 patients (mostly throat swab specimens) were characterized. Strains found belonged to the following emm types (number and percentage of strains): emm 12 (70, 77.8%), emm 1 (14, 15.6%), emm 4 (2, 2.2%), emm 22 (2, 2.2%), emm 2 (1, 1.1%), and emm 3 (1, 1.1%). All strains were susceptible to penicillin, but 77 (85.6%) strains were resistant to erythromycin. Of 59 strains tested for the 48-kb insert, 78.0% (46 strains) tested positive; 39 were emm 12 strains and 7 emm 1 strains. Antimicrobial drug susceptibility results were available for 39 strains positive for the 48-kb insert; 3 (7.70%) were susceptible to erythromycin. Conversely, among all erythromycin-resistant emm 12 strains in 2011 tested for the 48-kb insert, 6/42 (14.3%) yielded a negative result.

### The accuracy of clinical symptoms and signs for the diagnosis of serious bacterial infection in young febrile children: prospective cohort study of 15 781 febrile illnesses [^cb42fef6]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Definite bacteraemia was defined as a pure growth of a single pathogenic micro-organism on blood culture, or polymerase chain reaction positive for Meningococcus. Probable bacteraemia was defined as the growth of two or more types of organism (with at least one not a likely contaminant), growth of Streptococci viridans or other likely contaminant if the final diagnosis was endocarditis, or persistently positive blood cultures (that is, ≥ 2 blood cultures positive for same type of organism). Given the very low frequency of meningitis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis, we decided not to undertake diagnostic modelling for these outcomes because the risk of unreliable and potentially misleading models was unacceptably high. Children with one of these diagnoses were not included in the analysis.

All probable cases of serious bacterial infection were reviewed by a final diagnosis committee composed of two specialist paediatricians (with experience in paediatrics, infectious disease, and respiratory medicine) and, in cases of pneumonia, a radiologist. The presence or absence of bacterial infection was decided blinded to clinical information and based on consensus. Where a reference standard test (urine or blood culture, or chest radiograph) was performed outside the hospital, the report and films were obtained for review. Uncertain results and all abnormal chest radiographs were reviewed by the final diagnosis committee.

Children were classified into three categories: serious bacterial infection; clinically diagnosed infection; and no bacterial infection. Children were regarded as having a clinically diagnosed infection when a clinical test was positive (for example, red, bulging ear drums for otitis media) and it was possible that the cause was bacterial (for example, abscess, balanitis, cellulitis, epididymitis, epiglottitis, impetigo, lymphadenitis, lymphangitis, mastoiditis, otitis media, periorbital cellulitis, scarlet fever, sinusitis, tonsillitis, or wound infection). These children were treated separately for the purpose of estimating the proportion of children who were investigated and prescribed antibiotics, but for the purposes of model development, these children were included in the group categorised as without serious bacterial infection. The classification of "no bacterial infection" was assigned to children whose reference standard tests for serious bacterial infection (chest radiograph, urine culture, blood culture) were negative or the tests were not done, but whose illness spontaneously resolved before the 10–14 day follow-up without antibiotic administration.

### Intramural oesophageal abscess: an unusual complication of tonsillitis [^9c8faf57]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillitis is an extremely common condition, usually it is self-limiting, of viral origin, and managed conservatively in general practice. Rarely patients require inpatient management, usually when bacterial infection is present or when the cause is virulent organisms such as Epstein Barr virus. Complications can be divided into non-suppurative; sepsis, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis and Lemierres disease, and suppurative; quinsy, parapharyngeal abscess and retropharyngeal abscess, respectively. Anecdotally, there is concern that modern medical practice that counsels vigilance against overuse of antibiotics, could lead to increased complications of tonsillitis. We report a case of an otherwise healthy man who presented with dysphagia, odynophagia and neck pain following a sore throat. Despite antibiotic treatment he developed an intramural oesophageal abscess, to our knowledge, an unreported complication of tonsillitis.

### About scarlet fever… [^420adc97]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Scarlet fever is an infection that causes a sore throat and a rash.
- Healthcare providers can do a quick test to see if it's scarlet fever.
- Antibiotics can help people with scarlet fever feel better faster. Signs and symptoms It usually takes 2 to 5 days for someone exposed to the bacteria to begin having symptoms. Symptoms usually include:

- Fever
- Rash
- Sore throat Complications after having scarlet fever are not common but can occur. Keep Reading: Signs, Symptoms, and Complications. Risk factors Anyone can get scarlet fever, but some factors can increase the risk of getting this infection. Age Scarlet fever, like strep throat, is more common in children than adults. Most common: Children 5 through 15 years old Less common: Children younger than 3 years old. Close contact Close contact with another person with scarlet fever is the most common risk factor for illness.

For example, if someone has scarlet fever, the bacteria often spread to other people in their household. Contact with children: Parents of school-age children and adults who are often in contact with children are at increased risk. Crowded settings can increase the risk of getting a group A strep infection. These settings include:

- Daycare centers and schools
- Detention or correctional facilities
- Homeless shelters
- Military training facilities. Causes Group A Streptococcus cause scarlet fever and are contagious. Keep Reading: Causes and How the Bacteria Spread Prevention There are things people can do to protect themselves and others from group A strep infections, including scarlet fever.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^19c015e1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Q fever — clinical features of acute and chronic illness emphasize symptom timing, asymptomatic infection frequency, and endocarditis findings. Acute Q fever typically is characterized by a nonspecific febrile illness, hepatitis, or pneumonia, and asymptomatic infections have been reported in up to 60% of cases; onset of symptoms usually occurs within 2–3 weeks of exposure and symptomatic patients might be ill for weeks or months if untreated. Chronic Q fever can manifest within a few months or several years after acute infection and can follow symptomatic or asymptomatic infections; chronic disease is rare (< 5% of patients with acute infection) and is typically characterized by endocarditis in patients with preexisting risk factors such as valvular or vascular defects. Unlike acute Q fever, which has a low mortality rate (< 2%), chronic Q fever endocarditis is always fatal if untreated; routine blood cultures are negative, and vegetative lesions are visualized by echocardiography in approximately 12% of patients.

### Group A Streptococcus primary peritonitis in children, New Zealand [^2a2cd94e]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Streptococcus pyogenes, or group A Streptococcus (GAS), causes a wide spectrum of disease ranging from superficial skin infection and pharyngitis to invasive infections, such as sepsis, empyema, necrotizing fasciitis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis. GAS is responsible for the toxin-mediated complications of scarlet fever and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, as well as the postinfectious sequelae rheumatic fever and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.

Primary peritonitis is defined as a bacterial infection within the peritoneal cavity in the absence of ascites or an intraabdominal source of infection, such as appendicitis. Primary peritonitis is an uncommon manifestation of invasive GAS (iGAS) disease; a 2016 report found it accounted for 4.6% of children with iGAS in Finland. Pediatric primary peritonitis itself is rare, reportedly accounting for 1%–3% of children experiencing acute abdomen (sudden onset of severe abdominal pain), and is most commonly caused by S. pneumoniae, gram-negative organisms, and staphylococcal species.

In late 2022, the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, and several countries in Europe reported unexpectedly high rates of iGAS and scarlet fever, particularly in children < 10 years of age. Rates of iGAS in the United Kingdom during this period are reported to be higher than in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic (2017–2019) and substantially higher than those reported during 2020–2021. With increased GAS circulation, media coverage, and heightened community awareness, clinicians globally should be aware of the vast spectrum of invasive disease caused by GAS, including primary peritonitis.

In New Zealand, iGAS disease is not notifiable to Public Health authorities. Surveillance relies on individual laboratories sending clinically relevant iGAS isolates to the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) for typing. The most recent ESR report (2016) describes an iGAS incidence of 9.0/100,000 population in New Zealand; rates were inequitably high among New Zealand Māori (23.5/100,000 population) and Pacific peoples (73.9/100,000 population) compared with rates among persons of European or other ethnicities (4.3/100,000 population). Incidence of iGAS is highest in children < 1 year of age. Although ESR laboratory surveillance provides some information on the burden of iGAS in New Zealand, its passive nature suggests that reported rates are likely to be an underestimate.

### Characteristics of group A Streptococcus strains circulating during scarlet fever epidemic, beijing, China, 2011 [^6cb44829]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

This study had limitations. First, to track case outcomes, we followed up on the scarlet fever case-patients for 3 weeks after illness onset, which may not have allowed sufficient time to capture later-occurring complications; thus, outcome profiles may have been incomplete. Second, the enhanced surveillance in Beijing did not include invasive GAS diseases, so we could not report on all GAS strains circulating during the 2011 scarlet fever epidemic.

The 2011 scarlet fever epidemic in Beijing was characteristic of other scarlet fever epidemics and occurred after an abnormal peak winter incidence of the disease in 2010. emm 12 type GAS became predominant. The level of GAS resistance to clindamycin was lower than that to erythromycin and tetracycline.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^99b59e5c]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Assessment of clinical signs and symptoms — Acute Q fever in children is less likely to cause symptoms than in adults and may be milder, with symptomatic illness typically febrile and accompanied by headache, weakness, cough, and other nonspecific systemic symptoms; illness is frequently self-limited, though a relapsing febrile illness lasting for several months has been documented. Gastrointestinal symptoms are reported in 50%–80% of pediatric cases, and skin rash is more common than in adults with a prevalence as high as 50% among diagnosed children. Q fever pneumonia is usually moderate with mild cough; severe manifestations are rare but can include hepatitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, myocarditis, pericarditis, encephalitis, meningitis, hemophagocytosis, lymphadenitis, acalculous cholecystitis, and rhabdomyolysis.

### Pediatric fever [^29bbd436]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Pediatric fever is a common complaint in children. The most common cause is self-limited viral infection. However, neonates and young infants are evaluated and treated differently than older, vaccinated, and clinically evaluable children. Neonates should be admitted to the hospital, young infants in the second month of life may be risk stratified, and those deemed low risk on testing may be sent home with close follow-up. Children older than 2 months may be evaluated clinically for signs of bacterial infection that require intervention. Urinary tract infections cause more than 90% of serious bacterial illness in children, and younger children have a higher incidence of infection.

### Increased risk for invasive group A Streptococcus disease for household contacts of scarlet fever cases, england, 2011–2016 [^b0e69ee5]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

During 2014, England and Wales had a sharp increase in the incidence of scarlet fever, which by 2016 had reached 33.2 cases/100,000 person-years, the highest rate in almost 50 years. An increase in disease incidence was similarly reported from 2009 onward in Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong, and mainland China but has not been reported elsewhere in Europe (, –). The cause of this increase is unknown.

Scarlet fever was once a common cause of childhood death before incidence and deaths decreased dramatically during the 19th century. Although now typically a mild disease, scarlet fever remains statutorily reportable in England to enable prediction of periods of increased incidence of invasive group A Streptococcus (iGAS) infection given the temporal correlation between these 2 conditions. Genomic assessment of Streptococcus pyogenes has furthermore demonstrated that the same strains cause scarlet fever and iGAS infection. iGAS is statutorily reportable to make contact tracing easier, given the increased risk for secondary iGAS infection among household contacts.

This study was initiated as part of a coordinated public health response to determine the cause and effect of the increase in scarlet fever in the United Kingdom. We investigated whether there is an excess risk for secondary iGAS infection in households in which a person was given a diagnosis of scarlet fever to determine whether further public health actions are required to protect contacts.

### Fever in the not-so-typical pediatric patient [^26397cc0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Fever is one of the most common chief complaints for patients in the pediatric emergency department (ED). Most of the time, these patients are diagnosed with a virus and treated with supportive care; however, there are a subset of patients with chronic conditions or special circumstances that require a more thorough approach when they enter the ED with a fever. This article will go into detail about why we must be on high alert when these children present with a fever and how we should approach them medically.

### Vaccines for preventing typhoid fever [^b2bebcbd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical features

After ingestion of S. Typhi or S. Paratyphi, the bacteria spread from the intestine via the blood, where they multiply to the intestinal lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. Typhoid fever is usually characterized initially by fever, headache, and abdominal symptoms, although other nonspecific symptoms may occur. Neuropsychiatric manifestations, including psychosis and confusion, may occur. Other signs include relative bradycardia, rose spots, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly, although these signs are not pathognomonic (Mandell 2005).

Complications occur in 10% to 15% of untreated patients, usually in the third and fourth weeks of infection. The most important complications are gastrointestinal bleeding, occurring in up to 10% of patients (Parry 2002), followed by intestinal perforation and typhoid encephalopathy. Estimates of case‐fatality rates in typhoid fever range from 1% to 4%; fatality rates in children younger than 4 years of age are 10 times higher than in older children. In untreated cases, the fatality rates may rise to 10% to 20% (Bhutta 1996).

Both S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi can cause enteric fever, and the clinical manifestations of these two infections are similar. In some areas enteric fever caused by S. Paratyphi is more common (MacLennan 2014).

### Epidemiology of reemerging scarlet fever, hong kong, 2005–2015 [^b676eb1b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Scarlet fever, caused by group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes), was a common infectious disease in children before the early 20th century and a major cause of death, with a case-fatality risk > 30%. Various factors, including improvements in hygiene and the introduction of effective antibiotics, led to the disappearance of scarlet fever as a major cause of pediatric deaths by the mid-20th century. However, reemerging cases of scarlet fever were reported in China in 2011 and the United Kingdom in 2014. Hong Kong also experienced an upsurge in scarlet fever cases in 2011, with a > 10-fold increase over the previous incidence rate. The reason for the surge is unclear. One report has suggested that toxin acquisition and multidrug resistance might have contributed. Since 2011, the reported number of scarlet fever cases in these locations has remained at elevated levels. We analyzed the patterns in scarlet fever incidence in Hong Kong during 2005–2015, including the upsurge since 2011.

### To treat or not to treat? Management of guttate psoriasis and pityriasis rosea in patients with evidence of group A streptococcal infection [^b90638ea]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The association between guttate psoriasis and pityriasis rosea with Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) is well established in the literature; however treatment guidelines and necessity have not been clarified with respect to the infectious etiology. Also, the exact role of Streptococcus in the immunopathogenesis of these entities, and the associated risk of development of scarlet fever and poststreptococcal sequelae, are not centrally reported. No single report or case series definitively establishes the coexistence between guttate psoriasis and post-streptococcal sequelae in the same patient, supporting the theories of autoimmune protection conferred between these entities. Laboratory investigations and treatment of Streptococcus in the setting of guttate psoriasis are not necessary, as anti-streptococcal treatment does not significantly modify the course of cutaneous disease, and there is no theoretical or documented risk of post-streptococcal sequelae. However, due to minimal data, antibiotics may still have a role in pityriasis rosea.

### Characteristics of group A Streptococcus strains circulating during scarlet fever epidemic, beijing, China, 2011 [^d7ac0882]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Characteristics of Children Enrolled in Enhanced Surveillance

A total of 3,359 children, representing 972 clinical cases of scarlet fever and 2,387 cases of pharyngitis, were enrolled in enhanced surveillance for GAS disease. Of the 3,359 enrollees, ≈41.0% were female. The mean age was 5.8 years (SD ± 3.3 years). The mean interval from illness onset to first medical visit was 1.5 days (SD ± 1.5 days). Approximately 41.2% of the children received antimicrobial drugs at home before seeking medical care.

Of the 3,359 enrollees, 647 (19.2%) were confirmed to have GAS infection. GAS was isolated from clinical samples for 44.2% (430/972) of the children with scarlet fever and from 9.1% (217/2,387) of the children with pharyngitis.

### Intracranial invasive group A streptococcus: a neurosurgical emergency in children [^e239b0c4]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Invasive group A streptococcus (iGAS) infections are associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. CNS involvement is rare, with iGAS accounting for only 0.2%-1% of all childhood bacterial meningitis. In 2022, a significant increase in scarlet fever and iGAS was reported globally with a displacement of serotype, causing a predominance of the emm1.0 subtype. Here, the authors report on iGAS-related suppurative intracranial complications requiring neurosurgical intervention and prolonged antibiotic therapy.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective chart review of consecutive cases of confirmed GAS in pediatric neurosurgical patients.

Results

Five children with a median age of 9 years were treated for intracranial complications of GAS infection over a 2-month period between November 2022 and December 2022. All patients had preceding illnesses, including chicken pox and upper respiratory tract infections. Infections included subdural empyema with associated encephalitis (n = 2), extradural empyema (n = 1), intracranial abscess (n = 1), and diffuse global meningoencephalitis (n = 1). Streptococcus pyogenes was cultured from 4 children, and 2 were of the emm1.0 subtype. Antimicrobial therapy in all patients included a third-generation cephalosporin but varied in adjunctive therapy, often including a toxin synthesis inhibitor antibiotic such as clindamycin. Neurological outcomes varied; 3 patients returned to near neurological baseline, 1 had significant residual neurological deficits, and 1 patient died.

Conclusions

Despite the worldwide increased incidence, intracranial complications remain rarely reported resulting in a lack of awareness of iGAS-related intracranial disease. Awareness of intracranial complications of iGAS and prompt referral to a pediatric neurology/neurosurgical center is crucial to optimize neurological outcomes.

### What is beyond Salmonella gastroenteritis? A case of acute pancreatitis complicating Salmonella infection in a child: a case report and literature review [^3c754a53]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is the most common pancreatic disorder in children, and its incidence is increasing worldwide. Recent studies have estimated the incidence of AP in children to be approximately 1/10,000 children per year, an incidence approaching that in adult patients.

At present, there are no evidence-based diagnostic guidelines for the diagnosis of AP in children. The expert definition of pediatric AP from the International Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis (INSPPIRE) is modeled after the Atlanta classification in adult patients. As per INSPPIRE criteria, a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires at least two of the following:
Abdominal pain compatible with acute pancreatitis
Serum amylase and/or lipase ≥ 3 times upper limits of normal
Imaging findings consistent with acute pancreatitis

In children, blunt abdominal injuries, multisystem disease, biliary stones or microlithiasis, and drug toxicity are the most common contributing factors of AP. The severity of AP is highly variable, with most patients recovering spontaneously with supportive treatment only. Further, it is not uncommon for AP to lead to death if left untreated.

AP complicating Salmonella gastroenteritis is a rare complication among the pediatric population. This complication has been reported in adult patients with typhoid fever and nontyphoid Salmonella infection, but there are few reported cases in the pediatric population. Herein, we report a case of AP complicating Salmonella gastroenteritis infection in an immunocompetent child.

### Periprosthetic breast abscess caused by Streptococcus pyogenes after scarlet fever [^35536923]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

We present a case of a 32-year-old white women, affected by breast cancer and treated with mastectomy, who underwent immediate breast reconstruction with a tissue expander. She presented a periprosthetic infection from Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus, GAS) after scarlet fever. S. pyogenes may be responsible for suppurative complications of the respiratory system and a variety of metastatic foci of infection such as suppurative arthritic, endocarditis, meningitis, or brain abscess. Even though, in the literature, several cases and types of infection associated with breast implantation have been described, to our knowledge this is the first case report of periprosthetic infection after scarlet fever. Signs, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of GAS infection that occurred 2 months after the surgery are discussed.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^bd4a23fd]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Medium credibility.

Updated recommendations for the use of typhoid vaccine — epidemiology, clinical course, and travel vaccination guidance note that the incubation period is 6–30 days, serious complications generally occur after 2–3 weeks of illness, and untreated illness can last a month; patients with untreated typhoid fever had case‑fatality rates > 10%, while with early and appropriate antibiotic treatment the overall case‑fatality rate is typically < 1%. In the United States, typhoid fever is uncommon with an average of about 400 cases reported annually during 2007–2011; approximately 90% of cases occur among returning travelers, > 75% of whom had been in India, Bangladesh, or Pakistan, and most travelers (≥ 55%) reported visiting friends or relatives. CDC recommends typhoid vaccination for travelers to many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, but, as of 2010, no longer recommends typhoid vaccine for travelers to certain Eastern European and Asian countries, and the importance of preventive measures is heightened by increasing resistance of Salmonella serotype Typhi to antimicrobial agents, including fluoroquinolones.

### Penicillin V potassium [^5eab3508]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The dosage of Penicillin V should be determined according to the sensitivity of the causative microorganisms and the severity of infection, and adjusted to the clinical response of the patient.

The usual dosage recommendations for adults and children 12 years and over are as follows:

 Streptococcal Infections

Mild to moderately severe - of the upper respiratory tract and including scarlet fever and erysipelas: 125 to 250 mg (200,000 to 400,000 units) every 6 to 8 hours for 10 days.

 Pneumococcal Infections

Mild to moderately severe - of the respiratory tract, including otitis media: 250 to 500 mg (400,000 to 800,000 units) every 6 hours until the patient has been afebrile for at least 2 days.

 Staphylococcal Infections

Mild infections of skin and soft tissue (culture and sensitive tests should be performed): 250 to 500 mg (400,000 to 800,000 units) every 6 to 8 hours.

 Fusospirochetosis (Vincent's infection) of the oropharynx. Mild to moderately severe infections: 250 to 500 mg (400,000 to 800,000 units) every 6 to 8 hours.

For the prevention of recurrence following rheumatic fever and/or chorea: 125 mg to 250 mg (200,000 to 400,000 units) twice daily on a continuing basis.

For prophylaxis against bacterial endocarditis1in patients with congenital heart disease or rheumatic or other acquired valvular heart disease when undergoing dental procedures or surgical procedures of the upper respiratory tract: 2 gram of penicillin V (1 gram for children under 60 lbs.) 1 hour before the procedure, and then, 1 gram (500 mg for children under 60 lbs.) 6 hours later.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^e70b635b]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute Q fever in adults — The majority of acute Q fever cases resolve spontaneously within 2–3 weeks, even without treatment, but symptomatic patients with confirmed or suspected acute Q fever, including children with severe illness, should be treated with doxycycline. Doxycycline is the most effective treatment for Q fever, and treatment is most effective when given in the first 3 days of symptoms, shortens the illness, and reduces the risk for severe complications. If doxycycline is contraindicated because of allergies, other antibiotic regimens that can be used include moxifloxacin, clarithromycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and rifampin. Treatment for acute Q fever is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic persons or for those whose symptoms have resolved, although it might be considered in those at high risk for developing chronic Q fever; in one study, those who eventually had chronic Q fever were more likely to have not received appropriate doxycycline treatment during their acute illness. Patients with acute Q fever should undergo a careful clinical assessment to determine whether they might be at risk for progression to chronic Q fever, including review of possible immunosuppressive conditions, pregnancy testing when appropriate, and assessment for vascular and heart valve defects because certain valvular lesions might not be detectable by auscultation.

### Increased risk for invasive group A Streptococcus disease for household contacts of scarlet fever cases, england, 2011–2016 [^b5b9b478]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study identified a low risk for iGAS infection among household contacts of scarlet fever cases (35.3 cases/100,000 person-years). However, this risk was increased when compared with the background risk. Eleven iGAS cases occurred among ≈189,684 contacts during the 60 days after scarlet fever onset; 1.5 cases would have been expected on the basis of a background rate of 2.9 cases/100,000 person-years. Small numbers of cases preclude robust subgroup analysis but excess risk was highest in contacts > 75 and 11–17 years of age. Although the absolute risk was low, the effect of these infections was severe; 3 deaths were reported. These findings have implications for other countries reporting a high incidence of scarlet fever.

Half the secondary iGAS cases occurred in parents and one third occurred in siblings of scarlet fever case-patients. A previous study showed a slight excess in scarlet fever incidence in young adult women, possibly explained by caring responsibilities for children with the infection. We did not observe a similar pattern for iGAS; 3 of 5 cases in parents were in men. Contacts > 75 years of age had the highest absolute risk for development of iGAS. Although the background rate for iGAS was highest in elderly persons, because there were only an estimated 429 household contacts of scarlet fever case-patients within this age group, 1 secondary iGAS case in this group translated into a high attack rate.

An estimated 5 million grandparents have regular childcare responsibilities in the United Kingdom. We were unable to assess the risk for grandparents not living in the same household and are likely missing a major group potentially at risk through contact with scarlet fever case-patients. Our identification of 51 postcode-matched pairs with different addresses suggests a possible increased risk for iGAS infection in the neighborhood of scarlet fever case-patients and warrants further assessment. Although a proportion of the observed secondary household iGAS risk might be caused by transmission in wider social networks, the fact that parents constituted most secondary iGAS cases suggests that transmission within the home underpins these clusters because parents are less likely than children to be exposed to scarlet fever outside the home.

Clinical characteristics of treatment naïve pediatric acute KD subjects (n = 75) as well as IVIG-treated subjects with subacute (13–24 days; n = 36), early convalescent (25–75 days; n = 43) and late convalescent KD (9–49 months; n = 20), are described in Table 1 along with age-similar healthy pediatric controls (n = 48) and pediatric subjects with various acute febrile illnesses of bacterial (n = 12) and viral (n = 36) origin. Although GlycA levels were similar between healthy controls and convalescent KD patients, levels were higher in children with acute febrile illness and subacute KD than in healthy controls (P < 0.0001), or convalescent KD subjects (P < 0.0001) (Table 1, Fig. 1) and further elevated in acute KD patients (P < 0.0001). Approximately one third of the subjects with acute KD had higher GlycA concentrations than any of the febrile subjects with acute illness (Fig. 1). GlycA concentrations were higher in subjects with acute KD than in those with influenza A or B, scarlet fever or viral syndrome (P < 0.0001, 0.01 and 0.0001, respectively) but not in subjects with abscesses or adenoviral infections (Additional file 1: Figure S1). GlycA levels did not differ between acute KD patients who were resistant and those who responded to IVIG treatment (Additional file 2: Figure S2) or between acute KD subjects with CAA or dilated coronary arteries and those with normal echocardiograms (Fig. 1 and Additional file 2: Figure S2).

### Scarlet fever… [^34150006]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical features Scarlet fever is characterized by a scarlatiniform rash and occurs with the following group A strep infections:

- Pharyngitis
- Pyoderma
- Wound infections Rash characteristics Characteristics of the rash typically include:

- Erythematous rash that blanches on pressure
- Sandpaper quality
- Pastia's lines, an accentuation of the red rash in flexor creases
- Begins on the trunk and quickly spreads outward
- Usually spares the palms and soles The rash usually persists for about one week and desquamation may follow. Negative RADT Children older than 3 years: Healthcare providers should follow up a negative RADT with a throat culture. Have a mechanism in place to contact the family and initiate antibiotics if the back-up throat culture is positive. Giving antibiotics to children with confirmed scarlet fever with pharyngitis can reduce their risk of developing acute rheumatic fever.

All other ages: Throat culture after a negative RADT isn't routinely indicated. Acute rheumatic fever is very rare in these age groups. Treatment Patients with scarlet fever, regardless of age, who have a positive RADT or throat culture need antibiotics. Don't treat pharyngitis with a rash with antibiotics. Benefits of antibiotics Using a recommended antibiotic regimen to treat scarlet fever:

- Shortens the duration of symptoms
- Reduces the likelihood of transmission to close contacts
- Prevents the development of complications. Complications Rarely, complications can occur after scarlet fever. Suppurative complications Suppurative complications result from local or hematogenous spread of the organism. They can include:

- Cervical lymphadenitis
- Invasive group A strep disease
- Peritonsillar abscesses
- Retropharyngeal abscess.

Nonsuppurative sequelae When occurring with group A strep pharyngitis, nonsuppurative sequelae of scarlet fever include: Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can also occur after scarlet fever associated with group A strep skin infections. These complications occur after the original infection resolves and involve sites distant to the initial group A strep infection site. They're thought to be the result of the immune response and not of direct group A strep infection.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a life-threatening complication of infection typically caused by one of two bacterial species: Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes The outcomes in children with TSS can be devastating. Careful consideration of TSS is required as a potential differential diagnosis of children presenting with sepsis or severe illness associated with fever and rash.

### Reactivity of rheumatic fever and scarlet fever patients' sera with group A streptococcal M protein, cardiac myosin, and cardiac tropomyosin: a retrospective study [^e97cbbf4]. Infection and Immunity (2000). Low credibility.

Archived sera (collected in 1946) from acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and untreated scarlet fever and/or pharyngitis patients were reacted with streptococcal M protein, cardiac myosin, and cardiac tropomyosin. Except for very low levels to tropomyosin, antibodies to other antigens were not elevated in the sera of ARF patients relative to those of non-ARF patients, even though there was roughly equivalent exposure to group A streptococci. This suggests that antibodies to these molecules may not play a central role in the induction of ARF.

### About rheumatic fever | Group A strep… [^01299270]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory condition that can affect the heart, joints, brain, and skin.
- Rheumatic fever can develop if strep throat, scarlet fever, or impetigo aren't treated properly.
- Symptoms often include fever and painful, tender joints, with treatment focusing on managing inflammation and symptoms.
- Serious complications include long-term heart damage.
- Speak with a healthcare provider if you have concerns about rheumatic fever. Symptoms Rheumatic fever can develop about 1 to 5 weeks after a group A strep infection. Common symptoms Symptoms can include:

- Arthritis
- Chorea
- Fatigue
- Fever Arthritis is most common in the knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists.

Uncommon symptoms Rarely, symptoms can include:

- Nodules near joints
- Rash with pink rings and a clear center Heart-related symptoms Symptoms of rheumatic fever can also include symptoms of congestive heart failure:

- Chest pain
- Fast heartbeat
- **Shortness of breath In addition, someone with rheumatic fever can have**:
- A new heart murmur
- An enlarged heart
- Fluid around the heart. Complications If rheumatic fever is not treated promptly, rheumatic heart disease may occur. Rheumatic heart disease weakens the valves between the chambers of the heart. Severe rheumatic heart disease can require heart surgery and result in death. Group settings Crowded conditions can increase the risk of getting strep throat, scarlet fever, or impetigo. Thus, these settings can increase the risk for rheumatic fever if those infections aren't treated properly.

These settings include:

- Daycare centers and schools
- Detention or correctional facilities
- Homeless shelters
- Military training facilities Other health factors Someone who had rheumatic fever is more likely to get it again if they get another group A strep infection. Treatment and recovery Healthcare providers treat symptoms of rheumatic fever with medicines to reduce
- Fever
- Inflammation
- Pain In addition, all patients with rheumatic fever should get antibiotics that treat group A strep infections. People who develop rheumatic heart disease with symptoms of heart failure may require medicines to help manage this as well.

### A 3-month-old infant with atypical Kawasaki disease [^33a86402]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

The usual incidence of Kawasaki disease (KD) is from 6 months up to 5 years of age. There are only a few reported cases of neonatal KD. An important and distinctive clinical sign that is not included in the classical clinical criteria of KD is a reaction at the BCG inoculation site. BCG redness is found in more than 50% of KD patients aged less than 12 months. The crust formation or redness at the BCG scar should alert the physician to consider KD as a differential diagnosis for any febrile children, even when there are only a few or no classic clinical presentations.

Since it is challenging to establish a diagnosis, coronary artery complications occur frequently in infants with KD. To prevent such harmful consequences, paediatricians can treat patients with KD through intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion within 10 days of onset of the disease. IVIG can decrease the risk of coronary artery abnormalities from 25% to 5%. Our patient was diagnosed rapidly enough and received IVIG in good time, so she had no residual coronary artery complications.

Persistent fever can be caused by infectious and non-infectious diseases. Infectious diseases may be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. In this case, we gave her broad-spectrum antibiotics, but her symptoms did not improve indicating that bacterial infection was less likely. We therefore also included other micro-organisms and non-infectious diseases such as autoimmune diseases or neoplasm in the differential diagnosis. KD should also be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of persistent fever especially in children under 5 years. A detailed history and physical examination are required to reveal the cause of persistent fever.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Streptococcal Infections Group A

Infections of the upper-respiratory tract, skin and soft-tissue infections, scarlet fever, and erysipelas.

The following doses are recommended:

Adults and pediatric patients over 60 lbs. in weight: 2,400,000 units.

Pediatric patients from 30 to 60 lbs.: 900,000 units to 1,200,000 units.

Pediatric patients under 30 lbs.: 600,000 units.

NOTE: Treatment with the recommended dosage is usually given at a single session using multiple IM sites when indicated. An alternative dosage schedule may be used, giving one-half (1/2) the total dose on day 1 and one-half (1/2) on day 3. This will also insure the penicillinemia required over a 10-day period; however, this alternate schedule should be used only when the physician can be assured of the patient's cooperation.

Pneumococcal Infections (except pneumococcal meningitis)

600,000 units in pediatric patients and 1,200,000 units in adults, repeated every 2 or 3 days until the temperature is normal for 48 hours. Other forms of penicillin may be necessary for severe cases.

Method of Administration

Bicillin C-R is intended for Intramuscular Injection ONLY. Do not inject into or near an artery or nerve, or intravenously or admix with other intravenous solutions. (See WARNINGS section).

Administer by DEEP INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTION in the upper, outer quadrant of the buttock (dorsogluteal) or the ventrogluteal site. In neonates, infants and small children, the midlateral aspect of the thigh may be preferable. Administration in the anterolateral thigh is not recommended due to the adverse effects observed (see WARNINGS section), and vascularity of this region. When doses are repeated, vary the injection site.

Because of the high concentration of suspended material in this product, the needle may be blocked if the injection is not made at a slow, steady rate.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^d97a8061]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Assessment of clinical signs and symptoms — Acute Q fever in adults occurs symptomatically in approximately half of infected persons and, after an incubation period of 2–3 weeks, most commonly presents as a nonspecific febrile illness that might occur with pneumonia or hepatitis. In North America in the 1980s, among 1,306 hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia cases, 30 cases (2.3%) were acute Q fever, and cough is often nonproductive in 50% of patients. Fever in untreated patients lasts a median of 10 days (range: 5–57 days), with the majority defervescing within 72 hours of doxycycline; duration increases with age, with 60% of patients aged > 40 years having fever > 14 days compared with 29% aged < 40 years. Rash occurs in 5%–21% of patients. Mortality is < 2%, and during the Netherlands outbreak of approximately 4,000 reported cases up to 50% of acute Q fever patients were hospitalized. Common diagnostic coding in one U.S. military series included fever, not otherwise specified (780.6); pneumonia, organism unspecified (486); and viral infection, not otherwise specified (079.99).

Characteristics of Household Clusters

All household clusters were composed of 1 scarlet fever case and 1 iGAS case and occurred after March 2014. The median interval between onset of scarlet fever and of iGAS infection was 18 days (range 3–54 days) (Figure 3). Five iGAS cases occurred in parents of children with scarlet fever and 4 in siblings; the relationship to the scarlet fever case-patient was not recorded for 2 clusters (iGAS case-patients 86 and 26 years of age) (Table 1). Five iGAS case-patients had sepsis and 3 had cellulitis. Five of the 11 iGAS case-patients had an underlying chronic condition, and 1 had an acute infection with influenza. Three of the iGAS case-patients died; 2 of them had predisposing conditions (arthritis, diabetes, and atypical mycobacterial infection). The median household size was 4 persons (range 4–6 persons). Seven of 11 households were in the 30% most deprived neighborhoods in England, and 3 were in the 30% least deprived.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^7ed395cb]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Pregnant women — Q fever in relation to pregnancy is characterized by adverse outcomes and specific management considerations: infections that occur shortly before conception or during pregnancy might result in miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, intrauterine growth retardation, or low birthweight, and reports describing outcomes of infected pregnant women note that none have documented an increased risk for congenital malformations because of infection; a woman with a previous infection (> 30 days before conception) with no evidence of progression to chronic disease does not require treatment during pregnancy, whereas a Q fever infection during pregnancy requires antibiotic treatment and health-care providers should consider several factors to determine the best treatment approach, with careful assessment of serologic results because the phase II antibody response is increased in patients with an acute infection but decreases during convalescence as the phase I antibody response increases; risks are highest when an acute infection occurs during the first trimester, with untreated infection in the first trimester more likely to result in miscarriage and infection later in pregnancy more likely to cause premature delivery; women infected with acute Q fever during pregnancy might be at risk for recrudescent infection during subsequent pregnancies, and pregnant women with a history of Q fever infection during a previous pregnancy should be monitored closely for recrudescent infection in all subsequent pregnancies; health-care providers should educate women of child-bearing age who receive a diagnosis of acute Q fever of potential risks to the fetus, and these women should be advised to avoid pregnancy for at least 1 month after diagnosis and treatment and should receive a pregnancy test to determine whether long-term antibiotic treatment is needed.

### Morbidity and mortality of typhoid intestinal perforation among children in sub-saharan Africa 1995–2019: a scoping review [^7e22317b]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Typhoid fever is caused by the ingestion of contaminated food or water with the bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), from either an acutely infected person or a chronic carrier. Children are disproportionately affected with increased incidence seen between 5 and 14 years of age. Over the past century, public health efforts, including improved sanitation infrastructure, access to clean water, and availability of effective antibiotics, have contributed to the decline of typhoid fever incidence and complications, including intestinal perforation, in high-income countries. In the USA, there were an estimated 350 cases of typhoid fever annually from 2008 to 2015, with an associated mortality rate of less than 1%. The majority of these cases were due to travelers from endemic areas. In comparison, typhoid fever continues to be a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, especially in pediatric populations, where incidence peaks in children five to nine years of age.

The 2019 Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors study estimated that 10.9 million cases of typhoid fever occurred worldwide in 2017, with about 116,800 attributable deaths. An estimated 12.1% of the global cases of typhoid fever occurred in sub-Saharan Africa; however due to limitations with typhoid diagnostic data and modeling, as well as generalizability across the continent, this number is likely an underestimate of the true burden of disease for this region.

A feared complication of typhoid fever is typhoid intestinal perforation (TIP), observed in an estimated 0.8% to 39% of untreated or improperly treated cases worldwide. This is especially true in medically resource poor areas, including sub-Saharan Africa, which often lack access to specialized surgical and postoperative care. In addition, TIP occurs more often in children, with increased mortality rates when compared to adults. In the 1960s and 1970s, TIP-associated mortality rates in all ages ranged from around 30% in Ghana and India to about 60% in Nigeria; a reported rate of 30.5% was seen in a study of Guatemalan children. Since 1990, mortality rates in some endemic areas have decreased to between 3 to 13% in Pakistan, Nepal, and Iraq, with a study from Turkey reporting a rate of 4.8% in children. Data specific to TIP in children living in sub-Saharan Africa are limited.

### Evaluation of child with fever without source: review of literature and update [^7c9fa789]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Fever is one of the most common reasons for a visit to the primary care provider or the emergency department. Traditionally, clinicians have used various risk-stratification strategies to identify serious bacterial infections (SBI) without an obvious source in febrile children, because missed bacterial infections in such children can result in meningitis, sepsis, and death; therefore, early and accurate identification of SBIs is critical. Infants aged less than 60 to 90 days are at greatest risk of SBI. The epidemiology of SBI continues to evolve, especially after the successful introduction of conjugate vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^7bd28471]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2020.

Objectives

To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 3 September 2020: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), Embase Elsevier (from 1974), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (from 2010). We also searched clinical trial registers on 3 September 2020.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics, and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and used the GRADE approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes. We have reported the intention-to-treat analysis, and also performed an analysis of evaluable participants to explore the robustness of the intention-to-treat results.

Main Results

We included 19 trials reported in 18 publications (5839 randomised participants): six trials compared penicillin with cephalosporins; six compared penicillin with macrolides; three compared penicillin with carbacephem; one compared penicillin with sulphonamides; one compared clindamycin with ampicillin; and one compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All participants had confirmed acute GABHS tonsillopharyngitis, and ages ranged from one month to 80 years. Nine trials included only, or predominantly, children. Most trials were conducted in an outpatient setting. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both; heterogeneity; and wide confidence intervals. Cephalosporins versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference in symptom resolution (at 2 to 15 days) for cephalosporins versus penicillin (odds ratio (OR) for absence of symptom resolution 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.12; 5 trials; 2018 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results of the sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants differed (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 5 trials; 1660 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; 4 trials; 1386 participants; low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence showed no difference in reported adverse events. Macrolides versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference between macrolides and penicillin for resolution of symptoms (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.35; 6 trials; 1728 participants; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants resulted in an OR of 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.09; 6 trials; 1159 participants). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be different (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.03; 6 trials; 802 participants; low-certainty evidence). Azithromycin versus amoxicillin Based on one unpublished trial in children, we are uncertain if resolution of symptoms is better with azithromycin in a single dose versus amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis for per-protocol analysis resulted in an OR of 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; 1 trial; 482 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are also uncertain if there was a difference in relapse between groups (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; 1 trial; 422 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were more common with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Carbacephem versus penicillin There is low-certainty evidence that compared with penicillin, carbacephem may provide better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14.3; 3 trials; 795 participants). Studies did not report on long-term complications, so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain if there are clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Low-certainty evidence in children suggests that carbacephem may be more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the other comparisons in this review. Data on complications were too scarce to draw conclusions. These results do not demonstrate that other antibiotics are more effective than penicillin in the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis. All studies were conducted in high-income countries with a low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is a need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities, where the risk of complications remains high.

### Updated recommendations for the use of typhoid vaccine – advisory committee on immunization practices, United States, 2015 [^b7dfa2dd]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B (tartrate negative), and Paratyphi C cause a protracted bacteremic illness referred to respectively as typhoid and paratyphoid fever, and collectively as enteric fever. Enteric fever can be severe and even life-threatening. It is most commonly acquired from water or food contaminated by the feces of an infected person. The incubation period is 6–30 days, and illness onset is insidious, with gradually increasing fatigue and fever. Malaise, headache, and anorexia are nearly universal. A transient macular rash can occur. When serious complications (e.g. intestinal hemorrhage or perforation) occur, it is generally after 2–3 weeks of illness. Untreated illness can last a month. Patients with untreated typhoid fever were reported to have case-fatality rates > 10%; the overall case-fatality rate with early and appropriate antibiotic treatment is typically < 1%.

Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children, adolescents, and adults are developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is chartered as a federal advisory committee to provide expert external advice and guidance to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on use of vaccines and related agents for the control of vaccine-preventable diseases in the civilian population of the United States. Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children and adolescents are harmonized to the greatest extent possible with recommendations made by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in adults are harmonized with recommendations of AAFP, ACOG, and the American College of Physicians (ACP). ACIP recommendations approved by the CDC Director become agency guidelines on the date published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Additional information is available at.

### Increased risk for invasive group A Streptococcus disease for household contacts of scarlet fever cases, england, 2011–2016 [^490f018c]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Although it was not the focus of this study, we observed a slight excess risk for iGAS occurring before scarlet fever. Public health guidelines on the management of iGAS infection in the United Kingdom recommend that household contacts are advised to visit their general practitioner (GP) for assessment if they have symptoms of GAS infection in the 30 days after onset in the index case-patient. Therefore, these scarlet fever case-patients should have already been under surveillance, potentially increasing the likelihood of their diagnosis.

The number of contacts of scarlet fever case-patients was the main source of uncertainty in our risk estimation. If households that have scarlet fever case-patients differ in size from the average household with children, we could have underestimated or overestimated the risk. However, the risk for iGAS infection would still have been 6 times higher than background if the average household size was increased to 7 members. Coupled with our observation that household clusters had a median size of 4 (compared with 3.9 for all households in England), it is unlikely the uncertainty about numbers of contacts could account for the increase in risk observed.

Failure to match iGAS to scarlet fever cases could have occurred because of missing postcodes (3% of iGAS cases), errors in the postcode or address, or because the traced postcode represents the current address and might be different from that at the time of infection. Our finding that all clusters occurred after the increase in scarlet fever during 2014 was possibly influenced by this factor, given that postcode completion was higher in the later years of the study and enabled identification of clusters. We did not adjust for residence in a long-term care facility or hospitalization in the background risk calculation: 3.5% of iGAS cases in England (2009–2010) were estimated to be acquired in long-term care facilities, and 6% of these infections were estimated to be acquired in hospitals. Residents of long-term care facilities had a 6-fold higher risk for iGAS infection than community residents. Including institutionally acquired infections slightly increased the background iGAS risk in this study.

### Information for providers counseling male patients and parents regarding male circumcision and the prevention of HIV infection, STIs, and other health outcomes [^672edf3d]. CDC (2018). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) risk and male circumcision across infancy and the lifespan — parents and guardians should be informed about the medical benefits and risks of neonatal, pediatric, or adolescent medically performed male circumcision, with infancy data stating that circumcised infants are less likely than uncircumcised infants to experience UTIs; an estimated 7% of infant males presenting with fever in outpatient clinics and emergency rooms had UTIs, including 20% of uncircumcised febrile infants and 2% of circumcised febrile infants aged younger than 3 months of age, and lifetime data reporting an estimated 32% of uncircumcised males compared with 9% of circumcised males will experience a UTI in their lifetime, suggesting that circumcision is associated with a 23% absolute decreased lifetime risk of UTI; the text also notes that although most UTIs are treatable, serious complications may occur when UTIs are not diagnosed, recurrent, difficult to treat, or left untreated, with complications including sepsis, pyelonephritis, and renal scarring and associations with long-term consequences including hypertension, build-up of kidney waste products (uremia), and end-stage renal disease.

### Resurgence of scarlet fever in China: a 13-year population-based surveillance study [^ee665154]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

A re-emergence of scarlet fever has been noted in Hong Kong, South Korea, and England, UK, since 2008. China also had a sudden increase in the incidence of the disease in 2011. In this study, we aimed to assess the epidemiological changes before and after the upsurge. We also aimed to explore the reasons for the upsurge in disease in 2011, the epidemiological factors that contributed to it, and assess how these could be managed to prevent future epidemics.

Methods

In this observational study, we extracted the epidemiological data for all cases of scarlet fever between 2004 and 2016 in China from the Chinese Public Health Science Data Center, the official website of National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, and the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Surveillance System. These data had been collected from 31 provinces and regions in China and included geographical, seasonal, and patient demographic information. We used descriptive statistical methods and joinpoint regression to examine the spatiotemporal patterns and annual percentage change in incidence of the upsurge of disease across China.

Findings

Between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2016, 502723 cases of scarlet fever, with ten fatalities, were reported in China, resulting in an annualised average incidence of 2.8807 per 100000 people. The annual average incidence increased from 1.457 per 100000 people in 2004 to 4.7638 per 100000 people in 2011 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 3.27, 95% CI 3.22–3.32; p < 0.0001), peaking in 2015 (5.0092 per 100000 people). The annual incidence after the 2011 upsurge of scarlet fever, between 2011 and 2016, was twice the average annual incidence reported between 2004 and 2010 (4.0125 vs 1.9105 per 100000 people; IRR 2.07, 95% CI 2.06–2.09; p < 0.0001). Most cases were distributed in the north, northeast, and northwest of the country. Semi-annual patterns were observed in May-June and November-December. The median age at onset of disease was 6 years, with the annual highest incidence observed in children aged 6 years (49.4675 per 100000 people). The incidence among boys and men was 1.54 greater than that among girls and women before the upsurge, and 1.51 times greater after the upsurge (p < 0.0001 for both). The median time from disease onset to reporting of the disease was shorter after the upsurge in disease than before (3 days vs 4 days; p = 0.001).

Interpretation

To our knowledge, this is the largest epidemiological study of scarlet fever worldwide. The patterns of infection across the country were similar before and after the 2011 upsurge, but the incidence of disease was substantially higher after 2011. Prevention and control strategies being implemented in response to this threat include improving disease surveillance and emergency response systems. In particular, the school absenteeism and symptom monitoring and early-warning system will contribute to the early diagnosis and report of the scarlet fever. This approach will help combat scarlet fever and other childhood infectious diseases in China.

### Systematic review of household transmission of strep A: a potential site for prevention that has eluded attention [^d1414a5e]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

All selected texts were reviewed by 2 authors (S. L. E. E. P.) and the following data extracted: article details (title, author, year), type of study, year of transmission, country, geography (urban, rural, remote), participant age, infection status (exposed, symptomatic, asymptomatic), molecular testing, and mode of transmission. Strep A infection was classified as follows: superficial (eg, pharyngitis, impetigo, scarlet fever), severe (isolation of Strep A from a nonsterile site in combination with symptoms attributable to streptococcal toxic shock syndrome), or invasive (isolation of Strep A from a normally sterile site in combination with severe clinical presentation). In each study, the "index case" was noted as the first case requiring medical attention. Discrepancies between authors were discussed and amended accordingly. Notes were also taken where authors hypothesized possible drivers of transmission within the household. The primary outcome was the mechanism of Strep A transmission within the home. The secondary outcome was an assessment of the modes of transmission within the same setting with potential opportunities for prevention. Descriptive analyses were used to report the frequency of variables across the cohort of studies, and all other results were analyzed narratively.

### Conserved molecular chaperone prsA stimulates protective immunity against group A Streptococcus [^83626a44]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as group A Streptococcus (GAS), is a Gram-positive human-specific pathogen. Infections caused by GAS range from pharyngitis and impetigo to more severe conditions including bacteremia, puerperal sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis, scarlet fever, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, and autoimmune complications such as acute rheumatic fever (ARF), rheumatic heart disease (RHD), and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). Annually, GAS causes over 500,000 deaths and 18 million people are estimated to suffer from severe GAS-associated diseases. GAS infections also contribute significantly to antibiotic misuse, with sore throat (pharyngitis) being the third most common condition leading to antibiotic prescriptions in the U.S. and is a primary reason for self-medication with antibiotics in Europe –. These observations highlight the urgent need for the development of a GAS vaccine. A safe and efficacious vaccine would not only help control GAS infections and mitigate associated complications but also contribute to a reduction of antibiotic misuse.

### Gastrointestinal hemorrhage before anticoagulant therapy in Kawasaki disease: a case report [^861b3ec9]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

KD is the most common vasculitis in children. Even though more than 50 years have passed since the first description of this disease, the diagnosis of KD continues to remain a clinical dilemma and there is no confirmatory laboratory test. The diagnosis of KD is based on the presence of fever (lasting > 5 days) together with 4 of the 5 characteristic diagnostic criteria (rash, oropharyngeal changes, non-purulent conjunctivitis, cervical lymphadenopathy and change of the extremities). A prompt diagnosis is crucial because prognosis relies on timely initiation of the optimal treatment. The most common and life-threatening complication of KD, coronary artery abnormalities (CAA), will occur in approximately 25% of untreated patients which may lead to death by causing coronary thrombosis or myocardial infarction. The delayed diagnosis of KD could result in life-threatening problems particularly including cardiovascular sequelae.

Owing to its propensity to involve the medium-sized arteries in multiple organs, KD often mimics other disease processes. The diagnosis might be delayed if other prominent symptoms appear before the characteristic clinical features of KD, especially in children with incomplete or atypical forms. Incomplete KD occurs in patients presenting a typical fever without a sufficient number of main clinical criteria, with or without CAA. This kind of KD is frequent in children younger than 12–24 months and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of prolonged unexplained fever in childhood associated with any of the characteristic clinical features of the disease. The diagnosis can be considered confirmed when coronary artery aneurysms are identified in such patients by echocardiography. However, coronary artery dilatation is generally not detected by echocardiography until after the first week of illness, and a normal echocardiogram in the first week of illness does not rule out the diagnosis of KD. The term atypical KD is used when there are one or more symptoms or signs different from the main KD clinical features such as pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, facial paralysis, acute abdomen, arthritis, cholestatic jaundice, and renal injury. The diagnosis of KD is more challenging in the presence of one or more atypical manifestations.

### Gene transcript abundance profiles distinguish Kawasaki disease from adenovirus infection [^41348fc0]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Acute Kawasaki disease (KD) is difficult to distinguish from other illnesses that involve acute rash or fever, in part because the etiologic agent(s) and pathophysiology remain poorly characterized. As a result, diagnosis and critical therapies may be delayed.

Methods

We used DNA microarrays to identify possible diagnostic features of KD. We compared gene expression patterns in the blood of 23 children with acute KD and 18 age-matched febrile children with 3 illnesses that resemble KD.

Results

Genes associated with platelet and neutrophil activation were expressed at higher levels in patients with KD than in patients with acute adenovirus infections or systemic adverse drug reactions, but levels in patients with KD were not higher than those in patients with scarlet fever. Genes associated with B cell activation were also expressed at higher levels in patients with KD than in control subjects. A striking absence of interferon-stimulated gene expression in patients with KD was confirmed in an independent cohort of patients with KD. Using a set of 38 gene transcripts, we successfully predicted the diagnosis for 21 of 23 patients with KD and 7 of 8 patients with adenovirus infection.

Conclusions

These findings provide insight into the molecular features that distinguish KD from other febrile illnesses and support the feasibility of developing novel diagnostic reagents for KD based on the host response.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^a84567d9]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 vaccination in children with HIV — studies of adults and children with HIV show that vaccines are safe and immunogenic, though humoral responses are lower in people with advanced or untreated HIV, and vaccination against COVID-19 should not be delayed while awaiting immune reconstitution (AIII). Children with HIV may receive additional doses of COVID-19 vaccines per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised if they have stage 3 HIV infection, history of an AIDS-defining illness without immune reconstitution, clinical manifestations of symptomatic HIV, or untreated HIV infection. Contraindications or precautions are very few and are identical for children with and without HIV; common side effects include local reactions, ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy, and systemic reactions such as fever, fatigue, headache, or myalgias, with anaphylaxis or syncope rarely occurring in the immediate post-vaccination period. Myocarditis and/or pericarditis has been described most frequently among adolescent or young adult males, typically in the week after a second or subsequent messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine dose; myocarditis or pericarditis is estimated to be a rare outcome (up to two cases per 100,000 mRNA vaccine doses), and nearly all cases are mild and result in full recovery, while cardiac complications are estimated to occur at a rate two- to sixfold higher among adolescent males ages 12 to 17 years after SARS-CoV-2 infection than after mRNA vaccination.

Key points
- Skin rash and sore throat are common symptoms of scarlet fever.
- Physical signs of scarlet fever can appear on the tongue or skin and in the throat or neck.
- Complications aren't common after scarlet fever.
- Speak with a healthcare provider if you have concerns about scarlet fever. Signs and symptoms General symptoms Some symptoms of scarlet fever are common to other infections, too. These may include:

- Fever or chills
- Headache or body aches
- Nausea or vomiting
- Sore throat and pain when swallowing
- Stomach pain. Tongue, throat, and neck Signs in these areas include: Early in illness: Whitish coating on the tongue Later in illness: "Strawberry" tongue
- Red and swollen tonsils
- Swollen lymph nodes in the front of the neck
- Tiny, red spots on the roof of the mouth, called petechiae
- Very red throat
- White patches or streaks of pus on the tonsils.

Color of skin can vary Although the cheeks might look flushed, there may be a pale area around the mouth. Underarm, elbow, and groin skin creases may become brighter red than the rest of the rash. Rash fades and skin may peel The rash from scarlet fever fades in about 7 days. As the rash fades, the skin may peel around the fingertips, toes, and groin area. This peeling can last up to several weeks. Complications Complications can occur after having scarlet fever but aren't common. This can happen if the bacteria spread to other parts of the body. Complications can include:

- Abscesses around the tonsils
- Arthritis
- Ear, sinus, and skin infections
- Pneumonia
- Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis
- Rheumatic fever
- Swollen lymph nodes in the neck Treatment with antibiotics can prevent most of these health problems.

### A strep A vaccine global demand and return on investment forecast to inform industry research and development prioritization [^bfc926a3]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus or "Strep A") is a gram-positive bacterium that causes a wide spectrum of diseases in humans. The most common Strep A disease is pharyngitis, which results in over 600 million new global cases per year, predominantly in children. Strep A infection can also lead to serious invasive (e.g. sepsis) and toxin-mediated (e.g. scarlet fever) diseases, as well as necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Of Strep A diseases, RHD has the greatest morbidity and mortality, with global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of 10.5 million, mostly from premature deaths, and a global age-standardized prevalence rate of 513.7 per 100 000 people. In a recent study, RHD-related deaths were forecasted to remain almost constant until 2040, unlike other high-burden communicable diseases, including HIV and tuberculosis, for which mortality is projected to decrease quite significantly by 2040. It is estimated that Strep A causes 639 000 deaths each year, with RHD-related deaths accounting for approximately 73% of those deaths and invasive disease due to Strep A infection accounting for 25%. People in low- and middle-income countries as well as high-risk populations including pregnant women, the elderly, and Indigenous populations are disproportionately affected by diseases associated with Strep A infection. Strep A disease management involves antibiotic treatment and there is currently no pharmacological option to prevent Strep A infections.

### Update on streptococcal-associated rheumatic disease [^f934eaed]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review provides a comprehensive perspective on poststreptococcal rheumatic manifestations in pediatric patients by integrating recent updates and a literature review, with particular focus on poststreptococcal reactive arthritis and acute rheumatic fever.

Recent Findings

Poststreptococcal reactive arthritis presents with a unique clinical profile, distinguishing it from other poststreptococcal conditions in pediatric patients, especially acute rheumatic fever. Recent updates underscore the importance of diligent monitoring and management to mitigate potential cardiac complications, despite the relatively low incidence of carditis following poststreptococcal reactive arthritis.

Summary

The diagnosis of poststreptococcal reactive arthritis is often challenging due to significant overlap with other poststreptococcal syndromes, particularly acute rheumatic fever. Given the potential for cardiac complications in acute rheumatic fever, accurate differentiation between the two conditions is imperative. Ongoing research continues to refine diagnostic criteria and treatment approaches, emphasizing the need for clinicians to remain vigilant in recognizing and differentiating between the two syndromes.

### Pilot study comparing the childhood arthritis&rheumatology research alliance (CARRA) systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis consensus treatment plans [^89e77a62]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a rare childhood inflammatory disease associated with significant morbidity, and characterized by arthritis accompanied by high spiking fevers, plus additional features such as rash, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and serositis. There is considerable variation in systemic JIA treatment, due in part to a heterogeneous and somewhat unpredictable disease course, differences in physician practices, and until very recently, a lack of clinical trial data and evidence based guidelines. Recent trials of IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors (IL1i and IL6i) which demonstrated striking efficacy in systemic JIA were conducted in children with established chronic disease, so little evidence exists for use of biologic agents in new-onset or untreated systemic JIA. Nevertheless, many pediatric rheumatologists currently treat with IL1i and/or IL6i early in the course of disease. Intriguing data from several uncontrolled case series suggest that early use of these biologic agents might favorably alter the potentially devastating outcomes of chronic persistent systemic JIA. On the other hand, as many as 10–40% of patients may have a monocyclic course which remits spontaneously within the first year, complicating the evaluation of treatment effectiveness in early disease. An additional consideration is the question of whether rare, potentially fatal cardiopulmonary complications may be associated with the increased use of these agents specifically in systemic JIA.

### Systematic review of household transmission of strep A: a potential site for prevention that has eluded attention [^be409879]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Group A Streptococcus (hereafter, Strep A) is a bacterium responsible for significant global morbidity and mortality, causing an array of illnesses: superficial (ie, pharyngitis, impetigo), invasive (ie, bacteremia, sepsis), and toxin mediated (ie, scarlet fever). An estimated 162 million cases of Strep A impetigo are present globally at any one time, with 616 million annual cases of pharyngitis and 517 000 deaths caused by invasive Strep A infections per year worldwide. Strep A also has the potential to cause postinfectious immune-mediated illnesses — acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis — which can progress to causing rheumatic heart disease and chronic kidney disease, respectively. Susceptibility to postinfectious sequelae is driven by recurrent Strep A infection of the skin or throat in early life, leading to immune priming and vulnerability to these illnesses. There are > 200 known strains of Strep A, with a predilection for different clinical manifestations and evoking different host immune responses.

At a population level, incidence of Strep A infection and sequelae has long been associated with the consequences of socioeconomic marginalization, including poverty and household crowding. Contemporary case-control data from Aotearoa New Zealand strengthens the case for household crowding as a driver of Strep A infections. This is consistent with epidemiologic correlations in Australia, with the burden of Strep A and sequelae highest among remote-living Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in settings of poor household construction and limited infrastructure maintenance. Despite these associations, there has been little exploration of how household factors contribute to increased Strep A risk and what mitigation strategies may be possible. Understanding infectious disease transmission within houses and households offers important opportunities to understand and address disease effect. This systematic review scopes what is published about Strep A transmission events within household settings to inform thinking about environmental health responses in Australia.

### The economic burden of rheumatic heart disease in the Eastern mediterranean region [^ff8f2e91]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is an abnormal immunologic response to group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections arising as a sequela of untreated pharyngitis. It manifests 2–3 weeks after the onset of infection and may have cardiac, neurologic, musculoskeletal or dermatological manifestations. While ARF is common in children aged 5–15 years, it can affect individuals of every age. ARF has a high recurrence rate, particularly in patients left untreated. Severe or recurrent bouts of ARF can result in the development of complications such as rheumatic heart disease (RHD), which is caused by molecular mimicry. As the streptococcal M-protein bears structural resemblance to cardiac myosin and valvular endothelium, the immune system mistakenly targets cardiac tissues, causing valvular damage and disruption of cardiac function. This may lead to various heart-related issues, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, stroke and infective endocarditis. There is no cure for RHD, and treatment is symptomatic. In case there is damage to the heart valves, surgical intervention is carried out to replace or repair the damaged valves.RHD in pregnancy can cause both maternal and fetal complications, with increased risk of preterm delivery, abortions and intrauterine death.RHD is a preventable condition, primarily through the prompt and effective treatment of streptococcal infections with antibiotics, such as penicillin. Additionally, regular follow-up and treatment by healthcare providers can help manage RHD and reduce its impact on affected individuals.

### Routine pediatric surgical emergencies: incidence, morbidity, and mortality during the 1st 8000 days of life – A narrative review [^e82c4774]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Intra-abdominal infections

Abdominal sepsis due to intestinal perforation is a deadly complication following advanced intrabdominal infections such as typhoid fever or perforated appendicitis and requires emergency surgical intervention. These infections are most common in school age and adolescent children and may often go unrecognized or be undertreated at an early stage. This delay in care results in prolonged hospitalizations, additional surgeries, and preventable post-operative complications, further contributing to pediatric morbidity and mortality.

Typhoid fever

Typhoid fever is an infection caused by Salmonella typhi transmitted through the fecal–oral route, typically from contaminated food or poor water sanitation. Perforation due to typhoid fever or typhoid ileal perforation is a significant issue in LMICs and almost absent in HICs. The annual incidence of typhoid is estimated at 21 million cases, with an overall perforation rate of about 10% that increases with age, reaching a high of 30% by age 12 years. Mortality ranges from 12% in surgically equipped facilities to 100% in areas without adequate surgical access. For those children who do survive, the majority experience one or more complications, including surgical site infections, dehiscence, and enterocutaneous fistulae causing significant morbidity. Typhoid fever can also cause other complications that may require surgery, including cholecystitis, osteomyelitis, and abscesses. Further work on this condition has emphasized the consequences of delayed diagnosis due to multifactorial causes and resource shortages in surgical systems. In addition, reviews have also emphasized the need for prevention of this condition through distribution of the typhoid vaccine and improved sanitation. Routine vaccination against multi-drug resistant typhoid show promise in reducing disease burden globally, potentially averting 42.5 million cases. Table 1 summarizes recent literature on typhoid intestinal perforation and expands on a prior scoping review.
