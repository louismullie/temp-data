## Question

A 6-year-old develops truncal ataxia and dysmetria one week after recovering from varicella, and is diagnosed with post-infectious cerebellar ataxia. What ICD-10-CM code should be assigned for the cerebellar ataxia manifestation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be assigned for a 6-year-old with post-varicella acute cerebellar ataxia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and whether it maps to a specific ICD-10-CM diagnosis. Then, I should verify whether a post-infectious cerebellar ataxia code exists or if I need to use a manifestation code. Next, I will check the etiologic relationship to varicella and whether to code the infection as primary or additional. Finally, I will confirm the exact code and ensure documentation supports it, including any sequencing considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical diagnosis. Post-varicella acute cerebellar ataxia is a well-described, typically self-limited post-infectious syndrome in children, often arising within days to a couple of weeks after varicella, with truncal and appendicular ataxia, dysmetria, and sometimes nystagmus; neuroimaging is often normal, and prognosis is favorable, which fits this 6-year-old's presentation one week after varicella recovery [^ad8074d1] [^faa2aede] [^45de25fc].

> Wait, let me verify the ICD-10-CM landscape for this entity. I initially thought there might be a specific code like "post-infectious cerebellar ataxia", but hold on, I should verify that. I need to check whether such a code exists or if I should use a manifestation code such as G32.81 "cerebellar ataxia in diseases classified elsewhere", which would require coding the underlying condition first. Let me confirm: yes, G32.81 is the appropriate manifestation code, and it explicitly requires the underlying disease to be coded first, which in this case is varicella [^5d7f34b8].

> I should confirm the etiologic code next. Varicella in ICD-10-CM is coded as B01, with B01.8 capturing "varicella with other complications". Given that cerebellar ataxia is a recognized neurologic complication of varicella, B01.8 is the correct etiologic code to pair with the manifestation code, and I need to ensure I sequence it first as the underlying condition [^5fe226df] [^0ec0ecd8].

> Hold on, I should verify sequencing and coding conventions. ICD-10-CM requires that the underlying disease be coded first, followed by the manifestation. Therefore, the primary diagnosis should be B01.8 for varicella with other complications, and the secondary diagnosis should be G32.81 for cerebellar ataxia in diseases classified elsewhere. This sequencing aligns with official coding principles and the structure of G32.81 as a manifestation code [^5d7f34b8].

> Let me consider whether any alternative codes could apply and make sure I'm not missing a more specific option. I briefly wondered about using a generic ataxia code like R27.0, but that would be inappropriate here because the ataxia is a known complication of a classified disease (varicella), so I should not use an unspecified symptom code when a manifestation code and etiologic pairing exist. I should double-check: yes, G32.81 plus B01.8 is the correct, specific approach rather than R27.0 [^5d7f34b8].

> I need to ensure the documentation supports this coding choice. The record should explicitly state the diagnosis of post-infectious cerebellar ataxia, note the recent varicella infection, and ideally document that neuroimaging was normal or that no alternative cause was found, which strengthens the linkage to a post-varicella immune-mediated process and justifies B01.8 with G32.81 rather than other etiologies or unspecified codes [^ad8074d1] [^faa2aede].

> Final answer: Code B01.8 first for varicella with other complications, and code G32.81 second for cerebellar ataxia in diseases classified elsewhere. This pairing captures both the etiology (varicella) and the manifestation (cerebellar ataxia) in accordance with ICD-10-CM rules and the clinical entity of post-varicella acute cerebellar ataxia [^5d7f34b8] [^5fe226df].

---

The correct ICD-10-CM code for post-infectious cerebellar ataxia following varicella in a 6-year-old is **G32.81** (cerebellar ataxia in diseases classified elsewhere) [^5d7f34b8], with **B01.8** (varicella with other complications) as the underlying condition. This coding pair reflects the cerebellar ataxia as a neurological manifestation of a post-varicella complication [^5fe226df]. Accurate documentation of the temporal relationship between varicella and ataxia is essential to support this coding choice [^5fe226df].

---

## Clinical diagnosis and ICD-10-CM coding

Post-infectious cerebellar ataxia is an acute, immune-mediated cerebellar syndrome that typically follows a recent viral infection, most commonly varicella, and presents with truncal ataxia, dysmetria, and nystagmus [^ad8074d1] [^faa2aede]. The ICD-10-CM code **G32.81** specifically denotes cerebellar ataxia occurring as a manifestation of another disease, making it the appropriate code for the neurological presentation [^5d7f34b8]. The underlying condition, varicella with neurological complications, is coded as **B01.8** [^5fe226df].

---

## ICD-10-CM coding guidelines and documentation requirements

According to ICD-10-CM guidelines, when a neurological manifestation such as cerebellar ataxia results from another condition, the underlying condition should be coded first, followed by the manifestation code [^5d7f34b8]. Therefore, the correct coding sequence is:

- **Primary diagnosis**: B01.8 (varicella with other complications) [^5fe226df].
- **Secondary diagnosis**: G32.81 (cerebellar ataxia in diseases classified elsewhere) [^5d7f34b8].

Documentation must clearly establish the temporal relationship between the varicella infection and the onset of ataxia, as well as exclude other etiologies such as toxic, metabolic, or genetic causes [^5fe226df] [^faa2aede].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the diagnosis

Multiple studies and case reports document the association between varicella and acute cerebellar ataxia, emphasizing its immune-mediated pathogenesis and favorable prognosis [^ad8074d1] [^faa2aede]. The latency from varicella onset to ataxia is typically 1–2 weeks, consistent with a post-infectious process [^faa2aede]. Neuroimaging is often normal, further supporting a functional rather than structural etiology [^45de25fc].

---

## Potential coding pitfalls and common errors

Common coding errors include using **unspecified ataxia codes (e.g. R27.0)** or incorrectly coding the neurological manifestation as encephalitis (G04.90) when there is no evidence of parenchymal brain involvement [^5d7f34b8]. These errors can lead to inaccurate epidemiological data and inappropriate clinical decision-making. Accurate coding requires careful review of clinical documentation and adherence to ICD-10-CM guidelines [^5d7f34b8].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The correct ICD-10-CM code for post-infectious cerebellar ataxia following varicella in a 6-year-old is **G32.81**, with **B01.8** as the underlying condition. Accurate coding and documentation are essential for appropriate clinical management, epidemiological tracking, and insurance reimbursement. Clinicians should ensure that the medical record clearly documents the temporal relationship between varicella and the onset of ataxia, and coders should apply ICD-10-CM guidelines rigorously to avoid common errors [^5d7f34b8].

### Acute cerebellar ataxia in childhood: initial approach in the emergency department [^ad8074d1]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Acute childhood ataxia is a relatively common presenting complaint in paediatric emergency settings. Because life-threatening causes of pure ataxia are rare in children, an approach in a stepwise fashion is recommended. Acute cerebellar ataxia is the most common cause of childhood ataxia, accounting for about 30–50% of all cases. Varicella is the most commonly associated virus. Post-varicella acute cerebellar ataxia (PVACA) is the most common neurological complication of varicella, occurring about once in 4000 varicella cases among children younger than 15&emsp14; years of age, even in the postvaccine era. We describe an unimmunised child with PVACA to remind emergency physicians about its autoimmune pathogenesis. We also briefly discuss current controversies about the diagnostic approach and management.

### Post-infectious acute cerebellar ataxia in a young adult [^6bf31494]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Acute cerebellar ataxia is a clinical syndrome that involves loss of balance and coordination, typically within less than 72 hours. It usually presents in children and rarely affect adults. A woman in her early 20s presented with acute onset dizziness, vertigo, truncal ataxia and dysarthria 2weeks following an acute viral illness. Cerebral MRI identified evidence of dural enhancement, and positron emission topography brain imaging showed cortical reduction of glucose metabolism, consistent with an encephalopathic process. Lumbar puncture established a normal cerebrospinal fluid protein and glucose, with seven white cells ×10 6 /L. Subsequent investigations identified evidence of a recent Epstein-Bar virus, in keeping with a post-infectious acute cerebellar ataxia syndrome. Following treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone, symptoms resolved gradually over months. While post-infectious acute cerebellar ataxia is rare in adults, it is an important cause of an acute presentation of ataxia that should be recognised by paediatric and adult physicians.

### Post-infectious acute cerebellar ataxia in children [^faa2aede]. Clinical Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Acute cerebellar ataxia is a relatively common neurologic disorder among children. Our aim was to characterize the clinical picture, etiology, and prognosis of acute cerebellar ataxia. The medical records of all children with a diagnosis of acute cerebellar ataxia hospitalized in our center and Hasharon Medical Center from 1990 to 2001 were reviewed. The diagnosis of acute cerebellar ataxia was based on the following criteria: acute onset of ataxia with or without nystagmus; absence of known genetic predisposing factors, such as familial degenerative disorders; and absence of drug intoxication, bacterial meningitis, and metabolic disorders. Thirty-nine children were identified; 54% were male; mean age at presentation was 4.8 ± 3.8 years. All patients were observed for at least 1 year. A prodromal febrile illness was noted in 74.4%: varicella, 31%; mumps, 20%; nonspecific viral infection, 15.4%; mycoplasma, 5%; Epstein Barr virus, 3%. Latency from the prodromal illness to the onset of ataxia was 8.8 ± 7.4 days. The most common associated neurologic findings were nystagmus and dysmetria. Full gait recovery took less than 2 weeks on average, and the longest duration of neurologic signs was 24 days (mumps-related). Acute cerebellar ataxia in childhood is a self-limited disease. The recovery was faster than that reported in previous publications and was complete in all children without any neurologic sequelae. Imaging studies are needed only in atypical presentation or if there is no spontaneous improvement after 1 to 2 weeks.

### Is chickenpox so bad, what do we know about immunity to varicella zoster virus, and what does it tell us about the future? [^06bd475c]. The Journal of Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Varicella and zoster continue to cause significant morbidity and even mortality in children and adults. Complications include bacterial superinfection, central nervous system manifestations such as meningitis, encephalitis, and cerebellar ataxia, and pain syndromes especially post herpetic neuralgia. Many developed countries but not all, are now administering live attenuated varicella vaccine routinely, with a decrease in the incidence of disease, providing personal and herd immunity. There is some controversy, however, in some countries concerning whether a decrease in the circulation of wild type virus will result in loss of immunity to VZV in persons who have already had varicella. This manuscript reviews the complications of varicella and zoster in detail, the reasons for development of vaccines against these diseases, complications of vaccinations, and mechanisms by which immunity to this virus develops and is maintained. There are strong indications that the best way to control disease and spread of this virus is by vaccination against both.

### The yield of neuroimaging in children presenting to the emergency department with acute ataxia in the post-varicella vaccine era [^f286700d]. Journal of Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

To determine the yield of neuroimaging in children presenting to the emergency department with acute ataxia in the post-varicella vaccine era, we conducted a cross-sectional study between 1995 and 2013 at a single pediatric tertiary care center. We included children aged 1–18 years evaluated for acute ataxia of < 7 days' duration. The main outcome was clinically urgent intracranial pathology defined as a radiologic finding that changed initial management. We identified 364 children, among whom neuroimaging was obtained in 284 (78%). Forty-two children had clinically urgent intracranial pathology (13%, 95% confidence interval 9%-17%); tumors and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis were the leading findings. Age ≤ 3 years and symptoms ≤ 3 days of duration were predictors of low risk (0.7%, 95% confidence interval 0%-4.4%). In conclusion, neuroimaging may be indicated for most patients presenting with acute ataxia. Neuroimaging may be deferred in younger children with short duration of symptoms contingent on close follow-up.

### Postinfectious acute cerebellar syndromes in children: a nationally ascertained case series from Australia 2013–2018 [^cac85aa1]. Journal of Child Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postinfectious acute cerebellar syndromes show a wide spectrum of acute severity and can occur with acute febrile illness or vaccine receipt. Varicella has historically been the most common cause, associated with up to 25% of cases in large cohorts. This study aimed to describe the spectrum of syndromes in a setting with high varicella vaccine coverage.

Method

Data were collected on children initially identified as "suspected encephalitis" subsequently designated "not-encephalitis" at participating children's hospitals in the Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) network, Australia, as part of the Acute Childhood Encephalitis study. A comprehensive descriptive analysis was undertaken on prospectively identified, national series of children with postinfectious acute cerebellar syndromes from 2013 to 2018. Cases were classified using a previously validated severity score, and the outcome was assessed at 12 months using the Liverpool Outcome Scale score.

Results

A total of 20 cases (65% were vaccinated for varicella) were included, of which 70% were subcategorized as acute cerebellar ataxia (ACA), 20% acute cerebellitis (AC), and 10% acute fulminant cerebellitis (AFC). An acute febrile illness was noted in 55% and none were related to varicella or were temporally related to varicella vaccination or other childhood vaccines. A subset (total of 7 children) followed up at 12 months all showed reduced Liverpool Outcome Scale scores.

Discussion

The study provides an overall description of this uncommon spectrum of neurologic syndromes and shows the infrequency of varicella zoster virus as a cause in a vaccinated population.

### Diagnosis and management of progressive ataxia in adults [^259b7817]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ataxia, or lack of coordination, is a common manifestation of various neurological conditions, including stroke, brain tumour, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, toxicity, infection (including following varicella) and congenital cerebellar defects. Its evolution can be acute, subacute, episodic or chronic. Progressive ataxias frequently cause diagnostic uncertainty in general neurological practice, and many cases remain undiagnosed (or 'idiopathic'). This review aims to provide general neurologists with helpful pathways for diagnosing and managing adults with progressive ataxias. Recent advances in molecular genetics have enabled the diagnosis of many more cases with a genetic cause. Autoimmunity may also be important (but under-recognised) in causing some progressive cerebellar ataxias. There are no current treatments to halt the progression of most forms of chronic ataxia (with a few notable exceptions) but there have been recent advances in disease-modifying interventions. Ataxia management warrants a broad and multidisciplinary approach.

In this review, we explore in detail the progressive ataxias in adults, providing guidance on how to diagnose and to manage patients (and their families). Our advice is based on Ataxia UK's guidelines on the management of the ataxias (third edition July 2016), to which we have contributed. Our emphasis is clinical, guiding the busy general neurologist to a precise diagnosis, identifying pitfalls to avoid and outlining best practice in managing patients.

Types of ataxia

The ataxias may be broadly divided into those that are genetic (with or without a family history) and those that are acquired/degenerative. 'Sporadic' ataxia implies there is no family history. Acquired progressive ataxias can be immune mediated (eg, paraneoplastic spinocerebellar degeneration, gluten ataxia), degenerative (eg, cerebellar variant of multiple systems atrophy (type C)), caused by deficiency states (eg, vitamin B 12, vitamin E, and so on), toxicity (eg, alcohol-related ataxia, phenytoin), or associated with infections (HIV, sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy, and so on). Inherited ataxias can have autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked or mitochondrial (maternal) inheritance. Metabolic disorders (eg, Niemann-Pick type C, Tay-Sachs disease), even though 'inherited', can present as late-onset ataxia with no family history, emphasising the need for careful clinical scrutiny and comprehensive and appropriate laboratory testing.

### Acute ataxia in childhood: 11-year experience at a major pediatric neurology referral center [^45de25fc]. Journal of Child Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

We categorized the causes of acute ataxia in the pediatric population-referred to the Division of Neurology-at a large, urban pediatric medical center. Of the 120 cases identified over the past 11 years, post-infectious cerebellar ataxia was the most commonly diagnosed (59%), followed by drug intoxication, opsoclonus-myoclonus ataxia syndrome, episodic ataxia, acute cerebellitis, cerebellar stroke, ADEM, meningitis, cerebral vein thrombosis, Leigh's disease, Miller-Fisher syndrome, and concussion. Among the patients with post-infectious cerebellar ataxia, 85% were 1–6 years old and all had a history of antecedent viral illness. CSF pleocytosis was present in 40% of patients; all had normal brain MRIs. The majority (91%) recovered within 30 days. We conclude that post-infectious cerebellar ataxia remains the most common cause of acute ataxia in childhood and that it carries a good prognosis. We also differentiate acute post-infectious cerebellar ataxia from other causes with similar presentations.

### An increasing incidence of chickenpox central nervous system complications in children: what's happening in tuscany? [^8b794578]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The most frequent noncutaneous site of involvement of chickenpox is the central nervous system (CNS) and complications include cerebellar ataxia, encephalitis, and meningitis.

Objectives

We have recently observed an unusually high number of children with chickenpox CNS complications in our university children's hospital. A study to evaluate the incidence of these complications over time in children living in Tuscany was carried out.

Study Design

We evaluated all cases of chickenpox and chickenpox complications leading to hospitalization in children aged 1 month-14 years reported to the Tuscany public health centre between 1997 and 2004. The International Classification of Disease Ninth Revision-CM hospital discharge diagnostic codes and medical records were used.

Results

The incidence (95% confidence interval) of CNS complications/1000 chickenpox cases was stable between 1997 and 2001 [1997: 0.80 (0.29–1.74); 1998: 0.73 (0.29–1.50); 1999: 0.67 (0.25–1.46); 2000: 0.56 (0.15–1.44); 2001: 0.59 (0.16–1.50)] but increased significantly (chi(2) for trend: 9.401; p = .0021) in 2002 [1.56 (0.83–2.66)], in 2003 [1.73 (0.95–2.90)] and in 2004 [1.51 (0.74–2.27)]. Non-CNS complications remained stable over time.

Conclusions

Possible factors biasing the result were taken into account. Reasons of increased CNS complications remain unknown, but the possible emergence of a particularly neurotropic strain of varicella-zoster virus should be further investigated.

### Varicella death of an unvaccinated, previously healthy adolescent – Ohio, 2009 [^94ffe602]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Editorial Note

Varicella vaccine is highly effective (> 95%) in preventing severe varicella and deaths. VZV infection has the potential, even among healthy persons, to cause severe complications, including secondary bacterial infection and sepsis, pneumonia, encephalitis, cerebellar ataxia, and thrombocytopenia; these complications can occur within a few days of rash onset.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends routine administration of the first dose of varicella vaccine at age 12–15 months and the second dose at age 4–6 years. Catch-up vaccination also is recommended. Unvaccinated persons who do not have evidence of immunity to varicella * should receive 2 doses of varicella vaccine at appropriate intervals, and those who have received 1 dose previously should receive a second dose.

Before varicella vaccination was included in routine childhood immunization, approximately 11,000 varicella-related hospitalizations and 100–150 deaths were reported annually in the United States. Implementation of the varicella vaccination program in the United States has led to declines of > 95% in varicella-related illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths in populations that received routine vaccination. However, of 24,488 varicella-related hospitalizations during 2000–2006, a total of 17,142 (70%) were among healthy persons with no contraindications for vaccination. Among 112 varicella-related deaths during 2002–2007, a total of 100 (89%) were among persons with no high-risk preexisting conditions, such as cancer, immunodeficiency, or pregnancy.

### Acute cerebellar ataxia, acute cerebellitis, and opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome [^aa4d7711]. Journal of Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Acute cerebellar ataxia and acute cerebellitis represent a process characterized by parainfectious, postinfectious, or postvaccination cerebellar inflammation. There is considerable overlap between these entities. The mildest cases of acute cerebellar ataxia represent a benign condition that is characterized by acute truncal and gait ataxia, variably with appendicular ataxia, nystagmus, dysarthria, and hypotonia. It occurs mostly in young children, presents abruptly, and recovers over weeks. Neuroimaging is normal. Severe cases of cerebellitis represent the other end of the spectrum, presenting with acute cerebellar signs often overshadowed by alteration of consciousness, focal neurological deficits, raised intracranial pressure, hydrocephalus, and even herniation. Neuroimaging is abnormal and the prognosis is less favorable than in acute cerebellar ataxia. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis may be confused with acute cerebellitis when the clinical findings are predominantly cerebellar, but lesions on neuroimaging are usually widespread. Paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome is often initially misdiagnosed as acute cerebellar ataxia, but has very specific features, course, and etiopathogensis.

### Acute cerebellitis or postinfectious cerebellar ataxia? Clinical and imaging features in acute cerebellitis [^1cafb2a3]. Journal of Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute cerebellitis is a rare condition often considered within the group of acute postinfectious cerebellar ataxia despite its distinctive clinical and imaging features. We retrieved clinical, laboratory, and follow-up data of 15 children diagnosed with acute cerebellitis in our department between 2011 and 2019. There were 10 boys and 5 girls aged 3–15 years, median 9.5 years. The most common first symptoms were ataxia, vomiting, and headache. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) generally showed bilateral symmetrical T2 hyperintense changes with moderate swelling in the cerebellar cortex. Tonsillar herniation was present in 73.3% and obstructive hydrocephalus in 26.6%. Etiologic workup for infectious pathogens revealed Mycoplasma pneumoniae, influenza A virus, cytomegalovirus, and varicella zoster virus in 1 case each. Fourteen of 15 patients were treated with intravenous and/or oral steroids and 8 cases with intravenous immunoglobulin. No patient required surgical decompression. Neurologic examination median 12 months later revealed ataxia and dysmetria in 4 cases (27%), accompanied by memory difficulties, dysarthria or tremor. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; n = 12) showed diffuse cerebellar cortical T2-hyperintense signal changes in 11 cases and cerebellar atrophy in 9. The diagnosis of acute cerebellitis rather than acute postinfectious cerebellar ataxia should be considered when headache and vomiting accompany ataxia in a child. Acute cerebellitis heals with sequelae in about one-third of cases. The absence of fatalities in our series suggests early diagnosis, and steroid treatment can increase the chance of recovery. MRI results were not found to be predictive of outcome.

### Acute ataxia in paediatric emergency departments: a multicentre Italian study [^a4692a19]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the causes and management of acute ataxia (AA) in the paediatric emergency setting and to identify clinical features predictive of an underlying clinically urgent neurological pathology (CUNP).

Study Design

This is a retrospective medical chart analysis of children (1–18 years) attending to 11 paediatric emergency departments (EDs) for AA in an 8-year period. A logistic regression model was applied to identify clinical risk factors for CUNP.

Results

509 patients (mean age 5.8 years) were included (0.021% of all ED attendances). The most common cause of AA was acute postinfectious cerebellar ataxia (APCA, 33.6%). Brain tumours were the second most common cause (11.2%), followed by migraine-related disorders (9%). Nine out of the 14 variables tested showed an OR > 1. Among them, meningeal and focal neurological signs, hyporeflexia and ophthalmoplegia were significantly associated with a higher risk of CUNP (OR = 3–7.7, p < 0.05). Similarly, the odds of an underlying CUNP were increased by 51% by each day from onset of ataxia (OR = 1.5, CI 1.1 to 1.2). Conversely, a history of varicella-zoster virus infection and vertigo resulted in a significantly lower risk of CUNP (OR = 0.1 and OR = 0.5, respectively; p < 0.05).

Conclusions

The most frequent cause of AA is APCA, but CUNPs account for over a third of cases. Focal and meningeal signs, hyporeflexia and ophthalmoplegia, as well as longer duration of symptoms, are the most consistent 'red flags' of a severe underlying pathology. Other features with less robust association with CUNP, such as seizures or consciousness impairment, should be seriously taken into account during AA evaluation.

### Neurologic varicella complications before routine immunization in Germany [^0ec0ecd8]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Varicella is an acute febrile, highly infectious disease. We describe the incidence and types of neurologic complications in children up to 16 years old. Hospitalized varicella cases were prospectively captured by active nationwide surveillance through the German Pediatric Surveillance Unit for Rare Diseases from January 2003 to December 2004. Neurologic complications occurred in 232 (25.4%) of 918 hospitalized children with varicella, and were the most frequent reason for hospitalization. The median age was 4.2 years (interquartile range 2.5–5.9). The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (interquartile range 3–11). Neurologic complications were more frequent (P = 0.054) in immunocompetent (32%) than immunocompromised (4%) children. The most frequent diagnoses comprised acute cerebellar ataxia in 72 (31.0%), febrile convulsion in 69 (29.7%), meningoencephalitis in 52 (22.4%), cerebral convulsions in 21 (9.1%), syncope in 9 (3.9%), and cerebral vasculitis/infarction in 6 (2.6%) of all children with neurologic complications. Twenty-eight (12%) demonstrated sequelae (18 with ataxia, four with epilepsy, two with hemiparesis, three with cerebral nerve palsy, and one with dysesthesia). Three patients died. The yearly incidence of neurologic varicella-associated hospitalizations was estimated at 2.4 neurologic complications per 100,000 children, corresponding to about one neurologic complication in 2000 varicella cases.

### Varicella vaccination in Europe-taking the practical approach [^37e2c3e3]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Hospitalisations and complications from varicella

While usually self-limiting, a case of varicella can develop potentially serious complications (estimated in approximately 2 to 6% of cases attending a general practice; Additional file 2). Common complications in individuals hospitalised with varicella include superinfection of the skin, respiratory complications and neurological manifestations (for example, cerebellitis and encephalitis). Although seldom reported, long-term (including permanent or possible permanent) sequelae, which include severe scarring, ataxia/coordination disorder, epilepsy and cerebral nerve paralysis, occur in 0.4 to 10.1% of patients hospitalised for varicella (Additional file 2).

In the European studies identified, the incidence of hospitalisation for varicella ranged from 1.3 to 4.5 per 100,000 population/year and 12.9 to 28.0 per 100,000 children ≤ 16 years/year, with an average duration of hospital stay ranging from 3 to 8 days (Additional file 2). Most complications and hospitalisations for varicella occurred in children who were immunologically healthy with no underlying medical conditions.

Deaths from varicella

Occasionally, complications of varicella can be fatal; mortality rates from identified European studies are shown in Table S1 (Additional file 1). Of 13 varicella-related deaths reporting in children aged 9 months to 9 years, during the 2006 to 2007 varicella season in England, Scotland and Wales, 12 occurred in immunologically healthy children. Eight children died following catastrophic deterioration over less than 24 hours; group A streptococcal sepsis was confirmed in five children and Staphylococcus aureus sepsis in two children. Other potentially fatal complications of varicella in children include pneumonia and myocarditis.

The risk of death from varicella is much higher (25- to 174-fold) in adults than in children. As in children, the majority of adult deaths from varicella occur in previously healthy individuals, although underlying medical conditions, often immune suppression, contribute to a fatal outcome in some cases.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections among HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics [^73ffecd4]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations of varicella in children with HIV — The incubation period ranges from 10 to 21 days (average: 14 days) and lesions appear in three or more successive crops over approximately 5 to 7 days, evolving quickly (in about 24 hours) through macular, papular, vesicular, and pustular stages to crusts. Varicella causes more morbidity in patients with HIV than in the general population, with initial reports in children with HIV describing severe disease and chronic, atypical skin lesions, and clinically important systemic involvement including encephalitis, cerebellar ataxia, transverse myelitis, hepatitis, pneumonia, and multiorgan failure with intravascular coagulation. Subsequent studies suggest less complicated infections particularly in those receiving ART or with higher CD4 counts, but disease may last longer than normal with higher complication rates, and uncommonly, severely immunocompromised children can have persistent chronic infection with new VZV lesions for > 1 month after onset of varicella.

### Decline of neurologic varicella complications in children during the first seven years after introduction of universal varicella vaccination in Germany, 2005–2011 [^37c7f866]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Universal varicella vaccination for 1-year-old children was introduced in Germany in 2004. We investigated changes in the incidence and type of varicella-associated neurologic complications in children during the first 7 years after universal vaccination recommendation.

Methods

A surveillance study was conducted based on patients < 17 years of age with an International Classification of Diseases (10th Revision) discharge diagnosis of varicella, annually reported by 22–29 pediatric hospitals in Bavaria, Germany, 2005 to 2011. Annual incidences were estimated and linear trend across years was assessed by Poisson regression models.

Results

Of a total of 1263 varicella-associated pediatric hospitalizations, 228 children (18.1%) had neurologic complications (median age 4 years, interquartile range 2–7; 56% male). The most frequent neurologic complications were febrile convulsion (32.0% of 228 children, median age 3.0 years), varicella encephalitis or meningitis (28.9%; median age 4.5 years), syncope (13.2%; median age 7.0 years) and cerebral convulsion (11.0%; median age 4.0 years). Other complications included ataxia (3.1%), facial nerve palsy (2.6%) and cerebral vasculitis/infarction (1.8%). Neurologic complications showed a continuous decrease between 2005 and 2011, from an incidence of 2.8 (95% confidence interval: 2.1–3.6) per 100,000 children < 17 years of age to 1.2 (95% confidence interval: 0.7–2.1; P < 0.001). In particular, a marked decline was observed among children up to 7 years of age, mainly because of a decrease in the number of febrile convulsions and encephalitis or meningitis.

Conclusion

The incidence of varicella-associated neurologic complications in children decreased approximately by 60% during the first 7 years following the recommendation for universal vaccination.

### Myoclonus and cerebellar ataxia associated with COVID-19: a case report and systematic review [^925a1438]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in December 2019, neurological manifestations have been recognized as potential complications. Relatively rare movement disorders associated with COVID-19 are increasingly reported in case reports or case series. Here, we present a case and systematic review of myoclonus and cerebellar ataxia associated with COVID-19.

Methods

A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline using the PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases, from November 1, 2019 to December 6, 2020.

Results

51 cases of myoclonus or ataxia associated with COVID-19, including our case, were identified from 32 publications. The mean age was 59.6 years, ranging from 26 to 88 years, and 21.6% were female. Myoclonus was multifocal or generalized and had an acute onset, usually within 1 month of COVID-19 symptoms. Myoclonus occurred in isolation (46.7%), or with ataxia (40.0%) or cognitive changes (30.0%). Most cases improved within 2 months, and treatment included anti-epileptic medications or immunotherapy. Ataxia had an acute onset, usually within 1 month of COVID-19 symptoms, but could be an initial symptom. Concurrent neurological symptoms included cognitive changes (45.5%), myoclonus (36.4%), or a Miller Fisher syndrome variant (21.2%). Most cases improved within 2 months, either spontaneously or with immunotherapy.

Conclusions

This systematic review highlights myoclonus and ataxia as rare and treatable post-infectious or para-infectious, immune-mediated phenomena associated with COVID-19. The natural history is unknown and future investigation is needed to further characterize these movement disorders and COVID-19.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Cerebellar mutism caused by primary varicella infection in an immunocompetent child [^629931e4]. Journal of Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Varicella (chickenpox) is a common childhood infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which is often self-limiting and usually benign. Although uncommon, neurologic complications of varicella have been documented that include postinfectious cerebellar ataxia, meningoencephalitis, Reye syndrome, myelitis, optic neuritis, stroke, Guillain-Barré syndrome, seventh cranial nerve palsy, and Ramsay-Hunt syndrome. In this case study, the authors describe a 7-year-old girl who presented with varicella skin rash with unsteady gait and anarthria on day 2, and her condition was attributed to cerebellar mutism. To date, this complication has never been reported in a child with primary varicella infection. Therefore, this case study documents a rare but serious complication of childhood chickenpox.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Children hospitalized with varicella in Denmark: sensitivity of the national patient register [^ac07bcd1]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Varicella, common in childhood and most often self-limiting, may cause complications including bacterial superinfection, pneumonia and encephalitis. Universal childhood varicella vaccination has been introduced in several countries, but is controversial in Europe. In Denmark, varicella is not part of the national immunization program and there is no national surveillance of varicella. The primary aim of the study was to describe the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of children hospitalized with varicella in Denmark. The secondary aim was to validate the sensitivity and completeness of the Danish National Patient Register.

Methods

Active surveillance of children hospitalized with varicella was carried out at 4 pediatric departments. In the Danish National Patient Register, we identified all children discharged with an International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision code of varicella from the 4 departments. We used a capture-recapture analysis to estimate the "true" number of hospitalized children with varicella.

Results

By active surveillance, we identified 86 children eligible for clinical description. In 87% of cases, the children were 0–4 years of age. Complications were identified in 69% of patients, including 1 child with postvaricella cerebral angiopathy. In the National Patient register (NPR), we identified 125 children with a discharge diagnosis of varicella. By capture-recapture analysis, the sensitivity of the NPR was estimated to be 74%.

Conclusions

Varicella can cause serious complications including cerebral angiopathy in children in Denmark. The NPR will be a useful tool for estimating hospitalization incidence, but will underestimate the true number of hospitalizations.

### Acute ataxia in childhood: clinical presentation, etiology, and prognosis of single-center experience [^f74a0344]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute ataxia is a common reason for presentation to the pediatric emergency department and the pediatric neurology clinic in childhood. Its incidence is between 1/100,000 and 1/500,000. Its most common reason is infections.

Objective

The aim of this study was to examine the clinical presentation, etiological factors, and prognosis of patients presenting to our regional tertiary pediatric neurology clinic with a diagnosis of acute ataxia.

Methods

An evaluation was made of patients younger than 18 years diagnosed with acute ataxia in our tertiary pediatric neurology clinic between 2009 and 2016.

Results

Thirty-nine children were included in the analysis. Sex, age, diagnoses, treatment options, and clinical and radiological findings were evaluated. Acute postinfectious cerebellar ataxia was the most common diagnosis (21/39 [51.2%]). No agent could be identified in viral serological examination in 34 patients (87.2%). Rotavirus was identified in 2 (10.5%) of the acute postinfectious cerebellar ataxia cases, and varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, and hepatitis A positivities were each identified in 1 case. In 20 (51.2%) of 39 patients, varying treatments were applied according to the primary etiology.

Conclusions

Acute ataxia is a significant neurological problem in childhood. In this study, Rotavirus was the most common infectious agent. It may be related to vaccination. This study can be considered of value as the most comprehensive study conducted to date on this subject in the eastern region of Turkey.

### Acute cerebellar ataxia: an unusual pediatric case [^b3b6c038]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cerebellar ataxia is a clinical syndrome with sudden onset of uncoordinated gait and normal mental status in young children. Although it has a benign clinical course, it often requires an exhaustive diagnostic work-up in order to rule out potentially life-threatening etiologies that present similarly. The wide differential encompasses causes from infections, brain masses, drugs, toxins, trauma, paraneoplastic syndromes, as well as hereditary or congenital disorders.

Case Report

We report on a 4-year-old boy with recent hand-foot-mouth disease who presented with acute cerebellar ataxia. In addition to his marked truncal ataxia and wide-based, staggering gait, he had slowness of speech, which is not commonly reported with this condition in the literature. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians have a unique role in being first to evaluate pediatric ataxia and can make a significant impact on identifying potentially fatal mimickers of acute cerebellar ataxia. This article will attempt to outline major diagnostic considerations in order to aid emergency physicians through their clinical approach.

### Acute ataxia in childhood [^23e25052]. Journal of Child Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Acute childhood ataxia is a common cause of presentation to the pediatric emergency room or child neurologist. The primary concern on initial assessment is to exclude serious causes of this clinical syndrome, including central nervous system infections and mass lesions, while recognizing the essentially benign nature of acute ataxia in most children. Childhood ataxia can be diagnostically approached by consideration of the temporal course and presence or absence of associated neurologic abnormalities. In all forms of childhood ataxia, outcome is largely determined by etiology. In this review, the various causes and syndromes of acute ataxia in childhood are described, with discussion of diagnostic considerations and an approach to investigation, treatment, and prognosis.

### Central nervous system complications of varicella-zoster virus [^5fe226df]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the spectrum of central nervous system complications of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in children admitted to The Hospital for Sick Children between January 1999 and December 2012.

Study Design

Children aged 1 month to 18 years (n = 84) admitted with neurologic manifestations associated with a characteristic VZV rash or a confirmatory laboratory test (positive lesion scraping or cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction) were included in the study. Acute neurologic complications were included if they occurred within 4 weeks of VZV infection. Stroke was considered related to VZV if it occurred within 6 months of VZV infection, the neuroimaging was characteristic, and other causes were excluded.

Results

Clinical syndromes included acute cerebellar ataxia (n = 26), encephalitis (n = 17), isolated seizures (n = 16), stroke (n = 10), meningitis (n = 10), Guillain-Barré syndrome (n = 2), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (n = 2), and Ramsay Hunt syndrome (n = 1). In those with acute complications (nonstroke), neurologic symptoms occurred a median of 5 days after rash onset (range -6 to +16). The time between rash onset and stroke ranged from 2 weeks to 26 weeks (median 16.0 weeks). Three children with encephalitis died. Residual neurologic sequelae at one year occurred in 9 of 39 (23%) of children with follow-up data. Only 4 children were reported to have received the varicella vaccine.

Conclusion

Neurologic complications of VZV infection continue to occur despite the availability of an effective vaccine. Neurologic symptom onset can predate the appearance of the VZV exanthem and in rare cases may occur in the absence of an exanthem.

### Recurrent subacute post-viral onset of ataxia associated with a PRF1 mutation [^486773e4]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Inflammation is an important contributor to pediatric and adult neurodegeneration. Understanding the genetic determinants of neuroinflammation provides valuable insight into disease mechanism. We characterize a disorder of recurrent immune-mediated neurodegeneration. We report two sisters who presented with neurodegeneration triggered by infections. The proband, a previously healthy girl, presented at 22.5 months with ataxia and dysarthria following mild gastroenteritis. MRI at onset showed a symmetric signal abnormality of the cerebellar and peritrigonal white matter. Following a progressive course of partial remissions and relapses, she died at 5 years of age. Her older sister had a similar course following varicella infection, she died within 13 months. Both sisters had unremarkable routine laboratory testing, with exception of a transient mild cytopenia in the proband 19 months after presentation. Exome sequencing identified a biallelic perforin1 mutation (PRF1; p.R225W) previously associated with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL). In contrast to FHL, these girls did not have hematopathology or cytokine overproduction. However, 3 years after disease onset, the proband had markedly deficient interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) production. These observations extend the spectrum of disease associated with perforin mutations to immune-mediated neurodegeneration triggered by infection and possibly due to primary immunodeficiency.

### Acute cerebellar ataxia in a toddler: case report and literature review [^a769ed5a]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Acute cerebellar ataxia (ACA) is an inflammatory CNS disease that is characterized by rapid onset of ataxia in a child under 6 years of age. Symptoms typically occur in association with a relatively benign viral illness and have been reported after vaccination as well. Immunological studies suggest that both involve autoimmune destruction of axon tracts, with pathological and radiographic evidence of a link with multiple sclerosis. The emergency approach should be focused on excluding more significant illnesses, such as meningitis or an intracranial mass lesion. Here we present a case of a young girl with ACA and review the relevant literature.

### Evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of sydenham chorea: consensus guidelines [^718a843e]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Children with new‑onset chorea — differential diagnosis spans movement disorders; tic disorder or Tourette syndrome; post‑infectious movement disorder; autoimmune disorders including autoimmune encephalitis (anti‑NMDAR, anti‑GABAAR, and anti‑D2R) and other systemic autoimmune disorders; central nervous system infections including encephalitis (mycoplasma, herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, Japanese encephalitis virus) and Lyme disease; cerebrovascular disorders (cerebral arteriovenous malformations, Moyamoya syndrome); endocrine disorders or acute metabolic deficiency (hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperthyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency, and chorea gravidarum); neurodegenerative disorders or inborn errors of metabolism (Wilson disease, Lesch‑Nyhan syndrome, ataxia‑telangiectasia, glycine encephalopathy); dyskinetic‑choreoathetotic cerebral palsy; functional neurological disorder; drug side effects or intoxication; and intracranial space‑occupying lesions. The list "should serve as a guide to investigations in a patient suspected to have SC", with a "more thorough diagnostic evaluation" potentially required "in a low‑risk region for ARF", whereas "in a moderate to high‑risk ARF region or population with vulnerability to Sydenham Chorea… and evidence of a recent GAS infection, investigations can be tailored to local prevalence of the above conditions". Abbreviations include acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and Group A β hemolytic streptococcal (GAS).

### Varicella paediatric hospitalisations in Belgium: a 1-year national survey [^219310cb]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical features and complications

Fourteen per cent (79/552) of children presented with severe vesicular rash on admission, whereas 17% (N = 93) were reported to have only a mild eruption as defined above. The median time between the first lesions and hospitalisation was 3 days (range: 0–25 days). The main reasons for hospitalisation were suspected bacterial infection (49%), poor general status (20%), dehydration/anorexia (11%), the presence of neurological complications (10%), concomitant pneumonia (9%), high-grade persisting fever (6%), stomatitis (5%), underlying condition (5%), age below 3 months (3%) and social issues (3%). Poor general status, high fever and feeding difficulties justified admission in 34% of the youngest children (< 2 years). The median duration of hospital stay was short (3 days, IQR 2–5) but was up to 40 days in the most severe cases.

Sixty-five per cent (357/552) of children had one or more complications detailed in figure 1. Globally, the presence of any bacterial superinfection (not including pneumonia) represented two-thirds of complicated cases (235 children, 43% of the entire cohort). Bacterial skin and soft tissue infections were by far the most common (59% of complicated cases, 204 children). Among episodes with an available microbiology, meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and group A β-haemolytic Streptococcus were the main causal pathogens. Only three children had meticillin-resistant S. aureus infections. Neurological complications (N = 56, 10%) consisted in febrile seizures (29/56), cerebellitis with ataxia (13/56), encephalitis (6/56) and meningitis (2/56). Forty-nine children (9% of the cohort) suffered from pneumonia; out of them, 21 (43%) were recorded as having viral pneumonia, whereas in the remaining 28 (57%), a bacterial aetiology was suspected and treated accordingly. Rare complications included haemorrhagic vesicular rash (two cases), staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (one case) and disseminated vasculitic purpura (one case). Of interest, four babies had a neonatal varicella, all of which were self-limiting. No Reye's syndrome was reported.

Cerebellar ataxia without identified NSAbs

Post-infectious cerebellitis

This condition is well known in childrenbut adult cases have also been reported. Like OMS, it tends to improve spontaneously but often leaves long term deficits, especially in adults. Most cases are not associated with any identified antibody although autoantibodies cross reacting with Epstein–Barr virus have been reported, and autoimmune mechanisms are likely.

Cerebellar ataxia associated with antibodies against non-onconeural intracellular antigens

In cases of cerebellar ataxia without evidence of a tumour or onconeural antibodies, there is some evidence for potential autoimmune mechanisms. Antibodies against intracellular antigens have been reported in patients with non-paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia (eg, Homer3)and also with coexisting coeliac disease/gluten sensitivity (ie, antigliadin antibodies cross reacting with cerebellar antigens) although the latter hypothesis remains controversial. In addition, a more insidious course is described in non-paraneoplastic GAD-Ab associated cerebellar syndromes in which an autoimmune mechanism is further supported by CSF inflammation and polyendocrine autoimmunity. In each of these situations the possibility of NSAbs should be considered in the future.

### Use of the postacute sequelae of COVID-19 diagnosis code in routine clinical practice in the US [^505766f9]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

A new International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis code (U09.9 Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified) was introduced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on October 1, 2021.

Objective

To examine the use of the U09.9 code and describe concurrently diagnosed conditions to understand physician use of this code in clinical practice.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study of US patients with an ICD-10-CM code for post-COVID-19 condition used deidentified patient-level claims data aggregated by HealthVerity. Children and adolescents (aged 0–17 years) and adults (aged 18–64 and ≥ 65 years) with a post-COVID-19 condition code were identified between October 1, 2021, and January 31, 2022. To identify a prior COVID-19 diagnosis, 3 months of continuous enrollment (CE) before the post-COVID-19 diagnosis date was required.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Presence of the ICD-10-CM U09.9 code.

Results

There were 56 143 patients (7723 female patients [61.2%]; mean [SD] age, 47.6 [19.2] years) with a post-COVID-19 diagnosis code, with cases increasing in mid-December 2021 following the trajectory of the Omicron case wave by 3 to 4 weeks. The analysis cohort included 12 622 patients after the 3-month preindex CE criteria was applied. Among this cohort, the median (IQR) age was 49 (35–61) years; however, 1080 (8.6%) were pediatric patients. The U09.9 code was used most often in the outpatient setting, although 305 older adults (14.0%) were inpatients. Only 698 patients (5.5%) had at least 1 of the 5 codes listed as possible concurrent conditions in the coding guidance. Only 8879 patients (70.4%) had a documented acute COVID-19 diagnosis code (569 [52.7%] among children), and the median (IQR) time between acute COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 diagnosis codes was 56 (21–200) days. The most common concurrently coded conditions varied by age; children experienced COVID-19-like symptoms (eg, 207 [19.2%] had cough and 115 [10.6%] had breathing abnormalities), while 459 older adults aged 65 years or older (21.1%) experienced respiratory failure and 189 (8.7%) experienced viral pneumonia.

Conclusions and Relevance

This retrospective cohort study found patients with a post-COVID-19 ICD-10-CM diagnosis code following the acute phase of COVID-19 disease among patients of all ages in clinical practice in the US. The use of the U09.9 code encompassed a wide range of conditions. It will be important to monitor how the use of this code changes as the pandemic continues to evolve.

### Acute cerebellar ataxia in COVID-19 infection: a case report [^d7239425]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been widely reported to cause symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Neurologic complications have not been widely reported without associated respiratory symptoms. These neurologic manifestations have been found mostly in the elderly. There has been no report of ataxia or COVID-19 cerebellitis in the young adult population without associated respiratory symptoms.

Case Report

Here we report the case of a 30-year-old patient who presented with isolated cerebellar symptoms and was diagnosed with COVID-19 cerebellitis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? It is important for emergency physicians to know that COVID-19 can have many clinical manifestations and to have a high level of suspicion with acute neurologic symptoms.

### Pediatric de novo movement disorders and ataxia in the context of SARS-CoV-2 [^bd777fdd]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can trigger de novo movement disorders and cerebellar impairment in children and adolescents, likely through post-viral humoral autoimmunity. Most children presented with signs of COVID-19-associated ataxia comprising distinct characteristics different from other post-infectious ataxias or cerebellitis (older age, less favorable outcome). Fewer cases presented with chorea. Here, we identified CSF antibodies against structures of the basal ganglia, but details on the pathophysiology are yet to be discovered. Our data suggest that children with de novo movement disorders, and cerebellar inflammation can benefit from immune-modulating therapy, especially methylprednisolone, despite negative results in clinical investigations. Larger case numbers and longer clinical follow-up investigations will be necessary to further unravel the spectrum of pediatric COVID-19-associated ataxia/cerebellitis and COVID-19-associated chorea and potentially confirm these new clinical entities.

### Diagnosis and management of opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome in children: an international perspective [^f9aa3165]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background, Definitions, and Clinical Presentation

Multiple acronyms have been used to describe the same phenomenon: opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome (OMAS), opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS), opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia (OMA), and dancing eye syndrome. The incidence of OMAS has been reported for the United Kingdom in a prospective study as 0.18 cases per million of the populationand in a retrospective study in Japan as 0.27 cases per million children. The mean age at presentation was 18 months in the prospective study, and the median age was 16.5 months in the retrospective study. In a large retrospective single-center study of 356 children, the mean age at onset in children was not significantly different between those with tumor (1.7 years ± 0.89 SD) and those without (2.1 years ± 1.4 SD), with the vast majority presenting before age 5 years. Those children presenting after age 24 months were found to be less likely to present with tumor than those younger than 24 months (< 12 months, 58%, 12–24 months, 52%, > 24 months, 38%, p = 0.03). No cases in this large published series presented after age 10.

OMAS falls along the spectrum of acquired cerebellar ataxias of childhood, which may include syndromes presenting purely with ataxia, but is distinct for its paraneoplastic association with neuroblastoma (26%–44%), and the presence of opsoclonus and myoclonus. Opsoclonus, due to saccadic bursts, produces chaotic eye movements, without an intersaccadic interval, unlike nystagmus that is rhythmic and has fast or slow waves depending on the etiology. Because children with OMAS often present with gait imbalance, initial diagnosis is often acute cerebellar ataxia, an infectious or postinfectious illness, which in some cases is associated with varicella zoster or Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The development of opsoclonus and/or myoclonus declares the OMAS diagnosis. Occasionally, eye movement abnormalities present first and can resemble the sensory nystagmus seen in patients with visual loss. In such cases, primary ophthalmologic disorders should be considered, especially in children with onset less than 3 months of age.

### Pediatric de novo movement disorders and ataxia in the context of SARS-CoV-2 [^35547e78]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

After its outbreak in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2) spread rapidly around the world. By February 2022, more than 14 million children had been tested positive for COVID-19 and the pediatric infection-induced SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence was around 70% in the United States. Governments were forced to impose restrictions (e.g. school closure and social distancing) to fight exponential spread and hospital admissions. With unprecedented speed, vaccinations were developed and approved under an emergency use authorization by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and EMA (European Medicines Agency) in 2021, even for children.

Three years into the pandemic, we know that children present with milder respiratory symptoms than adults, possibly due to a stronger early innate antiviral response against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, in addition to the general symptoms of COVID-19, rare neurologic abnormalities have been gradually reported with involvement of the central and peripheral nervous system, including hypo- and hyperkinetic movement disorders, as well as cerebellar and pyramidal signs. Movement disorders, although often not life threatening, are functionally debilitating, stigmatizing, and pose a tremendous burden on the affected children and their families. The rising incidence of functional movement disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic was recently linked to the "Charcot's Era at the Salpêtrière" and discussed in the scope of governments' measures and their profound psychological impact. Therefore, it is even more important to characterize and identify the non-functional de novo movement disorders associated with COVID-19. There is increasing evidence that such dysfunctions may have an autoimmune underpinning, thereby offering options for causative treatment. In fact, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is rarely detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), at least in adult patients, and neuropathological analyses suggest that cellular and humoral mechanisms rather trigger neuronal dysfunction. As examples, in children, post-infectious conditions with movement disorders (e.g. acute cerebellar ataxia or Sydenham's chorea) with favorable outcomes have been well described. While single case reports and series of pediatric patients with de novo movement disorders in the context of a SARS-CoV-2 infection have been published, an overview of associated clinical phenotypes and their frequencies was still missing.

### Cerebellitis associated with influenza A (H1N1) pdm09, United States, 2013 [^5ba12d3e]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Figure
A) Magnetic resonance images of the brain of a woman with cerebellitis associated with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, United States, 2013. T1-weighted axial MRI brain sequence showing hypo-intensity of bilateral cerebellar hemispheres. B) T2-weighted axial MRI brain sequence showing hyperintensity of bilateral cerebellar hemispheres.

The patient was given oseltamivir, 75 mg orally twice daily for 5 days. She experienced a progressive improvement of ataxia and dysarthria during her hospital stay and was discharged after 1 week. At a follow-up visit 2 months later, the patient had remained healthy and neurologically stable.

Cerebellitis, or acute cerebellar ataxia, is an inflammatory process of the cerebellar white matter that occasionally is manifested after systemic viral or bacterial infections. The following pathogens are known to cause acute cerebellitis: viruses varicella-zoster, herpes simplex, Epstein-Barr, rotavirus, echovirus, coxsackie, mumps, measles, and rubella; and bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, Coxiella burnetii, Salmonella typhi, and Bordetella pertussis. Although the condition is presumed to be more common in children, adult cases of cerebellitis have been well described.

Before this case, influenza cerebellitis had been diagnosed in 8 cases as of 2011 (Technical Appendix Table). Two cases were reported in adult women and the remaining were in children. Four had a probable diagnosis of influenza cerebellitis, although positive viral culture or RT-PCR was lacking. Seven case-patients had influenza-like illness preceding the neurologic symptoms. One case-patient showed evidence of pneumonia, and described the interval from respiratory illness onset to developing of cerebellar signs Clinical sequelae, displayed in most case-patients affected by influenza cerebellitis, varied from complete recovery to development of serious complications such as hydrocephalus.

The pathogenic mechanism of influenza virus infection on the CNS can be either a direct invasion of the virus that causes acute illness or, more typically, a delayed autoimmune demyelinating postviral encephalopathy. Amplification of viral DNA in CSF is rare in most influenza-related CNS infections. In this case, the positive RT-PCR results for influenza A and the pertinent brain MRI findings, as well as the concurrent influenza prodromal symptoms, suggest that acute influenza cerebelllitis, rather than a postinfluenza encephalopathy, caused the associated neurologic findings.

### Pediatric de novo movement disorders and ataxia in the context of SARS-CoV-2 [^26c480aa]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

It appears that in most pediatric cases of COVID-19, two different neurological systems may be affected: (i) the cerebellar system and (ii) the cortico-basal ganglia network.

(ad i) Both, acute cerebellar ataxia (ACA) and acute cerebellitis (AC) are well-known (post)infectious conditions in children, with ACA being the most common cause for acute ataxia in pediatric emergency departments. Whereas these patients typically present with chief complaints as ataxia, unsteady gait, nystagmus, or dysmetria, children with AC additionally suffer of altered mental state and more frequently show brain MRI abnormalities. Children with ACA are typically under the age of 6 years and the outcome is very good. Segal et al. reported on a cohort of 58 children, 72% of whom made a complete spontaneous recovery within 1–2 days and the remainder within 3–21 days. Yet, after AC, Lancella et al. reported on neurologic sequelae in 6% of children, and those with pathologic findings on neuroimaging were more likely to have only partial recovery. In our cohort, we describe 26 children with predominant cerebellar signs in the context of COVID-19 (Fig. 2, Table 3, Supplementary Table 3). Only 12% could be classified as ACA, whereas most patients (54%) met criteria of AC. Chief complaints were ataxia, unsteady gait or dysmetria; and in many cases (70%) abnormalities on brain MRI were identified. Unlike ACA/AC, the median age of these patients with COVID-19-associated ataxia/cerebellitis was higher at 9 years and the onset of ataxia was earlier, with 70% of the children developing movement disorders during the acute course of infection. The outcome of these children was less favorable in comparison to ACA/AC: only 17% recovered without treatment, another 61% recovered completely after therapy, and 22% of patients recovered only partially after treatment. Within the small subgroup of three cases meeting the criteria of ACA, the outcome was better with 67% of spontaneous recovery and 33% fully recovering after treatment. To confirm these two entities in de novo ataxia/cerebellitis after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to further identify prognostic parameters and long-term outcomes, larger cohorts and longer follow-up periods will be necessary. Even so, COVID-19-associated ataxia/cerebellitis seems to have distinct characteristics and immunotherapy may be superior to watchful waiting.

### Varicella zoster virus cerebellitis without skin manifestations in an immunocompetent adult [^0f1a6c55]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

The varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a ubiquitous, neurotropic pathogen capable of reactivation from sensory ganglion cells to cause dermatomal herpes zoster infection, alongside a range of pathologies within the central nervous system. The presence of VZV cerebellitis without skin manifestations, however, is exceedingly rare in immunocompetent adults. We report a case of VZV cerebellitis in an immunocompetent woman in her 70s, in the absence of a rash. The patient presented with a 2-week history of progressive gait ataxia, headache and mild confusion. Serological tests and neuroimaging were unremarkable. Diagnosis was confirmed through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis which revealed lymphocytosis and the presence of VZV DNA on PCR analysis. The patient showed symptomatic improvement following empirical acyclovir treatment, corroborated by favourable CSF analysis 10 days post-treatment initiation. Infective aetiology, including VZV, should be considered in patients presenting with acute cerebellar ataxia, even in immunocompetent adults with an absence of dermatological signs.

### Substantial health and economic burden of COVID-19 during the year after acute illness among US adults at high risk of severe COVID-19 [^33ae48de]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-COVID conditions are characterized by symptoms of COVID-19 that extend beyond the initial recovery from acute illness. Presentation is highly variable across patients and may include residual symptoms that persist after acute illness, persistent organ dysfunction, or new symptoms or syndromes that develop after initial recovery from COVID-19. Post-COVID conditions often affect multiple organ systems, persist for several months, and have a substantial impact on daily functioning and productivity. The clinical diagnosis, termed post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), was officially defined and assigned an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), code (U09.9) in October 2021, but a widely accepted case definition and associated symptom timeframe is still under development.

Multiple studies have identified post-COVID conditions as a frequent result of COVID-19 illness, but prevalence estimates vary. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently reported that 38.2% of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 experienced ≥ 1 post-COVID condition from 30 to 365 days following diagnosis. The World Health Organization reports a range from 10% to 20% of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and other studies have reported rates of up to 57% 6 months after diagnosis. Heterogeneous cohorts likely contribute to varying results given that certain characteristics, such as female sex and older age, are associated with developing long-term sequelae.

Although the risk of post-COVID conditions has been associated with more severe cases of acute illness, it can occur across all levels of COVID-19 severity. In a systematic review of > 2000 studies conducted worldwide among patients with varying disease severity, more than half of patients who recovered from acute illness experienced long-term sequelae for ≥ 6 months after diagnosis. In 2 studies from Germany and the Faroe Islands of mainly nonhospitalized patients with asymptomatic or mild to moderate acute illness, approximately 28% to 53% of patients experienced persistent symptoms of COVID-19 months later.

### Coding long COVID: characterizing a new disease through an ICD-10 lens [^c21b8f63]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Naming a newly discovered disease is a difficult process; in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the existence of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), which includes long COVID, it has proven especially challenging. Disease definitions and assignment of a diagnosis code are often asynchronous and iterative. The clinical definition and our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of long COVID are still in flux, and the deployment of an ICD-10-CM code for long COVID in the USA took nearly 2 years after patients had begun to describe their condition. Here, we leverage the largest publicly available HIPAA-limited dataset about patients with COVID-19 in the US to examine the heterogeneity of adoption and use of U09.9, the ICD-10-CM code for "Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified".

Methods

We undertook a number of analyses to characterize the N3C population with a U09.9 diagnosis code (n = 33,782), including assessing person-level demographics and a number of area-level social determinants of health; diagnoses commonly co-occurring with U09.9, clustered using the Louvain algorithm; and quantifying medications and procedures recorded within 60 days of U09.9 diagnosis. We stratified all analyses by age group in order to discern differing patterns of care across the lifespan.

Results

We established the diagnoses most commonly co-occurring with U09.9 and algorithmically clustered them into four major categories: cardiopulmonary, neurological, gastrointestinal, and comorbid conditions. Importantly, we discovered that the population of patients diagnosed with U09.9 is demographically skewed toward female, White, non-Hispanic individuals, as well as individuals living in areas with low poverty and low unemployment. Our results also include a characterization of common procedures and medications associated with U09.9-coded patients.

Conclusions

This work offers insight into potential subtypes and current practice patterns around long COVID and speaks to the existence of disparities in the diagnosis of patients with long COVID. This latter finding in particular requires further research and urgent remediation.

### International classification of diseases (ICD-11) and neurologic disorders: the future [^cd55411e]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

When the WHO's Topic Advisory Group for Neurology (TAG) started work on revision of the ICD-10 diagnostic codes in June 2009, the issues were daunting. The existing classification was produced a generation ago and the need to move to the digital age was becoming imperative. Appreciating modern advances in genetics and immunology, and the consequent changes in understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of the nervous system, WHO's charge to the TAG was to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date disease classification, while providing published or consensus evidence for each coding change. In addition, the task would be to focus on ways to reduce the treatment gap while considering the utility of ICD-11 when used in primary care and nonspecialist settings. The project mushroomed over the 3 years since our first meeting and continues to do so. The work was made even more difficult as the group needed to add "content models" for the major codes for the first time (i.e., providing a definition for each disorder, along with appropriate diagnostic tests and outcome). The ICD-11 is meant to be updated as new knowledge develops, rather than waiting some years for another whole-scale revision, but this process has yet to be defined.

3.2 Case Identification and Baseline Characteristics

A total of 1488 individuals ≥ 18 years of age received at least one diagnosis of VZV‐associated CNS infection between 2010 and 2019, and 3823 controls were matched regarding age, sex, and place of residence. The cases were diagnosed as encephalitis (n = 571), meningitis (n = 669), RHS (n = 252), or vasculitis (n = 1). An ICD‐10 code for zoster‐related complications (B02) was used in 73% of encephalitis cases, 64% of meningitis cases, and 90% of RHS cases (Supporting Information S1: Table S3). Five individuals who were diagnosed as having meningitis and RHS were counted in both groups. No cases of cerebellitis were identified. Four cases with RHS were identified exclusively in primary healthcare. Cases with VZV‐associated CNS infection had a median age of 61 (interquartile range [IQR] 37–76 years), with encephalitis, rather than meningitis, generally affecting older patients (median 75 vs. 45 years; Table 1). The ratio between females and males was close to 1:1 in all groups. Encephalitis cases had more comorbid conditions, including immunosuppressive diseases, than cases with other manifestations. The proportion of patients treated with any immunosuppressive drug was similar for the different groups, that is, cases with encephalitis (21.5%), meningitis (17.0%), and RHS (16.7%). Details about immunosuppressive diseases and drugs included are listed in Supporting Information S1: Tables S4 and S5.

### Use of the postacute sequelae of COVID-19 diagnosis code in routine clinical practice in the US [^83d2b742]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

After the release of a new ICD-10-CM code for post–COVID-19 condition in October 2021, we observed this code among 56 143 patients through January 31, 2022, in this cohort study. When new codes are added to the ICD-10-CM coding dictionary, it is not always clear how quickly they will be used. Similar to when the code for acute COVID-19 (U07.1) was introduced, there was immediate use in routine clinical practice. We also observed increasing use later in January 2022, approximately 1 month after the peak in COVID-19 diagnoses, suggesting a temporal association with acute case epidemiology. The guidance for the post–COVID-19 condition code recommends concurrently coding 1 of the following conditions: chronic respiratory failure, loss of smell or taste, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, pulmonary embolism, or pulmonary fibrosis. However, clinicians' use of the post–COVID-19 code is not limited to these specific symptoms or diseases. Indeed, we observed very few patients (5.5%) with these conditions. It appears that physicians are using this code to represent a multitude of symptoms, conditions, and body systems. The seemingly broad use of this new diagnosis code is not unexpected. COVID-19 has previously been linked to developing chronic conditions (eg, cardiovascular and kidney disease), which could be more severe in older age groups. This may explain why we observed 14.0% of adults aged 65 years or older coded with post–COVID-19 condition in an inpatient setting. Although our study was not designed to determine whether these concurrent conditions were incident or exacerbations of preexisting chronic conditions, it is likely that older adults with post–COVID-19 experience more varied and complicated sequelae. Further research using other databases (eg, electronic health records) is needed to examine potential overlap between the post–COVID-19 code and clinical signs and symptoms. Although the majority (74.2%) of post–COVID-19 cases occurred in younger adults, 8.6% occurred in children. The most common concurrent diagnoses in children were signs and symptoms including cough, breathing abnormalities, malaise, and throat and chest pain. These are symptoms similar to those reported in other prospective studies. It is important to note that most post–COVID-19 codes were identified in the outpatient setting vs the inpatient setting. However, further analyses could stratify by care setting to further describe differences between these patients. Among those with a prior documented COVID-19 diagnosis (8879 cases [70.4%]), the time to the post–COVID-19 diagnosis code was a median (IQR) of 56 (21–200) days. This contributes to the body of literature seeking to understand when post–COVID-19 starts. The median time of 56 days is aligned with post–COVID-19 starting at either 3 or 4 weeks, as viral shedding declines over the course of 2 weeks, although prolonged shedding has been documented for severe cases.

### Recent advances in diagnosis of immune-mediated cerebellar ataxias: novel concepts and fundamental questions on autoimmune mechanisms [^c4a29fba]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Immune-mediated cerebellar ataxias (IMCAs) represent a group of disorders in which the immune system targets mainly the cerebellum and related structures. We address fundamental questions on the diagnosis and immunological pathogenesis of IMCAs, as illuminated by recent advances in the field. Various types of IMCAs have been identified, including post-infectious cerebellitis, Miller Fisher syndrome, gluten ataxia, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD), opsoclonus and myoclonus syndrome, and anti-GAD ataxia. In some cases, identification of several well-characterized autoantibodies points to a specific etiology in IMCAs and leads to a firm diagnosis. In other cases, various autoantibodies have been reported, but their interpretation requires a careful consideration. Indeed, some autoantibodies have only been documented in a limited number of cases and the causal relationship is not established. In order to facilitate an early treatment and prevent irreversible lesions, new entities have been defined in recent years, such as primary autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (PACA) and latent autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (LACA). PACA is characterized by autoimmune features which do not align with traditional etiologies, while LACA corresponds to a prodromal stage. LACA does not imply the initiation of an immunotherapy but requires a close follow-up. Concurrently, accumulation of clinical data has led to intriguing hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of autoimmunity, such as a pathogenesis of autoimmunity against synapses (synaptopathies), and the vulnerability of the entire nervous system when the immunity targets ion channels and astrocytes. The development of PCD in patients treated with immune-checkpoint inhibitors suggests that molecular mimicry specifically determines the direction of autoimmunity, and that the strength of this response is modulated by co-signaling molecules that either enhance or dampen signals from the antigen-specific T cell receptor.

### Cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome in children with acute postinfectious cerebellar ataxia [^5711f4f3]. Pediatric Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute postinfectious cerebellar ataxia is the most common cause of acute ataxia in childhood. One previous case study has suggested that cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome may be comorbid with acute postinfectious cerebellar ataxia, but this was not confirmed by formal assessments.

Methods

Children aged three to 15 years with a confirmed diagnosis of acute postinfectious cerebellar ataxia were invited to participate. Three patients were included and assessed by a pediatrician, neuropsychologist, and logopedist at the subacute stage (less than 14 days post-onset) and after six months and one year of follow-up.

Results

All three children complied with the diagnostic criteria of cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome. The cognitive and affective symptoms persisted longer than the motor symptoms. Child A (girl, aged three years and eight months) was most severely affected with slow progression of motor cerebellar symptom; the cerebellar cognitive affective symptoms had not entirely remitted at one-year follow-up. Child B (boy, aged four years and four months) had more subtle motor cerebellar symptoms that swiftly remitted within the first week; the cerebellar cognitive affective symptoms were also more subtle. Child C (boy, aged seven years and eleven months) was considerably affected by motor cerebellar symptoms but showed marked improvement within the first month; the cerebellar cognitive affective symptoms had not entirely remitted at one-year follow-up.

Conclusion

Cognitive affective cerebellar syndrome may be an overlooked complication of acute postinfectious cerebellar ataxia. The severity of cerebellar cognitive affective symptoms seemed to correspond to the severity of the cerebellar motor symptoms, but the improvement was remarkably slower.

Diagnoses

Between the baseline and post-acute phases, the frequency of individual ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes increased within several chapters (Fig. 2). The greatest percentage increase was observed in the ICD-10 chapter of "diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs and certain disorders involving the immune mechanism" (+ 16.3%), followed by "diseases of the nervous system" (+ 11.1%), "external causes of morbidity and mortality" (+ 7.9%), and "mental and behavioral disorders" (+ 7.7%).

Fig. 2
Percentage change from baseline to post-acute phase in ICD-10 diagnoses in the overall population (N = 19,558). Diagnosis codes (shown in parentheses) include those with a prevalence of ≥ 2% in the baseline population and with an increase from baseline to post-acute phases. Code ranges, raw values at baseline and post-acute phases, and diagnoses decreasing from baseline to post-acute phases are shown in Table 3. ICD-10, International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision

Frequencies of other disorders increased more modestly or decreased (Table 3); the greatest percentage decrease was observed in the chapter of "diseases of the respiratory system" (–18.3%). Within this chapter, the decrease was driven specifically by a drop in frequency of the subchapters acute upper and lower respiratory infections (–56.6% and –69.3%, respectively), which outweighed increases in frequency of other respiratory conditions, such as "other respiratory diseases principally affecting the interstitium" (+ 59.8%; Table S 2 and Fig. S 1).

### Acquired ataxias: the clinical spectrum, diagnosis and management [^f53f4615]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Acquired ataxias represent a large group of disorders defined by the common clinical feature of ataxia and the absence of a clear genetic basis for it. Based on the aetiology, the group can be subdivided into autoimmune, toxic, infectious and vitamin deficiency causes. Cerebellar ataxia may occur as an isolated syndrome in this spectrum of disorders but is often accompanied by additional neurological manifestations. Clinical work-up is challenging and mainly includes biochemical analyses, whereas imaging is of minor significance. Diagnosis is essential as many of these disorders represent potential treatable conditions and early therapy may prevent progressive cerebellar ataxia. The clinical findings, the implications for diagnosis and management of this heterogeneous group of disorders are discussed in this review.

### Severe complications of chickenpox in hospitalised children in the UK and Ireland [^7cd95663]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

To estimate the annual incidence of hospitalisations due to severe complications of varicella, describe the complications and estimate annual mortality.

Methods

Active surveillance throughout the UK and Ireland for 13 months by paediatricians notifying cases to the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit and completing a questionnaire. The case definition was any child aged < 16 years hospitalised with complicated varicella, as defined by a list of conditions, or admitted to ICU/HDU with varicella.

Results

188 cases were notified for the surveillance period, of which 112 (0.82/100 000 children/year) met the case definition and were not duplicates. Confirmed cases had a median age of 3 years (range 0–14). The complications were: bacteraemia/septic shock (n = 30), pneumonia (n = 30), encephalitis (n = 26), ataxia (n = 25), toxic shock syndrome/toxin-mediated disease (n = 14), necrotising fasciitis (n = 7), purpura fulminans/disseminated coagulopathy (n = 5), fulminant varicella (n = 5) and neonatal varicella (n = 3). 52 children (46%) had additional bacterial infections. Six deaths were due, or possibly due, to varicella, including one intrauterine death. Four of the other five children who died (ages 2–14 years) had a pre-existing medical condition. Sequelae on discharge were reported for 41 cases (40%), most frequently ataxia or skin scarring. The median length of hospital stay was 7 days (range 1–68).

Conclusions

This study provides a minimum estimate of severe complications and death resulting from varicella in children in the UK and Ireland. Most complications, excluding deaths, occur in otherwise healthy children and thus would be preventable only through a universal childhood immunisation programme.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Incidence and risk factors for varicella-zoster virus-associated central nervous system infections: a nationwide Swedish retrospective case-control study [^a73cb198]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Results

3.1 Case Validation

To validate VZV‐associated CNS infection diagnoses the medical records of 114 subjects were reviewed, of which 40 were diagnosed as encephalitis, 40 as meningitis, and 34 as RHS. Two‐thirds of the validated cases had received an ICD‐10 code for zoster‐related complications (B02) and the remainder were diagnosed with varicella‐related complications (B01; Supporting Information S1: Table S1). The PPV for meeting the predefined criteria was 73%, 58%, and 88% for encephalitis, meningitis, and RHS, respectively. Some cases not meeting the criteria were considered probable after review of the records (encephalitis n = 2; meningitis n = 1). Including these probable cases, the PPV reached 78% (encephalitis), 60% (meningitis), and 88% (RHS), while the PPVs for having any VZV‐associated CNS infection when diagnosed with encephalitis, meningitis, or RHS were 93%, 85%, and 88%, respectively (Supporting Information S1: Table S7). The overall PPV was 89% (95% CI [82–94]) for having any VZV‐associated CNS infection when diagnosed as either encephalitis, meningitis, or RHS. Further details of the results of the validation study are found in Supporting Information S1: Tables S8–S11.

Acute ataxia is a common neurologic presentation in the pediatric population that carries a broad differential diagnosis. The tempo of the presentation, distribution of the ataxia (focal or diffuse), examination findings, and paraclinical testing may be helpful in guiding diagnosis and management. Although Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and its variant, Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), are well defined, frequently encountered acute autoimmune neuropathies, the GBS/MFS spectrum have at least 12 different phenotypes with distinct neurologic features, 4 of which include ataxia. These lesser-known variants can be diagnosed clinically, in the absence of conclusive laboratory or neuroimaging data, and should always be considered in an acute presentation of ataxia. In this article, we present a previously healthy 8-year-old with acute onset ataxia with associated hyporeflexia that occurred after resolution of a presumed viral infection. We discuss our approach to ataxia, the patient's neurodiagnostic odyssey, and highlight the final diagnosis of acute ataxic neuropathy without ophthalmoplegia-a rare incomplete MFS subtype. Owing to timely recognition of the condition, the patient was treated appropriately and recovered fully.

### DAGLA autoantibody experience at mayo clinic [^6b2949a8]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

As reported for the 4 previously published DAGLA autoimmune patients, our patient was younger than average for autoimmune ataxia, and a paraneoplastic cause for DAGLA autoimmunity was not found. Recorded neurological improvements are also supportive of recovery from an immune mediated etiology, and could be accounted for in this uncontrolled study by one or more of natural history of the disease, immunotherapy, or rehabilitative services. The relatively good outcome in our case is at variance with the prior report of severe disability. In our experience of autoimmune ataxias in general, improvements occurred in 45% and were usually modest. [2] All 5 cases from Euroimmun and Mayo Clinic were detected between April 2022 and February 2023. Our patient was suspected to have had cerebellitis post Salmonella, a clinical entity that has been previously reported, though neural IgG testing was not undertaken in that prior reported case. Although a post-infectious cerebellitis has not been documented for this or other DAGLA autoimmune cases, the narrow timeframe of their occurrence is noteworthy. The immune effectors that cause cerebellar atrophy are unknown. Either DAGLA-specific cytotoxic T cells or 3D epitope-specific IgGs, or both are plausible.

2.4 Study Population

For the register‐based case‐control study, all patients with at least one registered VZV infection (ICD‐10 code B01 or B02) between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019 were identified. All adults (≥ 18 years old) with at least one episode of VZV‐associated CNS infection were included as cases in this study. VZV‐associated CNS infection was defined as having received one of the following ICD‐10 diagnostic codes: B01.0 or B02.1 (meningitis), B01.1 or B02.0 (encephalitis), or either B01.8 or B02.8 combined with one of G94.8 (cerebellitis), G51.0 (RHS), or I77.8 (vasculitis; Supporting Information S1: Table S3). The date of the first such diagnosis was called the index date. Diagnoses of RHS made exclusively in primary healthcare were included, but all other VZV‐associated CNS diagnoses were only counted if diagnosed in specialized care, as they require a lumbar puncture for diagnosis. Cases with both a diagnosis of encephalitis and meningitis or RHS were only counted as cases of encephalitis. Controls, matched by age, sex, and place of residence, but without a VZV diagnosis during the study period, were identified through a population register (Statistics Sweden) in a 3:1 ratio, and received the same index date as the matching case.

2.5 Clinical Data

Comorbidities, including immunosuppressive conditions, were defined based on ICD‐10 codes and drugs using Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes. To include chronic conditions, ICD‐10 codes from the year 2000 onward were retrieved. For cases and matched controls identified through the regional primary care registers, diagnoses were first extracted from the respective register of inclusion, then updated with data from the NPR, as applicable. ATC codes were extracted from the National Prescribed Drug Register, which contains nationwide data on all prescribed drugs from the year 2005 onward. To more accurately include current comorbidities, time frames were applied according to the chronicity of the respective disease, as adapted from Hvidberg et al. Details on the definitions of comorbidities and drugs are outlined in Supporting Information S1: Tables S4–S6.

### Utility of neuroimaging in children presenting to a pediatric emergency department with ataxia [^fb00481f]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of neuroimaging in children who present to the pediatric emergency department with acute-/subacute-onset ataxia. Neuroimaging is performed in many children with ataxia to rule out serious intracranial pathology. There is, however, limited evidence to support such practice.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of electronic medical records of children who presented to the emergency department with ataxia between 2007 and 2013. Patient demographics, historical features, physical examination findings, laboratory results, and neuroimaging results were collected. Neuroimaging studies that were classified as abnormal by a neuroradiologist were further reviewed and classified by the study neurologist as clinically significant or not.

Results

The records of 141 subjects were analyzed. The most common causes of ataxia were infectious/postinfectious (36.2%) and ingestion (15.6%). Neuroimaging was performed in 104 children (73.8%). Neuroimaging was abnormal in 63 children (60.6%). However, these abnormalities were clinically significant in only 14 children (13.5%). Focal neurological findings were noted in 12 of 14 children (85.7%) with clinically significant neuroimaging.

Conclusions

Clinically significant neuroimaging was noted in a minority of children who presented with acute/subacute ataxia. The majority of patients with clinically significant neuroimaging had focal neurological findings on examination. Neuroimaging may not be required in all children presenting to the ED with acute ataxia, but further large-scale studies are needed to validate these findings and identify a subset of patients with ataxia in whom imaging can be deferred.

### Incidence and risk factors for varicella-zoster virus-associated central nervous system infections: a nationwide Swedish retrospective case-control study [^8a722975]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

All CNS manifestations affected males and females equally, in contrast to herpes zoster, which has a female predilection. One plausible reason may be the differences in health‐seeking behavior between men and women, although this would be expected to have less influence in individuals suffering from the more severe symptoms of VZV‐associated CNS infection.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to validate ICD‐10 code diagnoses of VZV‐associated CNS infections, and only a few studies have validated diagnoses for other CNS infections. The ICD‐10 code B00.4 for herpes simplex encephalitis only yielded a PPV of 58%, but in combination with G05.1E it reached 76%. Henriksen et al. found a PPV of 64% for different types of community‐acquired CNS infections, and a decreasing PPV in cases with more severe disease and greater comorbidities. In the present study, encephalitis is the most complex and severe of the diagnoses included, and yet it reached a validity of 73% based on the predefined criteria. The method of including three sets of criteria probably contributed to a fairly high PPV. On the other hand, the validity of the meningitis diagnosis was poor. A possible explanation could be that the threshold for a meningitis diagnosis is lower in uncertain cases than for encephalitis. Furthermore, the clinical manifestations of VZV‐associated CNS infections occasionally overlap in the same individual. Indeed, a high proportion (89%) of the validated cases were considered to have a VZV‐associated CNS infection, although not diagnosed with the correct, that is, specific, VZV CNS diagnosis. ICD‐10 codes for both varicella and zoster‐related complications were used. However, it is likely that the majority of VZV cases in this adult population suffered from a reactivated disease, since the VZV seroprevalence of Swedish 12‐year‐olds is as high as 92%.

Definitions of Complications, Length of Admission and Seasonality Assessment

Complications related to varicella were identified by extracting all other discharge diagnoses in DNPR during the admission with varicella. The included complications were selected based on previous literature (Table 1). Underlying diseases related to varicella were defined as diseases occurring before the hospitalization with varicella and were extracted up to 5 years before the hospitalization with varicella. All diagnoses, both primary and secondary in any diagnostic positions, were included (See Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2). Since a previous study has highlighted varicella as a risk factor for arterial ischemic stroke (AIS), we extracted diagnoses related to AIS during VZV admission and up to 12 months after the VZV-related admission. All the applied ICD-10 codes are listed in Table, Supplemental Digital Content 3; Table, Supplemental Digital Content 4; Table, Supplemental Digital Content 5; and Table, Supplemental Digital Content 6.

TABLE 1.
Types of Complications in Children With Moderate and Severe Varicella in Denmark 2015–June 2023

Length of hospitalizations was calculated as days between the first admission with varicella and the last discharge day.

Seasonality was defined as systematic periodic fluctuations in disease incidence that occur over the course of a year. These fluctuations were characterized by their magnitude, timing and duration. The time of the seasonal peak was defined as the position of the maximum point on the seasonal curve.

### Spectrum of centrosome autoantibodies in childhood varicella and post-varicella acute cerebellar ataxia [^c14df77f]. BMC Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Sera from children with post-varicella infections have autoantibodies that react with centrosomes in brain and tissue culture cells. We investigated the sera of children with infections and post-varicella ataxia and related conditions for reactivity to five recombinant centrosome proteins: gammagamma-enolase, pericentrin, ninein, PCM-1, and Mob1.

Methods

Sera from 12 patients with acute post-varicella ataxia, 1 with post-Epstein Barr virus (EBV) ataxia, 5 with uncomplicated varicella infections, and other conditions were tested for reactivity to cryopreserved cerebellum tissue and recombinant centrosome proteins. The distribution of pericentrin in the cerebellum was studied by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) using rabbit antibodies to the recombinant protein. Antibodies to phospholipids (APL) were detected by ELISA.

Results

Eleven of 12 children with post-varicella ataxia, 4/5 children with uncomplicated varicella infections, 1/1 with post-EBV ataxia, 2/2 with ADEM, 1/2 with neuroblastoma and ataxia, and 2/2 with cerebellitis had antibodies directed against 1 or more recombinant centrosome antigens. Antibodies to pericentrin were seen in 5/12 children with post-varicella ataxia but not in any of the other sera tested. IIF demonstrated that pericentrin is located in axons and centrosomes of cerebellar cells. APL were detected in 75% of the sera from children with post-varicella ataxia and 50% of children with varicella without ataxia and in none of the controls.

Conclusion

This is the first study to show the antigen specificity of anti-centrosome antibodies in children with varicella. Our data suggest that children with post-varicella ataxia have unique autoantibody reactivity to pericentrin.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Setting

This retrospective register‐based case‐control study was conducted using data from Swedish national and regional health registers between 2000 and 2019. Registered residents in Sweden are given a unique personal identity number that is used in all contacts with healthcare services, making it possible to link information about patients between the different health registers. Episodes of VZV infection were identified through such diagnosis registers. The National Patient Register (NPR) covers all specialized care, including in‐ and outpatient visits. Since no national primary healthcare register exists in Sweden, two regional registers which record diagnoses from primary care visits were used, namely VEGA (Västra Götaland county) and VAL (Stockholm county). These are the two largest counties in Sweden and together comprise approximately 40% of the national population. The study was approved by the Swedish Ethics Review Authority (registration numbers 2020‐03623 and 2023‐06176‐02). As it was an observational study using anonymized data, no informed consent from the study participants was deemed necessary.

2.2 Validation Study

The algorithms to identify cases with VZV‐associated CNS infection were validated in a separate validation study. The aim was to randomly include 40 adults cases for each of the diagnoses: encephalitis, meningitis (between 2010 and 2019), and RHS (between 2000 and 2021). International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD‐10) code combinations were used to identify cases (Supporting Information S1: Table S1). For easier access to medical records, the cases were extracted from the VEGA local regional register, which covers in‐ and outpatient care as well as primary care in the county of Västra Götaland in Sweden. One of the authors (T.T.) reviewed the medical records to validate the diagnoses using the predefined criteria (stated in the following paragraph). Ambiguous cases were discussed within the research team.

Varicella usually is a self-limited disease but can result in serious complications (e.g., encephalitis, pneumonia, sepsis, hemorrhagic varicella, and death), especially among immunocompromised persons. Implementation of the varicella vaccination program in the United States, beginning in 1995, has led to declines of > 95% in varicella-related hospitalizations and deaths among populations routinely vaccinated (1).

Before universal vaccination, varicella was a universal childhood disease that caused a generally mild and self-limited illness but could be associated with complications in the general population with up to 4 million new infections, 11,000 hospitalizations, and 100–150 deaths per year; varicella infections in adults are more likely to be severe and have a higher incidence of complications, and primary infections in immunosuppressed individuals are associated with significant morbidity with a high degree for disseminated disease. Since 1995, live-attenuated varicella has been available in the United States.

### Adult post-infectious thalamic encephalitis: acute onset and benign course [^57c9c424]. European Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

We report on two young patients with an encephalitic syndrome and bilateral thalamic lesions following a presumably viral or mycoplasma respiratory tract infection with the main clinical symptoms of organic psychosis in the first and a prolonged amnestic syndrome and ataxia in the second case. Four months later the patients had recovered clinically and the thalamic lesions had resolved on magnetic resonance imaging in one case and almost completely in the other. We interpret the patients' illness as rare cases of a post-infectious acute thalamic encephalitis in adults. The cases and their relationship to possible post-infectious autoimmune inflammatory or toxic pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed and a review of the literature is provided.

### A practical approach to late-onset cerebellar ataxia: putting the disorder with lack of order into order [^a8e6eb42]. Practical Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical management of cerebellar ataxia is challenging, mainly because ataxia is a symptom of many neurological diseases. Many types of ataxia disorders are genetic and some are extremely rare. Here, the authors suggest a diagnostic approach to ataxia developed around a case of sporadic, late-onset, slowly progressive ataxia. Clinical information such as age of onset, rate of progression, family history and certain non-cerebellar features can narrow the differential diagnosis. Brain MRI is almost obligatory and may reveal valuable diagnostic clues. Having ruled out structural lesions, the two other most common diagnoses are inflammatory and degenerative (including genetic) disorders. Although only a minority of underlying diseases are treatable, there are still many options for supportive care.

### Sporadic ataxia with adult onset: classification and diagnostic criteria [^4d4495b5]. The Lancet: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

In most patients with adult-onset progressive ataxia, the condition manifests without an obvious familial background. The classification and correct diagnosis of such patients remain a challenge, because almost the entire spectrum of non-genetic and genetic causes of ataxia has to be considered. A wide range of potential causes of acquired ataxia exist, including chronic alcohol use, various other toxic agents, immune-mediated inflammation, vitamin deficiency, chronic leptomeningeal deposition of iron leading to superficial siderosis, and chronic CNS infection. Mutations in single genes can also underlie sporadic ataxia in adults. Finally, patients might have a sporadic degenerative disease, such as multiple system atrophy of cerebellar type or sporadic adult-onset ataxia of unknown aetiology. The definition of clinical criteria and delineation of characteristic MRI features have greatly facilitated the early and correct recognition of sporadic ataxias. In addition, specific serological and genetic markers are available that allow a definite diagnosis in many cases.

### Evaluating the impact of moderate and severe varicella infections on Danish children under 18 years old: a comprehensive analysis from 2015 to 2023 [^3a13cd98]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Some limitations are encountered when applying register-based data to explore the burden of diseases. The registry data may contain information bias and lead to underestimation of the incidence due to misreporting in ICD-10 coding in clinical practice. The DNPR is considered a high-quality database, however, a previous Danish study found that the sensitivity of varicella-coded hospitalization in DNPR was 74%. Additionally, we were not able to confirm the cases molecularly through laboratory tests. Albeit it is standard procedure to laboratory-confirm the cases admitted to a hospital in Denmark. The cases in this study are only identified by the use of ICD-10 codes.

Furthermore, most minor complications and infections related to varicella are handled at home or by general practitioners and will never be registered in DNPR or the 1813 helpline system. The 1813 helpline data cover solely the Capital Region of Denmark. Also, the purpose of the 1813 helpline is to assess the severity of symptoms, rather than diagnosis, potentially leading to inaccuracies in the number of mild cases. Additionally, without cross-linking between the cases from 1813 calls and the hospital admission, some of the mild cases identified through 1813 calls might have been among those hospitalized with varicella in the Capital Region. There were no reported deaths from varicella in children in our study period. However, a previous Danish study estimated the mortality rate of varicella infections to be 0.0014 per 100,000 in children under 18 years of age.

### COVID19-associated new-onset movement disorders: a follow-up study [^4fe19e7d]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Movement disorders as a manifestation of COVID-19 appear to be rare; with myoclonus ataxia syndromes being the most common. However, parkinsonism, dystonia, chorea and other movement disorders have also been reported. To date, case reports largely lack follow-up data, yielding uncertainty about their long-term outcome. Here we provide follow-up information of 27 patients who had developed a new-onset organic movement disorder in the context of their COVID-19 infection. We found that the prognosis of the movement disorder is generally good, with the majority recovering without residual symptoms within several weeks or months. It remained unclear why ataxia and myoclonus recovered earlier than parkinsonism and chorea. Only in a fraction of patients (6 of 27; 22%) the movement disorder was persistent after a follow-up period of 7.5 ± 3 weeks. A severe clinical course of COVID-19 in general and the development of an encephalopathy were risk factors for the persistence of the movement disorder, albeit others who had a severe course recovered so this is not a strong predictor. Given the small number of patients, data on the presence or absence of comorbidities should be interpreted carefully.

Brain imaging studies were done in a heterogenous pattern (i.e. MRI vs CT, different sequences, at different times, with or without follow-up etc.) — which owes to the different clinical practices (and availability of imaging machines) across countries. It appears that results were unremarkable in two thirds of patients. Reported abnormalities included cortical, cerebellar and brainstem ischemic and meningeal enhancement. Follow-up information was scarce, available only for eight patients, in some of whom imaging abnormalities had resolved or remained static. DaT imaging was done in two case and revealed reduced uptake which remained unchanged after 10 months in the one where assessed.

Previous literature suggested that myoclonus may develop fairly soon after the initial infection, whereas parkinsonism manifests later. Our data do not recapitulate this observation. Thus, clinicians should be alert for the different types of movement disorders early and late after the initial infection.

### DAGLA autoantibody experience at mayo clinic [^67af4295]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The patient, a man in his 20 s, was admitted to University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, presenting in December 2022 with a 4-month history of occipital headache, followed by progressive slurred speech, oscillopsia, dizziness, and incoordination. These symptoms developed approximately 2 months after a self-limiting gastrointestinal illness lasting 6 days, purported to be caused by Salmonella contamination from a recalled peanut butter brand. Brain MRI on admission revealed a Type 1 Chiari malformation (Fig. 1 C, cerebellar tonsillar descent without syrinx), with no notable T2 signal change or post-gadolinium enhancement of supra- or infratentorial meninges or parenchyma. A symptomatic CSF flow obstruction was suspected, and the patient underwent posterior fossa decompression, followed by improvement in his headaches (gabapentin and amitriptyline aided pain management). His ataxic syndrome progressed over the ensuing month. On examination, he exhibited gaze-evoked nystagmus, particularly in down and left lateral gaze, and severe truncal and appendicular ataxia, dysarthria, and truncal myoclonus. Brain MRI at that time revealed interim development of prominent cerebellar atrophy (Fig. 1 D) with no enhancement of the meninges or parenchyma. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis demonstrated mildly elevated protein (49 mg/dL; normal value at Mayo Clinic, ≤ 35), lymphocytic pleocytosis (10 WBCs/µL; normal, ≤ 5), an elevated IgG index (0.89; normal, ≤ 0.85), and the presence of four CSF-specific oligoclonal bands (normal, < 2). Evaluation for a paraneoplastic cause (CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, PET-CT of trunk, and testicular ultrasound) did not reveal cancer, and age- and sex-appropriate screening only was recommended thereafter. An autoimmune idiopathic or post-infectious cerebellitis was suspected. The patient was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, 1 g daily for 5 days, followed by oral prednisone taper, and five doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g/kilogram total). There was no immediate improvement, though in the ensuing months, the patient had gradual improvement (with physical, occupational, and speech therapies) to the point of near resolution of appendicular and truncal ataxia, and truncal myoclonus. He was able to walk independently without aid 2 years after his initial neurological presentation. Residual symptoms included occasional headaches accompanied by vertigo, well managed with amitriptyline and gabapentin. Residual signs included nystagmus and dysarthria. MRI brain at 10 months after symptom onset demonstrated further progression in cerebellar atrophy (Fig. 1 E).

### Metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1 autoimmunity: clinical features and treatment outcomes [^49998b94]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe retrospectively the clinical associations of immunoglobulin G (IgG) targeting metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1-IgG).

Methods

Specimens of 9 patients evaluated on a service basis in the Mayo Clinic Neuroimmunology Laboratory by tissue-based immunofluorescence assay (IFA) yielded a robust, synaptic immunostaining pattern consistent with mGluR1-IgG (serum, 9; CSF, 2 available). Transfected HEK293 cell-based assay (CBA) confirmed mGluR1 specificity in all 11 specimens. A further 2 patients were detected in Germany primarily by CBA.

Results

The median symptom onset age for the 11 patients was 58 years (range 33–81 years); 6 were male. All 9 Mayo Clinic patients had subacute onset of cerebellar ataxia, 4 had dysgeusia, 1 had psychiatric symptoms, and 1 had cognitive impairment. All were evaluated for malignancy, but only 1 was affected (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma). One developed ataxia post-herpes zoster infection. Head MRIs were generally atrophic or normal-appearing, and CSF was inflammatory in just 1 of 5 tested, though mGluR1-IgG was detected in both specimens submitted. Five patients improved (attributable to immunotherapy in 4, spontaneously in 1), 3 stabilized (attributable to immunotherapy in 2, cancer therapy in 1), and 1 progressively declined (untreated). The 2 German patients had ataxia, but fulfilled multiple sclerosis diagnostic criteria (1 relapsing-remitting, 1 progressive). However, both had histories of hematologic malignancy (acute lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma), and had mGluR1-IgG detected in serum by CBA (weakly positive on tissue-based IFA).

Conclusions

mGluR1 autoimmunity represents a treatable form of cerebellar ataxia. Dysgeusia may be a diagnostic clue. Paraneoplastic, parainfectious, or idiopathic causes may occur.

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^8b6d266d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system with clinical modifications (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures associated with health care utilization. The pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) classification system uses ICD codes to determine the presence of 1 or more CCCs (10 body-system categories) and includes posttransplant and technology variables to signify additional complexity (Box). The open-source code CCC system is the most widely used classification system to study patients younger than 18 years with medical complexities. The CCC system has evolved alongside the ICD system and must account for updates in the underlying ICD codes: CCC version 1 (V1)corresponded to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and version 2 (V2) to the transition to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Since implementation of the ICD-10-CM in the US in 2015, however, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The CCC system thus required a major update to capture the full spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

### Varicella-related mortality in California, 1988–2000 [^184c4681]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Although surveillance for varicella in the United States has documented a reduction in cases since vaccine licensure in 1995, information is lacking on varicella-related mortality since vaccine introduction. This study identifies varicella-related mortality in California before and after vaccine introduction and assesses how high risk conditions and complications contributed to varicella deaths during this period.

Methods

California death records mentioning varicella as either an underlying or contributing cause of death were selected from the 1988–2000 multiple cause-of-death files. Pre- and postvaccine periods were compared to assess differences in varicella mortality before and after vaccine introduction. Differences in varicella mortality by age, race/ethnicity and gender were also examined. ICD codes were used to identify high risk conditions and varicella-related complications.

Results

A total of 228 varicella-related deaths were reported between 1988 and 2000 in California. Age-adjusted varicella mortality rates showed a downward trend during this period, dropping from a high of 0.97 per million in 1990 to a low of 0.22 per million in 1999. The average age-adjusted mortality rate declined from 0.67 per million prevaccine to 0.38 per million postvaccine. Compared with the prevaccine period, the average rate of decline in varicella mortality was greater after vaccine implementation. Infants had the highest mortality rate for the period. At least one immunocompromising condition was present in 38% of varicella-related deaths. Pneumonia was the most commonly reported complication.

Conclusions

Varicella-related mortality declined in California after vaccine implementation, but potentially preventable varicella-related deaths continue to occur.

### Case report of subacute cerebellar ataxia of adolescence with long-term sequelae [^92e39d86]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Acute ataxia is not an uncommon childhood complaint. It most commonly occurs in young patients secondary to a postinfectious cerebellitis, which is typically associated with a very good prognosis and recovery. In adolescence, acute cerebellar ataxia is more often the product of an etiology likely to progress into a chronic disorder without recovery to preillness baseline. In the present case, the authors describe a 15-year-old girl with subacute cerebellar ataxia of presumed immune-mediated etiology that advanced into a chronic cerebellar ataxia. Due to a family history, celiac disease was suspected as the origin of the ataxia; biopsy ruled out enteropathy, and the severe, abrupt radiological changes to the patient's cerebellum are inconsistent with the reported sequelae of gluten ataxia. This case serves as a discussion for diagnostic challenges in adolescent patients with acute cerebellar ataxia with long-term sequelae as well as providing an adjunct discussion on the neurological complications of celiac disease.

### Clinical assessment of the sensory ataxias; diagnostic algorithm with illustrative cases [^a1057cc3]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Ataxia is a common neurological syndrome resulting from cerebellar, vestibular or sensory disorders. The recognition and characterisation of sensory ataxia remains a challenge. Cerebellar ataxia is the more common and easier to identify; sensory ataxia is often mistaken for cerebellar ataxia, leading to diagnostic errors and delays. A coherent aetiological work-up is only possible if clinicians initially recognise sensory ataxia. We discuss ways to separate sensory from cerebellar ataxia, the causes of sensory ataxia and the clinico-neurophysiological syndromes causing the sensory ataxia syndromes. We summarise a logical tiered approach as a diagnostic algorithm.

### Need for awareness and surveillance of long-term post-COVID neurodegenerative disorders. A position paper from the neuroCOVID-19 task force of the European Academy of Neurology [^8b0a57d7]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory and immune-mediated processes

It is considered that immune-mediated mechanisms are the key components in neuro-COVID for initiating the neurodegenerative cascade. The review of Furman et al. suggested that both COVID-19 and AD share pathological features and risk factors. The association between COVID-19 and AD may be explained by mutual risks and mechanisms; with neuroinflammation being the major connection between COVID-19 and AD. COVID-19 may be associated with diverse clinical and imaging neurological abnormalities, which can predict poor outcome in some patients. The mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated neurological symptoms that are highly heterogeneous in appearance, duration, and severity in individual patients are not well understood. Of note, the severity of neurological symptoms does not seem to correlate well with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in individual patients.

From recent studies, it has become clear that neurovascular pathologies, coagulopathy, and marked changes in glial cells in multiple brain areas are associated with the development of central and systemic inflammation in COVID-19 patients.

Gliovascular pathological changes are highly heterogeneous in individual patients, occurring in multiple foci across the brain, including the medulla, hypothalamus, thalamus, and different sites of the cerebral cortex, with most severe degenerative, inflammatory, and gliovascular pathologies in the medulla and the hypothalamus, and at central autonomic and neuroendocrine nuclei.

In post-mortem studies from deceased individuals at various stages of COVID-19, proteomic and transcriptomic profiling of brainstem, cerebellum, and olfactory tissues in early- and late-phase COVID-19 shows an inflammatory type I interferon response in acute COVID-19 cases, which resolves in the late disease phase. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, two patterns of reaction to severe systemic inflammation was noticed, one neuronal with a direct focus on cranial nerve nuclei and a separate diffuse pattern affecting the whole brainstem.

### An overview of the patient with ataxia [^cb14cdd8]. Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Ataxia, a neurological sign characterized by the incoordination of voluntary movements, is the most prominent manifestation of cerebellar disease. The cardinal features of cerebellar dysfunction involve disturbances of stance, gait, eye movements, muscle tone, skilled movements, and speech. Classification and differential diagnosis of ataxic syndromes have intrinsic complexity owing to the variability in phenotypic presentations and in etiologies, which include trauma, toxic and metabolic causes, neoplasms, immune mechanisms, and genetic diseases. Pure cerebellar symptoms are rarely observed, while the clinical picture of both genetic and sporadic ataxia syndromes is sometimes complicated by the presence of extracerebellar neurological or multisystem extraneural pathology. Clinical presentation and assessment of the patients together with classification, genetic aspects, and principles in differential diagnosis of ataxias are briefly reviewed.

### Epstein-Barr virus-associated cerebellar ataxia [^545b5b88]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Cerebellar ataxia is a common neurological presentation. It can be acute, subacute or chronic. Neurological complications of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are well-recognised with a variety of presentations. Acute cerebellar ataxia is a rare, but an established complication. It has been described as the sole manifestation of EBV infection without the systemic features of infectious mononucleosis. The pathophysiology is not clear. The course of the illness may last for a few months with a benign outcome, though serious complications can happen. We present a case of a 38-year-old man who presented with an acute cerebellar ataxia owing to EBV infection, along with a review of the literature.

### Classifying neurogenic dysphagia as a movement disorder [^0f3375b4]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Cerebellar pathology

Ataxia is an archetypal sign of cerebellar dysfunction, although there have been many differences in the use of the term. Ataxia can be classified by unique features: dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesis, intention tremor, delayed movement initiation and dyssynergia (Table 1). For the purposes of this paper, the term ataxia will be used more generically to describe key symptoms and signs of cerebellar involvement. Cerebellar ataxia has heterogeneous causes, including genetic, degenerative, infectious or immune-mediated.

Pure cerebellar dysphagia: ataxia

No currently published studies define the phenomenon of ataxic dysphagia, but there are increasing studies that suggest relationships between cerebellar damage and impaired swallowing. Pure cerebellar conditions with documented cases of dysphagia are rare. The existing literature to the date of this publication reported prevalence of dysphagia from 0%to approximately 10%in fairly confined cerebellar vascular injuries, but there are limited descriptions of specific swallowing biomechanical deficits. Dysphagia has been characterized in patients who have undergone treatment for cerebellopontine angle surgery, but brainstem involvement, particularly in the medulla, is difficult if not impossible to rule out. In spinocerebellar ataxia, a neurodegenerative ataxic disorder with many subtypes, those with more isolated cerebellar involvement in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 tend to present with less prevalent and milder dysphagia than those with more widespread neural involvement, including spinocerebellar ataxia types 1 and 3. Complicating the picture is spinocerebellar ataxia type 5, which is a rare subtype with isolated cerebellar atrophy with sparing of the brainstem and a high incidence of ataxic dysarthria. Of the case studies/series published, the only descriptions of difficulty swallowing were 'drinking water choking cough'in two individuals beginning at age 64 and 78, and 'weakened cough and trouble swallowing'(p283) in two individuals with young-onset spinocerebellar ataxia type 5, but not the adult-onset cohort. Otherwise, swallowing difficulties were either not reportedor explicitly stated that there were no complaints of dysphagia.

Dysphagia in conditions that primarily impact the cerebellum (localized stroke, spinocerebellar ataxia type 6) has been characterized by: reduced tongue movement; ineffective mastication; delayed pharyngeal swallow trigger; diminished or absent pharyngeal stripping wave; and reduced hyolaryngeal excursion.

Descriptions and potential consequences of abnormal physiologic signs listed above are outlined in Table 2. Dysphagia results in penetration/aspiration and post-swallow residue.

### Acute hemicerebellitis in a young adult: a case report and literature review [^81c5b0cc]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

Acute hemicerebellitis, marked by headache with or without cerebellar signs, is a rare clinical entity involving a unilateral cerebellar hemisphere. The pathogenesis of acute hemicerebellitis remains unclear, and the disease rarely occurs in adults. Here, we report an 18-year-old woman who presented with a lack of coordination of the right hand and leg lasting longer than one week, following a pulsatile headache. A neurological examination disclosed ocular dysmetria, right-sided limb ataxia and slight truncal ataxia. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed mononuclear pleocytosis. The serology and autoimmune studies were unremarkable. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a focal signal change in the right cerebellar hemisphere and vermis. Acute hemicerebellitis was diagnosed, and the patient was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate and acyclovir. Subsequently, the headache resolved, and the cerebellar signs were markedly improved. Twenty days after admission, she became asymptomatic and brain MRI showed resolution of cerebellar hyperintensity on the right side. In conclusion, we identified only 6 additional patients with adult-onset acute hemicerebellitis from previous reports, highlighting the importance of recognizing this rare clinical entity. Its clinical outcome is usually favorable, but in the acute phase, attention should be directed toward clinical symptoms that are suggestive of increased intracranial pressure.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### ICD-10-AM codes for cirrhosis and related complications: key performance considerations for population and healthcare studies [^90ee325b]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Cirrhosis-related complications

The PPVs for HCC (0.97), ascites (0.97) and 'grouped varices' (0.95) were good (table 1). NPVs were comparable (all ≥ 0.76) and there was acceptable agreement (κ all > 0.60) between codes and patients' medical records. Individual codes for varices were less concordant than 'grouped' codes. Overall accuracy was lower for SBP ('grouped' PPV 0.75; κ 0.73) and the poorest for HE ('grouped' PPV 0.55; κ 0.21).

Despite the high predictive values, ICD-10-AM codes underestimated the true prevalence of ascites and varices by more than one-third (sensitivity 61.9% and 61.3%, respectively). There were 93 encounters in which evidence of ascites was found in the medical record but not coded for (table 2). Of these, 48.4% were in patients with minimal or small volume ascites that did not require active management during the admission. Among 94 encounters that did not include a code for varices, 94.7% had documentation of known varices that were not pertinent to the admission.

In contrast, among 107 false-negative HE encounters (sensitivity 24.6%), HE was present and required active management in 80.4% of patients. The 29 false-positive encounters included documentation of cerebellar ataxia due to alcohol (n = 5), acute confusion (related to alcohol n = 4; medication n = 1; other/unknown cause n = 4), Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (n = 4), encephalopathy of unknown aetiology (n = 2), AIDS-related dementia (n = 2) and acute psychosis (n = 2). The reason for discrepancy could not be ascertained in five encounters.

'Grouped SBP' had a high concordance between codes and patients' medical records (κ 0.73) but failed to identify 23.9% of patients with SBP (sensitivity 76.1%). The 12 false-positive encounters involved peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis (n = 2), other abdominal collections (n = 6), empirical SBP treatment (n = 2), initiation of SBP prophylaxis (n = 1) and documentation of previous SBP (n = 1).

### Varicella death of an unvaccinated, previously healthy adolescent – Ohio, 2009 [^d0a52beb]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Varicella usually is a self-limited disease but sometimes can result in severe complications and death. Although infants, adults, and immunocompromised persons are at increased risk for severe disease, before varicella vaccine was introduced in 1995, the majority of hospitalizations and deaths from varicella occurred among healthy persons aged < 20 years. Introduction of varicella vaccine has substantially decreased varicella incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States. This report describes a varicella death in an unvaccinated, previously healthy adolescent aged 15 years. In April 2012, as part of the routine review of vital statistics records, the Ohio Department of Health identified a 2009 death with the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision code for varicella as the underlying cause. Because varicella deaths are nationally reportable, the Ohio Department of Health conducted an investigation to validate that the coding was accurate. Investigators learned that, on March 12, 2009, the adolescent girl was admitted to a hospital with a 3-day history of a rash consistent with varicella and a 1-day history of fever and shortness of breath. The patient was started on intravenous acyclovir (on day 4 of illness) and broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals, but she died 3 weeks later. The case underscores the importance of varicella vaccination, including catch-up vaccination of older children and adolescents, to prevent varicella and its serious complications.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^128fe85f]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus diseases — clinical manifestations in adults with HIV: Varicella rash evolves rapidly during the initial 8 to 12 hours after onset, with new vesicle formation continuing for 2 to 4 days. Herpes zoster presents as a painful dermatomal eruption; the most common sites are thoracic dermatomes (40% to 50% of cases), followed by cranial nerve (20% to 25%), cervical (15% to 20%), lumbar (15%), and sacral (5%) dermatomes. In zoster, new vesicle formation typically continues for 3 to 5 days and crusts typically persist for 2 to 3 weeks. About 20% to 30% of people with HIV have one or more subsequent episodes of herpes zoster; the probability of a recurrence within 1 year is approximately 10%. Approximately 10% to 15% of people with HIV report post-herpetic neuralgia as a complication following herpes zoster.

### Incidence and risk factors for varicella-zoster virus-associated central nervous system infections: a nationwide Swedish retrospective case-control study [^5c5f0138]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Case Definitions

The clinical diagnosis of encephalitis is based on a combination of clinical findings: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis, microbiological evidence of a typical pathogen, and electroencephalographical and neuroimaging abnormalities. While different sets of criteria have been proposed, they typically include one or more of the following major criteria: altered mental status, focal neurological findings, and seizures. Since 2013, the most established criteria are those of the International Encephalitis Consortium, with altered mental status as a mandatory finding. To avoid exclusion of true encephalitis cases, two additional sets of criteria were used, which also include cases with signs of focal or multifocal neurological deficits such as dysphasia or motor weakness, even without altered mental status. If a patient fulfilled the criteria for at least one of the three sets of criteria, the patient was considered as having encephalitis. Meningitis was defined as patients with CSF pleocytosis, no signs of parenchymatous brain dysfunction, and presenting with clinical signs of meningitis. RHS cases were required to exhibit peripheral facial nerve palsy and signs of VZV as a cause (either from typical blisters in the ear or mouth, or virological confirmation from blisters or CSF). Positive VZV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in CSF or positive VZV immunoglobulin G‐index at the time of diagnosis was mandatory to meet the diagnostic criteria for encephalitis and meningitis. (Details of definitions are presented in Supporting Information S1: Table S2).

### Phenotypic heterogeneity in genetic and acquired pediatric cerebellar disorders [^0f236bd8]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Cohort

We established the PEDIATAX cohort by retrieving all case records at the Oulu University Hospital from 1970 to 2022 (manual records before the year 2000; electrical records from the year 2000 onwards; diagnosis < 16 years) containing any of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)‐9 or ICD‐10 codes that pertain to PCDs (the retrospective study arm) (Table S1). Newly referred patients with suspected or confirmed PCDs were recruited by attending physicians during the active phase of the project (between 2019 and 2022) to ensure systematic coverage of all patients with PCDs in our study region (the prospective study arm). We recorded information on diagnostic tests (including testing for Friedreich's ataxia in cases where the initial exome sequencing was inconclusive), preliminary neuroradiological data, all diagnoses, and disease courses. The clinical significance of identified genetic variants was assessed by SIFT, PolyPhen, and CADD, and compared against information in the ClinVar, gnomAD (GRCh37, version 2.1.1), and Ensembl databases. In suspected encephalitis, routine investigations included brain MRI followed by etiological analyses of the cerebrospinal fluid, serum, and respiratory track samples (ie, polymerase chain reaction [PCR] of common CNS and respiratory pathogens). In cerebral palsy, genetic testing was conducted when the clinical presentation, history, or other findings raised suspicion of genetic etiology. PCDs were classified into the following categories based on etiology: non‐genetic etiology, definitive genetic diagnosis, variant of unknown significance (VUS), and undefined etiology. All personal identifying data were removed during data collection.

Brain imaging data (ie, images and radiological reports) were collected from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) of the Oulu University Hospital, and by contacting all central hospitals in Northern Finland within the tertiary catchment area of the Oulu University Hospital. Data were analyzed systematically by a junior radiologist (S.H.) using a structured data sheet (Table S2). Initially, all images were analyzed blinded (ie, without prior knowledge of the underlying condition), and then re‐analyzed for typical neuroimaging findings of specific genes/conditions. Though the focus was on posterior fossa findings, we collected data on other abnormalities and incidental findings. Finally, all available images were re‐read by a consultant pediatric neuroradiologist (M.S.‐P.), and a consensus was reached.

### Clinical and economic burden of antibiotic use among pediatric patients with varicella infection in the outpatient setting: a retrospective cohort analysis of real-world data in France [^8a66b383]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

LIMITATIONS

Certain limitations must be considered when interpreting these data. The CSD-LPD only covers around 10% of GPs and specialists in France potentially limiting generalizability. Though procedures are in place to ensure ICD-10 coding within the CSD-LPD is accurate, there is still the possibility for miscoding. Furthermore, study-specific code lists were developed to identify varicella cases, complications and medications; where possible, definitions were aligned with previously published studies and code lists were verified through medical input.

As we only captured varicella in the outpatient setting, we likely underestimated the burden of complications, antibiotics and costs associated with varicella. Furthermore, using a 3-month follow-up period, as opposed to a shorter period, may have overestimated varicella-related prescriptions and complications. Our data only included medications that were prescribed; over-the-counter medications were not captured. Therefore, it is possible that medication use and costs were underestimated. Finally, only confirmed consultations with a GP or specialist were included in the HCRU and cost analysis. The 6103 patients with a missing location on their index date had a varicella diagnosis, but did not have a consultation type recorded at index. We therefore may have underestimated indexed consultation costs for these patients.

In conclusion, we assessed complications, medications, HCRU, and the economic burden of pediatric varicella in an outpatient setting in France. Over 15% of patients experienced 1 or more complications during the 3-month follow-up period and a quarter of varicella patients were prescribed antibiotics. Introducing a UVV program in France is 1 potential strategy to reduce the clinical and economic burden of varicella in children and the use of antibiotics.

### Monitoring new symptoms after COVID-19 infection among primary care patients in New York city [^50b4d8df]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

COVID-19 affects multiple organ systems causing substantial long-term morbidity. The implications of the Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly for primary care, remain unknown. This cross-sectional study examines new symptoms reported at primary care encounters during three post-acute follow-up intervals after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods

Electronic health record data from the NYU Langone COVID Deidentified Dataset were queried for adults with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, and then restricted to those with a new ICD-10-CM code documented at a post-acute COVID-related primary care follow-up > 14 days after testing positive. New diagnoses and the corresponding Clinical Classifications Software Refined categories were assessed at the following intervals: 0.5–3 months ("subacute"), 3–6 months ("prolonged"), and 6–9 months ("persistent").

Results

Out of 3,154 patients, a new ICD-10-CM code was documented among 499 patients (∼16%). Respiratory complaints, including cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea, and hypoxemia, were most common. Malaise and fatigue were reported consistently among 10–13% of patients at all three time-intervals. Musculoskeletal pain, circulatory symptoms, and sleep-wake disorders were also observed at primary care follow-up.

Conclusion

This cross-sectional study provides support of a post-acute COVID syndrome, demonstrating that patients continue to experience symptoms after the acute infection period. Extensive follow-up data allowed for examining new symptoms up to 9 months after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding of the course of multi-organ post-acute sequelae is restricted by cross-sectional study design limitations. Standardized, sequelae-related ICD-10-CM codes to specify the type and duration of post-acute COVID-related symptoms would enable better monitoring of the growing number of SARS-CoV-2 infection survivors.

### DAGLA autoantibody experience at mayo clinic [^d9bbe07b]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diacylglycerol lipase alpha (DAGLA) autoantibody was recently reported in 4 patients (ages 18–34 years) all younger than the typical median age for autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (58 years). Serum and CSF produced a characteristic cerebellar molecular layer and hippocampal staining pattern of rodent brain by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA). All 4 patients had reactivity with a mostly extracellular DAGLA residue (amino acid [AA] 1–157) by cell-based assay (CBA) in CSF only. Reactivities with full-length DAGLA and other DAGLA residues were encountered in serum and CSF of DAGLA autoimmune patients and controls. For clinical assessment of DAGLA-specific autoimmune cerebellar ataxia, it has been recommended to test CSF to detect the DAGLA-characteristic staining pattern by IIFA and DAGLA reactivity by CBA expressing full-length DAGLA protein. Recommended optimized confirmatory testing employs a CBA expressing DAGLA AA, 1–582 residues (of 1042 total), that includes the 1–157 region. We report our experience of DAGLA autoimmunity from Mayo Clinic's Neuroimmunology Laboratory (IRB study protocol, 21–001297), and include a new likely post-infectious autoimmune cerebellitis case, identified among a cohort of patients with cerebellar IgG antibodies in our laboratory, giving further insight into this rare disorder.

### Phenotypic heterogeneity in genetic and acquired pediatric cerebellar disorders [^e16ccb28]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Neuroimaging is a central biomarker in PCDs and is essential for diagnostics and monitoring. We provide some examples of brain MRI findings associated with defined etiologies in the PEDIATAX cohort (Fig. 3). The most common neuroimaging finding in the PEDIATAX cohort was cerebellar atrophy that behaved in line with the literature. Although cerebellar atrophy is a frequent finding in genetic cerebellar ataxias, it is nonspecific and has only limited diagnostic value as an isolated finding. The specificity of diagnostic imaging of cerebellar hypoplasia and atrophy has developed during recent years; we have advanced from defining many posterior fossa findings as Dandy‐Walker malformations or as part of the Dandy‐Walker continuum to more detailed reporting. Recently, although Whitehead et al (2022) redefined the imaging definition of Dandy‐Walker malformation, they observed misdiagnoses in almost a quarter of previous reports. Thus, it will be essential to pursue a more detailed description of posterior fossa imaging findings to enable the recognition of previously unnoticed phenotypes that are linked to certain genetic conditions. Close collaboration between imaging and genetic research is necessary to enable more specific clinical diagnostics.

One limitation of the current study pertains to reporting bias in the literature review. We consider the clinical features included in our review to be common to PCDs, and information on the presence or absence of these features was present in most articles. However, some clinical features were not discussed in each article, possibly contributing to reporting bias (ie, underestimation of the frequency). All features were systematically assessed within the PEDIATAX cohort. Another limitation of the study is the small number of cases of non‐genetic etiologies, some of which may have been missed in the register search due to a lack of standardized ICD‐10 codes. ORPHAcodes were introduced in early 2025 as part of our electronic medical record system to improve the searchability of the records. In addition, a separate study of etiologies of cerebral palsy is currently ongoing in the study region and may yield additional insight into non‐genetic ataxias.
