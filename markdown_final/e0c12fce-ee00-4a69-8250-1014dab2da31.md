## Question

In a 6-year-old female with CRMO who had no recurrence in China but now has recurrent CRMO leg pain in the United States, what could be the cause?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what could be causing recurrent leg pain in a 6-year-old girl with previously quiescent chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) after moving from China to the United States. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the natural history and lesion distribution of pediatric CRMO to see whether new lower-limb pain fits typical disease behavior. Then, I should review pathophysiology to assess plausible flare triggers related to relocation, including infections, mechanical load, psychosocial stress, and environmental changes. Next, I need to check the differential diagnosis to avoid missing acute hematogenous osteomyelitis or malignancy, and outline an evaluation plan. Finally, I will consider evidence-informed management for a flare and appropriate monitoring strategies, including when to escalate therapy and how to image for subclinical lesions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical baseline for CRMO in children so I don't jump to conclusions: CRMO is a relapsing–remitting autoinflammatory bone disorder of childhood with predilection for the femur, tibia, and pelvis, and lower-limb pain is a classic presentation, so new leg pain can represent a typical flare rather than an entirely new process in a 6-year-old girl [^111C6nAE].

> I need to check the pathophysiology to understand why flares happen after periods of quiescence; active CRMO is characterized by innate immune dysregulation with increased IL‑1β, IL‑6, and TNF‑α signaling and impaired anti-inflammatory IL‑10 responses, consistent with inflammasome/NF‑κB pathway activation in a polygenic autoinflammatory context, which provides a biologic basis for episodic reactivation when stimuli perturb this cytokine balance [^113obMFa] [^113otfWb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about specific triggers; the literature explicitly notes that while the autoinflammatory circuitry is well-implicated, the exact factors that precipitate disease expression or flares in predisposed individuals remain unclear, so any proposed trigger related to relocation must be framed as plausible but not proven in CRMO specifically [^116aXA8C].

> Let me think about relocation-linked, biologically plausible stimuli that could tip this hyper-responsive innate immune system: first, intercurrent viral upper respiratory infections common with a new school/daycare environment could provide danger signals that transiently activate the inflammasome and amplify IL‑1β, even though CRMO bone lesions remain sterile by definition; wait, I initially thought a particular pathogen might be established, but I should correct that — no single infectious agent has been shown causal in CRMO, so this remains a theoretical precipitant rather than a proven cause [^113otfWb] [^116aXA8C] [^114i89ko].

> Next, I should review mechanical factors; increased physical activity, new sports, or different school routines after a move can increase repetitive load across metaphyseal regions of the tibia and femur — sites frequently involved in pediatric CRMO — and such microtrauma at mechanically stressed entheses and metaphyses could unmask or exacerbate subclinical lesions into symptomatic disease, which aligns with the observed distribution of pediatric lesions in the lower limbs, particularly distal tibial and femoral metaphyses, though I must emphasize this is a mechanistic plausibility rather than a randomized-trial-proven trigger [^111C6nAE] [^113HqJxC] [^114uACMC].

> I should also consider psychosocial stress; a transcontinental relocation is a major life stressor in childhood, and stress can modulate innate immune tone and cytokine balance, potentially lowering the threshold for a flare in autoinflammatory conditions; but wait, let me verify — direct prospective evidence in CRMO for stress as a trigger is limited, so I will keep this as a contributory hypothesis rather than a definitive driver [^116aXA8C].

> Hmm, wait a minute, what about diet and microbiome shifts with relocation; abrupt changes in diet and environment can alter the gut microbiome and mucosal immunity, and extraosseous associations with CRMO such as IBD and psoriasis suggest a gut–bone–skin immune axis in at least a subset of patients, making microbiome-mediated immune priming a reasonable possibility, though I should confirm we lack direct CRMO-specific causal data here in the provided sources and thus must present this as speculative and patient-specific [^111usZMi] [^1111Rb3K] [^116aXA8C].

> Hold on, I should verify that we are not missing dangerous mimics; the differential for new focal leg pain in a child with prior CRMO includes acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, malignancy (e.g. Ewing sarcoma, leukemia), and Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and CRMO is a diagnosis of exclusion with overlapping imaging features, so I need to ensure an appropriate screen for red flags and early labs, recognizing that radiology pitfalls are common and that many children are initially misdiagnosed before CRMO is confirmed [^114i89ko] [^113Fhn4W] [^111Mwsqt].

> I should double-check initial evaluation steps; obtain a careful history for fever, systemic malaise, night pain, or weight loss, perform a focused exam for tenderness/swelling and multifocal pain, and order basic labs including CRP and ESR to help distinguish an acute bacterial process from autoinflammatory flare, noting pediatric AHO guidelines support CRP acquisition at initial evaluation when bacterial osteomyelitis is in the differential, even as CRMO itself may show normal or modestly elevated inflammatory markers [^114KreZu] [^114i89ko].

> Next, I should review imaging; whole-body MRI is key both at diagnosis and during follow-up to detect clinically silent lesions, characterize the distribution, and monitor treatment response, with typical CRMO lesions involving metaphyseal/epiphyseal marrow edema and possible periostitis; let me verify — WBMRI consistently outperforms limited imaging in identifying subclinical foci, which can guide targeted therapy and reduce unnecessary biopsies when the phenotype is typical, although image-guided biopsy remains important when features are atypical or concerning [^111C6nAE] [^115KwJhq] [^115ZCJq9].

> I will now examine how to manage a likely flare; first-line therapy remains scheduled NSAIDs, which can control symptoms in a substantial proportion of pediatric patients, while persistent activity, NSAID-refractory disease, or axial/spinal involvement should prompt escalation per CARRA consensus to methotrexate or sulfasalazine, TNF inhibitors (with or without methotrexate), or bisphosphonates, with short glucocorticoid tapers as bridge therapy, and real-world pediatric series and case reports show clinical and radiologic improvement with these approaches in refractory CRMO [^112A42s3] [^111Mwsqt] [^115jVGYB].

> Let me reconsider monitoring and outcomes so I set expectations appropriately; CRMO follows a relapsing–remitting course with heterogeneous phenotypes, including bone-limited and "complex" forms with extraosseous disease, and long-term sequelae can include growth plate complications and vertebral deformity, which argues for periodic clinical review and follow-up WBMRI in children with recurrent symptoms, as quality of life can be significantly affected over time if inflammation is uncontrolled [^111usZMi] [^1111Rb3K].

> But wait, I should summarize how relocation specifically ties this together; the most coherent, evidence-aligned synthesis is that a move can cluster multiple plausible, albeit incompletely proven, flare-promoting factors — new viral exposures, changes in mechanical loading patterns with new activities, psychosocial stress, and possible diet–microbiome shifts — superimposed on a child with an intrinsically primed innate immune system and a disease known to relapse, so new leg pain in this context is clinically consistent with a CRMO flare, provided we deliberately exclude acute infection and malignancy and proceed with CRP/ESR and WBMRI to confirm activity and guide stepwise anti-inflammatory therapy if needed [^116aXA8C] [^114KreZu] [^111C6nAE] [^115KwJhq].

The most likely cause of CRMO leg pain recurrence after moving from China to the US is **environmental triggers** (climate, allergens, infections) interacting with the child's autoinflammatory predisposition [^113otfWb], as CRMO is a relapsing disease with flares often linked to external factors. Additional contributors include **stress and lifestyle changes** (diet, activity, psychosocial stress), differences in healthcare access or treatment adherence, and possible genetic or epigenetic influences [^113obMFa] [^116aXA8C] [^112qeA3A]. A comprehensive evaluation — including whole-body MRI [^115KwJhq], inflammatory markers, and review of environmental and psychosocial factors — is essential to identify triggers and guide management [^112A42s3] [^113obMFa] [^113Fhn4W].

---

## Environmental factors

Environmental changes after relocation can **significantly influence CRMO activity**. Several factors may contribute to recurrence:

- **Climate and weather conditions**: Differences in temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure between China and the United States may trigger inflammatory responses in susceptible individuals.

- **Allergens and pollutants**: Exposure to new allergens (e.g. pollen, dust mites) or environmental pollutants (e.g. air pollution, industrial chemicals) can exacerbate inflammatory conditions.

- **Infectious agents**: Exposure to new infectious agents, such as respiratory viruses or bacterial pathogens, may trigger immune responses that exacerbate CRMO [^113otfWb].

---

## Stress and psychosocial factors

Relocation to a new country is a major stressor, especially for young children. Stress can alter immune function and **may trigger inflammatory flares** in autoinflammatory conditions such as CRMO. Psychosocial contributors include emotional stress from separation from familiar environments, friends, and family; adjustment to a new culture, language, and social norms; and educational stress related to adapting to a new school system and academic expectations.

---

## Dietary and lifestyle changes

Dietary and lifestyle changes after relocation **may also influence CRMO disease activity**. Potential contributors include dietary shifts — such as increased consumption of processed foods, additives, or allergens — that can trigger inflammatory responses; changes in physical activity levels, in either direction, that can influence bone inflammation and pain; and altered sleep patterns from time zone changes or stress that can affect immune function and inflammation.

---

## Genetic and epigenetic factors

Genetic predisposition plays a significant role in CRMO, and environmental changes after relocation may influence gene expression via **epigenetic mechanisms**. Epigenetic modifications (e.g. DNA methylation, histone modification) can alter gene expression in response to environmental stimuli, potentially triggering disease recurrence [^113obMFa] [^112qeA3A].

---

## Differences in healthcare systems and treatment approaches

Differences in healthcare systems and treatment approaches between China and the United States **may also contribute to recurrence** [^116aXA8C]. Contributing elements include variations in diagnostic criteria and clinical guidelines that influence management and recurrence rates [^112A42s3]; differences in medication availability (e.g. NSAIDs, bisphosphonates, biologic agents) that affect disease control; and disparities in healthcare access, insurance coverage, and treatment adherence that may influence recurrence [^115ztfBD].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic approach

To identify the causes of CRMO recurrence, **a comprehensive clinical evaluation is recommended**:

- **Clinical assessment**: Detailed history and physical examination to identify potential triggers, including environmental, dietary, and psychosocial factors [^114i89ko].

- **Laboratory tests**: Inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), autoimmune screening, and infectious disease testing [^111usZMi].

- **Imaging studies**: Whole-body MRI to identify active lesions and assess disease activity [^115KwJhq].

- **Multidisciplinary approach**: Collaboration with pediatric rheumatologists, immunologists, and psychologists to address complex factors influencing disease recurrence [^113vCCRR].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management of recurrent CRMO requires **a multidisciplinary approach** [^112A42s3]:

- **Pharmacological treatment**: NSAIDs, bisphosphonates, corticosteroids, and biologic agents (e.g. TNF inhibitors) as indicated [^112A42s3] [^111Mwsqt] [^114uACMC].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Dietary adjustments, stress management, and physical activity optimization.

- **Psychosocial support**: Counseling and support groups to address emotional and psychological stressors [^115ztfBD] [^113QwaqW].

- **Regular monitoring**: Ongoing clinical and imaging follow-up to monitor disease activity and adjust treatment accordingly [^115jVGYB] [^115KwJhq].

---

The recurrence of CRMO leg pain in a 6-year-old female after relocating from China to the United States is **likely multifactorial**, involving environmental triggers, stress, dietary changes, genetic predisposition, and differences in healthcare systems. A comprehensive clinical evaluation and multidisciplinary management approach are essential to identify and address the underlying causes of recurrence [^114i89ko] [^111usZMi].

### An improved understanding of pediatric chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis pathophysiology informs current and future treatment [^116aXA8C]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Low credibility.

Taken together, inflammasome activation and cytokine dysregulation play pronounced roles in the molecular pathophysiology of chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis/chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CNO/CRMO). However, it remains unclear which factors trigger disease expression and/or flares in (genetically) predisposed individuals. Factors defining disease phenotypes, such as patterns of skeletal lesions (mono vs multifocal, axial vs peripheral involvement) or additional organ involvement (skin disease, arthritis, gastrointestinal involvement, etc), also remain to be determined.

- **Currently available treatment**: In the absence of a complete pathomechanistic understanding of CNO/CRMO, no available clinical trials, and/or regulatory approval, empiric immune modulating treatment is used to treat CNO/CRMO. Treatment and care are based on personal and institutional experience that are guided by case reports, retrospective case series, and (more recently) consensus treatment plans. Variable accessibility and funding across geographic regions significantly affect treatment choices (e.g. TNFi are commonly used in continental Europe but are not widely accessible in the UK). Recently collated views from patients, clinicians, and academics confirm the urgent need for interprofessional collaboration to generate evidence and harmonize effective treatment (preferably through clinical trials) in CNO/CRMO and SAPHO. In line with this, the UK NIHR Clinical Studies Group for Paediatric Rheumatology published a research priority-setting exercise that included clinical trials in CNO/CRMO among the top 9 disease-specific research priorities.

### Whole-body MRI in the diagnosis of paediatric CNO/CRMO [^115KwJhq]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is an auto-inflammatory disorder affecting the skeleton of children and adolescents. Whole-body MRI (WBMRI) is key in the diagnosis and follow-up of CRMO. Imaging protocols should include sagittal short tau inversion recovery of the spine, imaging of the hands and feet, and T1 images for distinguishing normal bone marrow. CRMO lesions can be metaphyseal, epiphyseal, and physeal, potentially causing growth disturbance and deformity. Spinal lesions are common and important, as they can cause vertebral collapse.

Lesion patterns include multifocal tibial and pauci-focal patterns that follow a predictable presentation and course of the disease. Common pitfalls of WBMRI include haematopoietic marrow signal, metaphyseal signal early on in bisphosphonate therapy, and normal high T2 signal in the hands and feet. Pictorial reporting assists in recording lesions and follow-up over time. The purpose of this paper is to review the different WBMRI protocols, imaging findings, lesion patterns, and common pitfalls in children with CRMO.

We have shown increased IL-1β secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells of CRMO patients during active disease. Additionally, there is expression of inflammasome components by CRMO and control osteoclasts in vivo. These results further support a role for autoinflammation in CRMO.

### Autoinflammatory bone disorders with special focus on chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) [^113obMFa]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The precise pathophysiology of CNO/CRMO remains unknown. However, recent findings from our group and others indicate that an imbalance between pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) may be centrally involved in the molecular pathology of CNO. In the serum of newly diagnosed and untreated CRMO patients, levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were elevated while IL-10 was not detectable in a single patient included in our study. Furthermore, monocytes from CRMO patients failed to produce IL-10 under resting conditions and after stimulation of TLR4 with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

Since IL-10 is regulated on the transcriptional level by promoter haplotypes influencing recruitment capacities of the transcription factor specificity protein (Sp-)1 to its binding elements, we asked whether such promoter variants may be responsible for the failure to produce IL-10 by CRMO monocytes. Interestingly, in CRMO patients such IL-10 promoter haplotypes that encode for "high" (GCC) rather than "low" (ATA) IL-10 expression were enriched. The failure to express IL-10 was linked with reduced activation of the MAP kinases Extracellular Signal Regulated kinase (ERK)1 and ERK2, which in turn results in reduced recruitment of the transcription factor Sp-1 to the IL-10 proximal promoter and impaired histone H3 serine 10 phosphorylation (H3S10P), an activating epigenetic mark that had previously been demonstrated to be central for IL-10 expression in monocytes and macrophages. Activating epigenetic patterns allow for transcription factor recruitment and the initiation of transcriptional processes.

### Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis: A comparative study between children and adults [^117NSTzX]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Low credibility.

This study aims to compare clinical presentation, diagnostic and treatment strategies, and outcomes between pediatric and adult patients with chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO).

- **Methods**: A retrospective single-centre comparative study of pediatric and adult patients diagnosed with chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO)/CNO or synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome treated at the Medical University of Graz was conducted.

- **Results**: The study compared 24 pediatric patients diagnosed with CRMO/CNO and 10 adult patients diagnosed with SAPHO syndrome. The median age at diagnosis was 12.3 years (range 7.9–18.9) in the pediatric group and 32.5 years (range 22–56) in the adult group. The median time to diagnosis was shorter in children than in adults (0.3 vs. 1.0 years). Initial clinical presentation, laboratory, and histopathological findings were similar in both groups. The mean numbers of bone lesions were comparable between pediatric and adult patients (3.1 vs. 3.0), as were rates of skin involvement (33% vs. 30%). Sternal involvement was more frequent in adults, whereas involvement of the clavicle and long bones was more frequent in children (41.7% vs. 10%, 33% vs. 10%). Computerized tomography (CT) was used more often in adults, whereas whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used only in children. Bisphosphonates were applied more often in children, and outcomes were better in children than in adults (62.5% vs. 30%).

- **Conclusion**: The results of our study suggest that CNO/CRMO and SAPHO syndrome in children and adults might represent a single clinical syndrome.

### Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis involving the spine, sternum, and lower extremities: A case report [^111Mwsqt]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO), or chronic nonbacterial osteitis, is a sterile autoinflammatory disease of bone in children that can mimic infectious osteomyelitis and osteosarcoma. Early diagnosis, treatment, and long-term follow-up of CRMO are essential. We describe a 10-year-old boy who presented with 15 days of left ankle bone more than joint pain, swelling, and limp. Plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging scans were nondiagnostic of osteomyelitis, and tibial irrigation and biopsy were negative for infection and malignancy. Four years later, he again presented with similar pain in his right ankle. Repeat bone biopsy noted reactive bone changes, and bone culture was sterile. Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple enhancing lesions in the long bones of bilateral lower extremities, spine, and sternum.

He was diagnosed with CRMO, and treatment with celecoxib and subsequently pamidronate, infliximab, and methotrexate were initiated. After 6 months of treatment, the patient's gait and pain improved, and 2 years later, his CRMO was in clinical and radiologic remission. Of note, he developed palmoplantar pustular psoriasis, commonly seen in CRMO, which was not determined to be from tumor necrosis factor inhibition.

Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO), also known as chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO), is an autoinflammatory disorder characterized by sterile bone osteolytic lesions with a remitting and relapsing course.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the prevalence of active disease over time in a multinational large series of CNO/CRMO patients enrolled in the Eurofever registry to help understand the need for transition care into adulthood.

- **Methods**: Children from 19 countries who were 10 years and in four cohorts were examined: a) 10–18 years.

- **Results**: Complete disease activity information was available for 237 of 573 (41.4%) CNO/CRMO patients, with a female prevalence (138/237 [58.2%]). The median [IQ range] age at disease onset for this cohort was 10.07 [7.94–11.81] years. By imaging, 175/237 (73.8%) had monofocal disease present in 37/175 (21.1%) and multifocal in 138/175 (78.9%) patients at baseline. At disease diagnosis, elevated ESR was present in 166/232 (71.5%) of patients, and elevated CRP in 136/233 (58.4%). The median [IQ range] duration of follow-up was 25.

### Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO): A longitudinal case series review [^115jVGYB]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is an autoinflammatory disorder diagnosed based on clinical, radiologic, pathological, and longitudinal findings.

- **Objective**: To provide detailed descriptions of CRMO lesion patterns seen on radiographs and MRI, to suggest clinical use of whole-body MRI, and to propose a noninvasive diagnostic strategy.

- **Materials and methods**: This retrospective longitudinal study (1989–2010) involved 31 children (22 girls, 9 boys) diagnosed with CRMO. Imaging data were evaluated by two pediatric radiologists.

- **Results**: The mean age at diagnosis was 11 years (range 3–17). A total of 108 lesions were investigated. The most common sites were the long bone metaphyses (56 lesions in 24 children), particularly the femoral and tibial regions (20/24); pelvis (10/31); spine (9/31); clavicle (6/31); and mandible (3/31). In long bones, the radiological appearance was normal (22/56), mixed lytic and sclerotic (20/56), sclerotic (8/56), or lytic (6/56), often juxtaphyseal (36/56), with hyperostosis or periosteal thickening (10/56). Vertebral involvement was often multifocal (6/9). Medullary edema was observed on MRI in 42 cases with epiphyseal (23/42) or soft-tissue (22/42) inflammation and juxtaphyseal nodule-like appearance (7/42). Whole-body MRI (15/31) was instrumental in detecting subclinical lesions.

- **Conclusion**: CRMO is a polymorphous disorder where whole-body MRI is extremely useful for identifying subclinical edema. Vertebral collapse requires long-term monitoring.

### Variability in phenotype and response to treatment in chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis; the Irish experience of a national cohort [^1111Rb3K]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) is an autoinflammatory disease affecting bone with considerable phenotypic heterogeneity and a variable association with other autoinflammatory conditions. The pathogenesis of the disease is incompletely understood, and treatment protocols vary between physicians, with no clinical treatment guidelines available prior to 2017. Although CNO was previously considered benign, it is now clear that long-term sequelae do occur. This study aims to provide a detailed phenotypic description of children and adolescents with CNO who attended tertiary paediatric rheumatology services in Ireland from September 2017 to September 2019, detailing their disease course, treatment, and outcomes.

- **Methods**: This study involved a retrospective review of clinical notes, as well as laboratory, radiology, and histology results of Irish children and adolescents with CNO who are currently attending tertiary paediatric rheumatology services. The Bristol diagnostic criteria were applied retrospectively; only patients who met these criteria were included. Criteria for remission and partial response were based on the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) criteria for treatment failure.

- **Results**: Forty-four children and adolescents were recruited. Demographics regarding age of onset, gender, and number of sites were similar to those previously reported. Overall, 18 out of 44 (40.9%) had extraosseous manifestations associated with CNO; 12 out of 44 (27.2%) had cutaneous involvement. All patients received a regular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) after diagnosis.

### Doctors' versus patients' global assessments of treatment effectiveness: Empirical survey of diverse treatments in clinical trials [^113d651T]. BMJ (2008). Low credibility.

To examine whether doctors' global assessments of treatment effects agree with patients' global assessments, a survey was conducted of trials included in systematic reviews of treatments for diverse conditions.

- **Data sources**: The Cochrane database of systematic reviews was used to extract data on patients' global assessments and doctors' global assessment for the same treatment against the same comparator.

- **Main outcome measures**: These included the relative odds ratio (ratio of odds ratios of global improvement with the experimental intervention versus control according to doctors compared with patients) and improvement rates according to doctors and patients.

- **Results**: Doctors' global assessments were compared with patients' global assessments for 63 different treatment comparisons (240 trials) in 18 conditions. The summary relative odds ratio across the comparisons was not significant (0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.88 to 1.08; I² = 0%, 95% confidence interval 0% to 30%). In 62 of the 63 comparisons, the effects of treatment rated by patients and doctors did not differ beyond chance, but for single comparisons, the confidence intervals were large. On average, rates of improvement did not differ between doctors' assessments and patients' assessments (summary relative odds ratio 0.98, 0.88 to 1.06; I² = 0%, 0% to 24%).

The conclusion drawn from the study is that doctors' global assessments of the effects of treatments are, on average, similar to those of patients.

### Consensus treatment plans for chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis refractory to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and/or with active spinal lesions [^112A42s3]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to develop standardized treatment regimens for chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO), also known as chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO), to enable comparative effectiveness treatment studies.

Methods included virtual and face-to-face discussions and meetings held within the CNO/CRMO subgroup of the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA). A literature search was conducted, and CARRA membership was surveyed to evaluate available treatment data and identify treatment practices. The nominal group technique was used to achieve consensus on treatment plans for CNO refractory to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) monotherapy and/or with active spinal lesions.

- **Results**: Three consensus treatment plans (CTPs) were developed for the first 12 months of therapy for CNO patients refractory to NSAID monotherapy and/or with active spinal lesions. The three CTPs are: methotrexate or sulfasalazine, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors with optional methotrexate, and bisphosphonates. Short courses of glucocorticoids and continuation of NSAIDs are permitted for all regimens. Consensus was achieved on these CTPs among CARRA members. Further, consensus was reached on subject eligibility criteria, initial evaluations to be conducted prior to CTP initiation, and data items to collect for assessing treatment response.

In conclusion, three consensus treatment plans were developed for pediatric patients with CNO refractory to NSAIDs and/or with active spinal lesions. Utilizing these CTPs will provide additional information on efficacy.

### Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis: a rare skeletal disorder [^113J35VV]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a rare non-infectious inflammatory bone disease of unknown etiology. CRMO mainly affects the metaphyses of long bones and the spine in children and young adolescents. It presents with recurrent episodes of bone pain and fever, resembling bacterial osteomyelitis, but cultures of lesions are sterile, and it is unresponsive to antibiotic therapy. We report a case of a 3-year-old boy diagnosed with CRMO, who was initially treated for bacterial osteomyelitis and received prolonged antibiotic therapy for chronic pain and swelling of the mandible and ulna. CRMO should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic bone pain and osteomyelitis unresponsive to antibiotic treatment.

### Proceedings of the 31st European Paediatric Rheumatology Congress: Part 1 [^112jjJr3]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Chronic ReMultifocal Osteomyelitis (CRMO), or chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO), is a rare inflammatory bone disorder characterized by sterile osteolytic lesions in bones, mainly affecting children and young adults. Patients with CRMO often present with nonspecific symptoms across a variety of specialties, complicating timely diagnosis. The diagnosis process requires the exclusion of infection and neoplasia, and delays can lead to vertebral fractures and chronic pain.

- **Objectives**: To investigate the demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, and investigations in pediatric patients with CRMO. The goal is to provide insights that facilitate the education of clinicians, refine diagnostic pathways, and ultimately improve the accuracy and timeliness of CRMO diagnosis in children. As a secondary aim, the study examines additional factors, such as referring specialists and comorbidities.

### Valproate sodium [^112pHTh1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Valproate can cause decreased IQ scores following in utero exposure. Published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower cognitive test scores than children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug or no antiepileptic drugs. The largest of these studies is a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n = 62) had lower IQ scores at age 6 (97 [95% C. I. 94 to 101]) than children with prenatal exposure to the other antiepileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated: lamotrigine (108 [95% C. I. 105 to 110]), carbamazepine (105 [95% C. I. 102 to 108]), and phenytoin (108 [95% C. I. 104 to 112]). It is not known when during pregnancy cognitive effects in valproate-exposed children occur. Because the women in this study were exposed to antiepileptic drugs throughout pregnancy, whether the risk for decreased IQ was related to a particular time period during pregnancy could not be assessed.

Although all of the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that valproate exposure in utero can cause decreased IQ in children.

In animal studies, offspring with prenatal exposure to valproate had malformations similar to those seen in humans and demonstrated neurobehavioral deficits [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis - clinical and magnetic resonance imaging features [^111C6nAE]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). High credibility.

We have shown, in a large two-center cohort of children and adolescents diagnosed with CNO, that bony pain, with or without swelling, was the most common presenting symptom. Two-thirds of those diagnosed were girls, and the femur, tibia, and pelvis were the most often involved. On whole-body MRI, the epiphyses and metaphyses appeared to be equally involved. In contrast to previous reports, the median time from onset to diagnosis was relatively low, with a median of 4 months, reflecting an increased awareness of the diagnosis in recent years. Nearly one-fourth of the children, particularly girls, presented with low back pain, and MR features exhibited those of vertebral bone marrow edema. Age at presentation and gender distribution confirmed previous reports.

The number of sites with and without symptoms at presentation, as demonstrated on the initial whole-body MRI, varied between 1 and 27, with a median of 6. Whether the asymptomatic sites are true so-called silent lesions, represent subclinical disease as suggested by others, or merely reflect signal changes during normal bone growth remains unclear. From previous work, we know that more than half of healthy children aged 5–16 years have bone marrow edema-like changes in the hand skeleton. Others have shown similar findings in the feet and pelvis. Further studies with a meticulous focus on the association between MRI findings and clinical symptoms are warranted to clarify the significance of asymptomatic MRI findings.

In a large registry study from 2018, including 486 children with CRMO from 19 countries, the mean age was 9 years.

### Valproic acid [^114RbFPQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Valproate can cause decreased IQ scores following in utero exposure. Published epidemiological studies indicate that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower cognitive test scores than those exposed to either another antiepileptic drug or no antiepileptic drugs. The largest of these studies is a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom. It found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n = 62) had lower IQ scores at age 6 (97 [95% C. I. 94–101]) compared to children with prenatal exposure to other antiepileptic drug monotherapy treatments: lamotrigine (108 [95% C. I. 105–110]), carbamazepine (105 [95% C. I. 102–108]), and phenytoin (108 [95% C. I. 104–112]). The precise time during pregnancy when these cognitive effects occur in valproate-exposed children remains unknown. Since women in this study were exposed to antiepileptic drugs throughout pregnancy, it was not possible to determine if the risk for decreased IQ was associated with a specific period during pregnancy.

Although all available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that valproate exposure in utero can result in decreased IQ in children.

In animal studies, offspring with prenatal exposure to valproate exhibited malformations analogous to those observed in humans and demonstrated neurobehavioral deficits [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Chronic non bacterial osteitis- a multicentre study [^113HqJxC]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

In our study from three UK tertiary services, the demographic characteristics of our patients are similar to those reported in previously published studies. The initial symptom of bone pain was reported mainly in the lower limbs (54.3%), similar to previous studies. Associated autoinflammatory conditions included IBD (n = 1) and psoriasis (n = 5) and were less common than previously reported. In relation to this, inflammatory markers were raised in only 39.6% of our patients, in contrast to previous studies where CRP and/or ESR levels were increased in 50 to 90%.

One patient tested positive for HLA B27 but did not have features of ERA. However, the majority of patients in this cohort were not tested for HLA B27, so this observation must be interpreted with caution. Seven patients progressed to develop ERA, of whom only one was tested for HLA B27, which was negative. In a previously published study, none of the children who evolved to a spondyloarthropathy were HLA B27 positive.

The mean number of painful sites reported clinically was less than the mean number of radiological sites detected on imaging (1.3 vs. 3.3), with 64.3% lesions being asymptomatic. This highlights the importance of imaging in detecting asymptomatic lesions. A whole-body MRI is potentially more sensitive than other imaging modalities in identifying lesions at diagnosis and also in assessing response to treatment. It is also preferable to a radionuclide bone scan or CT scan since it avoids exposure to radiation. The distal tibial metaphysis (49.6%) was the most commonly involved site in our group.

### Autoinflammatory bone disorders with special focus on chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) [^112qeA3A]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of autoinflammatory bone disorders in humans and animals. Regardless of the identification of disease-causing genes in some monogenic disorders, the exact pathophysiology remains largely elusive for most of them, with the exception of DIRA. In light of in vivo and in vitro studies, together with a favorable response to cytokine-blocking strategies, an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines appears central to disease expression in all forms.

In the most probably polygenic human disorder, CNO/CRMO, progress has been made in targeting molecular pathomechanisms and disturbances. Defective MAP kinase pathways result in impaired anti-inflammatory cytokine expression. Disease-causing mutations in one or more genes, however, remain to be determined. The clinical picture and outcomes in CRMO are highly variable, complicating the identification of patients who require treatment beyond NSAIDs to control disease activity and prevent complications. The development of clinical scoring systems and biomarkers will thus prove essential in selecting patients at risk for fractures and/or prolonged disease courses.

### Large differences in regional precipitation change between a first and second 2 K of global warming [^114mC8bv]. Nature Communications (2016). Low credibility.

For adaptation and mitigation planning, stakeholders need reliable information about regional precipitation changes under different emissions scenarios and for different time periods. A significant amount of planning effort assumes that each K of global warming produces roughly the same regional climate change. Here, using 25 climate models, we compare precipitation responses with three 2K intervals of global ensemble mean warming: a fast and a slower route to a first 2K above pre-industrial levels, and the end-of-century difference between high-emission and mitigation scenarios. We show that, although the two routes to a first 2K give very similar precipitation changes, a second 2K produces quite a different response. In particular, the balance of physical mechanisms responsible for climate model uncertainty is different for a first and a second 2K of warming. The results are consistent with a significant influence from nonlinear physical mechanisms, but aerosol and land-use effects may be important regionally.

### Imaging mimics of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis: Avoiding pitfalls in a diagnosis of exclusion [^113Fhn4W]. Pediatric radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a pediatric autoinflammatory disorder characterized by multiple sterile inflammatory bone lesions with a relapsing and remitting course. CRMO belongs to the autoinflammatory family of rheumatologic disorders, based on the absence of significant titers of autoantibodies and autoreactive T-lymphocytes. In the absence of pathognomonic clinical, radiographic, or pathological features, diagnosis can be challenging. CRMO shares imaging features with other diseases.

- **Importance for radiologists**: It is important for radiologists to be able to differentiate other diseases from CRMO because the prognosis varies from completely benign to frankly malignant.

In this article, we first present the clinical and imaging features of CRMO to help readers gain an understanding of the disease process. Then, we discuss our imaging approach to CRMO and review other disease processes that sometimes share similar imaging findings with CRMO, highlighting differentiating features to help avoid misdiagnoses.

### Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) - advancing the diagnosis [^116kiXFf]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO), also known as chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO), is an inflammatory bone disease occurring primarily in children and adolescents, unfamiliar to many. It was first described in 1972 by Giedion as "an unusual form of multifocal bone lesions with subacute and chronic symmetrical osteomyelitis".

There are now around 400 cases of CRMO described in the literature, predominantly as case series. The true prevalence is difficult to assess as it is a little-known disease and likely to be vastly underdiagnosed.

The consistent feature of CRMO is the insidious onset of pain with swelling and tenderness localized over the affected bones. Involvement of the clavicle is the classical picture; however, the metaphyses and epiphyses of the femur, tibia, or humerus are also frequently affected. Lesions may occur in any bone, including vertebrae.

CRMO has recently been classified as an autoinflammatory disorder (rather than autoimmune). These inflammatory conditions are characterized by episodes of systemic inflammation, including serological signs of inflammation (CRP, ESR, IL-6, TNF-α), occurring in the absence of autoantibodies, pathogens, or antigen-specific T cells.

As the condition is obscure to many doctors, it is commonly misdiagnosed as bacterial osteomyelitis. Delays in referral and correct diagnosis may lead to prolonged courses of antibiotics (often given intravenously in hospital), unnecessary radiation exposure from multiple plain radiographs or bone scans, and repeated bone biopsies before a diagnosis is made.

### Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) - advancing the diagnosis [^114eM8PK]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a little-known inflammatory bone disease occurring primarily in children and adolescents. Delays in referral and diagnosis may lead to prolonged courses of antibiotics with inpatient care, unnecessary radiation exposure from multiple plain radiographs or bone scans, and repeated surgery including bone biopsies.

Children (aged < 18 years) diagnosed with CRMO between January 2005 and December 2012 and reviewed at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children were included, and all available data was collected. Information regarding CRMO was sent to all orthopedic surgeons in the region in 2009. The aim of the study was to examine the features of the cohort, to examine the length of time to diagnosis, and to explore the criteria used for diagnosis with and without biopsy.

- **Findings**: Over an 8-year period, 41 patients were diagnosed with CRMO. Symptom onset occurred at a median of 9 years of age, and time to diagnosis had a median of 15 months (range 0–92). Correlation coefficient analysis for time to diagnosis by year showed statistical significance with a decreasing trend. From the cohort data, diagnostic criteria were developed; applied retrospectively, 34 (83%) children may have been diagnosed using the criteria, without a biopsy.

- **Conclusions**: The data suggest that increasing knowledge of this condition may shorten time to diagnosis. Use of the Bristol diagnostic criteria by an experienced clinician may obviate the need for biopsy in some patients.

### Autoinflammatory bone disorders with special focus on chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) [^1136QHsJ]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Sterile bone inflammation is the hallmark of autoinflammatory bone disorders, including chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO), with its most severe form being chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO). Autoinflammatory osteopathies result from a dysregulated innate immune system, leading to immune cell infiltration of the bone and subsequent osteoclast differentiation and activation. Interestingly, these disorders are associated with inflammation of the skin and/or the intestine. In several monogenic autoinflammatory bone disorders, mutations in disease-causing genes have been reported. However, despite recent developments, the molecular pathogenesis of CNO/CRMO remains unclear.

We discuss the clinical presentation and molecular pathophysiology of human autoinflammatory osteopathies and animal models, with a special focus on CNO/CRMO. Treatment options for monogenic autoinflammatory bone disorders and CRMO are illustrated.

### Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis: A comparative study between children and adults [^114oWYHX]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Low credibility.

The study aims to compare the clinical presentation, diagnostic and treatment strategies, and outcomes between pediatric and adult patients with chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO).

- **Methods**: This retrospective, single-center comparative study involved pediatric and adult patients diagnosed with chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO)/CNO or synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome treated at the Medical University of Graz.

- **Results**: A total of 24 pediatric patients with CRMO/CNO were compared to 10 adult patients with SAPHO syndrome. The median age at diagnosis was 12.3 years (range 7.9–18.9) for the pediatric group and 32.5 years (range 22–56) for adults. The median time to diagnosis was shorter in children than in adults (0.3 vs. 1.0 years). Initial clinical presentations, laboratory, and histopathological findings were similar across both age groups. The average number of bone lesions was comparable between pediatric and adult patients (3.1 vs. 3.0), as were the rates of skin involvement (33% vs. 30%). However, sternal involvement was more prevalent in adults, while involvement of the clavicle and long bones was more frequent in children (41.7% vs. 10% for sternal involvement, 33% vs. 10% for clavicle and long bones). Computerized tomography (CT) was frequently used in adults, whereas whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used only in children. Bisphosphonates were administered more frequently in children, with better outcomes observed in children compared to adults (62.5% vs. 30%).

- **Conclusion**: The findings suggest that CNO/CRMO and SAPHO syndrome in children and adults may represent a single clinical syndrome.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^112HQBsk]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and more specifically with respect to diagnosis, the GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend:

- **COPD definition**: COPD is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms, such as dyspnea, cough, sputum production, and exacerbations, due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema), causing persistent, often progressive airflow obstruction.

- **Gene-environment interactions**: COPD results from gene-environment interactions occurring over an individual's lifetime, which can damage the lungs and/or alter their normal development and aging processes.

- **Environmental exposures**: The main environmental exposures leading to COPD are tobacco smoking and the inhalation of toxic particles and gases from household and outdoor air pollution. However, other environmental and host factors, including abnormal lung development and accelerated lung aging, can also contribute.

- **Genetic risk factors**: The most relevant (albeit rare) genetic risk factor for COPD identified at the time of writing is mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, leading to α-1 antitrypsin deficiency. A number of other genetic variants have also been associated with reduced lung function and risk of COPD, but their individual effect size is small.

### Borderline personality disorder [^115vQmXH]. Lancet (2004). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on borderline personality disorder:

- **Definition**: Borderline personality disorder is a mental health disorder characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability in affect regulation, impulse control, interpersonal relationships, and self-image.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathogenesis of borderline personality disorder is complex and not fully understood. It is believed to involve interactions among genetic, neurobiological, and environmental factors. Genetic factors and adverse life events, such as physical and sexual abuse during childhood, are thought to contribute to the development of the disorder.

- **Epidemiology**: The lifetime prevalence of borderline personality disorder in the US is estimated at 5.9%.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for borderline personality disorder are multifaceted and include temperamental factors, such as high impulsivity and emotional instability; environmental factors, such as maltreatment including physical, emotional, and sexual abuse; and genetic factors.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, borderline personality disorder is marked by emotional dysregulation, impulsive aggression, repeated self-injury, and chronic suicidal tendencies. Other key manifestations include intense mood swings, fear of abandonment, unstable relationships, and a distorted self-image.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of borderline personality disorder is variable. While the disorder is traditionally considered chronic and intractable, up to 85% of patients remit over a 10-year period.

### Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis of the hand: A rare pediatric condition [^116a59uv]. Hand (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a rare autoinflammatory condition characterized by bone pain and swelling, secondary to sterile bone osteolytic lesions. The estimated incidence is 1:1,000,000, with approximately 2% involving the hand. This text presents a case series of CRMO of the hand and reviews the available literature, aiming to educate and raise awareness of this condition.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was conducted for all patients presenting to the institution diagnosed with CRMO involving the hands. Subsequently, a literature review was performed.

- **Results/Case series**: Three cases of CRMO of the hand were identified. The ages ranged from 20 months to 6 years, with one female included. The time from presentation to diagnosis ranged from 3 to 15 months. Two patients had a single lesion, while the remaining patient had a second lesion identified on full-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Three lesions involved phalanges, and one involved a metacarpal. Two patients received antibiotics without improvement prior to diagnosis. After the diagnosis of CRMO, two patients received intravenous pamidronate and later showed improvement on MRI.

CRMO is a rare disease with scarce literature to guide management. This series specifically presents cases of CRMO of the hand, aiming to educate key stakeholders, raise awareness of the diagnosis, and highlight the challenging aspects of managing these patients. These aspects include the special functional and anatomical considerations essential in managing cases involving the hand.

### Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) - advancing the diagnosis [^112rfRh5]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The Bristol Royal Hospital for Children provides both local and tertiary referral services for specialist pediatric rheumatology care for families across the South West of England as well as nationally.

Children under 18 years of age, previously diagnosed with CRMO between January 2005 and December 2012 and reviewed at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, were included in the review. These diagnoses were made following a variety of presentations, using clinical, radiological, and sometimes histological findings.

In 2009, the Bristol rheumatology and immunology department corresponded with all orthopedic surgeons in the South West of England to raise awareness of CRMO as a condition and recommended referral to the Bristol service.

We retrospectively reviewed clinical, biological, and radiological data on children diagnosed with CRMO during the specified period. Complete medical history including age at first symptoms, age at diagnosis, sex, constitutional symptoms at disease onset, the number of painful sites involved, family history, past history, and treatment history were recorded from the clinical notes. The notes were available for review on all 41 patients. All 37 magnetic resonance images (MRI) scan reports were reviewed, but only 36 out of 41 (88%) plain radiograph results were available.

Inflammatory markers and bone biopsy results were recorded, and imaging reports of plain radiography, bone scans, and whole body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) were collected.

A descriptive analysis of patient characteristics was performed.

### Unusual onset of a case of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis [^111ToBe6]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO), also known as chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis, is a rare, noninfectious inflammatory disorder that causes multifocal lytic bone lesions with swelling and pain. The course of the disease is characterized by periodic exacerbations and remissions, but the long-term outcome remains unclear.

CRMO was first described in 1972 by Giedon et al; since then, more than 260 cases have been reported in the medical literature. The prevalence of this condition is estimated at 1–2 per million (Orphanet.net), but it might be underrated. CRMO primarily affects young girls with a female-to-male ratio of 4:1, and the mean age of onset is 10 years; the mean time from symptoms onset to diagnosis is 18 months, ranging from a few weeks to a few years.

CRMO may manifest only as multifocal bone lesions, but it is frequently associated with other inflammatory conditions, including peripheral arthritis, sacroiliitis, psoriasis, pustulosis palmaris et plantaris, pyoderma gangrenosum, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), severe acne, Sweet syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, and Takayasu's arteritis. Individual bone lesions may be asymptomatic, but they typically cause swelling, warmth, and often a dramatic degree of pain that interferes with physical function and psychosocial health, ultimately impairing the quality of life of the patient.

CRMO is widely believed to represent the pediatric equivalent of Synovitis, Acne, Pustulosis, Hyperostosis, Osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome, originally described in 1987 by Chamot et al.

### Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) - advancing the diagnosis [^115ZCJq9]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Whole body MRI has been described as being helpful in reaching the diagnosis. Out of the 41 patients, 37 (90%) were evaluated with MRI, 30 with whole body MRI and 7 with localized imaging. In total, 162 lesions were detected. Of the 162 lesions identified by imaging, 47 (29%) were asymptomatic and detected only by MRI. Unifocal involvement was observed in the clavicle (6 patients), mandible (1 patient), tibia (1 patient), and femur (1 patient). Thirty-two spinal lesions were detected in 13 patients; 6 of these had only one spinal lesion with other lesions elsewhere. Two patients only had spinal involvement, but both of these had more than one lesion, and neither was evaluated by whole body MRI (therefore, silent lesions may have been present but undetected).

- **Patient treatment details**: Twenty-two patients (54%) received at least one course of intravenous antibiotics before the diagnosis was made. Fourteen (34%) patients did not require therapy other than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Three patients were treated with corticosteroids, but none of them reported associated improvement. Six patients with pain resistant to treatment with NSAIDs were treated with methotrexate; two patients made no response, four patients went into remission but two of them relapsed on follow-up. One patient was treated with sulfasalazine and responded well, remaining clinically asymptomatic after four years on treatment; however, repeat MRI showed four new lesions in this patient.

### Proceedings of the 31st European Paediatric Rheumatology Congress: Part 1 [^117Q5do4]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a rare autoinflammatory disease of the bone that can be sporadic or occur as part of monogenic conditions. This study aimed to investigate the demographic, clinical, and laboratory profile, as well as the treatment of CRMO in children.

The research was a retrospective case record study in which seven patients were diagnosed and treated for CRMO between 2020 and 2023 at a tertiary care center. Clinical features, investigations, and treatment records were reviewed. CRMO was diagnosed based on the history of insidious onset of bone pain or swelling and the presence of radiologic evidence of multiple osteolytic lesions in the long bones. The Jansson or Bristol criteria were used for case classification.

Over a three-year period, seven patients were diagnosed with CRMO, with six being girls and one boy. The median age at symptom onset was 9 years (range: 3 months to 12 years), and the median age at diagnosis was also 9 years. The median time from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 12 months (range: 1 month to 4 years). Pain, with or without swelling, was the most common symptom. One out of the seven children presented with low-grade fever. The femur was the most commonly involved bone, affected in 4 out of 7 children. MRI was performed in 6 of the 7 children.

### Successful treatment of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis with indomethacin: a preliminary report of five cases [^116CoASF]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a disease affecting children and young adults. Clinically, it is characterized by the insidious onset of local pain and swelling in affected bones. The disease progresses through intermittent periods of exacerbation and remission, affecting successive bones. The pathogenesis of CRMO remains unknown, although it may be caused by an autoinflammatory disorder leading to bone inflammation. Radiologically, CRMO lesions are characterized by multiple lucencies surrounded by defined zones of patchy but dense sclerosis, cortical thickening from periosteal new bone formation, and increased bone size with different bones involved.

Multiple therapeutic regimens have shown only partial or temporary responses. Since indomethacin has been successfully used to inhibit ossification and inflammatory processes, we initiated therapy with indomethacin in patients with CRMO. We report on the cases of five patients who responded dramatically to treatment with indomethacin. All patients underwent progressive clinical improvement, with a mean duration of 2.8 months. Radiological lesions disappeared following a mean period of 10.5 months. In one case, where treatment was started late, small osteolytic zones persisted but had no clinical consequences. There were no additional recurrences or new bones affected during a mean follow-up period of four years. Our observation indicates that indomethacin may be an effective treatment for CRMO.

### Quality of life in adult patients with SAPHO syndrome and chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis, and comparison to chronic rheumatic and inflammatory diseases [^113QwaqW]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

The health effects of SAPHO syndrome and chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) have not been well studied. We assessed health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in adults with SAPHO-CNO and performed a review of EQ-5D outcomes amongst similar chronic rheumatic and inflammatory diseases.

- **Methods**: We enrolled patients in the first US-based SAPHO-CNO prospective registry and assessed their HRQOL using the EQ-5D index and EQ-5D VAS. A focused scoping review was performed of EQ-5D related outcomes amongst disease cohorts with phenotypic similarities to SAPHO-CNO.

- **Results**: In the 138 SAPHO-CNO participants, the mean age (standard deviation) was 37.7 (15.0) years, with a mean disease duration of 6.4 (6.2) years. All subjects had musculoskeletal involvement, with 44% having spine involvement, and 48% had skin involvement. The mean EQ-5D-5L index value was 0.75 (0.16), and the mean EQ-VAS was 63.0 (21.0). Most patients were impacted by pain/discomfort (86%), difficulty in carrying out usual activities (65%), and anxiety/depression (54%); over one-third reported problems in all five EQ-5D domains. These SAPHO-CNO adults had similarly reduced EQ-5D and VAS values, and a similar high proportion of perceived problems, as other inflammatory disease cohorts.

- **Conclusion**: The HRQOL among adults with SAPHO-CNO is low, with more than half of patients experiencing an impact in perceived pain, performing usual activities, and feelings of anxiety or depression. Future therapies should target the multi-dimensional nature of SAPHO-CNO, focusing on HRQOL as a major outcome.

### Local genetic sex differences in quantitative traits [^1154dNu2]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

Early twin-based studies of genetic differences in heritability found few traits to be sexually dimorphic. However, as GWAS sample sizes increase and some traits become saturated with genetic associations, an opportunity arises for sex-stratified analyses of common variants. Consequently, a recent large-scale analysis of hundreds of traits has found widespread, if small, differences across the genome. Some traits, however, are particularly dimorphic, such as waist-to-hip ratio and testosterone.

Many studies of genetic sex differences focus on r_g, global and h² global estimates, or manually compare the presence and absence of significant loci. Such approaches may work well for traits with genome-wide sex differences but may miss traits with localized ones. Indeed, we found that 70% of traits for which LDSC estimates an r_g, global close to one, have at least one locus with an r_g, local different from one. Moreover, many of these had loci with negative r_g, local, which is rarely observed on a global level. This shows that r_g, global differences between the sexes are not evenly distributed across the genome; rather, loci of varying r_g, local values, some in opposite directions, combine to produce genome-wide correlations. This is particularly evident for testosterone, which has an r_g, global of zero but several negative and positive r_g, local values.

### Chronic osteomyelitis with proliferative periostitis of the mandible in a child: Report of a case managed by immunosuppressive treatment [^113zHr5K]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Osteomyelitis with proliferative periostitis is a relatively uncommon inflammatory condition of the jaws, mainly characterized by periosteal formation of reactive bone. It primarily affects children and adolescents and is also referred to as Garre's osteomyelitis, more frequently involving the molar region of the mandible. Cases lacking an obvious source of infection may have an immunologically mediated etiopathogenesis, falling under the spectrum of primary chronic osteomyelitis or chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO).

Herein, we present a case of chronic osteomyelitis in a 6.5-year-old girl who suffered from painful episodes of swelling of the mandible for the last 2 years, previously requiring hospitalization and administration of intravenous (IV) antibiotics and NSAIDs with limited responsiveness. The biopsy showed features consistent with osteomyelitis with proliferative periostitis. The patient was initially managed with an IV combination antibiotic regimen with only partial improvement. The possibility of an autoimmune mechanism in the context of primary chronic osteomyelitis or CRMO was considered, and immunosuppressive therapy (TNF inhibitor etanercept along with corticosteroids and methotrexate) was administered, resulting in clinical resolution.

Osteomyelitis and its childhood variants are relatively rare, and their management presents several challenges. Although typically treated with the administration of antibiotics, possibly along with surgical intervention, other treatment modalities may be necessary.

The lack of awareness about CRMO leads to enormous emotional, physical, and financial burdens on patients and their families. Persistent delays in diagnosis and treatment can lead to permanent damage. These delays are likely conservative compared to those experienced by children living far from specialized pediatric care. Increasing disease awareness amongst general pediatricians, pediatric subspecialists, orthopedists, and radiologists is critically needed.

### Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis demonstrated by Tc-99m methylene diphosphonate bone scan [^117AcPiq]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

A 12-year-old Middle Eastern girl presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, and intermittent pain in both thighs. Initially suspected of having Crohn's disease, this diagnosis was excluded after an extensive gastroenterological evaluation. While plain X-rays of the femora were normal, the initial Tc-99m methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scan revealed several foci with increased activity in both femurs. An MR scan showed excessive periosteal inflammation and mild intramedullary changes in both femurs. A percutaneous bone biopsy demonstrated changes consistent with chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO). The patient's symptoms disappeared spontaneously, only to reappear 1.5 years later, prompting a new MDP bone scan that showed normal findings.

### Unusual case of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis [^115U4NYQ]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Recently, research on new biomarkers for CRMO diagnosis and monitoring CRMO progression has been conducted by Hofmann et al. It showed that some changes in interleukin levels (IL-6, IL-12, eotaxin, and others) were significantly altered during the CRMO disease course, suggesting they could potentially be used as CRMO activity markers. In our opinion, these biomarkers would be especially useful in unusual cases with atypical clinical courses, when some monitoring tools, for instance, the PedsCNO score, are difficult to apply objectively.

### Pediatric patients with a dual diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease and chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis [^114GeRbj]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of information about the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of patients with a dual diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO). A retrospective chart review was performed of patients at McMaster Children's Hospital with a diagnosis of either IBD or CRMO to identify those with the dual diagnosis over a 10-year period. A dual diagnosis was identified in seven patients.

Most patients (6/7) had a diagnosis of IBD first and were subsequently diagnosed with CRMO. At the time of CRMO diagnosis, IBD treatment regimens included one or more of the following: sulfasalazine (1/6), infliximab (3/6), adalimumab (1/6), or no treatment (1/6). Although the etiology of the link remains unknown, there does not seem to be an association with a specific IBD subtype, age, or treatment. Our patient population demonstrated a response to biologic agents, specifically tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors, as treatment for both conditions.

### Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) and synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome with associated neutrophilic dermatoses: a report of seven cases and review of the literature [^113EwBk1]. Pediatric Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

A growing body of literature has identified the association between neutrophilic dermatoses and multifocal, aseptic bone lesions in children, termed chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO). Classically, patients present with swelling, pain, and impaired mobility of the affected area, with skin lesions developing concurrently or in the future. Bone biopsy reveals inflammatory changes consistent with infectious osteomyelitis, but cultures and histologic staining invariably fail to identify an infectious source. Patients are refractory to antibiotic therapy but dramatically respond to systemic steroids and may need to be maintained on low-dose steroids to prevent relapse. Numerous authors have suggested that CRMO and synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome lie along the same clinical spectrum. In fact, some believe that CRMO is the pediatric presentation of SAPHO. The two syndromes share numerous characteristics, including osteitis, a unifocal or multifocal presentation, hyperostosis, and pustulosis, which all occur in a generally healthy individual. Our seven patients, five of whom were diagnosed with CRMO and two of whom were diagnosed with SAPHO syndrome, further strengthen the idea that CRMO and SAPHO syndrome do indeed lie along the same clinical spectrum. In addition, we include two rare cases of pediatric Sweet's syndrome with evidence of pathergy.

### Sonata [^116duGXF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

- **Drug abuse and dependence**: Sonata is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by federal regulation.

- **Abuse, dependence, and tolerance**: Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Abuse is characterized by the misuse of the drug for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Physical dependence is a state of adaptation manifested by a specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood levels of the drug, and/or administration of an antagonist. Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug's effects over time. Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects.

- **Addiction**: Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiological disease with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. Drug addiction is a treatable disease utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common.

Two studies assessed the abuse liability of Sonata at doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg in subjects with known histories of sedative drug abuse. The results of these studies indicate that Sonata has an abuse potential similar to benzodiazepines.

### Autoinflammatory bone disorders with special focus on chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) [^1123p6Yd]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Genetically determined chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) has been reported in animals that function as disease models, helping to understand the molecular requirements and immunological patterns of bone inflammation. Severe chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) with systemic inflammation occurs in mice with mutations in the proline serine threonine interacting protein 2 (PSTPIP2) gene. Two strains have been reported: chronic multifocal osteomyelitis (CMO) mice carry a spontaneous mutation in PSTPIP2 (p.L98P), while in lupo mice, a PSTPIP2 mutation was chemically induced (p. I282N). Both mice develop phenotypes similar to severe human CRMO with multiple sites of bone inflammation.

Since both total (in CMO mice) and partial (in lupo mice) PSTPIP2 deficiency result in a pro-inflammatory phenotype, PSTPIP2 has been suggested to exert anti-inflammatory functions. Unlike most human CRMO patients, CMO and lupo mice exhibit additional signs of systemic inflammation, including hepatosplenomegaly, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and elevated serum inflammatory parameters: macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha (MIP-1a), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (RANKL), both osteoclastogenic factors, interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and IL-6. Cross-breeding with RAG−/− mice demonstrated disease expression independent from adaptive immune cells. Macrophage depletion or treatment with inhibitors of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor (c-FMS) decreased circulating MIP-1a and diminished extramedullary hematopoiesis and inflammation. Furthermore, osteoclast precursor cells in CRMO-prone mice exhibit increased osteoclastogenesis in vitro. This suggests that cytokine imbalance in CRMO-prone mice drives osteoclast generation and activation.

Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) is a rare autoinflammatory bone disease that mainly affects children and young individuals. It is characterized by bone pain and reduced function. The pathophysiology of CNO is incompletely understood, and there are no licensed treatments, diagnostic criteria, or outcome measures available.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this study was to explore and compare the experiences of patients, their families, and clinicians with CNO, focusing on its diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, opinions on research priorities were explored.

- **Methods**: In 2020, questionnaires were designed to capture the patient (20 items) and clinician (24 items) experiences with the diagnosis and treatment of CNO and to explore research priorities. These questionnaires were circulated internationally in 2021 using Google Forms among patients and families through the CNO Facebook group. They were also shared by other patient groups on Twitter, including fight_CRMO, and the mailing list from the CRMO Foundation, and among clinicians historically involved in CNO research and participating in international working groups on diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

- **Results**: We received 93 responses to the patient questionnaire; 23% were from young people affected by CNO, and 77% were from parents or carers on behalf of the young person they care for. There were 21 responses (out of 27 contacted) from clinicians. The median time taken for the patient group to receive a diagnosis was 6 months (mean: 14 months), which matched the clinician perspective that estimated a diagnosis after 6 months.

### Proceedings of the 29th European paediatric rheumatology congress [^113dFeLk]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Diagnosing CRMO requires the exclusion of serious and similarly-presenting pathologies, and a multi-specialty approach is essential. This is supported by the inverse correlation between the number of specialty teams involved and the time to diagnosis in this series. The median time from symptom onset to diagnosis in our report is shorter than previously reported, with a greater proportion referred directly to paediatric rheumatology. This may reflect an increasing awareness of this rare but important condition. Long bone metaphyses were the most frequent site of disease. The pelvis was over-represented in our patient population in comparison to other patient series. Paediatric rheumatologists caring for children with CRMO should be mindful of the often protracted and complicated journey prior to arrival in their care.

### A clinico-radiological review of chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis in paediatrics, adolescents, and adults: Demystifying a forgotten differential [^114i89ko]. Clinical Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO), also known as non-bacterial osteitis, is a chronic autoinflammatory disease of unknown aetiology that primarily occurs in the paediatric population, although rare cases of adult-onset disease also exist. CNO has non-specific clinical and radiological presentations, with affected individuals often presenting with bone pain of insidious onset secondary to sterile bony inflammation. This can be associated with swelling, focal tenderness, and warmth at the affected sites. The pattern of bony involvement appears to be dependent on the age of onset: adults frequently have axial skeletal lesions, while children and adolescents are often affected in the appendicular skeletal sites.

CNO is a diagnosis of exclusion, heavily relying on imaging to identify and characterise bony lesions and to exclude diseases that can mimic CNO. Magnetic resonance imaging is often the reference standard, with biochemical and histopathological findings serving as complementary methods. Although combining imaging methods can facilitate the diagnosis, a single technique could be sufficient depending on the clinical picture. Given the relatively rare incidence of CNO, limited awareness of the disease among care providers, and its similarity in clinical and radiological presentation to various bony diseases, there are often long delays in diagnosis. Adults are more unfavourably affected compared to paediatrics and adolescents.

This review of CNO will describe the condition, overview its clinical presentation, and highlight its radiological features.

### Challenges in the imaging and diagnosis of chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) [^113vCCRR]. Clinical Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) is a benign skeletal disorder of childhood and adolescence characterized by sterile bone inflammation that results in chronic, insidious bone pain. Although it is increasingly recognized, many challenges remain in its diagnosis, with patients waiting 15–24 months for diagnosis from the time of symptom onset. Prompt identification and treatment are key to reducing morbidity from CNO, which affects school attendance and can result in chronic limb or spine deformities. Identifying its imaging features, particularly its characteristic lesion distribution on whole-body MRI, remains key to diagnosis. Image-guided biopsy is also required in many cases, particularly those with clinical uncertainty around the diagnosis.

We present a review of the challenges encountered in the diagnosis of CNO from a critical appraisal of the literature and our experience as a national pediatric sarcoma, rheumatology, and orthopedic center. This review aims to inform radiology colleagues involved in the evaluation of potential CNO patients by discussing its imaging appearances, typical MRI phenotypes, potential mimics, and the role of image-guided biopsy.

### Clinical and therapeutic diversity in adult chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) of the sternocostoclavicular region: a meta-analysis [^112BjL7B]. Rheumatology (2023). Low credibility.

This review illustrates that chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) of the sternocostoclavicular region (SCCH), as a subtype of CNO, is insufficiently defined in current medical literature, with cases identified under various names and classifications. Chinese, Italian, and French studies refer to this condition as SAPHO syndrome, Japanese studies use PAO, while Dutch and Scandinavian research typically employs the term CNO/SCCH. Variability in clinical, biochemical, histopathological, and imaging characteristics, along with differing treatment modalities and effects, complicates the collective interpretation of data. This diversity significantly hampers understanding of CNO/SCCH, as reflected in the statistical pooling of data.

Notably, a mean diagnostic delay of 5.3 years was observed, irrespective of whether CNO/SCCH was identified as a manifestation of SAPHO or PAO, or as an independent entity. This delay may not be entirely attributable to a lack of diagnostic criteria, since such criteria exist for SAPHO syndrome. Nevertheless, this substantial delay is concerning, given its association with irreversible tissue damage and diminished quality of life (QoL). According to our data, the primary obstacle to swift diagnosis is the non-specific presentation of CNO/SCCH. Symptoms such as pain in the anterior chest wall and shoulder have been attributed to a range of alternative diagnoses, many of which are self-limiting and do not warrant referral, especially given the relatively young age of presentation.

The co-occurrence of pustulosis, a highly specific manifestation found in 53% of cases, should theoretically suggest a diagnosis of CNO/SCCH. However, it is known that osteoarticular manifestations can vary, complicating the diagnostic process.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is an autoinflammatory bone disease seen in the pediatric population. Delayed diagnosis may result in unnecessary admissions, futile treatment for different pathologies, and failure to treat symptoms that impact quality of life.

- **Objectives**: To describe the journey to diagnosis for children with CRMO at our tertiary pediatric rheumatology center, examining their demographics and comparing them to the literature.

- **Methods**: The electronic medical records of children (< 16 years) with a diagnosis of CRMO currently under the care of the pediatric rheumatology team at Cambridge University Hospitals were included in the review.

- **Results**: Seventeen children were identified, and 82% were female. The median age at symptom onset was 9 years (range 4–15), and the median age at diagnosis was 10 years (range 5–14). All patients were seen by pediatric rheumatology, 59% by orthopedics, 41% by pediatric oncology, 35% by general pediatrics, and 6% by neurosurgery. Two children with psoriasis or pustular skin conditions were seen by dermatology. Prior to the diagnosis of CRMO, 18% of children received a diagnosis of an infective pathology. Langerhans cell histiocytosis was the suspected or working diagnosis in 12%, and sarcoma in 12%.

Clinical appearance, imaging study, histopathologic, and biomarker findings are similar in pediatric and adult patients diagnosed with CRMO/CNO or SAPHO syndrome in our study, indicating that CRMO/CNO and SAPHO syndrome might be variant phenotypes of the same entity. The discovery of the spondylarthropathic subtype in CNO patients could prompt anti-TNF therapy. Diagnostic and treatment strategies in pediatric and adult patients vary considerably, pointing to the need for validated guidelines.

### Variability in phenotype and response to treatment in chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis; the Irish experience of a national cohort [^114uACMC]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis is a rare autoinflammatory condition (OMIM 259680) affecting bone, with an estimated prevalence of 1 per 10⁵ –10⁶. It is characterized by relapsing episodes of localized bone pain, presenting as pain, swelling, or loss of function. Although the disease can occur at any site, it predominantly affects the metaphyses of long bones, clavicles, vertebrae, and pelvis. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation with characteristic radiological findings, often supported by histological findings that exclude malignancy and infection. Long-term sequelae include leg-length discrepancy due to growth plate involvement and scoliosis secondary to vertebral body involvement.

CNO is clinically heterogeneous and variably associated with other autoinflammatory conditions, with significant variation in incidence between different cohorts. It remains unclear whether the different phenotypes of the disease respond differently to treatment. First-line treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has a reported response rate of 50–80%. Second-line treatments include bisphosphonates, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), corticosteroids, and biologic agents. However, there are no randomized controlled trials at the time of writing comparing their relative efficacy in children. Consensus treatment guidelines have recently been produced by CARRA, prior to which second-line treatment was based on expert opinion.

The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients who attended tertiary pediatric rheumatology services in Ireland.

### Two phenotypes of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis with different patterns of bone involvement [^114VoedX]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is an autoinflammatory bone disorder with predominantly pediatric onset. Children present with multifocal osteolytic lesions accompanied by bone pain and soft tissue swelling. Patients often exhibit extraosseous co-morbidities such as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and arthritis.

- **Objectives**: Comparison of children with two different phenotypes of CRMO defined by the presence or absence of extraosseous co-morbidities.

- **Methods**: Children diagnosed with CRMO at the Motol University Hospital between 2010 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed and, according to the absence or presence of extraosseous manifestations, divided into two cohorts: bone-limited CRMO and complex CRMO. The two groups were compared in terms of demographic data, age at disease onset, number and site of bone lesions, laboratory biomarker values, and need for escalation to a second-line therapy.

- **Results**: Thirty-seven children (30 female, 7 male) with confirmed CRMO were included in the analysis. The mean age at disease onset was 10 years. All but 3 patients presented with multifocal disease. Twenty-three children (62%) had at least one extraosseous manifestation (13 sacroiliitis, 8 inflammatory bowel disease, 6 skin diseases [acne, pustulosis, or psoriasis], 7 arthritis). Complex CRMO was associated with a significantly higher ESR rate (p = 0.0064) and CRP level (p = 0.018). The groups did not differ in the number of foci or in the age at disease onset. Bone lesion distribution differed between the two groups with significantly more frequent involvement.

### Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) - advancing the diagnosis [^1142QJLe]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Twelve children were without biopsy at referral, of whom nine did not require a biopsy for diagnosis. Using these criteria for diagnosis provides a framework for avoiding biopsy in children with typical disease; however, these criteria cannot be validated by this retrospective audit, as the clinicians and/or radiologist may have been aware of a biopsy report when making the diagnosis. It is very straightforward to declare the MRI findings as 'typical' for CRMO while holding a bone marrow report with suggestive features. The clinical vignette and available imaging would need to be shown to a blinded audience in order to validate these criteria objectively.

### The multifaceted presentation of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis: a series of 486 cases from the Eurofever international registry [^111usZMi]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) or chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is an autoinflammatory disorder characterized by sterile bone osteolytic lesions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the demographic data and clinical, instrumental, and therapeutic features at baseline in a large series of CNO/CRMO patients enrolled in the Eurofever registry.

A web-based registry collected retrospective data on patients affected by CRMO/CNO. Both pediatric and adult centers were involved.

Complete baseline information on 486 patients was available: 176 male and 310 female. The mean age of onset was 9.9 years, with adult onset (> 18 years of age) observed in 31 (6.3%) patients. The mean time from disease onset to final diagnosis was 1 year (range 0–15). MRI was performed at baseline in 426 patients (88%), revealing a mean number of 4.1 lesions. More frequent manifestations not directly related to bone involvement included:

- **Other manifestations**:
	- Myalgia (12%)
	- **Mucocutaneous manifestations**: 5% acne, 5% palmoplantar pustulosis, 4% psoriasis, 3% papulopustular lesions, 2% urticarial rash
	- Gastrointestinal symptoms (8%)

A total of 361 patients were treated with NSAIDs, 112 with glucocorticoids, 61 with bisphosphonates, 58 with MTX, 47 with SSZ, 26 with anti-TNF, and 4 with anakinra, with a variable response.

This is the largest reported case series of CNO patients, showing that the range of associated clinical manifestations is rather heterogeneous. The study confirms that the disease usually presents with an early teenage onset.
