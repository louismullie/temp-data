## Question

High vagal tone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about high vagal tone, including its definition, mechanisms, measurement, modifiers, benefits, risks, and clinical implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and the neuroanatomy that underpins vagal control. Then, I should verify the physiological mechanisms and how they differ from simple heart rate variability. Next, I will review validated measurement approaches and their limitations. After that, I need to examine factors that increase or decrease vagal tone and the evidence base for each. Then, I will weigh health benefits against potential harms, including arrhythmias and bradycardia. Finally, I will translate this into clinical implications, including when to intervene, how to modulate vagal tone safely, and how to counsel patients, while double-checking areas of controversy and correcting any overstatements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and neuroanatomy. High vagal tone refers to elevated parasympathetic efferent activity from the vagus nerve, particularly its myelinated ventral vagal fibers originating in the nucleus ambiguus that project to the sinoatrial node and exert a tonic inhibitory "brake" on heart rate, with additional projections to the atrioventricular node, ventricular myocardium, and multiple viscera including the gut, thereby shaping cardiac chronotropy, dromotropy, and gastrointestinal motility [^111SocLm] [^115vHHs8]. Hold on, I should verify the cardiac control hierarchy: the ventral vagal pathway to the heart is the primary source of beat-to-beat chronotropic control, while the dorsal motor nucleus contributes to metabolic and contractile modulation, including ventricular effects, which aligns with experimental data showing DVMN involvement in exercise capacity and cardiac contractility [^112EFnaP].

> Now, I need to check the physiological mechanisms. The ventral vagal brake maintains resting heart rate below the intrinsic sinus rate by releasing acetylcholine at cardiac ganglia, activating muscarinic receptors, and hyperpolarizing sinoatrial nodal cells, while respiratory gating produces respiratory sinus arrhythmia, which is a marker of vagal modulation rather than a direct measure of tonic vagal activity per se [^111ZABBw] [^116gXisd]. Wait, let me verify the relationship between RSA and vagal tone: although RSA amplitude tracks vagal modulation, recent expert consensus cautions that RSA should not be equated with vagal tone because RSA magnitude is also shaped by heart rate and respiratory–circulatory coupling dynamics, so I should avoid overinterpreting RSA as a pure index of tonic vagal activity [^116gXisd]. I should also confirm the anti-inflammatory pathway: efferent vagal signaling via the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway can inhibit cytokine production via α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on macrophages, linking vagal tone to immune modulation and potentially to cardiovascular outcomes [^114pX8zk] [^114vBDhV].

> Next, I should review how we measure vagal tone. High-frequency heart rate variability is the most widely used noninvasive surrogate of cardiac vagal modulation, but it has limited temporal resolution and can be confounded by recording length and respiratory pattern, so short epochs may misestimate vagal activity [^117SfsgT]. Let me consider alternatives: the cardiac vagal tone index provides higher temporal resolution and has been validated against pharmacologic blockade, while vagal efficiency quantifies the dynamic coupling between RSA and heart period during physiological challenges, indexing the functional impact of vagal efferents on cardiac chronotropy [^115XvvYi] [^116vQFv6]. I should double-check that no current noninvasive metric perfectly captures global vagal tone across organs, so cardiac indices remain proxies rather than direct whole-body measures [^11759dk8].

> I will now examine factors that increase vagal tone. Aerobic fitness and endurance training are consistently associated with higher resting vagal modulation and lower resting heart rate, though the magnitude of true vagal tone enhancement versus intrinsic sinus node remodeling remains debated, and some data suggest intrinsic pacemaker changes contribute substantially to athlete bradycardia [^112EFnaP] [^113bF7ix]. Let me verify lifestyle effects: slow, deep breathing, meditation, and yoga practices increase high-frequency HRV and likely augment vagal outflow, while healthy lifestyle clusters over time track with higher vagally mediated HRV, supporting a causal role for behaviors in enhancing vagal function [^1118DMB3] [^117TpSbo]. I should confirm neuromodulation: noninvasive transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation acutely increases vagal activity and has improved exercise capacity and reduced inflammatory signaling in randomized trials, indicating modifiable vagal tone in humans [^117FJXmM] [^115C2T6g]. But wait, what about diet and supplements? Observational and interventional data suggest omega-3 fatty acids may increase vagal tone, though high-dose pharmaceutical omega-3 has been linked to increased atrial fibrillation risk, so dose and context matter [^115i5oYT].

> Next, I should review factors that decrease vagal tone. Chronic stress, anxiety, and depression are associated with reduced vagal modulation and lower high-frequency HRV, consistent with a sympathovagal imbalance model linking affective dysregulation to autonomic dysfunction and adverse health outcomes [^116KTGu2] [^115RHuUr]. Hold on, I should verify metabolic contributors: obesity and insulin resistance correlate with blunted vagal afferent signaling and reduced HRV, and hypercaloric diets impair vagal afferent excitability and satiety signaling, contributing to dysmotility and energy dysregulation [^113joUyp] [^114b14L1]. I need to ensure I include disease states: heart failure, inflammatory bowel disease, and functional gastrointestinal disorders frequently exhibit low vagal tone, and critical illness disrupts the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex, all of which may worsen outcomes and inflammation [^116opYG6] [^115vHHs8] [^113Nqf2D].

> Let me consider the health benefits of higher vagal tone. Cardiovascular advantages include lower resting heart rate, improved baroreflex sensitivity, and reduced all-cause mortality, with higher HRV predicting better outcomes in population studies and vagal augmentation strategies attenuating heart failure progression in preclinical models [^117B3RJ2] [^113SxouM]. I should confirm anti-inflammatory effects: vagal efferent signaling can suppress proinflammatory cytokines and has been linked to improved myocardial metabolism and reduced apoptosis, suggesting a cardioprotective immunomodulatory role [^111BfBpU]. For exercise performance, optogenetic and translational data indicate that recruiting cardiac vagal neurons enhances contractility and endurance, and noninvasive tVNS improved VO2 peak in healthy volunteers, supporting a performance benefit via autonomic tuning [^112EFnaP] [^117FJXmM]. I will now examine gastrointestinal and metabolic effects: increasing vagal tone can promote motility and satiety, and vagal afferent signaling integrates nutrient sensing to regulate appetite and glucose homeostasis, offering therapeutic leverage in obesity and diabetes [^115C2T6g] [^1111uVtE].

> But wait, I should also weigh potential harms of excessive vagal tone. High vagal tone can precipitate bradyarrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia, high-grade atrioventricular block, and vasovagal syncope, particularly during sleep or rest when vagal activity peaks, and these phenomena are well described in athletes and during nocturnal monitoring [^115rQU1W] [^117HR1JK]. Hold on, I should verify the atrial fibrillation link: increased vagal tone shortens atrial refractoriness and, in the context of atrial remodeling from endurance training, can facilitate vagally mediated atrial fibrillation, especially at rest or during sleep, with dose–response concerns emerging for supplemental omega-3 as a potential mediator of vagal enhancement [^114Bv3yq] [^115i5oYT]. I need to ensure I mention drug interactions: dexmedetomidine can cause clinically significant bradycardia and sinus arrest, particularly in individuals with high vagal tone or with rapid administration, and labeling recommends preparedness to treat with anticholinergics and supportive measures [^111j5Sv2] [^112pPGQu].

> Next, I should review clinical implications and thresholds for intervention. Asymptomatic bradycardia due to high vagal tone, including nocturnal pauses, generally does not warrant pacing. Management is reassurance and avoidance of precipitants, whereas symptomatic vagally mediated AV block or recurrent syncope may justify therapy if bradycardia is temporally linked to symptoms, with guideline-directed evaluation and shared decision-making emphasized [^115rQU1W] [^117UMhtf]. Let me reconsider modulatory strategies: for patients with low vagal tone and autonomic dysfunction, noninvasive tVNS, HRV biofeedback, and lifestyle interventions can safely enhance vagal function, while for excessive vagal effects such as bradycardia with dexmedetomidine, proactive monitoring and anticholinergic rescue are prudent [^117FJXmM] [^116dYLr1] [^111j5Sv2]. I should confirm that in heart failure and inflammatory states, targeted vagal augmentation is an area of active investigation, with promising signals but ongoing trials needed before routine clinical adoption [^116opYG6] [^111BfBpU].

> I will now examine special populations and controversies. Athletes frequently exhibit high vagal tone and bradycardia, but not all bradycardia is purely vagal; intrinsic sinus node remodeling, including HCN4 channel downregulation via miR-423–5p, contributes to training-induced bradycardia, so I should avoid attributing all athlete bradycardia to autonomic changes alone [^113bF7ix]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially implied that higher vagal tone uniformly predicts better athletic performance; I should qualify that while autonomic tuning can enhance endurance and recovery, extreme training loads can shift balance toward sympathetic predominance, and performance is multifactorial, so vagal tone is supportive but not deterministic [^115hEg9N] [^112EFnaP]. I should also note that sex differences in autonomic regulation exist, with women often showing higher high-frequency HRV and different sympathovagal responses to challenges, which may modulate arrhythmic risk and treatment responses [^114HP2hk].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical counseling is grounded in evidence. For patients seeking to enhance vagal tone safely, I recommend regular moderate aerobic exercise, slow deep breathing or HRV biofeedback, mindfulness or yoga-based practices, adequate sleep, and anti-inflammatory nutrition patterns, while monitoring for adverse cardiac symptoms and tailoring intensity to comorbidities and medications that may potentiate bradycardia [^117TpSbo] [^1118DMB3] [^116dYLr1]. Hold on, I should verify that these strategies align with measured outcomes: randomized and longitudinal data support improvements in HRV and vagal indices with these interventions, and noninvasive tVNS offers a promising, low-risk adjunct in selected patients under medical supervision [^1118DMB3] [^115qLnq6]. If symptoms such as syncope, presyncope, or marked nocturnal bradycardia occur, I should confirm the diagnosis with ambulatory monitoring and guideline-directed testing, and counsel on hydration, positional maneuvers, and medication adjustments to mitigate vagally mediated events [^115rQU1W] [^117HR1JK].

High vagal tone reflects **increased parasympathetic activity** and is linked to lower resting heart rate, higher heart rate variability [^112ZkDQc], and improved autonomic balance [^116opYG6]. It is associated with better cardiovascular health [^111xDhvw], enhanced stress resilience [^111ELKBZ], and improved gastrointestinal motility [^112V8MEZ]. However, **excessive vagal tone** can cause bradycardia, hypotension, or vasovagal syncope [^117HR1JK], and may increase atrial fibrillation risk in athletes [^114Bv3yq]. Vagal tone can be enhanced by aerobic exercise, meditation, deep breathing, and non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation [^114QbAko] [^116opYG6], while medications like beta-blockers and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can modulate it pharmacologically [^113Nqf2D] [^112TGdMe].

## Physiological mechanisms of high vagal tone

The vagus nerve is a **mixed cranial nerve** [^115vHHs8] with extensive sensory and motor projections to the heart, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. High vagal tone reflects increased parasympathetic outflow, which slows heart rate, lowers blood pressure, and enhances gastrointestinal motility [^111SocLm].

---

### Cardiovascular effects

- **Heart rate**: High vagal tone increases acetylcholine release at the sinoatrial node, slowing heart rate and increasing heart rate variability (HRV) [^112ZkDQc] [^111ZABBw].
- **Blood pressure**: Vagal activation reduces sympathetic tone, lowering blood pressure and improving baroreflex sensitivity [^111ZABBw].
- **Arrhythmias**: Excessive vagal tone can precipitate bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and vasovagal syncope [^117HR1JK].

---

### Gastrointestinal effects

High vagal tone **enhances gastrointestinal motility** [^115vHHs8] and secretion, promoting efficient digestion and nutrient absorption [^notfound].

---

### Immune modulation

The vagus nerve modulates inflammation via the **cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway** [^11296Dx4], reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and promoting immune homeostasis [^116KTGu2].

## Factors influencing vagal tone

Several factors influence **vagal tone**:

- **Aerobic exercise**: Regular aerobic exercise increases vagal tone and HRV [^111xDhvw].
- **Meditation and mindfulness**: These practices enhance vagal tone and autonomic balance [^114QbAko].
- **Deep breathing**: Slow, deep breathing stimulates the vagus nerve, increasing vagal tone [^111Eom7H].

---

## Measurement of vagal tone

Vagal tone is commonly assessed using **heart rate variability (HRV)** [^112ZkDQc] metrics, including high-frequency (HF) power, root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), and the vagal efficiency index [^116vQFv6]. Non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) and baroreflex sensitivity tests are also used [^115C2T6g] [^116UTh7T].

---

- **Meditation and mindfulness**: These practices enhance vagal tone and autonomic balance [^114QbAko].
- **Deep breathing**: Slow, deep breathing stimulates the vagus nerve, increasing vagal tone [^111Eom7H].
- **Non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS)**: tVNS has been shown to improve vagal tone and autonomic balance [^116opYG6].
- **Pharmacological interventions**: Beta-blockers and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can modulate vagal tone [^113Nqf2D] [^112TGdMe].

### Vagal nerve activity as a moderator of brain-immune relationships [^111ELKBZ]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2013). Low credibility.

We investigated whether vagal tone, as assessed by heart rate variability (HRV), moderates the neural correlates of immune and physiological responses to acute stress. Participants with low and high baseline HRV underwent a reversal learning task as an acute stressor. Natural killer cells, norepinephrine, and adrenocorticotropic hormone in peripheral blood changed with acute stress in the high HRV group only. Activity in the prefrontal cortex and striatum correlated with the immune and physiological indices in the high HRV group. High vagal tone may reflect more flexible top-down brain regulation of immune and physiological activity.

### A neuroanatomical basis for electroacupuncture to drive the vagal-adrenal axis [^115EVz36]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Somatosensory autonomic reflexes allow electroacupuncture stimulation (ES) to modulate body physiology at distant sites 1–6 (for example, suppressing severe systemic inflammation 6–9). Since the 1970s, an emerging organizational rule about these reflexes has been the presence of body-region specificity 1–6. For example, ES at the hindlimb ST36 acupoint but not the abdominal ST25 acupoint can drive the vagal-adrenal anti-inflammatory axis in mice 10,11. The neuroanatomical basis of this somatotopic organization is, however, unknown. Here we show that PROKR2 Cre -marked sensory neurons, which innervate the deep hindlimb fascia (for example, the periosteum) but not abdominal fascia (for example, the peritoneum), are crucial for driving the vagal-adrenal axis. Low-intensity ES at the ST36 site in mice with ablated PROKR2 Cre -marked sensory neurons failed to activate hindbrain vagal efferent neurons or to drive catecholamine release from adrenal glands. As a result, ES no longer suppressed systemic inflammation induced by bacterial endotoxins. By contrast, spinal sympathetic reflexes evoked by high-intensity ES at both ST25 and ST36 sites were unaffected. We also show that optogenetic stimulation of PROKR2 Cre -marked nerve terminals through the ST36 site is sufficient to drive the vagal-adrenal axis but not sympathetic reflexes. Furthermore, the distribution patterns of PROKR2 Cre nerve fibres can retrospectively predict body regions at which low-intensity ES will or will not effectively produce anti-inflammatory effects. Our studies provide a neuroanatomical basis for the selectivity and specificity of acupoints in driving specific autonomic pathways.

### Cholinesterase inhibitors: cardioprotection in Alzheimer's disease [^112TGdMe]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease is a life shortening disease, and the lack of disease modifying therapy implies a huge impact on life expectancy as well as an outgrowing financial and socioeconomic burden. Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) represent the first line symptomatic therapy, whose benefit to harm ratio is still a matter of debate. Acetylcholinesterase enzyme is a core interest for pharmacological and toxicological research to unmask the fine balance between therapeutic drug efficacy, tolerability, safety, and detrimental effects up to adverse drug reaction. So far, a body of evidence advocated that an increased vagal tone was associated to an increased risk of gastrointestinal and cardiac side effects (negative chronotropic, arrhytmogenic, hypotensive effects), able to hamper ChEIs effects on cognition, reducing administration feasibility and compliance, especially in older and comorbid patients. Conversely, a growing body of evidence is indicating a protective role of ChEIs on overall cardiovascular mortality in patients with dementia, through a series of in vitro and in vivo investigations. The present review is aimed to report the up to date literature in the controversial field of ChEIs and cardioprotection in dementia, offering a state of the art, which may constitute the conceptual framework to be enlarged in order to build higher evidence. Chronic vagal nerve stimulation acted upon by donepezil might improve long term survival through pharmacological properties apart from cholinesterase inhibition, able to offer cardioprotection, abating the overall cardiovascular risk, and, thus profiling a new line of therapeutic intervention for ChEI drug class.

### Pistachio nut consumption modifies systemic hemodynamics, increases heart rate variability, and reduces ambulatory blood pressure in well-controlled type 2 diabetes: a randomized trial [^114bhXPA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Heart rate variability is also a recognized cardiovascular risk factor, – and we observed improvements in 3 indices of heart rate variability following pistachio consumption: RMSSD, high frequency, and low frequency. Both RMSSD and high frequency reflect vagal tone, and low frequency is believed to reflect both sympathetic and parasympathetic function. In the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities studies, individuals with type 2 diabetes who were in the lowest quartile of either high or low frequency heart rate variability were 50% to 80% more likely to develop coronary heart disease during an 8‐year follow‐up. The effect of pistachios on heart rate variability that we observed in the present study may be a yet unexplored mechanism through which nuts benefit cardiovascular health.

Given that this study utilized a controlled‐feeding protocol with pistachios, we can only speculate which component(s) of pistachios may be responsible for the observed changes. Like all nuts, pistachios have a heart‐healthy fatty acid profile (low in saturated fat, high in unsaturated fat) and are rich in plant protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Pistachios are a source of potassium, magnesium, and phytosterols. Notably, in the present study the ratio of sodium to potassium was substantially lower for the pistachio diet (0.63) than for the control diet (0.81). This difference was due to the high potassium content of pistachios (≈600 mg for 69 g/day for the 2100 calorie level) and the sodium content of the control diet snacks (ie, pretzels, string cheese, etc.) that were replaced by the pistachios (≈500 mg per day for the 2100 calorie diet). It is possible that a single bioactive component of pistachios is responsible for the observed changes in cardiovascular risk factors, but it is more likely that the macro‐ and micronutrient profiles combined contribute to their health benefits.

### Vagal nerve function in obesity: therapeutic implications [^1164TNLH]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The primal need for nutrients is satisfied by mechanisms for sensing internal stores and detecting food; ATP is the most primitive signal. With increasing density of sensory neurons and glia (the primordial brain) and the emergence of autonomic neural activity throughout the endoderm, transmitters and other signaling molecules enable alimentation before the appearance of innate storage functions. Memory and, ultimately, cognition are prerequisites for processing and producing food to facilitate assimilation and safeguard the supply of nutrients. The gut-brain-gut axis via the vagus nerve is the autonomic neurohumoral pathway integrating these elements of energy homeostasis. Humans uniquely override obligate nutrient needs, eating in the absence of deprivation, resulting in pathological chronic overnutrition arising from dysautonomia. Obesity surgery circumvents powerful redundant mechanisms of alimentation and reduces excess stores of body fat from chronic overnutrition while preventing re-accumulation of fat. All bariatric operations, whether purely restrictive, maldigestive and malabsorptive, or combinations, rely on regulatory mechanisms related to autonomic nervous system function and the brain-gut axis. We review the functional anatomy and the importance of the vagus nerve for maintaining maladaptive chronic overnutrition and describe interventions to abrogate its effects. In aggregate, the preponderance of evidence supported by laboratory and clinical mechanistic studies interrupting abdominal bi-directional vagal transmission demonstrates that the majority of patients report less "hunger" and lose weight.

### The vagus neurometabolic interface and clinical disease [^113rEXsi]. International Journal of Obesity (2018). Low credibility.

The nervous system both monitors and modulates body metabolism to maintain homoeostasis. In disease states such as obesity and diabetes, the neurometabolic interface is dysfunctional and contributes to clinical illness. The vagus nerve, in particular, with both sensory and motor fibres, provides an anatomical substrate for this interface. Its sensory fibres contain receptors for important circulating metabolic mediators, including leptin and cholecystokinin, and provide real-time information about these mediators to the central nervous system. In turn, efferent fibres within the vagus nerve participate in a brain-gut axis to regulate metabolism. In this review, we describe these vagus nerve-mediated metabolic pathways and recent clinical trials of vagus nerve stimulation for the management of obesity. These early studies suggest that neuromodulation approaches that employ electricity to tune neurometabolic circuits may represent a new tool in the clinical armamentarium directed against obesity.

FIGURE 1
Example of vagal efficiency defined by the slope of synchronous measures of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and heart period measured over posture changes (A). Though both adolescents have a similar range of vagal tone values (measured by RSA, panel B), the adolescent on the left has low vagal efficiency (slope = 14), suggesting that a vagal brake has a weak effect on cardiac output. The adolescent on the right has high vagal efficiency (slope = 87), suggesting that changes in cardiac vagal tone have a stronger effect on dynamic changes in heart period. Reprinted from Kolacz et al.

The initial study documented that sleep state in newborn infants could be reliably detected by quantifying VE. This finding has been replicated with high‐risk preterm infants and expanded to index clinical course. Additional studies indicated that in response to alcohol, VE decreased in humans. As we became more familiar with the metric, systematic challenges were used. In a clinical study using a posture challenge protocol to functionally stimulate baroreceptors, it was possible to detect a subset of patients in a pediatric gastroenterology clinic with joint hypermobility syndrome. In another study, an exercise bike challenge was used in a study with college students and VE distinguished participants with and without a maltreatment history. Most relevant to this special issue, is the documentation that children with cyclic vomiting syndrome have atypically low VE. On a clinical level, it appears that VE may provide an objective metric related to the clinical features associated with a diagnosis of dysautonomia.

### Heart rate variability and generalized anxiety disorder during laboratory-induced worry and aversive imagery [^111nVBaf]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

To date only a few published studies have examined the effect of disorder-relevant stressors on heart rate variability (HRV) in participants meeting a clinical diagnosis of GAD, with conflicting results. The primary aim of this study was to determine if GAD is associated with lower HRV at rest, and whether vagal regulation during task varies by type (i.e., baseline, anticipation, imagery, or worry).

Methods

This study investigated resting cardiac vagal tone and vagal regulation in a sample of 40 participants with or without a validated diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). High-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) was used to index cardiac vagal activity.

Results

GAD was associated with vagal withdrawal during both imagery and worry inductions, but no group differences in resting vagal tone or worry were observed.

Limitations

Methodological limitations include inherent limits to generalizability of laboratory-based findings; specifically worry induction and cardiac reactivity to lab-based stressors.

Conclusions

The results support the notion that GAD is associated with vagal withdrawal during active bouts of idiographic worry and imagery, and question the assumption that GAD is associated with low resting vagal tone. In light of polyvagal theory these findings provide additional support for the presence of emotion regulation deficits in GAD, and identify specific ANS processes that underlie GAD.

### Effect of stimulus type and worry on physiological response to fear [^114PLmgr]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

The current study investigated whether the immediacy and concreteness of fear stimuli play an important role in the effects of trait worry on physiological response to fear. One hundred and eight participants were exposed to one of three fear-provoking stimuli: an actual spider (immediate and concrete), an opaque box which they were told contained a spider (immediate but abstract), or a recorded script (distant and abstract). Participants were yoked by levels of worry and gender. Heart rate, vagal tone, and skin conductance were recorded. The combination of high worry and an actual spider caused the largest decrease in vagal tone, but both the actual spider and opaque box increased skin conductance regardless of worry level. The results suggest that factors, such as the type of fear stimulus and the type of physiological measures used, are vital in understanding the reasons for and the limits of fear activation.

### Autonomic nervous system activity correlates with peak experiences induced by DMT and predicts increases in well-being [^1143MHfT]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

The present results also confirmed our second hypothesis that greater sympathovagal balance at baseline would be related to the quality of the psychedelic experience, by allowing an optimal engagement of the SNS while also promoting an efficient post-stress recovery vagal activation. Indeed, high vagal tone (i.e. PNS activity) may hinder the intensity and duration of the stress response, and it has been proposed that lower baseline vagal tone and high SNS activity may index greater preparedness to engage a stress response, whereas higher baseline vagal tone may reflect a propensity to evaluate safety in the environment. On the other hand, high sympathetic activity has been associated with vulnerability to stress and impaired emotional regulation, reflecting less effective PNS-mediated post-stress recovery mechanisms. Starting the psychedelic experience from a state of balance between the two branches would therefore promote the deployment of optimal sympathetic stress response and post-stress vagal rebound. We found that baseline SD1/SD2 could predict spiritual experience ratings and that this relationship was mediated by sympathovagal coactivation during the DMT experience. Sympathovagal balance may therefore provide a physiological marker of "readiness" to undergo a deeper and more transformative psychedelic experience, characterized by strong SNS activation and subsequent vagal rebound. This finding is consistent with the notion, pursued in some contemplative practices such as Zen Buddhism, that finding the right equilibrium between arousal and rest, tension and relaxation, is key to the meditative practice. If indeed meditation practices allow the cultivation of a more balanced ANS, as suggested in a study that identified increase sympathovagal balance after an advanced meditation program, our findings may provide mechanistic evidence for previous observations that contemplative practices may aid in the preparation for psychedelic experiences to foster safety and positive effects. Our findings may thus have translational relevance by suggesting that cardio-physiological state may be a key factor for the success of the clinical use of psychedelics, complementing preliminary findings that psychological preparedness may promote the safety and efficacy of psychedelic therapy. Furthermore, our findings are in line with suggestions that the cultivation of optimal psychological and physiological states can improve safety and efficacy of psychedelics and NSCs, more broadly. These results warrant further research into the potential to develop markers of "readiness for acute alterations of consciousness" based on the state of the ANS, which could be used as predictors of peak experiences, and thereby of positive outcomes in psychedelic-assisted therapy.

The central autonomic nervous system (ANS) is essential for maintaining cardiovascular and respiratory homeostasis in the newborn and has a critical role in supporting higher cortical functions. At birth, the central ANS is maturing and is vulnerable to adverse environmental and physiologic influences. Critical connections are formed early in development between the ANS and limbic system to integrate psychological and body responses. The Polyvagal Theory, developed by Stephen Porges, describes how modulation of the autonomic vagal impulse controls social responses and that a broad range of neuropsychiatric disorders may be due to impaired vagal balance, with either deficient vagal tone or excessive vagal reactivity. Under additional circumstances of prematurity, growth restriction, and environmental stress in the fetus and newborn, the immature ANS may undergo "dysmaturation". Maternal stress and health as well as the intrauterine environment are also quite important and have been implicated in causing ANS changes in the infant and neuropsychiatric diseases in children. This review will cover the aspects of ANS development and maturation that have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders in children.

### Dexmedetomidine [^111j5Sv2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Drug Administration

Dexmedetomidine should be administered only by persons skilled in the management of patients in the intensive care or operating room setting. Due to the known pharmacological effects of dexmedetomidine, patients should be continuously monitored while receiving dexmedetomidine.

5.2 Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Sinus Arrest

Clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported with dexmedetomidine administration in young, healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration including rapid intravenous or bolus administration.

Reports of hypotension and bradycardia have been associated with dexmedetomidine infusion. Some of these cases have resulted in fatalities. If medical intervention is required, treatment may include decreasing or stopping the infusion of dexmedetomidine, increasing the rate of intravenous fluid administration, elevation of the lower extremities, and use of pressor agents. Because dexmedetomidine has the potential to augment bradycardia induced by vagal stimuli, clinicians should be prepared to intervene. The intravenous administration of anticholinergic agents (e.g., glycopyrrolate, atropine) should be considered to modify vagal tone. In clinical trials, glycopyrrolate or atropine were effective in the treatment of most episodes of dexmedetomidine induced bradycardia. However, in some patients with significant cardiovascular dysfunction, more advanced resuscitative measures were required.

### The effects of diaphragm release on sleep quality: a pilot feasibility study [^116hD8Sq]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sleep health is a critical determinant of overall well-being, and insufficient or poor-quality sleep has been associated with cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, impaired cognitive performance, and reduced quality of life. In the long term, inadequate sleep quality has been linked to serious health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, depression, anxiety, and stroke. Multiple factors, including environmental, physiological, psychological, behavioral, and physical influences, can negatively affect sleep. Importantly, poor sleep quality is a widespread issue that impacts individuals across all age groups, from otherwise healthy populations to those living with chronic illnesses.

Respiration is a fundamental aspect of life. As the primary respiratory muscle, the diaphragm plays a crucial role in breathing and physiological regulation. However, its functions extend beyond respiration, as the diaphragm also contributes to vocalisation and swallowing, alongside its primary respiratory function. The motion of the diaphragm during breathing influences the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and motor nerve activities.

Dysfunction of the diaphragm can disrupt physiological equilibrium and the interplay between body systems, leading to impaired breathing patterns. This dysfunction is associated with various disorders, including respiratory insufficiency, exercise intolerance, and sleep disturbance. The parasympathetic nervous system predominantly regulates sleep, with the vagus nerve playing a vital role in its control. Since the phrenic nerve, responsible for innervating the diaphragm and facilitating its functions, connects with the vagus nerve, releasing the diaphragm can potentially increase parasympathetic tone and deepen breathing, thus improving sleep quality. Although direct evidence for manual diaphragm release is lacking, it can be hypothesized that improving diaphragmatic function may exert similar effects to slow deep breathing, which has been shown to reset autonomic balance by inhibiting sympathetic activity and enhancing parasympathetic activation. Importantly, previous studies have also demonstrated that diaphragm release and stretching techniques can improve respiratory function and thoracic mobility by reducing tension on the diaphragm, including increases in maximal respiratory pressure and forced vital capacity. Through these pathways, interventions targeting the diaphragm may positively influence both physiological and psychological aspects of sleep regulation.

### Efficacy of a 4-week yoga module on the sympatho-vagal balance among healthcare workers in a tertiary care hospital: a randomised controlled trial [^1118DMB3]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The concept of sympatho-vagal balance (SVB) shows how our body's autonomic system is affected by both the sympathetic (fight or flight) and parasympathetic (rest and digest) influences, essentially indicating the balance between these two systems. The balance between these two systems is crucial for maintaining homeostasis in the body, and an imbalance can lead to various health issues, including cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal disorders and mental health problems. Research has extensively investigated SVB using techniques such as heart rate variability (HRV).

The fluctuation in the time intervals between adjacent heartbeats is called HRV. It measures the dynamic interactions between the heart and brain, influenced by the autonomic nervous system. In simpler terms, HRV provides insights into the coordination between the heart and brain, influencing various aspects of the body's functioning. HRV analysis techniques can distinguish between the activation of the parasympathetic nervous system, indicating a relaxed state that reflects good health, and the sympathetic nervous system, indicating an agitated state that, when persistently activated, leads to ill health.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) actively involved in patient care at tertiary care hospitals face significant stress and workload, which may adversely impact their overall well-being, including cardiovascular health. According to Joseph and Joseph, 'a healthcare worker is one who delivers care and services to the sick and ailing either directly as doctors and nurses or indirectly as aides, helpers, laboratory technicians or even medical waste handlers'. The WHO classifies HCWs into five broad categories: (a) health professionals; (b) health associate professionals; (c) personal care workers in health services; (d) health management and support personnel; and (e) other health service providers not elsewhere classified. Table 1 presents a concise form of this classification.

Table 1
Classification of HCWs according to WHO

HCWs often face substantial stressors in their professional environments, significantly impacting their SVB. The demanding nature of healthcare duties, including long working hours, emotional strain and exposure to high-pressure situations, can lead to chronic sympathetic activation and reduced parasympathetic tone among HCWs. Prolonged imbalance in sympatho-vagal activity has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, impaired immune function and psychological distress, highlighting the importance of implementing strategies to support the well-being of healthcare professionals.

### Targeting miR-423–5p reverses exercise training-induced HCN4 channel remodeling and sinus bradycardia [^113bF7ix]. Circulation Research (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our previous work on rodents was the first to attribute exercise training–induced bradycardia to the downregulation of HCN4 and I f. We now present evidence suggesting this is also the case in human athletes. In addition, we show that HCN4 is a novel target for post-transcriptional repression by miR-423–5p and the training-induced downregulation of HCN4 and I f, and consequently, the bradycardia is the result of an upregulation of Nkx2.5 and consequently miR-423–5p in the sinus node. This is the first report of miR-dependent regulation of pacemaking and heart rate.

There is widespread belief that the resting bradycardia in athletes is the result of high vagal tone, although vagal tone has never been directly measured in athletes. However, critical analysis of the literature does not necessarily support this. An increase in heart rate variability in human athletes has been extensively quoted as evidence for high vagal tone in athletes. However, we have shown from an analysis of the underlying biophysics of pacemaking that heart rate variability is primarily determined (in an exponential-like manner) by heart rate, and the increase in heart rate variability in athletes is attributed to the resting bradycardia rather than any increase in vagal tone. This study has shown that the relative bradycardia in human athletes (as compared with the heart rate of the control subjects) was still present (and in fact was larger) after complete autonomic blockade (Figure 1 B). The same result (a larger relative bradycardia after autonomic blockade) has been reported by 3 other studies of human athletes. This suggests that the autonomic nervous system is not responsible for the resting bradycardia. Once again, many studies of animal models of exercise training show no evidence of high vagal tone. However, some studies of human athletes or animal models of exercise training apparently show a reduction of the relative bradycardia after autonomic blockade, leaving open the possibility that high vagal tone does play a role. This is considered further in Discussion in the. Previously, we showed that the reduction of heart rate on blocking I f by ivabradine or Cs + is decreased in the trained rodent, and this is attributed to the training-induced downregulation of HCN4 and I f. The corollary of this, as shown in Figure 2 D, is that there is a correlation between the effect of ivabradine and the intrinsic heart rate of sedentary and trained mice. As shown in Figure 1 E, the same correlation is observed in sedentary and trained human subjects. It is, therefore, possible that there is a training-induced downregulation of HCN4 and I f in the human athlete, and this is the cause (or at least a contributing cause) of the bradycardia.

### P2X3 receptor antagonism attenuates the progression of heart failure [^111si1JL]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In addition to correcting the respiratory disturbances, focal P2X3 receptor antagonism within the carotid body also restored autonomic balance (i.e. reducing sympathetic and raising cardiac vagal tone) in the in situ preparation; this was also the case when the drug was given systemically in conscious rats. Clinically most relevant were the findings that systemic chronic treatment of P2X3 receptor blockade in HF rats: (i) prevented the deleterious progression of HF by improving cardiac output substantially; (ii) lowered classic HF biomarkers; (iii) reduced systemic inflammation; (iv) lowered heart weight, indicating that the treatment attenuated hypertrophy/compensatory myocardial pathological remodeling; (v) prevented pulmonary edema as lung weight was normalized, presumably due to improved left heart pump function; (vi) increased cardiac vagal tone and respiratory sinus arrhythmia reflecting improved central baroreceptor transmission in face of attenuated carotid body afferent drive. The present findings support the notion that P2X3 receptors, especially those within the carotid body, play a pivotal role in afferent-driven pathological mechanisms of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. In our studies where the antagonist was given systemically, we cannot rule out contributions of P2X3 receptors located on other afferent systems (e.g. cardiac, skeletal muscle sensors) to the aforementioned comorbidities associated with HF.

### Vagal tone: effects on sensitivity, motility, and inflammation [^115vHHs8]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2016). Low credibility.

The vagus nerve (VN) is a key element of the autonomic nervous system. As a mixed nerve, the VN contributes to the bidirectional interactions between the brain and the gut, i.e., the brain-gut axis. In particular, after integration in the central autonomic network of peripheral sensations such as inflammation and pain via vagal and spinal afferents, an efferent response through modulation of preganglionic parasympathetic neurons of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and/or preganglionic sympathetic neurons of the spinal cord is able to modulate gastrointestinal nociception, motility, and inflammation. A low vagal tone, as assessed by heart rate variability, a marker of the sympatho-vagal balance, is observed in functional digestive disorders and inflammatory bowel diseases. To restore a normal vagal tone appears as a goal in such diseases. Among the therapeutic tools, such as drugs targeting the cholinergic system and/or complementary medicine (hypnosis, meditation…), deep breathing, physical exercise, VN stimulation (VNS), either invasive or non-invasive, appears as innovative. There is new evidence in the current issue of this Journal supporting the role of VNS in the modulation of gastrointestinal functions.

### The metabolic role of vagal afferent innervation [^1111uVtE]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

The regulation of energy and glucose balance contributes to whole-body metabolic homeostasis, and such metabolic regulation is disrupted in obesity and diabetes. Metabolic homeostasis is orchestrated partly in response to nutrient and vagal-dependent gut-initiated functions. Specifically, the sensory and motor fibres of the vagus nerve transmit intestinal signals to the central nervous system and exert biological and physiological responses. In the past decade, the understanding of the regulation of vagal afferent signals and of the associated metabolic effect on whole-body energy and glucose balance has progressed. This Review highlights the contributions made to the understanding of the vagal afferent system and examines the integrative role of the vagal afferent in gastrointestinal regulation of appetite and glucose homeostasis. Investigating the integrative and metabolic role of vagal afferent signalling represents a potential strategy to discover novel therapeutic targets to restore energy and glucose balance in diabetes and obesity.

### Normal values and reproducibility of the real-time index of vagal tone in healthy humans: a multi-center study [^1148ps1B]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

This study is not without its limitations. Firstly, we did not formally assess the regularity with which individuals undertook physical exercise. It is not known whether exercise and fitness levels influence CVT per se. However, a number of previous studies have demonstrated that cardiovascular fitness influences autonomic control of heart rate and therefore, by extension, vagal tone. In addition, we chose to study subjects after one year so no comment can be made as to whether CVT is reproducible over the short (hours to days) or medium (weeks to months) term. Although ANS function is incompletely evaluated using this technique, for instance with concomitant measurement of more established measures of time or frequency domain measures of HRV, the enhanced temporal resolution has facilitated our groups and others to describe changes in these PNS parameters to various somatic and visceral stimuli. However, the results described herein cannot be extrapolated to patients groups as we have only studied "supernormal" subjects for our normative data. Further research is warranted to objectively and systematically comparing these techniques to established measures in the clinical environment particularly in patients with GI disorders such as IBD or IBS.

### Biofeedback for CHAMPS… [^116dYLr1]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Heart rate variability biofeedback has long been used to assist with a wide variety of stress-related concerns, including depression and anxiety, both conditions that commonly co-occur with disordered eating. Research suggests interoception, is disrupted in those with eating disorders. While there is relatively sparse evidence on the relationship between HRV and interoception, it is theoretically plausible that superior interoception would predict improved vagal tone as measured by HRV. Moreover, data on HRV and disordered eating is mixed, and poorly understood. The present research seeks to begin addressing this gap in knowledge through a pilot feasibility study designed to initiate proof-of-concept for the development of a conceptual model.

Specifically, the study aims to:

- assess the feasibility of implementing a digitally based HRV biofeedback protocol
- assess the acceptability and usability of HRV biofeedback in healthcare providers with elevated disordered eating
- examine signals of efficacy to begin building a conceptual model of the potential mechanisms underlying change in outcomes
- test whether there is a relationship between intervention engagement/adherence and change in outcomes. By establishing feasibility and proof-of-concept, the study will build upon a limited body of work and establish an important first step towards understanding intervention dosing and signals of efficacy for aiding with disordered eating and related mind-body factors in this population.

### Respiratory sinus arrhythmia: why does the heartbeat synchronize with respiratory rhythm? [^1117aNfT]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is heart rate variability in synchrony with respiration, by which the R-R interval on an ECG is shortened during inspiration and prolonged during expiration. Although RSA has been used as an index of cardiac vagal function, it is also a physiologic phenomenon reflecting respiratory-circulatory interactions universally observed among vertebrates. Previous studies have shown that the efficiency of pulmonary gas exchange is improved by RSA, suggesting that RSA may play an active physiologic role. The matched timing of alveolar ventilation and its perfusion with RSA within each respiratory cycle could save energy expenditure by suppressing unnecessary heartbeats during expiration and ineffective ventilation during the ebb of perfusion. Furthermore, evidence has accumulated of a possible dissociation between RSA and vagal control of that heart rate, suggesting differential controls between the respiratory modulation of cardiac vagal outflow and cardiac vagal tone. RSA or heart rate variability in synchrony with respiration is a biological phenomenon, which may have a positive influence on gas exchange at the level of the lung via efficient ventilation/perfusion matching.

However, in some patients with significant cardiovascular dysfunction, more advanced resuscitative measures were required.

### Evaluation and management of vasovagal syncope… [^117HR1JK]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Vasovagal syncope is characterized by the common faint, resulting from "vagally" mediated cardioinhibition. The resulting brady-cardia reduces cerebral blood flow to a level inadequate to maintain consciousness. Because of the episodic nature of vasovagal syncope and the heterogeneity of the patient population, it is difficult to make specific therapy recommendations. Fenton and associates reviewed the current understanding of vasovagal syncope to provide a diagnostic and therapeutic approach. The vagus nerve transmits afferent signals from the aortic arch baroreceptors, regulating arterial pressure. Increases in arterial flow stimulate efferent vagal outflow, inhibiting sympathetic drive and decreasing blood pressure. Assumption of an upright position with pooling of blood in the lower extremities activates this autonomic cycle and results in increased sympathetic tone to the vasculature and heart, causing vasoconstriction, increased heart rate and maintenance of blood pressure.

The vasovagal response is caused by excessive venous pooling that paradoxically results in vasodilatation and bradycardia rather than the appropriate physiologic responses of vasoconstriction and tachycardia. Other modulating factors that may be present during syncope include serotonin, adenosine and opioids. Nitric oxide has also been implicated in the vaso dilatory response associated with vasovagal syncope. There are no specific physical signs related to vasovagal syncope. Tilt-table testing provokes venous pooling and resultant vasovagal syncope. Pharmacologic agents used to emphasize this effect are not well standardized.

Testing is warranted in patients whose syncope is uncertain to be vasovagal and in patients with one or more of the following indications: recurrent syncope, a single syncope episode associated with injury, a single syncope episode associated with a high-risk setting, or syncope of another established cause whose treatment might be affected by vasovagal syncope. editor's note: Common presentations ofvasovagal syncope include episodes occurringafter a painful or fearful stimulus. Patientsmay faint after prolonged standing or exertion. A tilt-table test is the best diagnostic test; the hemodynamic and catecholamine response during the test simulates those occurring during a vasovagal syncopal episode andwill provoke a syncopal episode in susceptiblepersons. — r. s.

### Pregnancy anxiety and comorbid depression and anger: effects on the fetus and neonate [^113Myaaf]. Depression and Anxiety (2003). Low credibility.

One hundred sixty-six women were classified as experiencing high or low anxiety during the second trimester of pregnancy. The high anxiety women also had high scores on depression and anger scales. In a follow-up across pregnancy, the fetuses of the high anxiety women were noted to be more active and to experience growth delays. The high anxiety mothers' high prenatal norepinephrine and low dopamine levels were followed by their neonates having low dopamine and serotonin levels. The high anxiety mothers' newborns also had greater relative right frontal EEG activation and lower vagal tone. Finally, the newborns of high anxiety mothers spent more time in deep sleep and less time in quiet and active alert states and showed more state changes and less optimal performance on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale (motor maturity, autonomic stability and withdrawal). These data highlight the need for prenatal intervention for elevated anxiety symptoms during pregnancy.

### Pathophysiologic relationship between Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, and cardiovascular risk: a review and synthesis [^111xDhvw]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2017). Low credibility.

4.2 Aerobic exercise and physical fitness

In contrast to metabolic syndromes, aerobic exercise and healthy lifestyles have been shown to reduce the incidence of both CVD and AD in observational studies. Cardiovascular diseases have become very common as communities and individuals attain more wealth and pursue more sedentary lifestyles. Aerobic exercise promotes brain vascularization and may reduce vascular risk factors and improve cognitive function. Randomized controlled trials with as little as six months of exercise training lead to increased hippocampal volume and improved performance on spatial memory and executive function tasks. Aerobic exercise also upregulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which augments plasticity in the hippocampus.

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated reduced risk of cognitive decline and dementia as a function of activity levels, and studies have shown increased gray- and white-matter volume in the brains of participants assigned to aerobic trainingor those with higher levels of self-reported exercise. Recent meta-analysis of clinical trials of exercise interventions in dementia patients demonstrated positive effects. A recent prevention trial of an exercise intervention in sedentary older adults failed to find a significant effect on cognitive function; however, secondary analyses found significant improvement in cognitive function among the subset of participants who were diabetic.

A related measure of physical fitness is heart rate variability (HRV) on continuous electrocardiography recordings. HRV is usually relatively high for those who exercise frequently, as well as for young and healthy individuals. Aging and poor physical fitness are associated with an impairment of cardiac vagal function, and HRV is lower for those with relatively diminished parasympathetic tone, including those with CVD. Vagal tone, the ability of the vagus nerve to rapidly regulate cardiac output, accounts for a substantial portion of HRV. Vagal tone can be quantified via respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), which measures the slight ebb and flow in heart rate that occurs during the respiratory cycle. RSA is higher in older adults who demonstrate better performance on tasks of verbal episodic memory, a cognitive domain that is typically impaired with the onset of AD.

In Table 1, we provide a listing of evidence-based interventions for the treatment of CVD, discussed in the sections previously, and how these specific interventions have been explored in the treatment of AD.

### Novel interventional therapies to modulate the autonomic tone in heart failure [^112FBCKi]. JACC: Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) represents a significant and expanding public health burden associated with increasing prevalence and exponential growth in related health care costs. Contemporary advances in both pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies have often been restricted in application and benefit. Given the critical role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis in the failing heart, there has been increasing interest in the role of ANS modulation as a therapeutic modality in HF. In this review, we highlight the anatomy of the ANS and its role in the pathophysiology of HF, as well as metrics of its assessment. Given the limitations associated with pharmacological ANS modulation, including lack of specificity and medication intolerance, we focus in this review on contemporary nonpharmacological ANS modulation therapies. For each therapy-vagal nerve stimulation, carotid baroreceptor stimulation, spinal cord stimulation, and renal denervation-we review the rationale for modulation, pre-clinical and clinical assessments, as well as procedural considerations and limitations. We conclude by commenting on novel technologies and strategies for ANS modulation on the horizon.

### Enteric neuropathy and the vagus nerve: therapeutic implications [^114QbAko]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

9.2 Non‐vagus nerve stimulation methods for activating the vagus nerve

Deep and slow breathing efficiently increase parasympathetic activity, as assessed by high frequency power (i.e. % of high frequency in the total HRV power)and reduce state anxiety in both younger and older adults. Slow, deep breathing can reduce visceral pain intensity.

Hypnosis modifies HRV by enhancing parasympathetic activity and reducing sympathetic tone. Yoga and mindfulness meditation increase vagal activity. These complementary medicines may be of interest in the management of enteric neuropathies.

Regular physical exercise also induces an increase in resting vagal toneand enhances cardia vagal activity, stimulating noninvasively the VN.

9.3 Pharmacological methods of increasing cholinergic tone

Prucalopride is a specific 5HT4 agonist that has been shown to facilitate cholinergic neurotransmission in murineand humanwith gastrointestinal and colonic prokinetic activities. Prucalopride, approved for the treatment of IBS with constipation, could be of interest in the management of enteric neuropathies, although to my knowledge no data are available regarding its effect on HRV and vagal tone.

In the same way, pyridostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with only peripheral effects, enhances HRV and vagal tone in normal ratsand spontaneously hypertensive rats. In a model of acute myocardial infarction in spontaneously hypertensive rats, pyridostigmine treatment increased the parasympathetic tone and lowered M1/M2 macrophage ratio toward an anti‐inflammatory profile that was associated with decreased TNF levels in the heart and spleen.

Galantamine, a cholinesterase blocker and a nicotinic receptor agonist, including α7nAChR, is able to cross the blood–brain barrier and activates the central cholinergic pathway thus stimulating VN efferents. This drug is used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine dramatically decreases circulating TNF and IL‐6 and improves survival in a murine endotoxemia model. Thus, galantamine could be used as an immune suppressive drug. To our knowledge, galantamine has only been used in experimental inflammation but not in clinical research.

### Vigorous physical activity and atrial fibrillation in healthy individuals: what is the correct approach? [^114Bv3yq]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

8 PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE ENDURANCE ATHLETE LEADING TO AF

Several different physio‐pathological mechanisms may explain the increased risk of arrhythmia in athletes. Coumel's triangle, still represents the clearest way of understanding the complex pathophysiological AF mechanism, identifying three important elements: [1] electrical and structural remodeling, [2] triggers and [3] the role of the autonomic nervous system. Cardiac adaptation to intense exercise results in increased vagal tone, lower resting heart rate and increased systolic output, ventricular dilation, and hypertrophy, all of which may cause a predisposition to AF recurrences. Additional pathophysiologic mechanisms may include recurrent fluid and electrolyte shifts (Table 1).

Table 1
Potential mechanisms and associated sequelae for atrial fibrillation induced by strenuous endurance exercise.

The left atrium plays a critical role in receiving pulmonary venous return and modulating left ventricular filling. With the onset of exercise, left atrial function contributes to the augmentation in stroke volume. Athletes are frequently observed to have enlarged left atrial size, when compared to non‐athletes. The adaptation of the left atrium appears to be proportional to the cumulative volume of training over an individual's lifetime. The left atrial enlargement is attributed to the repetitive, volume and pressure overload applied during exercise, particularly that of long duration over many years, with some contribution from an expanded blood volume that is observed amongst the well‐trained. Beyond the size of the left atrium, cross‐sectional studies demonstrate a modest reduction in left atrial reservoir and contractile strain amongst athletes compared to sedentary controls. Structural and electrical changes within the atrium may also lead to a reduction in atrial refractoriness and therefore to conduction slowdown and electrical dispersion known to facilitate the formation of re‐entry circuits and AF as a result.

The increased vagal tone in athletes further decreases the atrial refractory period, which could facilitate re‐entry and predispose to AF, especially because it is associated with an intermittent‐exercise‐related increase in sympathetic tone. Indeed, AF in athletes typically occur at rest and especially during sleep when the vagal tone is higher. Moreover, animal studies demonstrated an association between atrial enlargement, progressive atrial fibrosis, and inflammation due to intense exercise and their correlation with the risk of AF.

Of note, it seems that women are at a generally lower risk of developing AF than men because resting heart rate is usually higher, differences in vagal tone, smaller atria, and shorter P‐wave duration, but these hypotheses are speculative and have not been demonstrated yet.

### The autonomic nervous system and hypertension [^113XGayZ]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

Physiological studies have long documented the key role played by the autonomic nervous system in modulating cardiovascular functions and in controlling blood pressure values, both at rest and in response to environmental stimuli. Experimental and clinical investigations have tested the hypothesis that the origin, progression, and outcome of human hypertension are related to dysfunctional autonomic cardiovascular control and especially to abnormal activation of the sympathetic division. Here, we review the recent literature on the adrenergic and vagal abnormalities that have been reported in essential hypertension, with emphasis on their role as promoters and as amplifiers of the high blood pressure state. We also discuss the possible mechanisms underlying these abnormalities and their importance in the development and progression of the structural and functional cardiovascular damage that characterizes hypertension. Finally, we examine the modifications of sympathetic and vagal cardiovascular influences induced by current nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions aimed at correcting elevations in blood pressure and restoring the normotensive state.

### Increased vagal tone accounts for the observed immune paralysis in patients with traumatic brain injury [^11296Dx4]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability, especially in the younger population. In the acute phase after TBI, patients are more vulnerable to infection, associated with a decreased immune response in vitro. The cause of this immune paralysis is poorly understood. Apart from other neurologic dysfunction, TBI also results in an increase in vagal activity. Recently, the vagus nerve has been demonstrated to exert an anti-inflammatory effect, termed the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. The anti-inflammatory effects of the vagus nerve are mediated by the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor present on macrophages and other cytokine-producing cells. From these observations, we hypothesize that the immune paralysis observed in patients with TBI may, at least in part, result from augmented vagal activity and subsequent sustained effects of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. This pathway may counteract systemic proinflammation caused by the release of endogenous compounds termed alarmins as a result of tissue trauma. However, sustained activity of this pathway may severely impair the body's ability to combat infection. Since the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway can be pharmacologically modulated in humans, it could represent a novel approach to prevent infections in patients with TBI.

### Preliminary report: modulation of parasympathetic nervous system tone influences oesophageal pain hypersensitivity [^111Eom7H]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Autonomic nervous system dysfunction has been implicated in visceral hypersensitivity. However, the specific contribution of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is unclear. We aimed to determine whether physiological and pharmacological manipulation of parasympathetic tone influences the development of hypersensitivity in a validated model of acid-induced oesophageal pain.

Design

Prior to, and following, a 30-min distal oesophageal infusion of 0.15M hydrochloric acid, pain thresholds to electrical stimulation were determined in the proximal non-acid exposed oesophagus in healthy subjects. Validated sympathetic (skin conductance response) and parasympathetic (cardiac vagal tone) parameters were measured at baseline and continuously thereafter. In study 1, 55 subjects were randomised in a pragmatic blinded crossover design to receive deep breathing or un-paced breathing during acid infusion. In study 2, 32 subjects were randomised in a blinded, crossover design to receive intravenous atropine or placebo (saline) with deep breathing during acid infusion.

Results

Study 1: Deep breathing increased cardiac vagal tone (2.1 ± 2.3 vs -0.3 ± 2.3, p = 0.0006) with concomitant withdrawal of skin conductance response (-0.6 ± 4.9 vs 3 ± 4.8, p = 0.03) in comparison with un-paced breathing. Deep breathing prevented the development of acid-induced oesophageal hypersensitivity in comparison with sham breathing (p = 0.0001). Study 2: Atropine, in comparison with placebo, blocked the attenuating effect of deep breathing on the development of acid-induced oesophageal hypersensitivity (p = 0.046).

Conclusions

The development of oesophageal hyperalgesia is prevented by physiologically increasing parasympathetic tone. This effect is pharmacologically blocked with atropine, providing evidence that the PNS influences the development of oesophageal pain hypersensitivity.

### Disorders of gut-brain interaction through the lens of polyvagal theory [^115V7KRh]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

The link between RSA and cardiac vagal tone has a long history going back to Hering (1910), who identified a respiratory rhythm in the vagal cardioinhibitory fibers traveling from the brainstem down to the heart. Hering's observation and the more contemporary neurophysiological research, provided scientists with a neurophysiological basis to develop noninvasive methods for measuring vagal activity using the RSA component of heart rate variability and to test hypotheses generated by the Polyvagal Theory.

In the early 1980s, my laboratory introduced a time–frequency methodology to quantify RSA. The index of cardiac vagal tone generated by this methodology had several advantages including: (1) it provided a more accurate estimate of cardiac vagal tone than other methods, and (2) it could be quantified during short time periods (e.g. 10–15 s). The latter point enabled an opportunity to ask new questions and test new hypotheses that required the evaluation of dynamic changes in vagal efferent activity. For example, the methodology enabled quantification of a new metric, vagal efficiency (VE), that could index the dynamic relationship between RSA and heart rate during a physiological challenge (e.g. posture shift). As illustrated in Figure 1, VE can be visually represented as a regression line and objectively quantified as the slope depicting the ms change in heart period that would occur with a change of one log unit of RSA amplitude (i.e. the units of quantification defined in the Porges‐Bohrer methodology).

### Efficacy of bio-and neurofeedback for depression: a meta-analysis [^115YMcn1]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Likewise, cardiac activity has proven to greatly contribute to the general physiological dysregulation of depressed patients, and not only to be a correlate of the neural dysregulation (Thayer & Mather). Heart rate variability (HRV), in particular the high frequency (HF) of the spectral domain, is considered to index cardiac vagal tone and thus to be a relevant marker of MDD. Research in this domain indicates that depression is associated with lower resting HF-HRV and lower LF/HF ratio (Hamilton & Alloy; Kemp et al.).

Taken together, these results indicate that NF and HRVB constitute two techniques that gather consistent theoretical support to justify a psychophysiological intervention. Indeed, there are a number of qualitative reviews (Hammond; Linden; Sacchet & Gotlib; Young et al.) that have gathered the available studies of neurofeedback and biofeedback for MDD and depressive symptomatology. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no study has meta-analytically established the extent to which this approach is efficacious for MDD and depressive symptomatology, respectively.

Apart from calculating the overall effect of bio- and neurofeedback interventions for MDD, this study also aims to calculate the effect of all bio- and neurofeedback studies that included depressive symptomatology as a secondary outcome measure in subjects suffering from other conditions than MDD.

### Non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation and exercise capacity in healthy volunteers: a randomized trial [^117FJXmM]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and Aims

Vagal parasympathetic dysfunction is strongly associated with impaired exercise tolerance, indicating that coordinated autonomic control is essential for optimizing exercise performance. This study tested the hypothesis that autonomic neuromodulation by non-invasive transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) can improve exercise capacity in humans.

Methods

This single-centre, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover trial in 28 healthy volunteers evaluated the effect of bilateral transcutaneous stimulation of vagal auricular innervation, applied for 30 min daily for 7 days, on measures of cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen consumption (VO 2 peak)) during progressive exercise to exhaustion. Secondary endpoints included peak work rate, cardiorespiratory measures, and the whole blood inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide ex vivo.

Results

tVNS applied for 30 min daily over 7 consecutive days increased VO 2 peak by 1.04 mL/kg/min (95% CI:.34–1.73; p = 0.005), compared with no change after sham stimulation (−0.54 mL/kg/min; 95% CI: −1.52 to.45). No carry-over effect was observed following the 2-week washout period. tVNS increased work rate (by 6 W; 95% CI: 2–10; p = 0.006), heart rate (by 4 bpm; 95% CI: 1–7; p = 0.011), and respiratory rate (by 4 breaths/min; 95% CI: 2–6; P < .001) at peak exercise. Analysis of the whole blood transcriptomic response to lipopolysaccharide in serial samples obtained from five participants showed that tVNS reduced the inflammatory response.

Conclusions

Non-invasive vagal stimulation improves measures of cardiorespiratory fitness and attenuates inflammation, offering an inexpensive, safe, and scalable approach to improve exercise capacity.

### Chronic vagus nerve stimulation improves autonomic control and attenuates systemic inflammation and heart failure progression in a canine high-rate pacing model [^113SxouM]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Autonomic dysfunction, characterized by sympathetic activation and vagal withdrawal, contributes to the progression of heart failure (HF). Although the therapeutic benefits of sympathetic inhibition with beta-blockers in HF are clear, the role of increased vagal tone in this setting has been less studied. We have investigated the impact of enhancing vagal tone (achieved through chronic cervical vagus nerve stimulation, [VNS]) on HF development in a canine high-rate ventricular pacing model.

Methods and Results

Fifteen dogs were randomized into control (n = 7) and VNS (n = 8) groups. All dogs underwent 8 weeks of high-rate ventricular pacing (at 220 bpm for the first 4 weeks to develop HF and another 4 weeks at 180 bpm to maintain HF). Concomitant VNS, at an intensity reducing sinus rate approximately 20 bpm, was delivered together with the ventricular pacing in the VNS group. At 4 and 8 weeks of ventricular pacing, both left ventricular end-diastolic and -systolic volumes were lower and left ventricular ejection fraction was higher in the VNS group than in the control group. Heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity improved in the VNS dogs. Rises in plasma norepinephrine, angiotensin II, and C-reactive protein levels, ordinarily expected in this model, were markedly attenuated with VNS treatment.

Conclusions

Chronic VNS improves cardiac autonomic control and significantly attenuates HF development in the canine high-rate ventricular pacing model. The therapeutic benefit of VNS is associated with pronounced anti-inflammatory effects. VNS is a novel and potentially useful therapy for treating HF.

### Vagus nerve stimulation: where are we? [^111jNx68]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Now nearly 5 years post-approval, vagus nerve stimulation has emerged as a major non-pharmacological treatment for epilepsy. The place of vagus nerve stimulation among antiepileptic drugs and other surgical therapies is still evolving. This review evaluates the role of vagus nerve stimulation in light of recently published research of its mechanism(s) of action, long-term efficacy, safety and tolerability, and application to other disorders besides epilepsy.

### Alterations in heart rate variability during everyday life are linked to insulin resistance. A role of dominating sympathetic over parasympathetic nerve activity? [^117BQkhb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

In the present study differences in HRV between T2D relatives and controls were more pronounced in long-term than the short-term assessments suggesting that other mechanisms, such as physical activity and other life-style factors also may be of importance. In addition, age-adjusted total and very low frequency (VLF) power was significantly lower in T2D relatives indicating that reduced vagal activation potentially could be an early component in the development of T2D.

Obesity, perhaps via relative hyperinsulinemia, could be an additional link between IR and ANS activity since sympathetic activity is related to the degree of adiposity. Our present study, in combination with previous work, support that obesity, and in particular visceral obesity, leads to dysregulated ANS activity, which in turn contributes to IR. However, somewhat surprisingly, acute pharmacological inhibition of vagal signals enhance insulin sensitivity in a previous study from our group. Therefore it could be hypothesized that acute and chronic effects of the ANS could have differential impact on glucose metabolism. The finding that dietary intervention in obese subjects was followed by an increase in both vagal function and insulin sensitivity also supports that IR may be modifiable by changes in the ANS.

The association between IR and visceral adiposity is well established. In this study VAT was associated with an increase in LF to HF power ratio and decreased HF power. When adjusting for VAT in analysis of short-term HRV parameters, only LF power and LF to HF power ratio during controlled breathing remained significantly associated with insulin sensitivity potentially indicating that IR is potentially more associated with parasympathetic dysregulation and visceral adiposity than sympathetic regulation. However, this study showed that models including BMI together with long-term HRV indices had the strongest association with IR indicating that total adiposity potentially may promote IR via an indirect increase in sympathetic/parasympathetic balance, for example via high FFA levels reaching the hypothalamus. A recent report also showed that direct SNS innervation of adipocytes that can stimulate lipolysis, and thus possibly contributing to IR via elevated FFA levels. Other factors like inflammation and leptin could be additional links between IR and ANS activity as indicated form other larger cohort studies. Another suggested link between IR and alterations in ANS activity, namely hyperinsulinemia, could potentially also be a link to hypertension, dyslipidemia and development of cardiovascular disease.

### Circadian rhythm of cardiac electrophysiology, arrhythmogenesis, and the underlying mechanisms [^1172RoNC]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Medium credibility.

Role of the autonomic nervous system

It is commonly believed that the SCN clock controls the circadian rhythm in heart rate through a circadian variation in autonomic tone to the sinus node, in particular an increase in vagal tone at night. The SCN controls the circadian release of other neurohumoral factors, but the effect on the circadian rhythm in heart rate is not well understood (for further discussion, refer to the Supplemental Data). Apparent support for the role of autonomic tone comes from studies of day–night variations in heart rate variability (HRV), which is widely used as an indirect measure of cardiac autonomic tone. However, biophysical analysis of HRV has demonstrated an exponential-like relationship between HRV and heart rate, and changes in HRV observed in humans and rodents are mainly attributable to the accompanying changes in heart rate. Interestingly, direct recordings of stellate ganglion nerve activity and vagal nerve activity in an ambulatory dog model of heart failure show a circadian rhythm in sympathetic but not vagal tone to the heart. This is supported by measurements of skin sympathetic nerve activity in epileptic patients. These studies suggest that circadian sympathovagal balance may be largely due to diurnal fluctuations in sympathetic tone. Catecholamine secretion from the adrenal medulla also exhibits a prominent circadian rhythm, and this may contribute to the circadian rhythm in heart rate.

### Vagal determinants of exercise capacity [^112EFnaP]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Elite endurance athletes display exceptionally high parasympathetic vagal tone. Although indirect measures of high cardiac parasympathetic activity correlate with enhanced exercise capacityand lower all-cause mortalityin athletes and the general population, it remains unclear (and currently contentiously debated) whether vagal tone can be enhanced by exercise training. Alternatively, intrinsically high parasympathetic activity, for example due to genetic factor(s), could predispose some individuals to higher tolerance for enduring training regimes, essential to achieve superior athletic performance.

This study was designed to directly test the hypothesis that the strength of vagal tone determines exercise capacity implying that vagal withdrawal should reduce while vagal recruitment should enhance the ability to exercise. We tested it in rodents by genetically targeting the key population of vagal preganglionic neurons that reside in the brainstem's dorsal vagal motor nucleus (DVMN). Developmental studies suggested that the DVMN is the primary vagal nucleus and probably the most (evolutionary) ancient central nervous system (CNS) structure which harbours autonomic neurons in vertebrates. Cardiac vagal preganglionic neurons which reside in the DVMN innervate ventricular myocardium, but have limited control over the chronotropic function. These neurons are tonically activeand critically important for metabolic control. A subset of DVMN neurons provides functional innervation and contributes to the autonomic control of the electrical and contractile properties of the left ventricle (LV) of the heart.

In this study, we show that genetic silencing of the DVMN neurons dramatically impairs exercise capacity, while optogenetic recruitment of this neuronal population enhances cardiac contractility and prolongs exercise endurance in rats. These data provide direct experimental evidence that parasympathetic drive generated by the DVMN neurons determines the ability to exercise.

### Omega-3 and risk of atrial fibrillation: vagally-mediated double-edged sword [^115i5oYT]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Studies regarding effects of omega-3 fatty acids, specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), on risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) have reported discordant results. The aim of this review is to clarify effects of marine omega-3 intake on risk of AF.

Patients and Methods

A PubMed search was performed using terms: atrial fibrillation, omega-3, EPA, DHA, vagal tone. We summarized findings from randomized clinical trials (RCTs), epidemiology studies, and meta-analyses evaluating effects/associations of DHA + EPA on risk of AF. Also, vagal tone was explored as a mediator between omega-3 and risk of AF.

Results

Meta-analyses of 8 RCTs and 17 prospective cohort studies comprised of 83,112 and 54,799 individuals, respectively, investigated the link between omega-3 intake and incident AF. The RCTs reported that treatment with DHA and/or EPA was associated with a 24% increased relative risk of AF (absolute risk 4.0% vs 3.3%; relative risk [RR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11–1.38, p = 0.0002). This was dose-dependent; DHA + EPA doses of ∼1000 mg/d increased AF risk ∼12%, whereas 1800 to 4000 mg/d increased AF risk by ∼50%. In contrast, observational studies focused on DHA + EPA blood levels or dietary intake have generally reported that higher omega-3 levels/consumption are associated with lower AF risk. Maximal AF risk reduction. (12%) occurred at ∼650 mg/d of dietary DHA + EPA. Other studies have indicated that omega-3 fatty acids can dose-dependently increase vagal tone, which could explain the biphasic relationship between DHA + EPA and AF risk. Experimental studies show that low-level vagal stimulation decreases risk of AF, whereas high-level vagal stimulation increases risk of AF.

Conclusion

Higher consumption of dietary omega-3 is associated with decreased AF risk. In contrast, pharmaceutical dosing of omega-3 increases AF in a dose-dependent manner, which may be mediated by vagal tone.

### Importance of resting heart rate [^1125g6U6]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Resting heart rate is a determinant of cardiac output and physiological homeostasis. Although a simple, but critical, parameter, this vital sign predicts adverse outcomes, including mortality, and development of diseases in otherwise normal and healthy individuals. Temporal changes in heart rate can have valuable predictive capabilities. Heart rate can reflect disease severity in patients with various medical conditions. While heart rate represents a compilation of physiological inputs, including sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, aside from the underlying intrinsic sinus rate, how resting heart rate affects outcomes is uncertain. Mechanisms relating resting heart rate to outcomes may be disease-dependent but why resting heart rate in otherwise healthy, normal individuals affects outcomes remains obscure. For specific conditions, physiologically appropriate heart rate reductions may improve outcomes. However, to date, in the normal population, evidence that interventions aimed at reducing heart rate improves outcomes remains undefined. Emerging data suggest that reduction in heart rate via vagal activation and/or sympathetic inhibition is propitious.

### Healthy lifestyle and cardiac vagal modulation over 10 years: whitehall II cohort study [^117TpSbo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Increased vagal modulation is a mechanism that may partially explain the protective effect of healthy lifestyles. However, it is unclear how healthy lifestyles relate to vagal regulation longitudinally. We prospectively examined associations between a comprehensive measure of 4 important lifestyle factors and vagal modulation, indexed by heart rate variability (HRV) over 10 years. Methods and Results The fifth (1997–1999), seventh (2002–2004), and ninth (2007–2009) phases of the UK Whitehall II cohort were analyzed. Analytical samples ranged from 2059 to 3333 (mean age: 55.7 years). A healthy lifestyle score was derived by giving participants 1 point for each healthy factor: physically active, not smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, and healthy body mass index. Two vagally mediated HRV measures were used: high-frequency HRV and root mean square of successive differences of normal-to-normal R-R intervals. Cross-sectionally, a positively graded association was observed between the healthy lifestyle score and HRV at baseline (P overall ≤ 0.001). Differences in HRV according to the healthy lifestyle score remained relatively stable over time. Compared with participants who hardly ever adhered to healthy lifestyles, those with consistent healthy lifestyles displayed higher high-frequency HRV (β = 0.23; 95% CI, 0.10–0.35; P = 0.001) and higher root mean square of successive differences of normal-to-normal R-R intervals (β = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.07–0.22; P ≤ 0.001) at follow-up after covariate adjustment. These differences in high-frequency HRV and root mean square of successive differences of normal-to-normal R-R intervals are equivalent to ≈6 to 20 years differences in chronological age. Compared with participants who reduced their healthy lifestyle scores, those with stable scores displayed higher subsequent high-frequency HRV (β = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.01–0.48; P = 0.046) and higher root mean square of successive differences of normal-to-normal R-R intervals (β = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.01–0.29; P = 0.042). Conclusions Maintaining healthy lifestyles is positively associated with cardiac vagal functioning, and these beneficial adaptations may be lost if not sustained.

### Redefining respiratory sinus arrhythmia as respiratory heart rate variability: an international expert recommendation for terminological clarity [^116gXisd]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

The variation of heart rate in phase with breathing, known as 'respiratory sinus arrhythmia' (RSA), is a physiological phenomenon present in all air-breathing vertebrates. RSA arises from the interaction of several physiological mechanisms but is primarily mediated by rhythmic changes in cardiac parasympathetic (vagal) activity, increasing heart rate during inspiration and decreasing heart rate during expiration. RSA amplitude is an indicator of autonomic and cardiac health; RSA is diminished or absent in common pathological conditions such as chronic heart failure and hypertension. In this Expert Recommendation, we argue that the term 'RSA', although historically important, is semantically inaccurate and carries misleading pathological connotations, contributing to misunderstanding and misinterpretation of the origin and the physiological importance of the phenomenon. We propose replacing 'RSA' with the term 'respiratory heart rate variability' (RespHRV), which avoids pathological connotations and emphasizes the specific respiratory contribution to heart rate variability. We clarify that RespHRV encompasses respiratory-related heart rate variations in both the low-frequency and high-frequency bands traditionally defined in heart rate variability analysis, and that its amplitude should not be misconstrued as a measure of vagal tone. Adopting the proposed term 'RespHRV' is expected to unify understanding and stimulate further experimental and clinical research into the physiological mechanisms and functional importance of this phenomenon.

### Effects of different exercise methods and intensities on the incidence and prognosis of atrial fibrillation [^116H8MS2]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained arrhythmia in clinical practice, exhibits a higher risk of cardiovascular adverse events. Exercise plays a crucial role in AF prevention, but the effects of different exercise types and doses are inconclusive. This review aims to comprehensively explore the most recent evidence and possible mechanisms of diverse exercise modalities concerning AF incidence and therapeutic outcomes. Multiple studies underscore the efficacy of moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) in reducing AF incidence and symptom burden, rendering it the currently favored exercise therapy for AF patients. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) shows promise, potentially surpassing MICT, especially in reducing age-related AF susceptibility and improving symptoms and exercise capacity. Conversely, prolonged high-intensity endurance exercise exacerbates AF risk due to excessive exercise volume, with potential mechanisms encompassing irreversible atrial remodeling, heightened inflammation, and increased vagal tone. In summation, MICT is a secure strategy for populations in mitigating the risk associated with AF incidence and secondary cardiovascular events and should be encouraged. Also, it is recommended to initiate large-scale clinical intervention trials encompassing a variety of exercise types to delineate the optimal exercise prescription for cardiovascular patients, including those afflicted with AF.

### Inhibition and heart rate variability in experimentally induced pain [^1151R18g]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Heart Rate Variability

Heart rate Variability was collected via Firstbeat Bodyguard-2 (Firstbeat Analytics, Jyvaskyla, Finland). The signal was processed using Kubios HRV Analysis 3.4.3 software. In particular, we evaluated the HRV by considering both frequency and time domains. The frequency-domain analysis yielded the mean spectral power measures of the Low-Frequency (LF-HRV, 0.04–0.15 Hz) and High-Frequency (HF-HRV, 0.15–0.4 Hz) bands. The first measure indicates the influence of both vagal and sympathetic activity, whereas the latter reflects changes in the heart's vagal control. The time-domain analysis yielded the standard deviation of the mean RR interval (SDNN), reflecting the variability in the recording period, and the root mean square of successive standard deviation (RMSSD), reflecting the vagal tone. We evaluated HRV during a baseline condition (Resting), task performances requiring cognitive and motor inhibition (Reactivity), and at the end of the procedure (Recovery) for each participant. HRV measures were normalized using natural logarithms.

### Increased cardiac vagal tone in childhood-only, adolescent-only, and persistently antisocial teenagers: the mediating role of low heart rate [^1128KA94]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiac vagal tone is an indicator of parasympathetic nervous system functioning, and there is increasing interest in its relation to antisocial behavior. It is unclear however whether antisocial individuals are characterized by increased or decreased vagal tone, and whether increased vagal tone is the source of the low heart rate frequently reported in antisocial populations.

Methods

Participants consisted of four groups of community-dwelling adolescent boys aged 15.7 years: (1) controls, (2) childhood-only antisocial, (3) adolescent-only antisocial, and (4) persistently antisocial. Heart rate and vagal tone were assessed in three different conditions: rest, cognitive stressor, and social stressor.

Results

All three antisocial groups had both lower resting heart rates and increased vagal tone compared to the low antisocial controls across all three conditions. Low heart rate partially mediated the relationship between vagal tone and antisocial behavior.

Conclusions

Results indicate that increased vagal tone and reduced heart rate are relatively broad risk factors for different developmental forms of antisocial behavior. Findings are the first to implicate vagal tone as an explanatory factor in understanding heart rate - antisocial behavior relationships. Future experimental work using non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation or heart rate variability biofeedback is needed to more systematically evaluate this conclusion.

### Normal values and reproducibility of the real-time index of vagal tone in healthy humans: a multi-center study [^113MgPRN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Given our basic physiological understanding of PNS influence on the heart it should technically be possible to deduce PNS activity non-invasively by measuring beat-to-beat changes in R-R interval. The adaptation of such an approach has been demonstrated to be successful in dogs. Based on this principle, a relatively recent advance has been the development of a validated real-time beat-to-beat index of PNS tone known as CVT (vide infra for a more detailed explanation). Recently, the measurement of CVT has been increasingly utilized across a range of research themes, particularly within visceral pain and GI research. However, the normal baseline/resting range for CVT and its long-term reproducibility in healthy subjects of the parameter is incompletely understood and it is this significant knowledge gap that our multi-center study aimed to address.

### Vagus nerve stimulation boosts the drive to work for rewards [^116fGAvV]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

To summarize, we show that non-invasive taVNS increases invigoration to work for rewards without altering effort maintenance. Furthermore, taVNS alters the correspondence between invigoration and subjective ratings of wanting, effectively increasing participants' drive to approach less-wanted rewards. Collectively, our results indicate that taVNS alters motivation primarily by boosting the prospective benefit of work, not by altering the costs associated with maintaining effort. Moreover, as suggested by preclinical research, stimulation at the left ear exerts stronger effects on invigoration when food rewards are at stake. We conclude that taVNS may provide a promising brain stimulation technique to acutely improve motivational syndromes characterized by a lack of vigor to pursue rewards such as apathy, or anhedoniaas these symptoms might be partly caused by aberrant vagal signaling. Notwithstanding, it is unknown to date whether acute improvements can predict sustained therapeutic effects of potential taVNS-based treatments, which remains as a vital question for the translation to clinical settings. Our findings also add to the growing literature demonstrating the crucial role of peripheral interoceptive signals in tuning instrumental behavior according to metabolic needs. Intriguingly, our results corroborate recent theories suggesting that the gut–brain reward pathways may bypass the cognitive regulatory system by directly reinforcing behavior. Ultimately, this perspective may help to better understand the etiology of common motivational symptoms across disorders.

### Recent developments in esophageal motor disorders [^111mgrQM]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Over the past year, further insights into the control of esophageal motility and disturbances associated with motor disorders, and additional information about the treatment of esophageal motor disorders has emerged. This review outlines the major developments in these areas.

Recent Findings

The pharyngeal and esophageal phases of swallowing appear to be controlled by different areas within the vagal nuclei. Differences in the density and activation of calcium channels may explain differences in activity between the circular and clasp fibers of the lower esophageal sphincter and in the peristaltic function of the esophageal body. Tonic cholinergic input is the major determinant of esophageal tone. Experimental diabetes mellitus alters the mechanics of the esophageal body. Subtle abnormalities of peristalsis have been identified by high-resolution manometry and 24-hour ambulatory manometry that are not evident on standard manometry in patients with non-obstructive dysphagia. In achalasia, additional support has been provided for vagal damage in some patients with achalasia as well as evidence for a viral-induced immune damage to the myenteric plexus. The three main treatments for achalasia - botulinum toxin, pneumatic dilatation, and minimally invasive myotomy have been re-evaluated. Myotomy continues to provide the best results. Intraoperative manometry would seem to be a useful aid to minimize the risk of incomplete myotomy. The usefulness of glucagon in relieving food bolus obstruction has been revisited in a retrospective study.

Summary

These studies provide further information with which to more effectively manage esophageal motor disorders.

### Modulation of vagal tone enhances gastroduodenal motility and reduces somatic pain sensitivity [^115C2T6g]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The parasympathetic nervous system, whose main neural substrate is the vagus nerve, exerts a fundamental antinociceptive role and influences gastrointestinal sensori-motor function. Our research question was to whether combined electrical and physiological modulation of vagal tone, using transcutaneous electrical vagal nerve stimulation (t-VNS) and deep slow breathing (DSB) respectively, could increase musculoskeletal pain thresholds and enhance gastroduodenal motility in healthy subjects.

Methods

Eighteen healthy subjects were randomized to a subject-blinded, sham-controlled, cross-over study with an active protocol including stimulation of auricular branch of the vagus nerve, and breathing at full inspiratory capacity and forced full expiration. Recording of cardiac derived parameters including cardiac vagal tone, moderate pain thresholds to muscle, and bone pressure algometry, conditioned pain modulation using a cold pressor test and a liquid meal ultrasonographic gastroduodenal motility test were performed.

Key Results

Cardiac vagal tone increased during active treatment with t-VNS and DSB compared to sham (p = 0.009). In comparison to sham, thresholds to bone pain increased (p = 0.001), frequency of antral contractions increased (p = 0.004) and gastroduodenal motility index increased (p = 0.016) with active treatment. However, no effect on muscle pain thresholds and conditioned pain modulation was seen.

Conclusions & Inferences

This experimental study suggests that this noninvasive approach with combined electrical and physiological modulation of vagal tone enhances gastroduodenal motility and reduces somatic pain sensitivity. These findings warrant further investigation in patients with disorders characterized with chronic pain and gastrointestinal dysmotility such as functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome.

### Identification of the optimum vagal manoeuvre technique for maximising vagal tone [^115uSBWU]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the most effective technique for Valsalva Manoeuvre (VM) and Human Dive Reflex Manoeuvre (HDR) generation of vagal tone.

Methods

We conducted a repeated-measures trial of healthy adult volunteers from a university campus, aged 18–56years, in sinus rhythm. Participants were randomised to VM (in supine or Trendelenberg postures) and HDR (supine or sitting postures) sequentially. Participants performed three trials of each technique, in random order, with a continuous ECG recording. Single-blinded analysis of ECG data was conducted. Mean differences between premanoeuvre and postmanoeuvre R-R intervals and heart rates were calculated for each posture within and between vagal manoeuvres.

Results

Seventy-two participants were enrolled. The difference between VM (supine) and VM (Trendelenberg) was not significant at 0.008s (-0.023 to 0.038). The difference in mean R-R intervals for HDR (supine) was greater than HDR (sitting) 0.062 (0.031 to 0.093), although this significance was not reflected in a heart-rate change of -0.87 (-3.00 to 1.26). VM supine generated greatest overall mean R-R interval difference, while HDR (sitting) provided the smallest change in R-R interval. The VM (supine) provided a significant maximum effectiveness over the HDR (supine) of 0.102s (0.071 to 0.132).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that VM (supine) generates the greatest vagal tone producing the largest transient heart rate decrease in healthy volunteers. No advantage was identified in Trendelenberg posturing for the VM in this study. These results may assist in the standardisation of vagal manoeuvre technique for the range of therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

### Cardiac vagal efficiency is enhanced by percutaneous auricular neurostimulation in adolescents with nausea: moderation by antidepressant drug exposure [^116Y67gE]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Neuromodulation is being explored as an intervention for a variety of psychological and physical conditions, with vagus nerve stimulation as a common target. The vagus innervates organs throughout the body, including the digestive tract, and provides a channel for afferent activity from the visceral organs to the brainstem. Neurostimulation is an emerging therapy for many gastrointestinal (GI) conditions governed by disordered brain–gut signaling. Non‐pharmacological and alternative medicine therapies are frequently sought by families of children suffering from disorders of gut–brain interaction (DBGI), many who have experienced adverse reactions to drug therapies. Neurostimulation therapies are thus increasingly explored due to the concerning side effect profile of many pharmacological agents coupled with a lack of mechanistic support and insufficient evidence for their use in children.

DGBI are stress‐sensitive conditions with clinical features and comorbidities suggesting heightened autonomic reactivity and visceral sensitivity. Meta‐analyses and systematic reviews demonstrate that functional impairment of vagal regulation is implicated in the pathophysiology of several DGBI, functional somatic syndromes, and anxiety disorders. Vagal regulation can be indexed using power spectral analysis of heart rate variability, providing specific, rapid, and noninvasive assessment of neuromodulation effects on the vagus. Cardiac vagal tone can be measured by the amplitude of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA; also known as high‐frequency heart rate variability; HF‐HRV), an established and validated index that reflects changes in the signaling of the myelinated cardiac vagal pathway to the heart. More recently, the coupling strength of RSA to average heart period (HP) (time between heart beats) during physiological challenges was measured in pediatric DGBI using the vagal efficiency (VE) index. Reduced VE was documented in cohorts of children with both abdominal‐pain‐related DGBI and cyclic vomiting syndrome, indicating a possible mechanism and therapeutic target. A reduced VE was also found in a subset of DGBI patients with a therapeutic response to auricular percutaneous electrical nerve field stimulation (PENFS). However, studies are needed to examine whether vagal function indices such as VE are acutely responsive to stimulation.

4 VAGAL BRAKE AND VAGAL EFFICIENCY

In humans, the ventral vagal efferent pathways to the heart function as a brake. The intrinsic rate of the heart in the healthy human, even without sympathetic excitation, is significantly faster than the resting heart rate. Thus, under most conditions, the vagus, primarily via myelinated vagal fibers originating in the nucleus ambiguus, actively inhibit heart rate. However, when there is a need to engage actively with select elements in the environment, neurons originating at higher levels inhibit the brainstem regulation of homeostatic needs, and cardiac output is rapidly increased to match metabolic demands.

Under these situations, there is a transitory withdrawal of the vagal tone to the heart to increase heart rate, which defines the removal of the vagal brake. The vagal brake represents the actions of engaging and disengaging the ventral vagal influence on the heart's pacemaker. In addition, the release of the vagal brake on the heart also enables tonic underlying sympathetic excitation to exert more influence on the autonomic nervous system and inhibit gut motility.

Polyvagal Theory does not interpret homeostasis as being locked to a set point but is more consistent with the construct of allostasis, which also emphasizes the dynamic adjustment of autonomic function to match the metabolic demands of behavior. However, Polyvagal Theory focuses on the specific role of the ventral vagal brake as an important neural pathway in serving this purpose.

Vagal efficiency (VE), as a metric, evaluates the dynamic functional impact of efferent vagal fibers on heart rate. In mammals, chronotropic vagal influences are primarily conveyed via efferent fibers originating in nucleus ambiguus, the source nucleus of the ventral vagus, that terminate on the sinoatrial node. This relationship has led scientists to assume that heart rate, in the absence of sympathetic excitation, would be tightly coupled with dynamic changes in vagal tone. However, the ventral vagal pathway to the heart is more complex and the dynamic vagal influence on the pacemaker is influenced by brainstem mechanisms. For example, brainstem mechanisms producing a respiratory rhythm functionally gate the efferent vagal influence on the heart and produce a dynamically changing transitory respiratory pattern in heart rate known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA is functionally the modulation of the myelinated ventral vagal fibers by a brainstem cardio‐pulmonary oscillator.

### Genetic loci associated with heart rate variability and their effects on cardiac disease risk [^112ZkDQc]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a physiological variation in cardiac cycle duration. When measured under supine or sitting conditions, resting HRV is most prominently centred around the frequency of respiration (∼0.25 Hz) and the intrinsic blood pressure rhythm (∼0.1 Hz). This reflects modulation of tonic activity in the cardiac vagal nerves originating in cortical and subcortical nucleiby oscillatory input at the brainstem level from cardiorespiratory coupling, lung stretch-reflexes, and arterial chemo- and baroreceptors. This vagal gating gives rise to oscillatory vagal effects on the pacemaker potentials in the sinoatrial node that scales with the tonic activity in the vagal nerves and provides a source of beat-to-beat variation in heart rate. Due to its good reproducibilityand ease of measurement, HRV is a widely used non-invasive research and clinical tool to quantify the degree of vagal control of heart rate.

### Conversion from vagal to sympathetic predominance with strenuous training in high-performance world class athletes [^115hEg9N]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Benefits of moderate endurance training include increases in parasympathetic activity and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and a relative decrease in sympathetic tone. However, the effect of very intensive training load on neural cardiovascular regulation is not known. We tested the hypothesis that strenuous endurance training, like in high-performance athletes, would enhance sympathetic activation and reduce vagal inhibition.

Methods and Results

We studied the entire Italian junior national team of rowing (n = 7) at increasing training loads up to 75% and 100% of maximum, the latter approximately 20 days before the Rowing World Championship. Autoregressive power spectral analysis was used to investigate RR interval and blood pressure (BP) variabilities. BRS was assessed by the sequences method. Increasing training load up to 75% of maximum was associated with a progressive resting bradycardia and increased indexes of cardiac vagal modulation and BRS. However, at 100% training load these effects were reversed, with increases in resting heart rate, diastolic BP, low-frequency RR interval, and BP variabilities and decreases in high-frequency RR variability and BRS. Three athletes later won medals in the World Championship.

Conclusions

This study indicates that very intensive endurance training shifted the cardiovascular autonomic modulation from a parasympathetic toward a sympathetic predominance. This finding should be interpreted within the context of the substantial role played by the sympathetic nervous system in increasing cardiovascular performance at peak training. Whether the altered BP and autonomic function shown in this study might be in time hazardous to human cardiovascular system remains to be established.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Sinus node dysfunction — synopsis and supportive considerations emphasize that the goal of anti-bradycardia therapy in SND is to increase the heart rate so that cardiac output is normalized, and the perfusion of brain and other end organs is maintained to meet physiologic demand, and because there is no established minimum heart rate below which treatment is indicated, identifying temporal correlation between symptoms and bradycardia is important when deciding on the necessity of therapy; healthy young individuals, particularly athletes, have sinus bradycardia that is not associated with symptoms, with resting sinus rates that can be well below 40 bpm, and in almost all cases patients are completely asymptomatic and anti-bradycardia therapy is not indicated and the patient should be reassured; complications associated with PPM implantation range from 3% to 7% and there are significant long-term implications for pacing systems that use transvenous leads; significant sinus bradycardia (rates < 40 bpm) or pauses (> 5 seconds) are common during such periods and have been observed across a wide age range, high vagal tone can also affect the atrioventricular node and cause transient and varying degrees of conduction abnormality that is asymptomatic in nearly all cases, and nocturnal sinus bradycardia or pause is a relatively common phenomenon; SND commonly manifests as sinus bradycardia or recurrent sinus pauses, and because SND is not a life-threatening condition, the benefit of permanent cardiac pacing is essentially symptom relief and quality of life (QOL) improvement; for this reason, asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients have no indication for permanent pacing even if they were to have electrophysiologic evidence of SND, and when symptoms suggestive of bradycardia occur in the absence of bradycardia, permanent pacing has no clinical benefit and should not be performed.

### Is cardiac autonomic control affected in major depressive disorder? A systematic review of heart rate variability studies [^116KTGu2]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent work also highlighted a relationship between HRV and inflammatory markers. This is important because inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis of CVD. While acetylcholine released from the vagus inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production, reduced vagal tone leads to heightened inflammatory state and development of CVD, therefore suggesting that changes in HRV may precede the development of these other critical 'downstream' risk markers.

Interestingly, different neuromodulation techniques, such as vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and potentially deep brain stimulation, targeting key structures that are affected in depression, have proven to be successful and effective in providing clinical benefits and depressive symptom improvement. Moreover, these techniques showed subsequent positive effects on cardiac measures, possibly increasing parasympathetic tone. Specifically, VNS showed consistently to decelerate HR and normalize HRV.

In accordance, the results we obtained, which suggest a decrement in vagal activity, further support the use of the VNS that, by intervening in the modulation of the brain-heart pathway, could provide benefits also in autonomic regulation. The concomitant improvements in MDD both in mood and autonomic regulation suggest a possible overlap between a frontal-vagal (brain-heart) network and brain areas that are affected in MDD. These considerations also lend further support to the neurovisceral integration model, which proposes that decreased parasympathetic tone may be the common pathway linking negative affective states and conditions to ill health. Whether these autonomic tests could also be used as biological markers of depression and whether they would have any prognostic value are important questions that need to be answered soon.

Effect of antidepressant treatments

When assessing the relationship between depression and HRV, a first key question that arises is whether the association between MDD and CVD could be mediated by the side effects of antidepressant medications. Our study, which included only drug-naïve and drug-free MDD patients, suggests that MDD itself is an independent factor for low HRV and increased risk of developing CVD.

Consequently, a second question that emerges is whether the use of antidepressants in MDD patients without pre-existing CVD can further influence cardiac autonomic modulation, potentially even worsening HRV. While evidence indicates that antidepressant treatments can affect HRV, a clear picture of these mechanisms has yet to be defined, except for tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Heterogeneity was observed between different types of treatment, such as TCAs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), mirtazapine, and nefazodone.

### Effects of rapid saline infusion on orthostatic intolerance and autonomic tone after 20 days bed rest [^113qoYKm]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

To test whether acute volume expansion can normalize orthostatic intolerance and autonomic tone after prolonged bed rest (BR), 23 men were subjected to 20 days BR. Left ventricular (LV) echocardiography was performed during the lower body negative pressure (LBNP) test before and after BR with and without preceding rapid infusion of saline (1,500 ml/30 min). Saline infusion restored heart rate, LV dimension, and stroke volume during LBNP, increased cardiac output (from 4.1 ± 1 to 5.3 ± 1 L/min), and normalized LBNP tolerance time (from 11 ± 4 to 23 ± 6 minutes). In 9 men, a Holter electrocardiogram was recorded on the day before BR, the fourth and twentieth days of BR, and the day after BR. The high-frequency component of heart rate variability during sleep gradually decreased and reached the lowest level on the day after BR (100%, 66 ± 16%, 39 ± 18%, 10 ± 8%). Thus, restoring decreased blood volume is an effective countermeasure for orthostatic intolerance after BR. However, decreased vagal tone persisted, suggesting reset autonomic tone.

### Ten-year follow-up of cardiac function and neural regulation in a group of amateur half-marathon runners [^1139evzd]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Even with a small study population, our findings provide some detail on the controversial issue of the benefits or disadvantages of different levels of physical training through the years. This sample, although small, is of particular interest given its age and the long follow-up at 10 years. In fact, establishing whether endurance physical activity is beneficial in athletes in their 50s or 60s is an important issue.

Of notice, most athletes continued to practice regular physical exercise through the years, although the mean hours of training per week dropped, although still in a range of training that can be considered at least moderate.

Interestingly, at FU the athletes, in addition to a slight increase in ANSI, suggestive of improved cardiac autonomic regulation, showed a decreased sympathetic modulation directed to the heart and an enhanced vagal one, as mirrored by an higher HF RR, nu and a lower LF RR and LF RR, nu compared with B. This observation is somehow opposite to what expected during the physiological ageing process, which is characterised by a progressive increase of the sympathetic tone and a decrease of the vagal one. This apparent discrepancy could just reflect the effect of the reduced amount of physical exercise weekly in a group of athletes used to train much more and to have high cardiac sympathetic modulation at rest. If so, a regular and strenuous endurance exercise practiced at the time of the first studylikely elicited a transient increase of cardiac sympathetic drive, that is, reversible by the modification of training intensity, that did not represent a risk factor for the development of echocardiographic abnormalities or cardiovascular disease.

### Sex differences in cardiac arrhythmia: a consensus document of the European Heart Rhythm Association, endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society and Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society [^114HP2hk]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Cardiac autonomic regulation — sex differences in heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) are highlighted, noting that autonomic regulation plays an important role in arrhythmogenesis and that sex differences in cardiac autonomic status and cardiovascular autonomic reflexes need to be considered. Premenopausal adult women have faster heart rates than men, with women having consistently higher heart rates than age matched males between the ages of 20 to about 50 years, after which the difference gradually diminishes and eventually disappears mostly because of a heart rate decline in females. Compared with men, spectral analyses of HRV in women have reported an increase in high-frequency components associated with vagal modulation of the sinoatrial node, and the ratio between the low-frequency and high-frequency components is consequently lower in women; in both sexes, heart rate variability decreases with advancing age. Little data exist on autonomic responses to standardized provocations, but sympathetically active challenges lead to larger autonomic shifts in women, and strong sympathetic inputs may even abolish the sex difference altogether.

### Mechanisms of metabolic surgery effectiveness in obesity and type 2 diabetes: a puzzle with some known pieces [^114b14L1]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Piece no. 3: Effect of high-calorie diet on VAFs

What are the harmful effects of a diet that is too high in calories on the neurovegetative system?

In experimental animals, prolonged intake of diets rich in fats or sugars (hypercaloric) alters vagal afferent signaling and the biophysical properties of the gut–brain vagal axis. This includes reduced excitability of afferent vagal neurons (reduced vagal activation), reduced sensitivity of their receptors, and impairment of the vagovagal reflexes.

Plasticity changes (i.e. the ability of neurons to change their shape and function in response to environmental alterations) also occur. Morphological alterations in neurons, such as increased size and dendritic arborization, are associated with these changes.

Animals with obesity experience a decrease in the excitability of vagal afferent neurons, leading to reduced activation in response to hormonal metabolic signals from the gut. This reduced sensitivity requires a higher stimulus (hunger) to elicit an appropriate action potential. The threshold required to activate the gastric mechanoreceptors also increases.

This leads to excessive food consumption owing to the reduced suppressive effects of intestinal nutrients and reduced satiety, hyperphagia, and weight gain. This also applies to people with obesity, in whom food signaling from the GI tract is altered because of the reduced sensitivity of the intestinal vagal afferents.

RYGB corrects many of these effects. This reversibility suggests that vagovagal neurocircuits are open to modulation and adaptation and may represent targets for obesity therapy (see below). After SG, the NTS sprouts new vagal afferents (an increase in axonal collaterals) and forms new synapses.

### Effects of cocaine on heart rate variability in healthy subjects [^1129GH3U]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

In this study, we found that cocaine decreased the high-frequency power of heart rate variability in normal volunteers, implicating a decrease in vagal tone. However, the results of our autonomic blocking studies indicated the opposite, suggesting a major influence of cardiac sympathetic drive on the high-frequency power of heart rate variability.

### Enteric neuropathy and the vagus nerve: therapeutic implications [^112V8MEZ]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

3 THE VAGUS NERVE: A MAJOR ELEMENT OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM

The ANS is composed of the parasympathetic (VNs, and pelvic nerves originated from the sacral parasympathetic nucleus) and the sympathetic nervous system (splanchnic nerves). There is a balance between both components of the ANS, which can be assessed by heart rate variability (HRV). An imbalance of the ANS, represented by a sympathetic hyperactivity and/or a low vagal activity is reported in numerous conditions. Autonomic dysfunction has been reported in several GI motility disorders; CIPO associated with diabetes or neurologic disorders, for example, is related to mainly vagal dysfunctionwhile chronic refractory constipation is associated with a decrease in parasympathetic and an increase in sympathetic activity during high amplitude propagating pressure waves.

A low vagal tone is correlated with low motility. In type 1 diabetes, for example, GI symptoms and cardiac vagal tone correlate with gut transit times and motility index while a significant increase of gastric motility index and colonic transit time were observed in patients with low cardiac vagal tone. A normalization of meal‐induced antral motility in functional dyspepsia can be induced through a vagally‐mediated cephalic stimulation by chewing gum, thus arguing that such an hypomotility is due to insufficient vagal activation. In diabetic patients with delayed gastric emptying, both antral dysmotility and impaired autonomic gastric innervation most likely participate in the observed dysfunction. An impaired meal‐induced volume response is also observed in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, again most likely due to a low vagal tone.

Thus, enhancing vagal tone by gum chewing, deep breathing, moderate pressure massage therapy, or other exercises improving heart rate and its variability, or through VN stimulation (VNS), may have beneficial prokinetic effects.

### Understanding the somatic consequences of depression: biological mechanisms and the role of depression symptom profile [^115RHuUr]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysregulation

Acute stress results in immediate activation of sympathetic nerves and reduction of parasympathetic nerves in order to prepare the body for a fight or flight response. An indication of autonomic activity can be obtained from looking at catecholamine levels. Indeed, some older studies indicate a tendency for the urinary excretion of noradrenaline and its metabolites to be diminished, whereas other reports document elevated plasma levels of noradrenaline. A more direct way of measuring autonomic tone is by measuring noradrenaline spillover to plasma in patients with MDD. A recent noradrenaline spillover study among MDD patients by Barton et al. found sympathetic nervous activity to be high, including the sympathetic outflow to the heart, but this was restricted to only a subgroup of MDD patients.

Such invasive spillover studies are unfortunately not easily implementable in large psychiatric cohorts, restricting our insights into generalizability of results and the role of potential underlying confounding factors. That is why many researchers have used non-invasive, but more indirect indicators of autonomic tone, for example, obtained from electrical and impedance cardiography assessments. A non-invasive method for autonomic dysregulation assessment is heart rate variability (HRV), particularly in the respiratory frequency range, as an indicator of cardiac vagal control. HRV reflects an individual's capacity for parasympathetic inhibition of autonomic arousal in emotional expression and regulation, and is an important predictor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Depression is hypothesized to involve an autonomic nervous system that is in a relative state of more sympathetic and less parasympathetic activation. According to the polyvagal theory, this is partly due to the fact that impairments of low vagal tone are associated with reduced social engagement and a less flexible behavioral response to environmental changes.

### Normal values and reproducibility of the real-time index of vagal tone in healthy humans: a multi-center study [^11759dk8]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

The ANS has been the focus of research across a number of disciplines in gastroenterology including IBD, functional GI disorders and hepatology. However, differing study designs, for instance comparing baseline/resting autonomic tone and response to a stimulus, makes the meaningful interpretation and comparison a significant challenge both to the basic scientist and clinician. This is notwithstanding the bewildering and complex array of autonomic parameters reported across the literature based on both frequency and time domain analysis of HRV. CVT in its most simple terms reduces these challenges to a degree in that its interpretation is more intuitive and its phraseology is arguably easier to understand. Given these assertions, in combination with the aforementioned temporal benefits, it is an attractive parameter in GI research, which may allow the further delineation and refinement of our understanding and the contribution of the PNS to the pathophysiology of many GI disorders. Nevertheless, it remains largely unresolved whether the measurement of ANS measures derived from cardiac chronotropy truly reflect the degree of autonomic tone within the gut and to the best of our knowledge has not been systematically studied (Fig. 2). Whilst this controversy, to the best of our knowledge, has not been objectively determined, measurement of rectal mucosal blood flow (RMBF) by laser Doppler flowmetry has been used in a number of studies. RMBF reflects the level of activity of autonomic innervation specifically to the rectum, although it must be noted that this technique does have a high degree of intra-operator variability. To date, RMBF and cardiac derived autonomic parameters have not been systematically compared and remains, in our opinion, a key knowledge gap within the field.

### Associations of infant feeding with body composition and cardiometabolic health in young female university students [^112cZaWo]. Journal of Women's Health (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low resting heart rate is associated with lower risk for cardiovascular and noncardiovascular premature mortality. Although the resting heart rate is a highly variable parameter that is influenced by numerous factors, including sex (higher in women), obesity, waist girth, and blood pressure (BP), the resting heart rate is mainly determined by cardiac vagal control. It is well known that endurance training is associated with low resting heart rate. Breastfeeding shifts maternal and infant's autonomic nervous system balance toward relatively greater parasympathetic and lesser sympathetic activity; the opposite occurs with bottle feeding. It has been reported that repeated vagal tone measurements (assessed via heart rate recovery) were associated with breastfeeding and physical activity at preschool age. However, there is a dearth of evidence in adults due probably to many confounders.

Breast milk contains more cholesterol than infant formula, and breastfed infants had increased plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and reduced endogenous cholesterol synthesis. Long-term consequences of breastfeeding on cholesterol were inconclusive: initial breastfeeding (particularly when exclusive) was associated with lower blood cholesterol in somebut not in other systematic reviews. These were based largely on observational studies, which were carried out in mostly high-income countries from western world, and studies from developed Asian countries are limited. Because some studies suggested a stronger effect in women, the present study tested whether infant feeding was associated with body composition and cardiometabolic health, including lipid profile and a marker of autonomic nervous function in young Japanese female university students of Mukogawa Women's University, in whom the socioeconomic status was less heterogenous.

For example, > 90% of grade 1 students are 18 years old. This approach may decrease the interference of age and environmental factors, including smoking, alcohol, educational, and socioeconomic status. Further, in almost all students, almost all school expenses were covered by parents, suggesting that socioeconomic status appears to be less heterogeneous among mothers who fed participants of the present study. We assessed current dietary intake of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol, which may be related to blood lipid profile.

Autonomic Nervous System Alterations in Cardiopulmonary-Related Sleep Disorders

Background

Diurnal and circadian influences on cardiovascular function

Multiple aspects of the cardiovascular system display prominent diurnal variation due to the influences of circadian rhythms, sleep–wake states, and sleep disorders (particularly sleep apnea but also periodic limb movements) and associated changes in ANS function. Specifically, diurnal variations in cardiac electrophysiology (including PR and QT interval length, heart rate, HRV, propensity for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, and ion channel activity), blood pressure, cardiac output, MI, stroke, and SCD are well described and are at least partially mediated by the ANS. Heart rate and rhythm, blood pressure, and cardiac output are regulated by the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems through circulating neurohumoral factors (cortisol, catecholamines) and proinflammatory cytokines that display circadian rhythmicity. Atrial arrhythmias are most likely to occur during the night when vagal tone is highest, whereas ventricular arrhythmias are more likely to occur during the early morning when sympathetic activity increases. Blood pressure typically declines by at least 10% at night relative to the day, attributable to increased parasympathetic activity during sleep. OSA may obliterate (or even reverse) this "dipping" pattern due to the sympathetic surges that occur with obstructive respiratory events. Although the mediating mechanisms linking circadian and sleep–wake states and sleep disturbances to cardiac physiology involve autonomic pathways, the specific mechanisms underlying these associations are only partially understood. An improved understanding of the roles of circadian and sleep physiology in cardiopulmonary disease may enhance the identification of at-risk populations, vulnerable time periods for adverse cardiac events, and optimal times for administration of chronotherapy-directed interventions. Specific elucidation of the roles of ANS alterations that occur with disorders of circadian rhythms, sleep–wake states, and sleep disorders may further help identify novel therapeutic targets and interventions.

### Internal senses of the vagus nerve [^111kAjaX]. Neuron (2022). Medium credibility.

The vagus nerve is an indispensable body-brain connection that controls vital aspects of autonomic physiology like breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, and gut motility, reflexes like coughing and swallowing, and survival behaviors like feeding, drinking, and sickness responses. Classical physiological studies and recent molecular/genetic approaches have revealed a tremendous diversity of vagal sensory neuron types that innervate different internal organs, with many cell types remaining poorly understood. Here, we review the state of knowledge related to vagal sensory neurons that innervate the respiratory, cardiovascular, and digestive systems. We focus on cell types and their response properties, physiological/behavioral roles, engaged neural circuits and, when possible, sensory receptors. We are only beginning to understand the signal transduction mechanisms used by vagal sensory neurons and upstream sentinel cells, and future studies are needed to advance the field of interoception to the level of mechanistic understanding previously achieved for our external senses.

### Inflammation, heart disease, and depression [^114QNyPh]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease is exceedingly high worldwide. Depressive illness afflicts a significant portion of the population worldwide. Epidemiological studies have confirmed the high co-morbidity between these two entities and the co-morbidity is bidirectional. Systems that contribute to this co-morbidity include the central and autonomic nervous systems, the neuroendocrine, immune, vascular and hematologic systems. Specific pathophysiologic factors include imbalance between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic systems, sympathoadrenal activation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation, immune system dysregulation with release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, platelet activation and hypercoaguability. Inflammation occurs in cardiac and cardiovascular pathology independent of the presence or absence of depression and in depression. Inflammation is closely associated with endothelial dysfunction which is a preamble to atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis. A likely common instigator underlying this co-morbidity is mental stress leading to sustained sympathetic overdrive and diminished vagal tone. Diminished vagal tone contributes to a pro-inflammatory status which affects neurotransmitter regulation, specifically serotonergic transmission. Stress hormones and certain pro-inflammatory substances released by macrophages and microglia upregulate the rate-limiting enzymes in the metabolic pathway of tryptophan. This results in a shunt in tryprophan metabolism away from serotonin formation and down the kynurenine pathway with resulting formation of neurotoxic metabolites.

### The VITAH trial VITamin D supplementation and cardiac autonomic tone in hemodialysis: a blinded, randomized controlled trial [^112C3bQr]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiac autonomic tone

Cardiac autonomic tone is derived from beat to beat measurements of the time intervals between successive QRS intervals, specifically RR intervals. Measurement of HRV provides direct insight into abnormalities of the autonomic nervous system, which consists of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the parasympathetic (vagal) nervous system (PNS) limbs. HRV assesses the dynamic interaction and balance between the SNS and PNS at the level of the heart, overall providing a measure of cardiac autonomic competence. The a priori main outcomes of interest are measures of the frequency domain as these parameters are direct measures of cardiac autonomic tone and are most commonly described in the ESKD study population. No one parameter of HRV has been established as superior in regards to their predictive ability as surrogate markers for adverse cardiovascular events.

Decreased HRV is associated with an increased risk of arrhythmias and cardiac death in both the general population and patients with ESKD on dialysis. Further, alterations in HRV occur more frequently in dialysis patients and corresponds with an increased risk of SCD and cardiovascular mortality. In a study of 30 ESKD patients, 53% had autonomic dysfunction, in which 40% was isolated to the vagal (PNS) limb and 13% had combined sympathetic and vagal dysfunction. Similarly, HRV findings in a study of 239 hemodialysis patients demonstrated drastic sympathetic over-activity and vagal withdrawal. Another study of 383 patients with ESKD on hemodialysis found that impaired cardiac autonomic tone was independently associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Although HRV is a surrogate measurement, it has been established as an important and validated, non-invasive measure of cardiovascular-related mortality risk in the ESKD population. Consequently, interventions enhancing measures of HRV, and therefore influencing cardiac autonomic control, could potentially have considerable survival benefits in the high-risk ESKD patient population.

### Disorders of gut-brain interaction through the lens of polyvagal theory [^112Dpi7w]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

3 POLYVAGAL THEORY

Polyvagal Theory emerged as a solution to another vagal paradox, one in which vagal activity to the heart was conceptualized as calming and supporting health, while the other was potentially lethal. In heart rate, the beneficial influence was observed as the respiratory component of heart rate variability and the detrimental influence was observed as bradycardia.

Identifying the vagal mechanisms underlying the paradox evolved into the "Polyvagal Theory". In developing the theory, the anatomy, development, evolutionary history, and function of the two vagal systems were identified as follows: one system was potentially lethal, while the other system was protective. The two vagal pathways originated in different areas of the brainstem. Through the study of comparative anatomy, it can be inferred that the two vagal circuits evolved sequentially. This sequence was further observed during mammalian embryology and early postnatal development.

### Rehabilitation program combining physical exercise and heart rate variability biofeedback in hematologic patients: a feasibility study [^1177Gwtg]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Regarding the program's effectiveness on HRV, we observed no significant improvements in either global variability characterized by SDNN and TP, or in vagal tone represented by RMSSD and HF spectral power. However, HRVB produced a peak power in LF band corresponding to high synchronization between cardiac and respiratory systems when respiration rates were approximately 6 breath/min, which corresponds to vagal tone modulations on the sino-atrial node. Therefore, the increase in both LF band and coherence score (Table 4) suggests that patients were able to achieve cardiac coherence state and could reflect a possible mobilization of vagal regulation at rest. Other studies using HRVB in patients with various chronic illnesses provide similar results with respect to an increase in the LF band of the HRV signal, which the authors interpreted as an increase in vagal tone. Although results regarding SDNN and TP are inconclusive, the feasibility of HRVB in hematologic patients encourages the testing of a larger sample to determine the effectiveness of the rehabilitation program on HRV. The high inter-individual variability in cancer patients could explain the absence of significant increases of SDNN and TP in our study, especially since other results showed an increase in HRV after programs of both physical exercise and HRVB.

In conclusion, a rehabilitation program combining PE and HRVB is feasible in hematologic patients and effective on physical function. However, further research with larger sample sizes and randomized controlled study designs is needed to investigate effectiveness on patients' autonomic function. In addition, impacts on patient symptomatology, post-treatment recovery, and quality of life should be studied to better understand the challenges of rehabilitation programs based on non-pharmacological interventions such as PE and HRVB.

Figure 1
Effects of low‐level transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation.

Patients with heart failure have a low vagal tone and high sympathetic activity. Low‐level transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation via the auricular branch leads to an increase in efferent vagal activity and resultant increased parasympathetic tone with a decreased sympathetic tone. Parasympathetic activation results in attenuation of inflammation, which is one of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Low‐level transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to improve outcomes in both animal models and patients with HFpEF.

Similarly, the majority of studies in patients with cardiovascular disease report that parasympathetic tone, as inferred from heart rate variability, is inversely related to inflammatory markers (IL-6 and CRP). Finally, increased morbidity and mortality following cardiac surgery, myocardial infarction, sepsis, RA, IBD, lupus erythematosus and sarcoidosis have been reported to be associated with decreased VN activity. Whereas these data suggest that reduced vagal tone increases the setpoint of the immune response with a subtle rise in proinflammatory cytokines and increased disease risk, increased vagal tone resulting from elevated intracranial pressure has been proposed as mechanism underlying the observed immune paralysis in patients with traumatic brain injury. Taken together, these data provide indirect evidence that basal vagal tone may represent an important determinant of the risk to develop or have progression of disease. The finding that exercise or dietary interventions, such as fish oil supplementation to enhance vagal tone may partly explain their beneficial effect on general health.

The final evidence that the vagal anti-inflammatory pathway is indeed a breakthrough for the clinical management of immune-mediated inflammatory disease will ultimately have to come from clinical trials evaluating the different strategies discussed above. Selective α7nAChR agonists are currently evaluated as potential therapeutic drugs for the treatment of cognitive impairments in schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. To date, however, only a very limited number of studies have been performed to evaluate their anti-inflammatory potential in humans. Based on the observation that the selective α7nAChR agonist GTS-21 attenuated cytokine production by stimulated whole blood and human monocytes more potently than nicotine, its effect was tested in a human endotoxin model. However, no significant reduction in cytokine response to endotoxin injection in healthy subjects was observed between GTS-21 and placebo-treated subjects. Clinical studies evaluating the effect of specific α7nAChR are therefore awaited with great interest. Alternatively, more physiological activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway using enteral feeding of a high fat solution may represent an interesting approach, for example, to prevent POI.

### Normal values and reproducibility of the real-time index of vagal tone in healthy humans: a multi-center study [^117SfsgT]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Over the recent past, CVT has been increasingly utilized, particularly in GI pain, nociceptive physiological and wider research in the field of psychosomatic medicine. The ANS has provided an attractive candidate for linking psychological traits with physical symptoms as it integrates with regions of the brain associated with pain, interoception and behavior. However, a considerable methodological draw back as Tillisch notes, has been " the inability to measure the ANS in action throughout the body". Arguably, within the literature, the most widely utilized proxy measures of autonomic tone in humans are surrogates derived from spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) yet they are not without methodological limitations. For instance, many of the validated measures of HRV are inaccurate in epochs of less than 1 min, which should therefore limit experimental design, although this is not always the case. Not surprisingly therefore, many studies using HRV, across a diverse array of academic disciplines, have reported disappointingly inconsistent results. CVT however transcends many of these difficulties, allowing researchers to interrogate and study smaller epochs of interest, which may, in future, further its applications in GI research. A recent example of this is a study by Paine et al, who demonstrated for the first time co-activation of the SNS and PNS in response to a painful visceral stimulus using CVT and CSB. The traditional and dogmatic understanding would have predicted a classical "fight or flight" response in response to an acutely painful stimulus, being characterized by SNS activation with concomitant PNS withdrawal. These data highlight the knowledge gaps that remain in our understanding of the response of the ANS to acutely stressful stimuli.

### Heart rate variability and vagal tone in schizophrenia: a review [^112GgLvN]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2015). Low credibility.

Recent heart rate variability (HRV) research has identified diminished levels of parasympathetic activity among schizophrenia patients. Over two dozen empirically-based studies have been published on this topic; primarily over the last decade. However, no theoretical review appears to have been published on this work. Further, only one empirical study has evaluated HRV research findings in the context of documented hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity in schizophrenia. HRV research indicates that no abnormalities exist in the initial sympathetic stress response of schizophrenia patients. However, evidence has consistently demonstrated that patients exhibit a diminished capacity to recover from a stress response as a result of deficits in parasympathetic activity. Moreover, this diminished parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) response, also known as decreased vagal tone, has been found to relate to increased symptom severity. Although these findings may cause speculation that the observed vagal tone disruption merely results from anxiety produced by the presence of positive symptomology, additional studies have identified similar parasympathetic dysfunction among nonpsychotic relatives of individuals with schizophrenia. We posit that the resulting sympathovagal imbalance leads to an overall sympathetic dominance despite the fact that sympathetic nervous system activity is not abnormally elevated among patients. Implications are discussed within the context of the diathesis-stress/vulnerability-stress model, including the potential for identifying a mechanism of action by which environmental stressors may contribute to triggering first-episode psychosis.

### New horizons in the ageing autonomic nervous system: orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension [^111ZABBw]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

These changes occur within seconds, and may manifest as a transient increase in heart rate, a small decrease in systolic BP and rise in diastolic BP. Usually this occurs without symptoms or consequence.

Conversely, when BP rises, baroreceptors and mechanoceptors sense increased stretch and inhibit sympathetic activity. Simultaneously parasympathetic tone is activated via the parasympathetic nervous system's (PNS) main effector, the vagus nerve. Acetylcholine is released from cardiac ganglia, acting on muscarinic receptors and lowering heart rate, contractility and BP.

The two arms of the autonomic nervous system (the SNS and PNS) work together in finely tuned harmony, regulating the BP on a moment-by-moment basis. A healthy system is flexible and responsive, and is capable of reacting to sudden bursts of activity and stress, (mediated by the SNS) and periods of rest and recovery (via the PNS). The reflex arc can be disrupted at multiple points. For example, impairment may occur at the sensing stretch receptors, in the afferent nerves to the brainstem, in the brain and central autonomic network, the efferent pre- and post-ganglionic neurons to the effector organs, the ganglia themselves, or neurotransmitter production and transmission.

### Heart rate variability, deceleration capacity of heart rate, and death: a veteran twins study [^117B3RJ2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The autonomic nervous system controls basic bodily functions such as heartbeat, digestion, respiration, and blood pressure. Dysregulation of the autonomic system can be a consequence of many diseases or adverse exposures, and is associated with various pathological conditions, such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and death. Autonomic function can be measured noninvasively using heart rate variability (HRV), which provides indices of beat‐to‐beat heart rate fluctuations over time derived from electrocardiographic monitoring data. Reduced HRV is indicative of an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic modulationand has been associated with death primarily in individuals with known CVD.,

While traditional measures of HRV signal autonomic dysregulation, they do not distinguish between vagal and sympathetic effects. Time domain HRV indices have also been criticized for not being specific to physiological mechanisms. With recent progress in passive sensing technologies, novel indices have been extracted from ECG data. Some of these measures, such as distribution entropy, provide advances in the analysis of complex heart rate fluctuation patterns that may have prognostic significance, but their physiological underpinnings remain unclear.

Deceleration capacity (DC) of heart rate is one such novel metric, but it carries specific physiological significance as a marker of vagal function on the heart, as it indexes the rate of deceleration of the heart rate in short intervals that are consistent with vagal activity. This metric, therefore, should allow more direct examination of the relationship of vagal function with health outcomes. Indeed, DC has revealed strong prognostic value in clinical samples with known CVD, with a predictive ability often stronger than conventional HRV metrics.

Few studies have evaluated the association of HRV and, specifically, DC, with the risk of death in the general population. Those that have studied community samples have typically examined a limited spectrum of HRV domains. In addition, no prior study of death has evaluated daytime and nighttime metrics separately. As autonomic function can be influenced by physical activity and daily stressors during the day, as well as sleep disturbances during the night, examining daytime and nighttime separately may provide incremental predictive information over 24‐hour measurements only.

### Learning of food preferences: mechanisms and implications for obesity&metabolic diseases [^1142jWjD]. International Journal of Obesity (2021). Medium credibility.

Another unanswered question is whether the changes in energy intake resulting from specific pathway deletions have any long-lasting effects on energy regulation and the development of obesity, as quantitative or qualitative changes in food intake do not necessarily lead to changes in body weight. For example, would silencing glucose-sensitive NTS neurons which suppress 24-h sugar intake lead to long-term reductions in the intake of sugar-rich drinks or foods and thereby attenuate sugar-induced obesity? Tools are now available to carry out inducible deletions of specific populations of vagal afferent neurons. Given that at least some pathways include vagal afferent signaling, could it be that the numbing of vagal afferent function observed in high-fat fed mice includes these critical vagal afferent populations, and what implications might this have on the course of obesity?

Bariatric surgeries are currently the most effective treatment option for obesity, and there is great interest in deciphering the mechanisms for their success. A role for vagal afferents contained within the celiac branches in the weight loss effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery has been demonstrated in rats, but it is not known whether the surgical celiac branch vagotomy affected the vagal afferents mediating the neuropod signal described by Buchanan et al. or the vagal afferent neurons described by Tan et al. In another study in rats, the common hepatic branch of the left vagus, which was implicated in the detection of the sugar signal by Fernandes et al. was not required for the weight-lowering effects of RYGB. It was claimed that a gut-vagal afferent-striatal pathway is recruited by RYGB to reduce fat appetite in obese rats. However, when this pathway was interrupted with total subdiaphragmatic truncal vagotomy (SDV), RYGB reduced body weight to exactly the same extent as in sham vagotomized rats. Again, the discrepancy in these outcomes could be due to the issues with non-selectivity of SDV and common hepatic branch vagotomy that were described above.

### Vagus nerve modulation of inflammation: cardiovascular implications [^114pX8zk]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The vagus nerve modulates inflammatory responses in various organ systems. Emerging evidence indicates that the vagus can have profound and complex effects on cardiovascular function, remodeling, arrhythmias, and mortality by several mechanisms. In heart failure and during ischemia, an adverse inflammatory response can occur. The vagus nerve may modulate cardiovascular disease and outcomes by affecting inflammatory responses. Here, evidence for and components of the vagus inflammatory reflex are reviewed and evidence for and implications of effects of vagus activation on inflammation in the cardiovascular system are considered.

Vagally mediated atrioventricular block — features and management explain that it may be an incidental finding that occurred while the patient was sleeping or in other cases be associated with syncope and is felt to be attributable to neural reflexes, which result in simultaneous bradycardia and hypotension, with typically sinus rate slowing in conjunction with the onset of atrioventricular block and the atrioventricular block can be high grade or complete; atrioventricular block attributable to high vagal tone, such as during sleep, is almost always asymptomatic, the level of the block is at the atrioventricular node with normal atrioventricular nodal function when tested at EPS, and if asymptomatic, medical treatment or pacemaker implantation is not warranted; if the patient is having frequent syncopal episodes, treatment may be warranted if bradycardia appears to be the dominant factor, and although PPM implantation is a relatively low-risk cardiac procedure, procedural complications and death directly related to implant can occur, and implanted leads have long-term management implications.

### Research opportunities in autonomic neural mechanisms of cardiopulmonary Regulation: a report from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Institutes of Health office of the director Workshop [^112JdgoW]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Sleep–wake states: background for ANS–cardiovascular interactions

Understanding the influences of normal sleep–wake physiology and disturbed sleep is important for appreciating the role of the ANS on cardiopulmonary function. Integration of cardiorespiratory control during sleep is achieved at multiple levels within the neuraxis. Pontine and suprapontine, as well as cerebellar mechanisms, can influence cardiorespiratory regulation during sleep and waking. Sites within the cerebral cortex also play major roles, particularly in modulating sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow and breathing patterns.

Sleep consists of repetitive cycles of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) states over the sleep period. Each sleep state is characterized by distinct levels of ANS activity and physiological changes in cardiovascular and respiratory functions. At the beginning of sleep, NREM sleep predominates and is accompanied by a progressive decline in SNA and increase in parasympathetic activity that result in a reduction in blood pressure and heart rate. The impact of SNA on cardiovascular function is decreased by more than one-half from wakefulness to stage N3 of NREM sleep. The autonomic stability of NREM sleep, with the attendant mild hypotension, bradycardia, and reduced cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance, provides a relatively restorative neurohumoral background. The occurrence of bradycardia appears to result mainly from enhanced vagus nerve activity, whereas the hypotensive response appears to be primarily due to decreased effects on sympathetic vasomotor tone. During transitions from NREM to REM sleep, bursts in vagus nerve activity may produce pauses in heart rhythm and occasional brief periods of asystole. REM sleep occurs at ∼90-min intervals, subserving the brain's neurochemical functions and behavioral adaptations. This dynamic state, however, can disrupt cardiorespiratory homeostasis. In general, the brain's increased excitability during REM sleep can result in major surges in SNA to the heart and coronary vessels. In individuals with ischemic heart disease, the strong bursts in sympathetic activity can cause arrhythmias and even SCD. During REM sleep, baroreceptor gain is reduced and is a factor that contributes to the reciprocal pattern of increased sympathetic activity and reduced parasympathetic tone. Consequently, heart rate can fluctuate markedly, with episodes of tachycardia and bradycardia. REM sleep is also associated with irregular breathing patterns that can lower oxygen saturation, especially in individuals with pulmonary or cardiac disease.

### Ghrelin inhibits autonomic function in healthy controls, but has no effect on obese and vagotomized subjects [^112ASUem]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Ghrelin inhibits sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity in rodents. We studied the effect of ghrelin on healthy humans, in obesity and in vagotomized subjects.

Design

Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover.

Subjects

Seven lean [mean body mass index (BMI) 23.6 ± 0.9 kg/m(2)], seven morbidly obese (mean BMI 50.9 ± 4.4 kg/m(2)) and seven post-gastrectomy subjects (mean BMI 22.0 ± 1.1 kg/m(2)).

Measurements

Subjects were randomized to intravenous ghrelin (5 pmol/kg/min) or saline over 270 min. Subjects had a fixed calorie meal and a free choice buffet during the infusion. Heart rate variability (HRV) was measured. Total power (TP) represents overall autonomic function, low-frequency (LF) power represents sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, and high-frequency (HF) power represents parasympathetic activity. Very low (VLO) frequency represents the frequency band associated with thermogenesis.

Results

Preliminary anova analysis, looking at all three subject groups together, showed that ghrelin had an overall highly significant inhibitory effect on TP (P = 0.001), HF power (P = 0.04), VLO power (P = 0.03) and no effect on LF (P = 0.07). Further subset analysis revealed that ghrelin had a significant effect on TP (P = 0.03), borderline effect on LF power (P = 0.06) and no effect on HF power (P = 0.1) in healthy controls. By contrast in obese subjects, ghrelin had no effect on TP (P = 0.3), LF (P = 0.5) and HF (P = 0.06) and also no effect in the vagotomized subjects on TP (P = 0.7), LF (P = 0.7) and HF (P = 0.9). Ghrelin had no effect on the LF/HF ratio.

Conclusions

Ghrelin inhibits SNS activity in healthy controls with a moderate effect on parasympathetic nervous system activity but had no effect on obese subjects. Vagotomized subjects also did not respond to ghrelin, suggesting the vagus nerve is important for the effects of peripheral ghrelin on the SNS.

### Normal values and reproducibility of the real-time index of vagal tone in healthy humans: a multi-center study [^115XvvYi]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

CVT

PNS efferent activity is given by CVT. The incoming QRS complex is compared to a template that is generated from the initial stages of ECG acquisition from that particular subject. If these two QRS complexes are sufficiently similar, voltage-gated oscillators within the instrument generate a 1 mV pulse, which is then fed into a two-limb circuit. The first limb, known as the high-pass limb, follows the incoming QRS signal exactly whereas the second limb, known as the low-pass limb, produces a damped rendition. Thus the slower the rate of change of the incoming signal, i.e. the lower the HRV, the closer the low-pass limb mimics the high-pass, resulting in a lower value. Conversely, the higher the HRV the more the low-pass limbs deviates from the high-pass limb thus producing a higher value. This process has been termed phase shift demodulation and is based uniquely among non-invasive measures of PNS tone. CVT is measured on a linear vagal scale (LVS) where 0 was derived from fully atropinized healthy human volunteers. CVT has been demonstrated both a sensitive and specific measure of vagal tone and comparable to other HRV indices.

Cardiac sensitivity to the baroreflex (CSB)

Secondly, vagal baroreflex sensitivity incorporating PNS afferent and efferent activity was derived from CSB. CSB is derived from the incorporation of RR intervals with mean BP into an algorithm on a 10-sec cycle. Thus CSB does not have any units per se and is expressed as a ratio of change in R-R interval against change in unit BP (DRR/DmmHg). ANS parameters were recorded according to internationally agreed recommendations.

Protocol: All subjects were studied in the afternoon (from 1400–1600 h) in a temperature controlled (20–22°C), constantly lit, quiet laboratory. Subjects were reclined at 45° on a bed. After attachment of ANS recording equipment, 20 min of autonomic data (resting/no stimulation) was acquired. The mean/median values of the ANS parameters were derived from the middle 10 min of recording. The subjects that were restudied after 1 year had the protocol repeated based on subject availability at the London center.

### Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) for depression: what do we know now and what should be done next? [^114jgLFE]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy is the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved somatic clinical intervention for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Long-term open data suggest a sustainable antidepressant response over time. Here we review the clinical data that exist so far and their limitations. We also discuss guidelines that may inform the clinical utilization of this procedure. Further clinical studies, in addition to prospective cost utilization and health economic investigations, are needed to better understand VNS therapy and the impact it holds on TRD care.

### Normal values and reproducibility of the real-time index of vagal tone in healthy humans: a multi-center study [^116UTh7T]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiac vagal tone (CVT) is a putative measure of the influence of the PNS on the heart via the vagus nerve, which arises in the brainstem. During ventricular systole, baroreceptor discharge increases as a consequence of a transient increase in blood pressure. This initiates a vago-vagal reflex, mediated through the medullary neurons of the nucleus of the solitary tract, thereby increasing vagal discharge from the brainstem. This reflex results in a reduction of the rate of spontaneous discharge of the sino-atrial node thus reducing heart rate (HR) through prolongation of the R-R interval. There are a diverse array of factors that influence HR such as stress, respiratory rate, metabolic needs and blood pressure through homeostatic synergy of the broadly reciprocal actions of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and PNS. In humans, this aforementioned vagal response to increased baroreceptor discharge occurs within a time frame in the order of 240 msec, which is of sufficient celerity to influence the subsequent cardiac cycle. In contrast, the SNS influence on HR occurs relatively slowly through dynamic changes largely mediated by alterations in peripheral vascular resistance. Thus, over short epochs beat-to-beat changes in HR have been postulated to be due to changes in PNS tone alone. However, the direct measurement of human vagal tone is problematic. In animal models, direct measurement of vagal tone is possible through the invasive placement of electrodes directly into the brainstem or vagal afferents. Clearly in in vivo human studies such an approach is not viable and therefore considerable effort has been afforded in identifying validated non-invasive surrogate markers of PNS tone.

Given that beat-to-beat changes in HR are largely due to PNS influences, various measures commonly derived from power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV), amongst other statistical techniques, have been used as surrogate markers of PNS tone. Such measures are widely utilised across a plethora of scientific disciplines including gastroenterology research. However, many of these methods of deriving PNS tone are notwithstanding limitations. Arguably the most important of these is their relatively poor temporal resolution. Whilst this is not an issue in studies where prolonged recordings are made, erroneous conclusions maybe drawn from studies where changes in PNS tone over relatively short-time periods such as those when changes under 1 min represent the investigators' epoch of interest. It is likely that these limitations are a potential source of confounding and a source of the disparate results reported, particularly in IBS.

### Bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagal nerve stimulation using a novel waveform decreases body weight, food consumption, adiposity, and activity in obesity-prone rats [^114PyrJD]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As food transits through the digestive system, stomach and intestinal wall stretch activates intraganglionic laminar ending (IGLE) mechanoreceptors, which contributes to a sensation of satiety and a reduction in food consumption. This has been demonstrated through experiments using gavage, ligation, and optogenetic activation as well as several studies using electrical nerve stimulation. However, studies suggest that animals exposed to a high-fat diet have less vagal tone during stomach distension, which may promote overeating. Thus, the decision to use vagal nerve stimulation to increase vagal tone and convey a sense of fullness has been studied by several groups. Looking across the results from this study, the data shows that the sVNS group trended toward lower body weight and adiposity due to lower caloric intake but not likely due to an increase in activity that would result in increased energy expenditure nor due to a cessation of activity that would suggest discomfort.

During the baseline phase, all rats on a high-fat diet weighed significantly more than those on the standard diet. However, rats receiving sVNS attained a body weight that was greater than but not significantly different from rats kept on a standard diet. By the end of the study, rats receiving sVNS weighed approximately 595 g, compared to shams that weighed approximately 670 g. While the adiposity of rats on the high-fat diet was significantly greater than those on the standard diet, it is worth noting that the adiposity of rats receiving sVNS was significantly less than all other rats on the high-fat diet and the lean body mass was not significantly different between the group receiving sVNS and the control group on the standard diet. The reduction of adiposity found in this study was similar to the 20% reduction in visceral fat demonstrated in obese Wistar rats after 12 weeks of cervical VNS. Results further suggest that the activity of rats receiving sVNS becomes more similar to rats on a standard diet than sham or non-implanted rats on a high-fat diet.

### Normal values and reproducibility of the real-time index of vagal tone in healthy humans: a multi-center study [^117HXHTt]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Figure 2
A highly schematic representation of the efferent limb of parasympathetic /vagal tone arising in the brainstem (cardiac vagal tone), its interaction with the heart and subsequently the afferent limb (cardiac sensitivity to the baroreflex). Whether these parameters, derived from cardiac chronotropic measures reflect the bidirectional communication between the parasympathetic nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract remains to be determined

As mentioned, autonomic dysfunction has been variably associated with a number of functional GI disorders, including IBS. In a recent narrative review, Masurak et al reported that the majority of studies in the literature demonstrated no difference in HRV parameters when the IBS population was compared to healthy controls. However, when IBS patients are sub-classified according to predominant bowel habit, and the presence of psycho-affective disorders, they are associated with changes in autonomic functioning, particularly in the PNS. Whilst CVT per se has not been measured in patients with IBS, we have recently reported a study in patients with functional chest pain of presumed esophageal origin, where at baseline, patients had lower CVT (5.5 ± 0.84 vs. 11.76 ± 1.6, P = 0.003).

In conclusion, we have defined the normal range of CVT in a relatively large population of normal healthy subjects. Over a period of 1 year, CVT is a reproducible measure of PNS tone.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Abnormalities within the parasympathetic nervous system have been proposed across a number of gastrointestinal disorders including the prevalent irritable bowel syndrome
Parasympathetic nervous system parameters can be difficult to measure, interpret and reproduce
Herein we present a novel non-invasive measure of efferent parasympathetic nervous system tone, known as cardiac vagal tone

What the new findings are:

Cardiac vagal tone, in comparison to more traditional values derived from heart rate variability, has enhanced temporal resolution and is increasingly being used in gastrointestinal research
In a large group of healthy volunteers across 3 study centers, we described the normal range of cardiac vagal tone and demonstrate its reproducibility at 1 year
Further research is now warranted to examine the salience of this parameter in patient cohorts, such as those with irritable bowel syndrome

### Yoga programme for type 2 diabetes prevention (YOGA-DP) among high-risk people in India: a multicenter feasibility randomized controlled trial [^115RUpwi]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Yoga's mechanism of action in T2DM and related conditions has been reported before. Briefly, its benefits on T2DM-related risk profiles seem to occur predominantly through the following pathways: (1) by decreasing the activation and reactivity of the sympathoadrenal system and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, and by fostering feelings of well-being, it may lessen the effects of stress and promote multiple beneficial downstream effects on the neuroendocrine status, metabolic function, and related systemic inflammatory responses; (2) by directly stimulating the vagus nerve, it may improve the parasympathetic activity and lead to beneficial changes in the cardiovagal function, energy state, mood, and related neuroendocrine, metabolic, and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, Yoga may reduce body mass index (BMI), and the reduction in BMI lowers the risk of T2DM.

Effectiveness systematic reviews suggest the benefits and safety of Yoga in T2DM and related conditions. However, the duration of most of the primary studies was short (≤ 3 months), and these studies often had significant methodological limitations. In addition, the intervention development process was not always reported, and some did not describe the intervention in detail. Even if they did, the interventions were heterogeneous. Therefore, robustly designed studies are needed to evaluate the utility of Yoga for preventing T2DM among high-risk individuals. We systematically developed the Yoga Programme for T2DM Prevention (YOGA-DP). Our aim is to conduct a definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT) in the future that will evaluate YOGA-DP's effectiveness among high-risk individuals in India compared to enhanced standard care. The chances of successful completion of the definitive RCT will improve if the feasibility of its key elements is tested before commencement. Therefore, the feasibility of undertaking the definitive RCT was explored in this study.

### Bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagal nerve stimulation using a novel waveform decreases body weight, food consumption, adiposity, and activity in obesity-prone rats [^116TcpUg]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The FDA approved vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) to treat intractable epilepsy in 1997 and chronic depression in 2005. There are ongoing investigations into the use of VNS to treat other conditions, including migraine headache, cardiac rhythm, anxiety, Alzheimer's, fibromyalgia, tinnitus, post-traumatic stress disorder, and inflammation. A reported side effect of VNS has been a reduction in EBW, BMI, and/or adiposity. However, these reports were retrospective in nature and the studies were not designed to assess the effect of VNS on weight loss. Reduction in EBW has motivated several VNS approaches that vary in target location and stimulus parameter selection.

Several studies have found that VNS promotes reduced food intake, causes weight loss, and reduces cravings and appetite. VNS has been associated with reduced plasma glucose, cholesterol, visceral fat, and blood pressure. Studies have shown reduced food intake during VNS. Recently, an elegant study utilizing optogenetics suggested that activation of axons that innervate stomach and intestinal stretch mechanoreceptors is the primary factor that reduces food consumption. However, it is also worth noting that other studies have found no effect of VNS on body weight, either in animals or in humans. For further review of the literature, including the specific location at which VNS was applied, the reader is directed to and.

In this study, we investigate the use of a novel VNS waveform on body weight, food consumption, adiposity, and activity. Studies were conducted in obesity-prone Sprague Dawley rats, and we compare outcomes between the treatment group — rats on high-fat chow that received VNS — and three control groups: (1) rats on standard chow that did not receive an implant; (2) rats on high-fat chow that received an implant but no stimulation (sham); and (3) rats on high-fat chow that did not receive an implant. Results showed that rats on a high-fat diet that received subdiaphragmatic vagal nerve stimulation (sVNS) attained a similar weight to rats on a standard diet due primarily to a reduction in daily caloric intake. Rats on a high-fat diet that received sVNS had significantly less body fat than other high-fat controls. Rats receiving sVNS also began moving a similar amount to rats on the standard diet.

### Role of the gut-brain axis in energy and glucose metabolism [^113joUyp]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, impaired vagal signaling may play a role in obesity, as decreased vagal activation to both mechanical stimuli and satiety-inducing signals is characteristic of a high-fat diet (HFD) –. One study suggests that the decrease in vagal signaling seen with HFD feeding is due to upregulation of K+ channels in the nodose ganglia, increasing hyperpolarization of VANs, while other studies have implicated changes in the gut microbiota as a contributor to vagal afferent desensitization during HFD feeding (see the "Gut microbiota–brain connection" section). For a more comprehensive review on impaired gut signaling during obesity, see ref.

### Tragus nerve stimulation attenuates postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in post COVID-19 infection [^116gESuX]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

3.2 Autonomic Dysfunction and COVID‐19

While COVID‐19 primarily affects the respiratory system, it can also have systemic effects that extend beyond the acute phase of the illness. Some patients who have recovered from COVID‐19 may experience a range of persistent symptoms and complications, collectively known as post‐acute sequelae of COVID‐19 or Long COVID. Among the diverse symptoms observed in this prolonged phase, POTS has been frequently reported. POTS is widely recognized as a complex disorder of the autonomic nervous system, characterized by orthostatic intolerance. Clinically, while POTS presents with orthostatic tachycardia as a hallmark feature, it also encompasses a broader range of symptoms associated with autonomic dysregulation, including headache, cognitive impairment, nausea, and gastrointestinal dysmotility. The potential mechanisms are likely related to an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, as well as hemodynamic abnormalities such as reduced systemic venous return, augmented splanchnic and extremity pooling, decreased cardiac output, and decreased cerebral perfusion. This dysregulation manifests as a decrease in parasympathetic tone and an increase in sympathetic activity, particularly during postural changes from supine to upright positions. HRV provides a noninvasive method to assess the interaction between the sympathetic and parasympathetic activity.

In HRV analysis, HF primarily represents vagal (parasympathetic) activity. High HF power indicates increased vagal tone and is associated with relaxation and restorative processes in the body. On the other hand, the low‐frequency (LF) component, along with the LF/HF ratio, is often interpreted as a marker of sympathetic activity. Higher LF power and LF/HF ratio are typically associated with increased sympathetic tone and arousal. In the present study, we observed a reduction in HF, and increases in LF and LF/HF ratio within 10 min of standing, accompanying postural changes from a recumbent to an upright position, highlighting the dysregulation of the ANS in patients with POTS. This dysregulation is typified by a decrease in parasympathetic activity and a concurrent increase in sympathetic activity, which are key contributors to the hallmark symptoms of POTS. Therefore, potentiation of parasympathetic response and inhibition of sympathetic drive may work as an effective therapeutic strategy in POTS.

### Vagus nerve stimulation and inflammation in cardiovascular disease: a state-of-the-art review [^111BfBpU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The interaction between the autonomic nervous system and inflammation is well known. Stimulation of adrenergic receptors on immune cells regulates all stages that are important for a coordinated immune response. The sympathetic nervous system has been found to have a significant impact on the immune system function with regard to the development and exacerbation of chronic immune‐mediated diseases. On the other hand, the parasympathetic nervous system interacts with innate immunity, by acting as an anti‐inflammatory neural circuit.

Recent studies have shown that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can reduce the expression of inflammatory proteins. The cardioprotective role of VNS has been attributed to the limitation of myocyte apoptosis and improvement of myocardial metabolism. Furthermore, the beneficial role in arrhythmias following VNS has been attributed to the electrical stability by reducing disease‐associated loss of connexin‐43. However, the evidence on the mechanistic link between the potential association of inflammatory status with clinical outcomes following VNS is scarce. This review aims to summarize the existing preclinical and clinical data about the association of VNS with inflammation and the potential link of this effect with clinical outcomes in cardiovascular diseases (Table).

### Brainstem dysfunction in critically ill patients [^113Nqf2D]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Another contributing factor of the brainstem dysfunction in critical illness course might be the impaired sympatho-vagal control of the inflammatory response. The vagus nerve first senses and modulates peripheral inflammation, constituting the so-called cholinergic reflex; second, it senses the microbiota metabolites, being a major component of the gut-brain axis (Table 2). The adrenergic system controls the immune system, with alpha and beta-1 receptors being pro-inflammatory and beta-2 receptors anti-inflammatory. It is therefore conceivable that a brainstem-related neuro-immune impairment can contribute to infection, organ failure, or death by facilitating a maladapted immune response. The modulation of the cholinergic reflex by α7nAChR agonists and by vagal nerve stimulation has been proposed in sepsis and critical illness to improve peripheral immune response and reduce organ dysfunction. In addition to its peripheral immune effects, cholinergic modulation and vagal stimulation can promote anti-inflammatory microglial polarization. However, we shall remind that rivastigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is deleterious in critically ill patients. Vagal nerve stimulation is also proposed in refractory status epilepticus and consciousness disorders, suggesting its potential but not yet demonstrated effect in critical illness-related encephalopathy. Beta-blockers reduce the mortality in cardiac diseases by attenuating the deleterious effects of sympathetic hyperactivation and increasing the vagal tone. In sepsis, beta-blockers improve HR control, reduce systemic inflammation, and decrease mortality, acknowledging that their routine use is not yet warranted.
