## Question

Are there muscle relaxants that can be given intravenously?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are muscle relaxants that can be given intravenously. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the user means by "muscle relaxants" and separate neuromuscular blocking agents used in anesthesia from skeletal muscle relaxants used for pain or spasticity. Then, I should verify which specific drugs in each class have intravenous formulations backed by labeling or guidelines. Next, I will check major practice guidelines to confirm the standard routes of administration. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and highlight any rare or exceptional IV use outside anesthesia, noting safety and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the scope so we don't talk past each other; in anesthesia and critical care, "muscle relaxants" typically refers to neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) that cause temporary paralysis to facilitate intubation or surgery, whereas in primary care and pain medicine, "muscle relaxants" usually means skeletal muscle relaxants for back or neck pain, most commonly given orally; I should confirm this distinction because it will determine which IV options are relevant, and the ASA neuromuscular blockade guidelines and ACP/AAFP pain guidelines illustrate these different contexts clearly [^113tT2SA] [^114aKFE8].

> Now, I will identify specific neuromuscular blocking agents with clear intravenous administration; rocuronium has labeled IV bolus and infusion dosing for intubation and maintenance of paralysis, including detailed infusion rates, confirming IV use, and the SPL also specifies IV dosing ranges for rapid sequence intubation, which I should double-check to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing [^1128SqNX] [^115kFWhr]; vecuronium labeling likewise indicates IV use for intubation and surgical relaxation, which aligns with routine IV practice in the OR and ICU [^116iXhGh]; succinylcholine labeling explicitly includes "dosage recommendations for intravenous use", providing typical IV intubating doses and infusion guidance for longer procedures, which confirms standard IV administration [^111V1XgR]; atracurium is also labeled as an IV injectable for intubation and surgical relaxation, so I can be confident it is intended for IV administration [^115siMWn]; cisatracurium is described in clinical trials as given by IV bolus followed by infusion, which further supports IV use across the NMBA class [^116dybhf].

> Hold on, I should verify that guidelines explicitly align with IV administration rather than alternative routes; perioperative and airway guidelines recommend fast‑acting NMBAs such as succinylcholine 1 mg/kg or rocuronium 0.9–1.2 mg/kg for rapid sequence induction, which in practice are administered intravenously, and SCCM RSI guidance co‑administers sedative‑hypnotic induction agents when NMBAs are used, underscoring standard IV bolus sequencing in RSI, while ASA guidance focuses on monitoring and reversal of IV NMBAs, which collectively affirms that IV is the routine route in these settings [^1128vLtQ] [^116vSwBF] [^115ZmCMf] [^111T9n9q] [^115qCu5R] [^113tT2SA].

> But wait, what if the user meant skeletal muscle relaxants used for low‑back or neck pain; I need to check whether any of those are given intravenously, and the BMJ meta‑analysis of skeletal muscle relaxants reports that across 49 trials, most agents were given orally, some intramuscularly, and only one trial used intravenous injection, suggesting IV administration in this category is rare and not standard, whereas ACP and AAFP guidelines frame these drugs for oral use in acute pain settings rather than IV routes, so IV use here should be viewed as exceptional rather than routine [^114qQrkr] [^114aKFE8] [^115Zh4py] [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost conflated all "muscle relaxants" with NMBAs; I should correct that framing and be explicit in the conclusion: yes, many anesthetic "muscle relaxants" (neuromuscular blockers) are routinely administered intravenously with detailed labeled dosing and strong guideline support, whereas skeletal muscle relaxants for pain are overwhelmingly oral with only rare trial‑level IV use noted and no standard IV labeling in the materials provided, so the intravenous route is standard for NMBAs but not for routine analgesic "muscle relaxants" in ambulatory or primary care contexts [^111V1XgR] [^1128SqNX] [^116iXhGh] [^115siMWn] [^1128vLtQ] [^116vSwBF] [^114qQrkr].

> To synthesize and answer directly: yes, there are muscle relaxants that are given intravenously, specifically neuromuscular blocking agents such as succinylcholine, rocuronium, vecuronium, atracurium, and cisatracurium, which are administered IV by bolus and often by infusion in anesthesia and critical care with established monitoring and reversal practices; by contrast, skeletal muscle relaxants for pain are primarily oral, with only rare reports of IV use in trials and no routine IV role in guideline‑based care in the references provided, so context matters greatly in interpreting "IV muscle relaxants" [^111V1XgR] [^1128SqNX] [^116iXhGh] [^115siMWn] [^116dybhf] [^1128vLtQ] [^116vSwBF] [^114qQrkr] [^113tT2SA].

---

Yes, several muscle relaxants are available for **intravenous (IV) use**, including succinylcholine [^111V1XgR], rocuronium [^115Cg7sU], vecuronium [^116iXhGh], atracurium [^115siMWn], cisatracurium, and pancuronium. These agents are used to **facilitate tracheal intubation** [^115Cg7sU], provide muscle relaxation during surgery [^115siMWn], and support mechanical ventilation [^116iXhGh]. IV muscle relaxants are classified as **depolarizing** (e.g. succinylcholine) or **non-depolarizing** (e.g. rocuronium, vecuronium, atracurium, cisatracurium, pancuronium) and are selected based on clinical context, onset, duration, and patient factors [^113tT2SA].

---

## Classification of IV muscle relaxants

IV muscle relaxants are broadly classified by mechanism as **Depolarizing muscle relaxants**, which mimic acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, causing sustained depolarization and subsequent muscle paralysis, and **Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants**, which competitively inhibit acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, preventing depolarization and muscle contraction [^113tT2SA].

---

## Commonly used IV muscle relaxants

The following table summarizes **commonly used IV muscle relaxants** — their classification, onset, duration, and clinical indications:

| **Drug name** | **Classification** | **Onset time** | **Duration of action** | **Clinical indications** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Succinylcholine | Depolarizing | 30–60 seconds | 4–6 minutes | - Rapid sequence intubation <br/> - Short procedures [^111V1XgR] |
| Rocuronium | Non-depolarizing | 1–2 minutes | 30–60 minutes | - Rapid sequence intubation <br/> - Surgery <br/> - Mechanical ventilation [^115Cg7sU] |
| Vecuronium | Non-depolarizing | 2–3 minutes | 30–40 minutes | - Surgery <br/> - Mechanical ventilation [^116iXhGh] |
| Atracurium | Non-depolarizing | 2–3 minutes | 20–35 minutes | - Surgery <br/> - Mechanical ventilation [^115siMWn] |
| Cisatracurium | Non-depolarizing | 2–3 minutes | 30–40 minutes | - Surgery <br/> - Mechanical ventilation [^116dybhf] |
| Pancuronium | Non-depolarizing | 2–3 minutes | 60–90 minutes | - Long procedures <br/> - Cardiac surgery [^113J1jS5] |

## Clinical applications of IV muscle relaxants

IV muscle relaxants are **essential in several clinical scenarios**, including:

- **Rapid sequence intubation (RSI)**: Succinylcholine [^111V1XgR] and rocuronium [^115Cg7sU] are commonly used for RSI due to their rapid onset of action [^116vSwBF].

- **Surgical procedures**: Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants such as vecuronium [^116iXhGh], atracurium [^115siMWn], and cisatracurium are used to provide muscle relaxation during surgery, facilitating surgical access and reducing patient movement [^111WUSoP].

- **Mechanical ventilation**: Muscle relaxants are used in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation to improve ventilator synchrony and reduce oxygen consumption [^111QVVpL].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

IV muscle relaxants **require careful monitoring** and adherence to safety guidelines:

- **Neuromuscular monitoring**: Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring (e.g. train-of-four monitoring) is recommended to assess the depth of neuromuscular blockade and prevent residual paralysis [^116RHoyE].

- **Reversal agents**: Sugammadex is recommended for rapid reversal of rocuronium and vecuronium-induced blockade [^115SM1cr], while neostigmine is used for other non-depolarizing agents [^114DFhLu].

- **Adverse effects**: Potential adverse effects include respiratory depression, allergic reactions, and prolonged paralysis, necessitating careful patient selection and monitoring [^115hDwqp] [^114Lq75c].

---

## Special considerations in specific patient populations

Certain patient populations **require special consideration** with IV muscle relaxants:

- **Neuromuscular disorders**: Patients with neuromuscular disorders (e.g. myasthenia gravis) are highly sensitive to muscle relaxants, requiring dose adjustments and careful monitoring [^113QvTHC].

- **Renal and hepatic impairment**: Muscle relaxants metabolized by the liver or excreted by the kidneys (e.g. vecuronium, pancuronium) [^112yiqG5] may have prolonged effects in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, necessitating dose adjustments.

- **Elderly patients**: Elderly patients may experience prolonged neuromuscular blockade due to altered pharmacokinetics, requiring careful dosing and monitoring [^111DG4JZ].

---

## Conclusion

IV muscle relaxants are essential in anesthesia and critical care, enabling intubation, surgery, and ventilation. They include depolarizing and non-depolarizing agents; selection is guided by onset, duration, and patient factors. Careful **monitoring** and appropriate **reversal strategies** are required to ensure safety and effectiveness [^113tT2SA].

- **Dosage recommendations for intravenous use in adults**:

	- **For short surgical procedures**: The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg of ANECTINE given intravenously. The optimum intravenous dose will vary among patients and may range from 0.3 to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following intravenous administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. Depending on the dose and duration of succinylcholine administration, the characteristic depolarizing neuromuscular block (Phase I block) may change to a block with characteristics superficially resembling a non-depolarizing block (Phase II block) [see Prolonged Neuromuscular Block due to Phase II Block and Tachyphylaxis (5.8), Overdose (10), and Pharmacodynamics (12.2)]. A 5 to 10 mg test dose may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

	- **For long surgical procedures**:

		- **Continuous intravenous infusion**: The dose of ANECTINE administered by intravenous infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. The average rate for an adult ranges between 2.5 and 4.3 mg per minute.

### Impact of shorter-acting neuromuscular blocking agents on fast-track recovery of the cardiac surgical patient [^113J1jS5]. Anesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

Residual paralysis associated with the use of long-acting muscle relaxants can delay recovery from anesthesia and surgery. The authors tested the hypothesis that the use of shorter-acting neuromuscular blocking agents is associated with reductions in tracheal extubation times and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.

- **Methods**: One hundred ten patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting or single valve surgery were randomized prospectively to receive either pancuronium or rocuronium intraoperatively. Anesthetic management and muscle relaxant maintenance dosing were standardized. In the ICU, the time required to wean ventilatory support, the duration of tracheal intubation, and length of stay were recorded. Subjects were asked to quantify generalized muscle weakness as they awakened in the ICU and again after tracheal extubation.

- **Results**: Complete data were collected on 51 patients in the pancuronium group and 52 patients in the rocuronium group. No differences were found between the groups in anesthetic, surgical, or ICU management. Significant increases in the duration of weaning of ventilatory support were observed in patients who received pancuronium (median, 180 min; range, 50–780 min) compared with the rocuronium group (median, 110 min; range, 45–250 min). Tracheal extubation was significantly delayed in the pancuronium group (median, 500 min; range, 240–1,305 min) compared with the rocuronium group (median, 350 min; range, 210–1,140 min). Subjects in the pancuronium group…

### The effect of neuromuscular blocking reversal agents on perioperative neurocognitive function after general anaesthesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114KG9K1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

Based on the Population/Intervention/Comparator/Outcome/Study design (PICOS) framework, the inclusion criteria for screening eligible studies were as follows:

- **Population**: Adult patients who underwent elective surgery under general anaesthesia and received neuromuscular blocking agents.
- **Intervention**: Intravenous administration of NMBRs (neostigmine, sugammadex, or adamgammadex) at the end of surgery to reverse residual neuromuscular blockade.
- **Comparator**: Placebo or other drugs used in the intervention.
- **Outcome**: The incidence of PND (POD, POCD, dNCR, and PNCD) as defined and measured by the study authors.
- **Study design**: The peer-reviewed RCTs serve as the primary source of evidence for our analysis.

The exclusion criteria for this study included:

- **Study type**: Case reports, conference abstracts, and reviews.
- **Participants**: Patients under 18 years of age.
- **Route of administration**: Administration of drugs via routes other than intravenous.
- **Availability**: Studies for which full texts were not available.

A standardized data extraction form was designed to ensure consistent information collection across all studies. This form included key details such as the first author's name, publication year, country of origin, study design, sample size, type of surgery, patient characteristics (e.g. age, gender, and ASA classification), characteristics of NMBRs usage (e.g. type, dosage, timing), and the specific metrics or scales utilized to evaluate PND. In cases where data were incomplete or missing, the primary authors were contacted for further details.

### Effect of nitrous oxide on cisatracurium infusion demands: A randomized controlled trial [^116dybhf]. BMC Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Recent studies have questioned our previous understanding of the effect of nitrous oxide on muscle relaxants, since nitrous oxide has been shown to potentiate the action of bolus doses of mivacurium, rocuronium, and vecuronium. This study aimed to investigate the possible effect of nitrous oxide on the infusion requirements of cisatracurium.

- **Methods**: Seventy ASA physical status I-III patients aged 18–75 years were enrolled in this randomized trial. The patients were undergoing elective surgery requiring general anesthesia with a duration of at least 90 minutes. Patients were randomized to receive propofol and remifentanil by target-controlled infusion in combination with either a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide (Nitrous oxide/TIVA group) or oxygen in air (Air/TIVA group). A 0.1 mg/kg initial bolus of cisatracurium was administered before tracheal intubation. This was followed by a closed-loop computer-controlled infusion of cisatracurium to produce and maintain a 90% neuromuscular block. Cumulative dose requirements of cisatracurium during the 90-minute study period after bolus administration were measured. The asymptotic steady-state rate of infusion to produce a constant 90% block was determined by applying nonlinear curve fitting to the data on the cumulative dose requirement during the study period.

- **Results**: Controller performance, i.e. the ability of the controller to maintain neuromuscular block constant at the setpoint, and patient characteristics were similar in both groups. The administration of nitrous oxide did not affect cisatracurium infusion requirements.

### Improved neuromuscular blockade using a novel neuromuscular blockade advisory system: A randomized, controlled, clinical trial [^112HdiZN]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2008). High credibility.

Conventional incremental bolus administration of neuromuscular blocking (NMB) drugs is associated with limitations in intraoperative control, potential delays in recovery, and residual blockade in the postanesthetic period. To overcome such limitations, we developed a novel adaptive control computer program, the Neuromuscular Blockade Advisory System (NMBAS). The NMBAS advises the anesthesiologist on the timing and dose of NMB drugs based on a sixth-order Laguerre model and the history of the patient's electromyographic responses. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the use of the NMBAS improves NMB compared to standard care.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, blinded, parallel-group, clinical trial with n = 73 patients (ASA physical status I-III) undergoing abdominal surgery under general anesthesia lasting ≥ 1.5 hours with NMB using rocuronium. Patients were allocated to standard care or NMBAS-guided rocuronium administration. The primary outcome variable was the incidence of intraoperative events reflecting inadequate NMB. Secondary outcome variables included train-of-four (TOF) ratios at the end of surgery before reversal, the total doses of rocuronium, reversal agents, anesthetics, and other drugs, the incidence of postoperative adverse events, and the incidence of anesthesiologist noncompliance with NMBAS recommendations.

- **Results**: Of 73 enrolled patients, n = 30 per group were eligible for analysis. Patient demographics were comparable between the groups. The incidence of total intraoperative events associated with inadequate NMB was significant.

### Efficacy, acceptability, and safety of muscle relaxants for adults with non-specific low back pain: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1163X91z]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

- **Safety**

- **Acute low back pain**: Twenty-two trials (28 comparisons) determined the safety of muscle relaxants for acute low back pain. The type and reporting of adverse and serious adverse events varied across trials. Compared with control, non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics were associated with an increased risk of an adverse event (relative risk 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.0; 16 trials, 3404 participants; low certainty evidence) but not a serious adverse event (2.3, 0.3 to 20.8; 2 trials, 830 participants; very low certainty evidence). Antispastic drugs were also associated with an increased risk of an adverse event (2.0, 1.1 to 3.8; 2 trials, 290 participants; moderate certainty evidence) whereas benzodiazepines were not (1.8, 0.9 to 3.6; 2 trials, 159 participants; low certainty evidence). Participants receiving antispastics were more likely to discontinue treatment due to an adverse event (34.6, 2.1 to 568.0; 1 trial, 195 participants; very low certainty evidence) whereas participants receiving non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics were not (1.5, 0.6 to 3.5; 5 trials, 1641 participants; very low certainty evidence).

- **Chronic low back pain**: Two trials (two comparisons) determined the safety of muscle relaxants for chronic low back pain. Compared with control, no difference was found in the risk of experiencing an adverse event.

### Intermediate acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents and risk of postoperative respiratory complications: Prospective propensity score matched cohort study [^115hDwqp]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Our data raise concern about the potential adverse outcome events of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, and further targeted research is warranted to resolve remaining questions. For example, it is unclear if the respiratory morbidity associated with neuromuscular blocking agents can be mitigated by optimal clinical management such as the use of reversal agents and qualitative or quantitative monitoring of neuromuscular transmission or use of newer reversal agents such as sugammadex. In summary, we found that the use of intermediate acting neuromuscular blocking agents during anesthesia leads to an increased risk of developing clinically meaningful respiratory complications.

### European neuromuscular centre consensus statement on anaesthesia in patients with neuromuscular disorders [^1123gBYf]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Anaesthetists are often asked by surgeons or other physicians to administer nonanaesthetic drugs, such as antibiotics or antiepileptics. However, several of these drugs may be harmful to patients with neuromuscular disorders (NMDs). The following drugs should only be used with caution:

- **Neuromuscular junction disorders**: Oxazolidinone antibiotics (myasthenic crisis), aminoglycoside antibiotics (myasthenic crisis), beta‐blocking agents (myasthenic crisis), botulinum toxin (myasthenic crisis), fluoroquinolone antibiotics (myasthenic crisis), intravenous magnesium (myasthenic crisis), and macrolide antibiotics (myasthenic crisis).

- **Muscle channelopathies**: Potassium‐releasing agents (hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis), beta‐agonists (hypokalaemic periodic paralysis), and insulin (hypokalaemic periodic paralysis).

- **Mitochondrial myopathies**: Aminoglycoside antibiotics (ototoxicity), linezolid antibiotics (lactic acidosis), metformin (lactic acidosis), and valproic acid (liver failure).

Because of the low prevalence of most NMDs, there is a lack of prospective clinical studies providing high-level evidence on the anaesthetic management of patients with NMDs. This results in several urgent open questions. Observational multicentre studies can be of great value in studying the prevalence of perioperative complications in patients with NMDs and their association with certain anaesthetic agents. One open question is the future role of remimazolam, a recently introduced short‐acting benzodiazepine. In patients with NMDs, neither propofol nor volatile anaesthetics are ideal, and short‐acting benzodiazepines may offer a better alternative.

### Extravascular injection of neuromuscular blocking drugs: A systematic review of current evidence and management [^115ep5mi]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

When a TOF ratio greater than 0.9 is observed, the patient can be safely extubated. Monitoring after extubation should include regular measurement of the neuromuscular block, full ASA monitoring, and an extended stay in a postanesthesia care unit (PACU) for a minimum of 4 to 5 hours. This prolonged observation is particularly important when long-acting NMBDs are used. If there is a decline in the TOF ratio during this period of observation, an additional dose of sugammadex is necessary when an aminosteroid NMBD has been used. If the maximum dosage of neostigmine is given to reverse a neuromuscular block caused by a non-aminosteroid NMBD and results in insufficient recovery of the TOF ratio, we advise not to repeat the dose but to observe the patient in the ICU under prolonged sedation and ventilation.

We would like to highlight that our clinical pathway recommendations include guidelines based on clinical expertise and scientific basis, which were not studied or explored. Further research is required to assess any clinical benefit.

### Ketamine and esketamine in clinical trials: FDA-approved and emerging indications, trial trends with putative mechanistic explanations [^116GbGvd]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

In high doses, ketamine produces anesthesia and is suitable for diagnostic and surgical procedures that do not require the application of muscle relaxants. Low-dose ketamine, as a supplement to other anesthetic drugs (general anesthetics, benzodiazepines, and propofol), can prolong their action and reduce the dose of opioids required in the postoperative period. The main advantage of ketamine application in anesthesia is its ability to maintain heart rate and cardiac output, increase blood pressure, provide bronchodilation, and preserve pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes without respiratory depression.

In sub-anesthetic doses, ketamine is used along with opioids to treat cancer pain, particularly breakthrough pain, chronic pain, including chronic neuropathic pain, phantom and ischemic limb pain, postherpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, fibromyalgia, and chronic regional pain syndromes, and acute perioperative pain.

### Vecuronium bromide [^112yiqG5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Since allergic cross-reactivity has been reported in this class, request information from your patients about previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents. In addition, inform your patients that severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including vecuronium bromide, have been reported.

- **Renal failure**: Vecuronium is well tolerated without clinically significant prolongation of neuromuscular blocking effect in patients with renal failure who have been optimally prepared for surgery by dialysis. Under emergency conditions in anephric patients, some prolongation of neuromuscular blockade may occur; therefore, if anephric patients cannot be prepared for non-elective surgery, a lower initial dose of vecuronium should be considered.

- **Altered circulation time**: Conditions associated with slower circulation time in cardiovascular disease, old age, and edematous states resulting in increased volume of distribution may contribute to delay in onset time; therefore, dosage should not be increased.

- **Hepatic disease**: Experience in patients with cirrhosis or cholestasis has revealed prolonged recovery time in keeping with the role the liver plays in vecuronium metabolism and excretion (see clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics). Data currently available do not permit dosage recommendations in patients with impaired liver function.

- **Long-term use in ICU**: In the intensive care unit, long-term use of neuromuscular blocking drugs to facilitate mechanical ventilation may be associated with prolonged paralysis and/or skeletal muscle weakness.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^113GxZcy]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this update was to revise the 2002 version of the "Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient".

- **Design**: A Task Force comprising 17 members of the Society of Critical Care Medicine, who have particular expertise in the use of neuromuscular-blocking agents, along with a Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation expert and a medical writer, met via teleconference and three face-to-face meetings. They also communicated via e-mail to examine the evidence and develop these practice guidelines. Annually, all members completed conflict of interest statements; no conflicts were identified. This activity was funded by the Society for Critical Care Medicine, with no industry support provided.

- **Methods**: Utilizing the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system, the expert on the Task Force created profiles for evidence related to six of the 21 questions and assigned quality-of-evidence scores to these and the additional 15 questions, for which insufficient evidence was available to create a profile. Task Force members reviewed this material, all available evidence, and provided recommendations, suggestions, or good practice statements for these 21 questions.

- **Results**: The Task Force developed a single strong recommendation: they recommend scheduled eye care that includes lubricating drops or gel and eyelid closure for patients receiving continuous infusions of neuromuscular-blocking agents. Additionally, the Task Force developed 10 weak recommendations.

Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) required for cardiac surgery presents unique challenges to the cardiac anesthesiologist, who is responsible for providing the three most basic facets of any anesthetic: amnesia, analgesia, and muscle relaxation. Unique pathophysiologic changes during CPB result in pharmacokinetic alterations that impact the serum and tissue concentrations of intravenous and volatile anesthetics. Similarly, CPB causes pharmacodynamic alterations that impact anesthetic efficacy. The clinical significance of these alterations represents a "moving target" as practice evolves and the technology of CPB circuitry advances.

In addition, perfusionists choose, modify, and maintain the CPB circuitry and membrane oxygenator. Thus, their significance may not be fully appreciated by the anesthesiologist. These issues have a profound impact on the anesthetic state of the patient. The delivery and maintenance of anesthesia during CPB present unique challenges. The perfusionist may be directly responsible for the delivery of anesthetic during CPB, a situation unique to the cardiac suite.

Furthermore, monitors of anesthetic depth — such as assessment of clinical signs, hemodynamic indicators, the bispectral index monitor, end-tidal anesthetic concentration, or twitch monitoring — are often absent, unreliable, or directly impacted by the unique pathophysiology associated with CPB. The magnitude of these challenges is reflected in the higher incidence of intraoperative awareness during cardiac surgery. Further complicating matters are the lack of specific clinical guidelines and varying international policies.

### Safety application of muscle relaxants and the traditional low-frequency ventilation during the flexible or rigid bronchoscopy in patients with central airway obstruction: a retrospective observational study [^114Kvp8y]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

The safety of skeletal muscle relaxants used in patients with tracheal stenosis is a significant challenge for anesthesiologists. In this research, skeletal muscle relaxants were used in 96.5% (362 patients) of the 375 included patients, with 83.5% (313 patients) using cisatracurium, 12.0% (45 patients) rocuronium, and 1.1% (4 patients) atracurium. The use rate of skeletal muscle relaxants was 96.5% (79.5% cisatracurium, 15.8% rocuronium, 1.2% atracurium) in rigid bronchoscopy patients. It was 96.6% (86.8% cisatracurium, 8.8% rocuronium, 1.0% atracurium) in flexible bronchoscopy patients, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p > 0.05).

Although 96.5% of patients with central airway obstruction (CAO) undergoing flexible or rigid bronchoscopy therapy used skeletal muscle relaxants, we found no patients with ventilation failure. Moreover, no patients suffered from bronchospasm or cough. Thirteen patients (8 in flexible, 5 in rigid) experienced hypoxemia during the procedure, and two patients (0.05%) required reintubation after awakening due to dyspnea post-extubation, subsequently being sent to the ICU following bracket adjustment. There was no significant difference in perioperative adverse events between the two groups. Additionally, the dosage of cisatracurium used was higher in rigid bronchoscopy compared to flexible bronchoscopy therapy (10.8 ± 3.8 mg vs. 11.6 ± 3.6 mg, respectively, p < 0.0).

### Difficult airway society 2015 guidelines for management of unanticipated difficult intubation in adults [^114JY8AL]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

If the surgery is not urgent, the safest option is to wake the patient up, and this should be considered first. This will require full antagonism of neuromuscular block. If rocuronium or vecuronium has been used, sugammadex is an appropriate choice of antagonistic agent. If another non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent has been used, then anesthesia must be maintained until paralysis can be adequately antagonized. Surgery may then be postponed or may continue after awake intubation or under regional anesthesia.

If waking the patient up is inappropriate (for example, in the critical care unit, in the emergency department, or where life-saving surgery must proceed immediately), the remaining options should be considered.

### Dose-dependent association between intermediate-acting neuromuscular-blocking agents and postoperative respiratory complications [^114Lq75c]. Anesthesiology (2015). High credibility.

Duration of action increases with repeated administration of neuromuscular-blocking agents, and intraoperative use of high doses of neuromuscular-blocking agents may affect respiratory safety.

- **Methods**: In a hospital-based registry study on 48,499 patients who received intermediate-acting neuromuscular-blocking agents, the primary hypothesis tested was that these agents are dose-dependently associated with the risk of postoperative respiratory complications. In the secondary analysis, the association between neostigmine dose given for reversal of neuromuscular-blocking agents and respiratory complications was evaluated. Post hoc, the effects of appropriate neostigmine reversal (≤ 60 μg/kg after recovery of train-of-four count of 2) on respiratory complications were assessed. Risk factors related to patient, anesthesia, and surgical complexity were controlled.

- **Results**: High doses of neuromuscular-blocking agents were associated with an increased risk of postoperative respiratory complications (n = 644) compared with low doses (n = 205) (odds ratio [OR], 1.28; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.57). Neostigmine was associated with a dose-dependent increase in the risk of these complications (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.83). Post hoc analysis revealed that appropriate neostigmine reversal eliminated the dose-dependent association between neuromuscular-blocking agents and respiratory complications (for neuromuscular-blocking agent effects with appropriate reversal: OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.52).

### Remifentanil with thiopental for tracheal intubation without muscle relaxants [^112qv9sa]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2003). Low credibility.

Tracheal intubation may be accomplished with remifentanil and a non-opioid IV anesthetic without a muscle relaxant. In this study, we evaluated in a double-blinded, prospective, randomized manner the dose requirements for remifentanil with thiopental, without muscle relaxant administration, to obtain clinically acceptable intubation conditions and cardiovascular responses.

After premedication with midazolam 0.03 mg/kg IV, 105 patients were randomized equally into one of three study groups, each receiving the following:

- **Group I**: Remifentanil 2 micro g/kg
- **Group II**: Remifentanil 3 micro g/kg
- **Group III**: Remifentanil 4 micro g/kg

Remifentanil was administered over 30 seconds, and anesthesia was induced with thiopental 5 mg/kg. Tracheal intubation conditions were assessed by the anesthesiologist performing the intubation as: (a) excellent, (b) satisfactory, (c) fair, and (d) unsatisfactory. There were no statistically significant differences among groups regarding demographic data. Blood pressure and heart rate did not increase in any group after accomplishing intubation. There was a significant improvement in intubation conditions between Groups I and II, I and III, and II and III (P < 0.001). We conclude that remifentanil 4 micro g/kg administered before thiopental 5 mg/kg provided excellent or satisfactory intubation conditions in 94% of patients and prevented cardiovascular responses to intubation.

We evaluated in a double-blinded manner the dose requirements for remifentanil with thiopental without muscle relaxants for obtaining acceptable intubation conditions. Our results suggest that remifentanil is effective in providing proper intubation conditions and maintaining cardiovascular stability.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^113noRqA]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade, particularly concerning patients with neuromuscular diseases, the SCCM 2016 guidelines indicate there is insufficient evidence to recommend monitoring a specific muscle group in patients with myasthenia gravis undergoing treatment with neuromuscular blocking agents.

### Sugammadex in clinical practice [^114DFhLu]. Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

The availability of sugammadex allows greater flexibility in the use of rocuronium and vecuronium during anaesthesia and surgery. The neuromuscular block induced by both drugs can be reversed from both superficial and deep levels of block by adjusting the dose of sugammadex. The dose of sugammadex for reversal of a shallow block produced by these neuromuscular blocking drugs is approximately 2 mg·kg⁻¹, and for a deep block, the dose is 4 mg·kg⁻¹.

A larger dose of sugammadex (16 mg·kg⁻¹) administered 3 minutes after the neuromuscular blocking drug allows rapid reversal of a neuromuscular block induced by 1–1.2 mg·kg⁻¹ of rocuronium, thereby raising the possibility of using rocuronium as a replacement for suxamethonium. The use of sugammadex has not been reported to be associated with a recurrence of block, provided a dose that is adequate for reversal has been used. Sugammadex appears to have an acceptable safety profile. There are no requirements for dose adjustment for age or the use of potent volatile anaesthetic agents.

At the end of preoxygenation, critically ill adults undergoing intubation in the ED or ICU without an indication for awake intubation commonly receive:

1. A sedative medication to induce anesthesia.
2. A neuromuscular blocking agent to relax the muscles of the head and neck.
3. An intravenous fluid bolus or vasopressor to prevent hypotension during intubation (Figure 1).

### European Neuromuscular Centre consensus statement on anaesthesia in patients with neuromuscular disorders [^113QvTHC]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). High credibility.

General anaesthesia: Short-acting opioids, sedatives, and hypnotic agents are preferred to minimize respiratory depression upon emergence from anaesthesia. The level of evidence is rated at 4. The median score by the modified Delphi process was 9. Respondents who scored ≥ 7 constituted 18 of 18 (100%), with two respondents abstaining from voting.

- **Neuromuscular blocking agents**: Based on their mechanisms of action, neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) can be divided into depolarizing and nondepolarizing NMBAs. Patients with neuromuscular disorders (NMD) are at the greatest risk for succinylcholine-induced hyperkalemia; therefore, succinylcholine should not be used in patients with a known or suspected NMD. The level of evidence is rated at 2−. The median score by the modified Delphi process was 9. Respondents who scored ≥ 7 totaled 19 of 19 (100%), with one respondent abstaining from voting.

	- Most patients with neuromuscular conditions exhibit increased sensitivity to nondepolarizing NMBAs due to reduced muscle mass and strength. A lower initial dose may be adequate for achieving muscle relaxation. Duration of action is often prolonged, and the effects of residual relaxation are more severe than in patients without NMD. The effects of NMBAs should be quantitatively monitored to prevent residual neuromuscular blockade after emergence from anaesthesia and extubation. The level of evidence is rated at 2+. The median score by the modified Delphi process was 9. Respondents who scored ≥ 7 were 18 of 18 (100%), with two abstaining.

	- When a nondepolarizing NMBA is used, extubation and emergence from anaesthesia should be guided by a train-of-four ratio of 1.0.

### Real-world experience with neuromuscular blockade reversal [^112hnejU]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Neuromuscular blocking agents are used in many surgical procedures and have enabled new surgical advances. The expanded landscape of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) reversal drugs allows for fast and complete NMB reversal and the reduction of postoperative complications from residual block. In the United States, neostigmine/glycopyrrolate and sugammadex are the primary agents for pharmacologic antagonism of neuromuscular blocking agents. Whereas neostigmine and an anticholinergic have been available for decades, sugammadex has only recently become available.

We present real-world cases in a variety of surgical procedures and clinical settings in which the use of NMB reversal agents played a significant role in the patients' clinical outcome.

### Requirements for muscle relaxants during radical retropubic prostatectomy [^113TxJBt]. Anesthesiology (2000). Low credibility.

The need for the routine use of muscle relaxants to provide an adequate surgical field for intraabdominal surgery has not been established. This study tested the hypothesis that vecuronium decreases the frequency of unacceptable operating conditions for patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy who are anesthetized with isoflurane and fentanyl.

- **Methods**: After obtaining informed consent, patients in this blinded, placebo-controlled study were randomized to receive either an infusion of vecuronium or saline (placebo) beginning 5 minutes after fascial incision during the maintenance of anesthesia with at least 1 minimum alveolar concentration end-tidal isoflurane and fentanyl infusion. The surgical field was graded from 1 (excellent) to 4 (unacceptable) by the surgeons at 15-minute intervals. If a grade 4 rating occurred (defined as a treatment failure), the patient received rescue vecuronium.

- **Results**: A total of 120 patients are included in this report (59 in the vecuronium group and 61 in the placebo group). The frequency of treatment failure in the placebo group was 17 of 61 (27.9%) versus 1 of 59 (1.7%) in the control group who received vecuronium (P < 0.001). Thirty-eight patients (62.3%) in the placebo group and 52 patients (88.1%) in the vecuronium group had surgical field ratings of ≤ 2 (good to excellent) at each time assessed throughout the procedure.

- **Conclusion**: The study hypothesis was confirmed. However, an isoflurane-fentanyl anesthetic alone produced a good to excellent surgical field in approximately two-thirds of patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy.

### Duration of anesthesia before muscle relaxant injection influences level of paralysis [^117N2RXp]. Anesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

Dosage guidelines for muscle relaxants are based on dose-response studies, normally performed after several minutes of stable nitrous oxide (N₂O)-opioid anesthesia. However, relaxants are used immediately after the induction of anesthesia. The study was designed to determine the influence of the duration of anesthesia and N₂O on the onset time at the adductor pollicis (AP) and the corrugator supercilii (CS) muscles of maximum neuromuscular blockade after mivacurium.

- **Methods**: After institutional approval and informed consent, patients were randomly allocated into three groups. Anesthesia was induced with alfentanil and propofol. Group A (n = 10) received mivacurium (0.1 mg/kg) immediately after loss of consciousness. Groups B (n = 10) and C (n = 10) received mivacurium after 15 minutes of anesthesia with propofol alone (B) or propofol with N₂O (C). The evoked response to train-of-four stimulation was measured by acceleromyography at the AP and the CS.

- **Results**: Maximum neuromuscular blockade (%T1, median [range]) was significantly less in group A than in groups B and C (< 0.001) at both the AP (81 [47–90]; 90 [35–100]; 100 [93–100], respectively) and the CS (19 [5–63]; 68 [61–100]; 89 [72–100], respectively). Maximum neuromuscular blockade was less in group B than in group C (< 0.001) at the AP. Onset time of maximum neuromuscular blockade was not different between groups but was shorter at the CS than at the AP.

- **Conclusions**: Duration of anesthesia and N₂O before mivacurium injection affect the intensity of neuromuscular blockade but not onset time.

### A new pharmacological approach for tracheal intubation [^113wUhpK]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Low credibility.

Anaesthesia induced with remimazolam and a fentanyl-series opioid can be reversed with flumazenil and naloxone. Concomitant paralysis with rocuronium can facilitate tracheal intubation while being reversible with sugammadex. Together, this combination might offer full reversibility of a 'routine' or a 'rapid-sequence' induction anaesthesia. Whether this is useful, or even safe, requires careful evaluation.

### Observational study on patterns of neuromuscular blockade reversal [^115yMnib]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade (NMB) is commonly used to facilitate tracheal intubation and surgical conditions in patients undergoing general anesthesia. It remains a mainstay of a balanced anesthetic technique despite advances in short-acting volatile and intravenous anesthetics. Our understanding of the prevalence and impact of residual postoperative NMB has greatly expanded in recent years. Even mild levels of residual NMB decrease objective measures of pulmonary function, increase the risk of aspiration and airway obstruction, and worsen the patient recovery experience. Residual neuromuscular blockade continues to be a widespread problem, affecting greater than 50% of patients receiving NMB in normal practice, even with qualitative neuromuscular monitoring and the use of neostigmine.

Although the overwhelming majority of anesthesiologists surveyed in Europe and the United States believe that either subjective or quantitative train-of-four (TOF) monitoring may improve NMB management, neither modality has been accepted as the standard of care for patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents. Among the reasons cited for this lack of adoption of monitoring standards is significant practice variation in NMB management that exists between countries, hospitals, and individual practitioners. For example, according to Naguib et al, surveys in Denmark, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Mexico have suggested that only 43%, 28%, 10%, and 2% of clinicians respectively, routinely use neuromuscular monitors of any kind.

### Guidelines for the safe practice of total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA): Joint guidelines from the Association of Anaesthetists and the Society for Intravenous Anaesthesia [^115VMYCf]. Anaesthesia (2019). Low credibility.

Guidelines are presented for safe practice in the use of intravenous drug infusions for general anaesthesia. When maintenance of general anaesthesia occurs by intravenous infusion, this is referred to as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA). Although TIVA has advantages for some patients, the most common technique used for maintaining anaesthesia in the UK and Ireland remains the administration of an inhaled volatile anaesthetic. However, the use of an inhalational technique is sometimes not possible, and in certain situations, inhalational anaesthesia is contraindicated. Therefore, all anaesthetists should be able to deliver TIVA competently and safely. For purposes of simplicity, these guidelines will use the term TIVA but will also encompass techniques involving a combination of intravenous infusion and inhalational anaesthesia. This document is intended as a guideline for safe practice when TIVA is being used, and not as a review of the pros and cons of TIVA vs. inhalational anaesthesia in situations where both techniques are possible.

### Extravascular injection of neuromuscular blocking drugs: A systematic review of current evidence and management [^112wrmRx]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). High credibility.

The initial search revealed 77 articles after removing duplicates. From these, 71 were excluded based on the exclusion criteria, mostly because no extravasation of neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBDs) occurred. Ultimately, our search yielded nine articles: seven case reports, one case series describing four cases, and one article reporting one case report with a consecutive clinical trial. The flow of the articles can be found in Fig. 1.

- **Table 1: Demographics and characteristics of intravenous insertion and procedure**. The median age was 59 years, with a male/female distribution of 6/6 and an average BMI of 25 kg/m². Two cases reported the presence of the intravenous cannula upon arrival in the operating room. Three cases reported difficult insertion of the intravenous cannula.

- **Table 2: Characteristics of the subcutaneous injection of NMBDs**. Rocuronium was used in nine cases, vecuronium in two cases, and pancuronium in one case. No case reports were found describing the extravasation of atracurium, cisatracurium, mivacurium, or succinylcholine. Only three cases mentioned that the intravenous line was checked prior to induction. Except for one case, all cases suspected extravasation due to the observation of local swelling. None of the cases reported high injection pressure during the initial injection.

The subcutaneous injections occurred at the level of the upper extremities.

### Efficacy, acceptability, and safety of muscle relaxants for adults with non-specific low back pain: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^117LTsVx]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

Two independent reviewers appraised the study-level risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the recommendations from Furlan et al. Thirteen criteria were assessed across the risk of bias domains: selection, performance, attrition, detection, reporting, and other sources of bias. Because recommendations were not available from Furlan et al, we used previously published criteria to determine the overall study risk of bias for each trial.

Two reviewers independently determined the certainty of the evidence for each analysis using the GRADE system. Certainty of the evidence is best considered as the certainty that the true effect lies within a particular range. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence if a serious flaw was present in the domains of risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, and publication bias (see supplementary file 5).

The certainty of evidence was initially classified as high and then as moderate, low, or very low certainty. High certainty meant that we were very confident that the true effect was close to that of the estimate of the effect. Moderate certainty meant that we were moderately confident in the effect estimate; the true effect was likely to be close to the estimate of the effect but with a possibility of being substantially different. Low certainty meant that we had limited confidence in the effect estimate; the true effect might be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Very low certainty meant that we had very little confidence in the effect estimate; the true effect was likely to be substantially different.

### Rocuronium [^1128SqNX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Use by continuous infusion of rocuronium bromide should begin only after initial signs of spontaneous recovery from an intubating dose. For effective administration, an initial infusion rate of 10 to 12 mcg/kg/min is recommended. Due to rapid redistribution [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] and associated rapid spontaneous recovery, starting the infusion after substantial return of neuromuscular function (more than 10% of control T1) may require additional bolus doses to maintain adequate surgical block.

Upon reaching the desired level of neuromuscular block, individualize the infusion rate of rocuronium bromide for each patient. Adjust the rate according to the patient's twitch response, monitored by a peripheral nerve stimulator. Clinical trials indicate that infusion rates have ranged from 4 to 16 mcg/kg/min.

- **Inhalation anesthetics**: Enhance neuromuscular block action. When using enflurane or isoflurane at steady-state concentrations, reduce the infusion rate by 30 to 50% after 45 to 60 minutes post-intubation.

Spontaneous recovery and reversal of neuromuscular blockade after discontinuation of rocuronium bromide infusion are expected to occur at rates similar to those following comparable total doses administered via repetitive bolus injections [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

**Mixed low back pain**: Two trials (two comparisons) determined the efficacy of muscle relaxants at immediate-term follow-up, and one trial at short-term follow-up for mixed low back pain. Non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics were associated with a reduction in pain intensity at two weeks or less compared with control (−4.4, −6.9 to −1.9; 2 trials, 617 participants; low certainty) but not at 3–13 weeks (−5.8, −13.8 to 2.2; 1 trial, 329 participants; very low certainty evidence). Non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics were also associated with a reduction in disability at two weeks or less compared with control (−19.2, −27.7 to −10.7; 1 trial, 329 participants; low certainty evidence).

### Muscle relaxants for nonspecific low back pain: A systematic review within the framework of the Cochrane collaboration [^1178zANm]. Spine (2003). Low credibility.

A systematic review was conducted focusing on randomized and/or double-blinded controlled trials. The use of muscle relaxants to manage nonspecific low back pain remains controversial. Questions persist regarding their effectiveness, alongside concerns about potential adverse effects involved.

The aim of this review was to determine the effectiveness of muscle relaxants in treating nonspecific low back pain. A comprehensive computer-assisted search of the Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 up to October 2001), and EMBASE (1988 up to October 2001) was performed. The searches used the algorithm recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group. References from identified articles and other relevant literature were screened. Included were randomized and/or double-blinded controlled trials involving patients diagnosed with nonspecific low back pain, who were treated with muscle relaxants as either monotherapy or in combination with other therapeutic methods.

The methodological quality assessment and data extraction of the trials were performed independently by two reviewers. The analysis comprised a quantitative analysis (statistical pooling) and a qualitative analysis ("best evidence synthesis"). This involved evaluating the strength of evidence for various conclusions using a rating system based on the quality and outcomes of the included studies. Evidence was categorized as "strong", "moderate", "limited", "conflicting", or "no" evidence.

Thirty trials met the inclusion criteria.

### Extravascular injection of neuromuscular blocking drugs: A systematic review of current evidence and management [^112NRn55]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

A clinical pathway based on the literature is suggested in Figure 2 for the management of extravasation of neuromuscular blocking drugs. Preventive measures include correct labeling of medication as well as assessing the quality of the intravenous line. If an intravenous cannula is present, the injection site should be checked for edema, inflammation, and pain. We recommend that the administration of NMBDs via an intravenous cannula with the absence of backflow or increased injection pressure should be handled with caution.

After suspicion of extravasation, a new intravenous line should be secured as soon as possible to ensure safe anesthesia. Following an accidental subcutaneous injection, a prolonged and unpredictable duration of neuromuscular block must be presumed, especially if additional intravenous doses of NMBDs were administered. Quantitative monitoring of the neuromuscular block should always be applied as there is a risk for ongoing neuromuscular block. Ideally, the application of TOF monitoring should take place at the start of the induction of anesthesia to assess the onset of the neuromuscular block. After suspected extravasation of NMBDs, we advise TOF measurement before an additional intravenous dose of NMBD is administered to accommodate anesthesia best practices. NMBDs might have a delayed absorption from subcutaneous tissue; therefore, spontaneous recovery or stabilization of the neuromuscular block must be observed.

### Efficacy, acceptability, and safety of muscle relaxants for adults with non-specific low back pain: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^114qQrkr]. BMJ (2021). High credibility.

Overall, 3,362 records were initially identified; 215 duplicates were removed, and 3,147 records were screened during the title and abstract screening. Forty-nine trials were included in the review: 35 were peer-reviewed journal articles, two were conference abstracts, and 12 were trial registry records. Thirty-one trials (including two trial registry records and one conference abstract), with a total of 6,505 participants, contributed data to the meta-analyses.

- **Study characteristics**: The included trials investigated 18 different muscle relaxants, most commonly non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics (n = 29), miscellaneous (n = 11), antispastics (n = 5), and benzodiazepines (n = 4). The muscle relaxants were administered orally in 35 trials, by intramuscular injection in 10 trials, and by intravenous injection in one trial. In three trials, the drugs were administered in a mixed manner, using intramuscular injection followed by subsequent oral doses. Most trials (n = 32) compared a muscle relaxant with a placebo.

Thirty-five trials sampled participants with acute low back pain, two trials sampled participants with subacute low back pain, and eight trials sampled participants with chronic low back pain. Two trials investigated participants with both acute and subacute low back pain (mixed duration sample), and two trials did not report the duration of low back pain.

- **Risk of bias**: Of the 39 completed trials assessed for overall risk of bias, eight were assessed at low risk, three at moderate risk, and 28 at high risk. The most common reasons for bias included…

### The effect of neuromuscular blocking reversal agents on perioperative neurocognitive function after general anaesthesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114BpmYW]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

Given that monitoring muscle relaxation and antagonizing residual muscle relaxation are already routine practices in clinical anaesthesia, the secondary outcome events will exclusively present the results of sugammadex and neostigmine, excluding studies involving a placebo.

MMSE score

Two studies (n = 247) reported preoperative MMSE scores, while four studies (n = 440) reported postoperative MMSE scores. The pooled results indicated no significant difference in preoperative or postoperative MMSE scores between sugammadex and neostigmine.

- **Recovery time**: Two studies (n = 196) reported the time taken for patients administered NMBRs to reach a TOF ≥ 0.9. Sugammadex significantly shortened the time of TOF ≥ 0.9 compared to neostigmine (MD -4.52; 95% CI: -5.04 to -3.99; I² = 80%; P < 0.01; moderate quality). One study found that sugammadex resulted in a shorter postoperative extubation time compared to neostigmine (7.85 ± 1.26 vs. 6.28 ± 1.33, P < 0.05).

- **PONV**: Two studies reported the effects of NMBRs on PONV. The pooled analysis of these RCTs (n = 193) revealed no significant difference in the risk of PONV (RR 0.86; 95% CI: 0.48–1.56; I² = 0%; P = 0.63; moderate quality).

- **Length of stay**: One study compared the effects of NMBRs on PACU LOS and found no difference. Additionally, three RCTs (n = 619) recorded hospital LOS and indicated that the use of sugammadex does not affect hospital LOS compared to neostigmine (MD 0.06; 95% CI: -1.06 to 1.19; I² = 78%; P = 0.91; very low quality).

### Muscle relaxants for non-specific low back pain [^115iXv2e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Use of muscle relaxants in the management of non-specific low back pain is controversial. It is not clear if they are effective, and concerns have been raised about the potential adverse effects involved.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this review was to determine if muscle relaxants are effective in the treatment of non-specific low back pain.

- **Search strategy**: A computer-assisted search of the Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 up to October 2001), and EMBASE (1988 up to October 2001) was carried out. These databases were searched using the algorithm recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group. References cited in the identified articles and other relevant literature were screened.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised and/or double-blinded controlled trials, involving patients diagnosed with non-specific low back pain, treated with muscle relaxants as monotherapy or in combination with other therapeutic modalities, were included for review.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently carried out the methodological quality assessment and data extraction of the trials. The analysis comprised not only a quantitative analysis (statistical pooling) but also a qualitative analysis ("best evidence synthesis"). This involved the appraisal of the strength of evidence for various conclusions using a rating system based on the quality and outcomes of the studies included. Evidence was classified as "strong", "moderate", "limited", "conflicting", or "no" evidence.

- **Main results**: Thirty trials met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-three trials (77%) were o

### Extravascular injection of neuromuscular blocking drugs: A systematic review of current evidence and management [^113ScnmC]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

Extravascular injection of neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBDs) can cause a neuromuscular block because of systemic absorption. Currently, there are no guidelines available for managing extravasation of NMBDs. This article reviews the available literature on extravasation of NMBDs. Medline and Embase databases were searched for studies concerning the paravenous or subcutaneous injection of NMBDs. Nine articles were included, consisting of seven case reports, one case series, and one clinical trial. Rocuronium was used as the primary NMBD in nine cases, vecuronium in two cases, and pancuronium in one case.

Although there is significant heterogeneity between the reported information in the included studies, the majority of the case reports describe a slower onset, with a median delay of 20 minutes, and prolonged duration of the neuromuscular block. Nine patients had a residual neuromuscular block at the end of surgery. Postoperative monitoring in the recovery room was prolonged (median time four hours).

Most studies suggest that the delay in NMBD onset and recovery is caused by the formation of a subcutaneous depot, from which the NMBD is slowly absorbed into the systemic circulation. According to the literature, extravasation of NMBDs results in an unpredictable neuromuscular block.

Strategies to prevent potentially harmful side effects, such as frequent train-of-four (TOF) monitoring, the use of NMBD reversal agents, and prolonged length of stay in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), should be considered. This article suggests a clinical pathway that can be used after extravasation.

### Different patterns of mast cell activation by muscle relaxants in human skin [^111YXz33]. Anesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

Activation of mast cells and systemic release of histamine are major side effects of intravenously administered muscle relaxants. In the study, dermal microdialysis was used for the investigation of mast cell activation by muscle relaxants. Dermal microdialysis enabled simultaneous assessment of mediator release, vascular reactions, and sensory effects induced by intradermal application of muscle relaxants without systemic side effects.

- **Methods**: Succinylcholine, the isoquinolines cisatracurium, atracurium, and mivacurium, and the steroids pancuronium, vecuronium, rocuronium, and rapacuronium were tested in human volunteers (n = 6 each). After intradermal insertion of microdialysis capillaries (0.4 mm diameter, cutoff 3,000 kd) and a 60-minute equilibration period, the muscle relaxants were delivered via the capillaries for 30 minutes, followed by a 30-minute washout period. Dialysate was sampled at 15-minute intervals, and histamine, mast cell tryptase, and protein extravasation were determined. Changes in skin blood flow were measured using a laser Doppler imager. Potency and efficacy were derived from nonlinear fittings of the dose-response curves.

- **Results**: For succinylcholine and the isoquinolines, dose-response curves for the vascular and sensory effects paralleled the histamine and tryptase release. In contrast, aminosteroids evoked a rapid histamine release that was accompanied by a delayed increase in tryptase.

- **Conclusions**: Dermal microdialysis has been successfully used to simultaneously assess mediator release, vascular reactions, and sensory effects.

### Efficacy, acceptability, and safety of muscle relaxants for adults with non-specific low back pain: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^112mJUje]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

- **Efficacy and acceptability**: Seventeen trials (24 comparisons) investigated the efficacy of muscle relaxants for acute low back pain at an immediate follow-up of two weeks or less and four trials (seven comparisons) at a short-term follow-up of 3–13 weeks. Thirteen trials (16 comparisons) evaluated the acceptability of muscle relaxants for acute low back pain.

Non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics were associated with reduced pain intensity at two weeks or less compared with control (mean difference −7.7, 95% confidence interval −12.1 to −3.3; 16 trials, 4546 participants; very low certainty evidence). However, they were not associated with reduced pain intensity compared with control at 3–13 weeks (0.6, −4.5 to 5.7; 3 trials, 612 participants; moderate certainty evidence) or in disability at two weeks or less (−3.3, −7.3 to 0.7; 7 trials, 2438 participants; very low certainty evidence), and 3–13 weeks (4.3, −1.4 to 10.1; 2 trials, 422 participants; moderate certainty evidence). No difference was found in the acceptability of non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics compared with control (relative risk 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.6 to 1.1; 13 trials, 2834 participants; very low certainty evidence).

Evidence ranging from moderate to low certainty indicated no benefit of antispastic and benzodiazepine drugs compared with control for pain and disability at immediate (≤ 2 weeks) and short-term (3–13 weeks) follow-up, except for a reduction in disability.

### Rapid sequence induction with a standard intubation dose of rocuronium after magnesium pretreatment compared with succinylcholine: A randomized clinical trial [^113kDF7u]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). High credibility.

Succinylcholine remains the muscle relaxant of choice for rapid sequence induction (RSI) but has many adverse effects. High-dose rocuronium bromide may be an alternative to succinylcholine for RSI, but recovery times are nearly doubled compared with a standard intubating dose of rocuronium. Magnesium sulfate significantly shortens the onset time of a standard intubating dose of rocuronium. We set out to investigate whether intravenous (IV) pretreatment with MgSO4 followed by a standard intubating dose of rocuronium achieved superior intubation conditions compared with succinylcholine.

- **Methods**: Adults were randomized to receive a 15-minute IV infusion of MgSO4 (60 mg·kg⁻¹) immediately before RSI with propofol 2 mg·kg⁻¹, sufentanil 0.2 μg·kg⁻¹, and rocuronium 0.6 mg·kg⁻¹, or a matching 15-minute IV infusion of saline immediately before an identical RSI with succinylcholine 1 mg·kg⁻¹. The primary endpoint was the rate of excellent intubating conditions 60 seconds after administration of the neuromuscular blocking agent, compared between groups using a multivariable log-binomial regression model. Secondary endpoints were blood pressure and heart rate before induction, before and after intubation, and adverse events up to 24 hours postoperatively.

- **Results**: Among 280 randomized patients, intubating conditions could be analyzed in 259 (133 MgSO4-rocuronium and 126 saline-succinylcholine). The rate of excellent intubating conditions was 46% with MgSO4-rocuronium and 45% with saline-succinylcholine. The analysis, adjusted for gender and center, showed no superiority of either method.

### Peri-operative management of neuromuscular blockade: A guideline from the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care [^115ZmCMf]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding respiratory support for reversal of neuromuscular blockade, more specifically with respect to tracheal intubation, ESAIC 2022 guidelines recommend administering a fast-acting muscle relaxant, such as succinylcholine 1 mg/kg or rocuronium 0.9–1.2 mg/kg, for rapid sequence induction and intubation.

### Difficult airway society 2015 guidelines for management of unanticipated difficult intubation in adults [^112gWQGV]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

The placement of a cuffed tube in the trachea offers the greatest protection against aspiration. Suxamethonium is the traditional neuromuscular blocking agent of choice because its rapid onset allows early intubation without the need for bag–mask ventilation. Several studies have compared suxamethonium with rocuronium for rapid sequence induction. Although some have shown better intubating conditions with suxamethonium, others have found that after administering rocuronium at 1.2 mg kg⁻¹, the speed of onset and intubation conditions are comparable.

- **Suxamethonium-induced fasciculation**: Increases oxygen consumption during apnoea, which may become relevant in the event of airway obstruction.

The ability to antagonize the effect of rocuronium rapidly with sugammadex may be an advantage, although it should be remembered that this does not guarantee airway patency or the return of spontaneous ventilation. If rapid antagonism of rocuronium with sugammadex is part of the failed intubation plan, the correct dose (16 mg kg⁻¹) must be immediately available.

### Total intravenous anesthesia without muscle relaxant in a parturient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis undergoing cesarean section: A case report [^1165w3rq]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with pregnancy are quite rare. The aim of this case report is to present the successful use of total intravenous anesthesia without muscle relaxant for cesarean section in a parturient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis at 35 weeks' gestation. The parturient presented with impaired neuromuscular function. Titrated general anesthesia with short-acting anesthetics was applied. During the procedure, no muscle relaxant was used. This strategy helped avoid prolonged ventilation and prevent maternal respiratory complications.

### Short-lasting pediatric laparoscopic surgery: Are muscle relaxants necessary? Endotracheal intubation vs. laryngeal mask airway [^113C9ZE8]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Technical advances have led to lower insufflation pressures and shorter anesthesia times for children undergoing laparoscopic procedures. In this study, we compared the use of endotracheal tube (ETT) and laryngeal mask airway (LMA) with or without muscle relaxant (MR) in children undergoing laparoscopic repair for inguinal hernia.

- **Methods**: Children undergoing laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair were randomized into four groups: ETT+MR (group 1), ETT without MR (group 2), LMA with subparalytic dose of MR (group 3), or LMA without MR (group 4). Surgical, anesthesia, and recovery times, intragastric pressures, and peak airway pressures during insufflation were compared.

- **Results**: After applying exclusion criteria and discontinuing interventions, groups 1 and 3 contained 20 patients, while groups 2 and 4 contained 19 patients each. Surgical times were similar among the groups. Anesthesia times were statistically significantly different, with the shortest time in group 4 and the longest time in group 1. Recovery time was statistically significantly longer in group 1 compared to the other groups. There was no difference between groups in basal intragastric pressure, average intragastric pressure during insufflation, peak airway pressure, and average peak airway pressure during insufflation.

- **Conclusion**: The use of muscle relaxants in short-lasting laparoscopic procedures in children is not absolutely necessary. LMA, with or without a subparalytic dose of muscle relaxant, is a safe alternative.

- **Type of study**: Treatment study.

- **Level of evidence**: Not specified.

### Efficacy, acceptability, and safety of muscle relaxants for adults with non-specific low back pain: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ikMoi]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

International clinical practice guidelines provide conflicting recommendations for the use of muscle relaxants; of 15 clinical practice guidelines, six recommend muscle relaxants to manage low back pain, five do not recommend them, and four do not offer a recommendation. Our review shows uncertainty regarding the efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants. Although non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics might reduce pain intensity at two weeks or less for acute low back pain, the effect is unlikely to be considered clinically significant. Additionally, non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics could increase the likelihood of adverse events (commonly dizziness, drowsiness, headache, and nausea) being reported, yet might have little to no effect on treatment discontinuation. This suggests the treatment and increased risk of adverse events are acceptable. However, the low to very low certainty of evidence does not permit firm recommendations. Clinicians are encouraged to discuss this uncertainty regarding efficacy and safety with patients, sharing information about the potential for pain reduction and the increased risk of experiencing non-serious adverse events, to enable informed treatment decisions.

- **Unanswered questions and future research**: Large, definitive, placebo-controlled trials are urgently needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants. New trials should adhere to the core outcome set for non-specific low back pain and the recommendations of the initiative on methods.

### The effects of neuromuscular blockade on operating conditions during general anesthesia for spinal surgery [^111zV1XS]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Muscle relaxants are prescribed routinely for patients undergoing general anesthesia, but the requirement for paralysis in spinal surgery is unclear. This study compared the operating conditions of general anesthesia with and without a muscle relaxant on spinal surgery patients.

- **Methods**: Eighty-six adults who underwent elective spinal surgery were randomly assigned to a relaxant group (group R) or a no-relaxant group (group NR). All patients were induced with intravenous midazolam (0.05 mg/kg), fentanyl (4 µg/kg), propofol (1.0 mg/kg), and succinylcholine (2 mg/kg). Atracurium was then used in group R but not in group NR. The operating conditions, including muscle tone, body movements, airway pressure, anesthetic consumption, eye-opening time, extubation time, and the Observer's Assessment of the Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) score 20 minutes after extubation, were compared between the two groups.

- **Results**: The operating conditions, including muscle tone scales, body movements, and airway pressure, did not differ between the two groups. Eye-opening time (9.35 ± 2.34 vs. 11.02 ± 2.50 min; P = 0.002) and extubation time (13.95 ± 3.41 vs. 16.72 ± 3.67 min; P = 0.001) were shorter in group NR than in group R. The BIS score at extubation (87.2 ± 5.0 vs. 83.3 ± 5.7; P = 0.001) and the OAA/S score 20 minutes after extubation (5 [3 to 5] vs. 4 [3 to 5]; P = 0.005) were significantly higher in group NR than in group R. Propofol consumption was higher in group NR than in group R (4206.10 ± 415.80 vs. 3900.60 ± 365.40 μg/kg, respectively; P = 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: General anesthesia without muscle relaxants showed improved recovery markers such as shorter eye-opening and extubation times, higher alertness scores, and increased anesthetic consumption in spinal surgery patients.

### Rocuronium [^111DG4JZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Additional information for the administration of rocuronium to pediatric patients of all age groups is presented elsewhere in the label [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. The infusion of rocuronium bromide must be individualized for each patient. The rate of administration should be adjusted according to the patient's twitch response as monitored with the use of a peripheral nerve stimulator. Spontaneous recovery and reversal of neuromuscular blockade following discontinuation of rocuronium bromide infusion may be expected to proceed at rates comparable to that following similar total exposure to single bolus doses [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Rocuronium bromide is not recommended for rapid sequence intubation in pediatric patients.

- **Geriatric patients**: Geriatric patients (65 years or older) exhibited a slightly prolonged median (range) clinical duration of 46 (22 to 73), 62 (49 to 75), and 94 (64 to 138) minutes under opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia following doses of 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 mg/kg, respectively. No differences in duration of neuromuscular blockade following maintenance doses of rocuronium bromide were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

### Suprane [^116TAFSK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: No clinically significant adverse interactions with commonly used preanesthetic drugs, or drugs used during anesthesia (such as muscle relaxants, intravenous agents, and local anesthetic agents) were reported in clinical trials. The effect of Suprane on the disposition of other drugs has not been determined. Similar to isoflurane, Suprane does not predispose to premature ventricular arrhythmias in the presence of exogenously infused epinephrine in swine.

- **Concomitant use of N₂O, benzodiazepines, and/or opioids**: This combination reduces the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of Suprane. Adjust the dose accordingly. Suprane decreases the doses of neuromuscular blocking agents required, so dose adjustments should also be made.

- **Benzodiazepines and opioids (MAC reduction)**: Benzodiazepines and opioids decrease the amount of desflurane (MAC) needed to produce anesthesia. This effect is shown in Table 3 for intravenous midazolam (25–50 µg/kg) and intravenous fentanyl (3–6 µg/kg) in patients of two different age groups.

- **Neuromuscular blocking agents**: Anesthetic concentrations of desflurane at equilibrium (administered for 15 or more minutes before testing) reduced the ED95 of succinylcholine by approximately 30% and that of atracurium and pancuronium by approximately 50% compared to N₂O/opioid anesthesia (see Table 4). The effect of desflurane on the duration of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade has not been studied. Dosage reduction of neuromuscular blocking agents during induction of anesthesia may result in delayed onset of conditions suitable for endotracheal intubation or inadequate muscle relaxation.
