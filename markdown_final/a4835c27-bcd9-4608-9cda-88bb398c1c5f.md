## Question

Can corticosteroids be given to Upper respiratory infection patient with history of liver transplant?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether corticosteroids should be given to a liver transplant recipient who presents with an upper respiratory infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context of a "simple" URI versus atypical or lower-tract disease in an immunocompromised host. Then, I should verify the infectious risks and outcomes associated with adding systemic steroids in transplant populations. Next, I will review what guidelines and high-quality evidence say about systemic steroids for acute respiratory infections. After that, I should identify the rare scenarios where steroids are indicated in transplant patients with respiratory disease, like Pneumocystis pneumonia or ARDS, and make sure I'm not conflating those with URIs. Finally, I will weigh harms versus benefits, consider any exceptions, and synthesize a clear recommendation with safer alternatives for symptom control.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. An "upper respiratory infection" in a liver transplant recipient could be a simple viral rhinosinusitis or nasopharyngitis, but in immunocompromised hosts, viral URIs carry a higher risk of progression to lower tract disease, and the presentation can be atypical or complicated by co-pathogens, so I need to ensure I'm not underestimating severity or missing an early LRTI or opportunistic process [^113EZtB1] [^116jPB2g].

> Now, I should verify the core risk signal with corticosteroids in transplant patients who develop infections. Steroids suppress innate and adaptive immunity, reduce resistance to new and existing infections, can reactivate latent infections, and mask inflammatory signs; the infection risk rises with dose, and in HCT recipients, high-dose systemic steroids increase progression and mortality from respiratory viral infections, underscoring that this is not a benign adjunct in this setting [^112HseeK] [^112hR2ih] [^115fcYjL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check the direct evidence for systemic steroids in acute respiratory tract infections. High-quality data and guidelines consistently show no clinically meaningful benefit of systemic steroids for URIs and bronchitis, and expose patients to nontrivial adverse effects even after short courses; in fact, outpatient steroid prescribing for URIs remains common but is not guideline-supported, which reinforces the lack of indication here [^114m3PfB] [^113M7avZ].

> But wait, what if I'm conflating ARDS or severe pneumonia guidance with URIs? I should double-check that distinction. The 2024 ATS guideline supports corticosteroids in select nonintubated ARDS phenotypes (for example, COVID-19, severe CAP), yet it explicitly cautions that benefit is etiology-dependent and uncertain in other causes, and that late initiation may be harmful; moreover, in immunocompromised patients, the threshold to add steroids should be higher, with vigilant monitoring for complications, which does not translate to uncomplicated URI care [^111q5Y1S].

> Next, I should review when steroids are actually indicated in liver transplant recipients with respiratory disease, so I don't miss an exception. The AASLD/AST guideline supports adjunctive corticosteroids for Pneumocystis pneumonia with significant hypoxemia alongside high-dose TMP-SMX, which is a different entity entirely and should be considered if hypoxia, bilateral interstitial infiltrates, or compatible risk and diagnostics emerge; likewise, ARDS with an etiology that benefits from steroids would be a separate decision point, not an indication for a simple URI [^114HYhKF] [^111ZtGTF] [^111q5Y1S].

> I need to ensure I weigh harms against any hypothetical benefit. Even short courses of systemic steroids can worsen glycemic control, promote hypertension, impair wound healing, increase risk of secondary bacterial infection, reactivate viral or latent infections, and mask fever, which is particularly risky in immunosuppressed patients where subtle deterioration can be missed. Given the absence of demonstrated benefit for URIs, these risks tip the balance firmly against routine steroid use in this scenario [^112HseeK] [^111BFMrZ] [^115ju9qr].

> Let me consider disease-specific modifiers briefly. Patients transplanted for autoimmune hepatitis are sometimes maintained on low-dose steroids as part of their regimen, but that background exposure already heightens infection risk. Adding more systemic steroids for a URI would compound that risk without offsetting benefit, so if anything, I should avoid escalation unless there is a compelling non-URI indication, reinforcing the general principle to minimize immunosuppression in the setting of active infection when feasible [^111TFJKz] [^112HseeK].

> I should confirm safer, evidence-aligned alternatives for symptomatic relief. Localized therapies such as intranasal corticosteroids for rhinitis symptoms have minimal systemic absorption and are preferred over systemic steroids. Otherwise, supportive care with analgesics, hydration, and close follow-up is appropriate, with a low threshold to escalate evaluation if symptoms progress, hypoxia develops, or systemic features suggest LRTI or opportunistic disease in this immunocompromised host [^113M7avZ] [^116jPB2g].

> Synthesis and recommendation: Systemic corticosteroids should not be administered for an uncomplicated upper respiratory infection in a liver transplant recipient, given the lack of efficacy for URIs and the meaningful risk of infectious complications, disease masking, and metabolic adverse effects. Reserve steroids for guideline-supported indications such as Pneumocystis pneumonia with hypoxemia or select ARDS phenotypes after careful risk–benefit assessment and infectious disease consultation, and use local or supportive measures for symptom control instead [^114m3PfB] [^114HYhKF] [^111q5Y1S] [^112HseeK].

---

Systemic corticosteroids are **not recommended** for routine treatment of upper respiratory infections (URIs) in liver transplant recipients because they increase the risk of secondary infections, delayed viral clearance, and masking of infection symptoms [^112HseeK] [^114m3PfB]. Steroids should be **avoided** unless there is a clear indication, such as acute cellular rejection or severe hypoxemia from Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) [^114HYhKF] [^116K2mpn]. If corticosteroids are absolutely necessary, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, and monitor closely for infection progression and complications.

---

## Risks associated with corticosteroid use in liver transplant recipients with URI

Corticosteroids cause broad immunosuppression, increasing susceptibility to bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, and can **worsen existing infections or trigger reactivation of latent infections** (e.g. tuberculosis, hepatitis B, Strongyloides) [^112HseeK] [^116oRSr6]. They can also mask infection symptoms, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. In transplant recipients, corticosteroids are linked to higher risks of opportunistic infections — including PJP, CMV, and invasive fungal disease — which can be severe or fatal [^113B8HDx] [^113nSRg4].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding corticosteroid use in URI for liver transplant recipients

There is **no evidence supporting routine corticosteroid use** for URIs in liver transplant recipients. For immunocompetent adults, guidelines do not recommend systemic steroids for acute respiratory infections, including URIs, due to lack of benefit and potential harm [^114m3PfB]. In transplant populations, corticosteroids are reserved for specific indications — such as acute rejection or severe PJP with hypoxemia — not for uncomplicated URIs [^116K2mpn] [^114HYhKF].

---

## Potential benefits versus risks

Although corticosteroids may transiently reduce inflammation and symptoms, these potential benefits are outweighed by the **significant risks** of infection progression, delayed viral clearance, and complications in immunocompromised patients. Therefore, routine corticosteroid use for URIs in liver transplant recipients is not justified.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines and expert consensus recommend avoiding routine corticosteroid use for URIs in liver transplant recipients. Steroids should be **reserved for specific indications**, such as:

- **Acute cellular rejection**: High-dose corticosteroids (e.g. methylprednisolone 500–1000 mg IV daily for 1–3 days) followed by a taper are recommended for moderate to severe acute rejection [^116K2mpn].

- **Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP)**: Corticosteroids are indicated only in patients with significant hypoxemia (PaO2 < 70 mmHg on room air) in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy [^114HYhKF].

- **Severe COVID-19 or ARDS**: Corticosteroids may be beneficial in specific clinical scenarios, but evidence is limited and should be individualized [^111q5Y1S].

---

## Alternative treatments and supportive care

For URIs in liver transplant recipients, **supportive care** is recommended:

- **Supportive care**: Analgesics, antipyretics, hydration, and rest.

- **Antiviral therapy**: Consider if influenza or other specific viral infections are confirmed.

- **Monitoring**: Close monitoring for progression to lower respiratory tract infection or opportunistic infections.

---

## Monitoring and precautions if corticosteroids are deemed necessary

If corticosteroids are absolutely necessary, the following precautions are recommended:

- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.

- **Close monitoring**: Regularly monitor for infection progression, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and other corticosteroid-related adverse effects.

- **Infection prophylaxis**: Consider prophylaxis for opportunistic infections (e.g. PJP, CMV) as indicated.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Corticosteroid use** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated URI in liver transplant recipient | Not recommended | - Increased infection risk <br/> - Delayed viral clearance <br/> - Masking of symptoms [^112HseeK] [^114m3PfB] |
| Acute cellular rejection | Recommended | Standard treatment protocol [^116K2mpn] |
| PJP with hypoxemia | Recommended | Adjunctive therapy with antimicrobial treatment [^114HYhKF] |
| Severe COVID-19 or ARDS | Considered | Individualized decision based on clinical judgment [^111q5Y1S] |

---

Systemic corticosteroids are **not recommended** for routine treatment of URIs in liver transplant recipients due to increased infection risks and potential harm. They should be reserved for specific indications, such as acute rejection or severe PJP with hypoxemia, and used with caution and close monitoring. Supportive care and close monitoring are the mainstays of URI management in this population.

Recurrent autoimmune hepatitis after liver transplantation (LT) — clinical course and corticosteroid effects: Outcomes of LT for AIH are typically good, although infection is relatively common in the early post-LT period due to immunosuppression usage. Patients transplanted for AIH-related acute liver failure have similar survival and recurrence rates as those with AIH-related cirrhosis. However, TCMR and CDR occur more commonly in recipients with AIH than other liver diseases and allograft failure can result from CDR or cirrhosis due to recurrent AIH. A small, single center study showed low dose corticosteroid in combination with other immunosuppressive agents reduced recurrent AIH, but a meta-analysis of limited datasets and another more recent study demonstrated no benefit of long-term administration of corticosteroids on disease recurrence or patient survival. Ongoing corticosteroid use may in fact be harmful for patients who have underlying osteoporosis or are at increased risk of infection.

Corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — implementation and safety considerations are outlined as follows: Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer, yet there is substantial heterogeneity in dosing, timing, and duration with uncertainty about the optimal course, and data on short- and long-term adverse effects are limited with low- to very-low certainty for other safety outcomes. Although evidence applies to intubated ARDS, corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit in some nonintubated groups; for nonintubated individuals, corticosteroids should be administered for those with ARDS etiologies known to benefit (COVID-19, severe community-acquired pneumonia), and the role in nonintubated patients with other etiologies remains uncertain. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit with regimens defined in large randomized controlled trials, whereas for other ARDS etiologies, several regimens used in clinical trials may reasonably be chosen based on an individual patient's risk profile for steroid side effects. The initiation of corticosteroid treatment > 2 weeks after onset of ARDS may be associated with harm, and the use of corticosteroids should be accompanied by close surveillance for adverse effects, particularly in higher-risk populations such as immunocompromised patients or those in regions endemic for tuberculosis or parasitic disease.

Invasive aspergillosis — host risk factors in transplant and immunocompromised populations are outlined: patients at risk include those with prolonged neutropenia, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients, solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, patients receiving corticosteroids, those with advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and those with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Allogeneic HSCT recipients have a significantly higher risk than autologous HSCT recipients, and in allogeneic HSCT there are 3 periods of risk for invasive mold disease — neutropenia following the conditioning regimen, exogenous immunosuppression for treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and exogenous immunosuppression for prevention of chronic GVHD (after day 100 of transplant). In SOT, lung transplant recipients have the highest risk of invasive aspergillosis, and in a multicenter surveillance study approximately one-half of cases in lung transplant recipients were late-onset, occurring 1 year or more after transplantation; cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a risk factor, notably in heart and lung transplant recipients. In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy, invasive aspergillosis is a rare complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, with AIDS-associated aspergillosis most frequently associated with advanced AIDS and additional risk factors such as neutropenia, corticosteroid use, and concurrent opportunistic infections; CGD features recurrent bacterial and fungal infections including invasive aspergillosis, which can be life-threatening. Pretransplant Aspergillus colonization is frequent among cystic fibrosis patients and increases the risk of post–lung transplant invasive aspergillosis.

Steroid therapy discontinuation — KDOQI commentary — notes that steroid sparing within the first few weeks after transplant is widespread in the United States, with more than 25% of patients discharged off steroid therapy, but the work group did not think early discontinuation should be a universal guideline; short- and medium-term protocols show equivalent patient and graft survival while acute rejection rates are higher, and newer regimens decrease prednisone to 5 mg/d. Some centers accomplish discontinuation up to 6 months posttransplant, whereas late discontinuation (> 1 year posttransplant) is no longer recommended; withdrawal should occur only with close frequent monitoring.

Intra-articular corticosteroids — Intra-articular (IA) corticosteroids could provide short-term relief for patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee, with Strength of Recommendation: Moderate (downgrade). Overall pain and function improved with intra-articular corticosteroids; however, such effect lasted only up to 3 months. Analyses differentiating extended versus immediate release found that extended release IA steroids can be used over immediate release to improve patient outcomes (Moderate strength recommendation). The recommendation has been downgraded one level because of potential risk in accelerating osteoarthritis from injections. For implementation safety, the AAOS Patient Safety Committee recommends avoiding musculoskeletal corticosteroid injections for two weeks before and one week after COVID vaccine administration. The cost-effectiveness of different intra-articular therapies is still to be determined.

6.5 Pediatric Renal Transplant Patients

Safety was assessed in a controlled clinical trial in pediatric (< 18 years of age) renal transplant patients considered at high-immunologic risk, defined as a history of one or more acute allograft rejection episodes and/or the presence of chronic allograft nephropathy on a renal biopsy [see Clinical Studies (14.6)]. The use of sirolimus in combination with calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids was associated with a higher incidence of deterioration of renal function (creatinine increased) compared to calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy, serum lipid abnormalities (including, but not limited to, increased serum triglycerides and cholesterol), and urinary tract infections.

6.6 Patients with Lymphangioleiomyomatosis

Safety was assessed in a controlled trial involving 89 patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis, 46 of whom were treated with sirolimus [see Clinical Studies (14.7)]. The adverse drug reactions observed in this trial were consistent with the known safety profile for renal transplant patients receiving sirolimus, with the addition of weight decreased which was reported at a greater incidence with sirolimus when compared to placebo. Adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of ≥ 20% in the sirolimus treatment group and greater than placebo include stomatitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, nasopharyngitis, acne, chest pain, peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, dizziness, myalgia, and hypercholesterolemia.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Acute Serious Liver Injury, Acute Liver Failure or Elevated Aminotransferases

Inform caregivers that ZOLGENSMA could increase liver enzyme levels and cause acute serious liver injury or acute liver failure, and death. Inform caregivers that patients will receive an oral corticosteroid medication before and after infusion with ZOLGENSMA, and will undergo regular blood tests to monitor liver function. Advise caregivers to contact their healthcare provider immediately if the patient's skin and/or whites of the eyes appear yellowish, if the patient misses a dose of corticosteroid or vomits it up, or if the patient experiences a decrease in alertness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Vaccination Before and After Infusion With ZOLGENSMA

Advise caregivers to consult with their healthcare provider to determine if adjustments to the patient's vaccination schedule are necessary during corticosteroid use. Inform caregivers that where feasible, the vaccination schedule should be adjusted appropriately to accommodate treatment with corticosteroid. Prophylaxis against influenza and RSV is recommended and vaccination status should be up-to-date prior to ZOLGENSMA administration. Please consult your healthcare provider [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Systemic Immune Response

Caregivers should be aware that an infection (e.g., cold, flu, gastroenteritis, otitis media, bronchiolitis, etc.) before or after ZOLGENSMA infusion could lead to more serious complications. Caregivers and close contacts of patients should follow infection prevention practices (e.g., hand hygiene, coughing/sneezing etiquette, limiting potential contacts). Advise caregivers of the signs of a possible infection, such as coughing, wheezing, sneezing, runny nose, sore throat, or fever. Caregivers should contact their healthcare provider immediately if the patient experiences any symptoms suggestive of infection before or after ZOLGENSMA infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^114NBA7s]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) — early liver transplantation (LT) evidence and barriers are described as follows: The lack of effective rescue medical therapies for non-responders to prednisolone provides the rationale for considering early LT, and short-term mortality at 1 month from presentation is as high as 50%. In a case controlled study of highly selected patients with severe AH who were non-responsive to corticosteroids, survival at 6 months with early LT was 77% vs. 23%. Recidivism after LT in AH was reported in a minority of patients (< 15%). A national transplant database analysis reported similar liver graft and patient survival at 5 years follow-up for LT recipients listed for AH compared with matched LT recipients for alcoholic cirrhosis. In a survey, LT center directors in the US cited center protocol, socio-cultural issues, organ shortage, and insurance approval as barriers, and only 50% of LT centers were using all the five criteria proposed in the study by Mathurin et al. In the prospective study, 1-year survival of 77% was inferior to historic survival of over 90% after LT for alcoholic cirrhosis, with majority of deaths being due to invasive fungal infections; patients with severe AH are prone to fungal infections, especially those who are non-responders to corticosteroids. Prospective multicenter studies are needed as basis for deriving guidelines for selection of AH patients for LT, antibiotic protocol for infection prevention in the perioperative period, and immunosuppression protocol on long-term follow-up of these patients.

WARNING: IMMUNOSUPPRESSION, USE IS NOT RECOMMENDED IN LIVER OR LUNG TRANSPLANT PATIENTS

Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies may result from immunosuppression

Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma may result from immunosuppression. Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of renal transplant patients should use sirolimus for prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving renal transplants. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver or lung transplant patients, and therefore, such use is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)].
Liver Transplantation – Excess Mortality, Graft Loss, and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT)

The use of sirolimus in combination with tacrolimus was associated with excess mortality and graft loss in a study in de novo liver transplant patients. Many of these patients had evidence of infection at or near the time of death.

In this and another study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of sirolimus in combination with cyclosporine or tacrolimus was associated with an increase in HAT; most cases of HAT occurred within 30 days post-transplantation and most led to graft loss or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Lung Transplantation – Bronchial Anastomotic Dehiscence

Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence, most fatal, have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when sirolimus has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

WARNING: IMMUNOSUPPRESSION, USE IS NOT RECOMMENDED IN LIVER OR LUNG TRANSPLANT PATIENTS

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies may result from immunosuppression (5.1). Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of renal transplant patients should use sirolimus for prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving renal transplants.
The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver or lung transplant patients, and therefore, such use is not recommended (5.2, 5.3).

Systemic antifungal prophylaxis for critically ill liver transplant recipients is suggested based on risk; "We suggest using systemic antifungal prophylaxis in critically ill liver transplant recipients with risk factors for invasive fungal infections (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence)" and "We suggest not using antifungal prophylaxis in critically ill liver transplant recipients at low risk for invasive fungal infections (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence)". Risk factors include "renal failure requiring dialysis, rejection treatment, cytomegalovirus viremia or disease, acute hepatic insufficiency, early graft failure, retransplantation, preoperative use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, fungal colonization, and re-exploration after transplantation". A meta-analysis found reduced invasive fungal infections (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19–0.72) and mortality attributable to invasive fungal infections (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.10–0.83) with prophylaxis, while "overall mortality was not impacted" (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.54–1.39).

### Deflazacort (Jaythari) [^111q6VM9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection

Corticosterosids, including JAYTHARI, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can:

- Reduce resistance to new infections
- Exacerbate existing infections
- Increase the risk of disseminated infections
- Increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections
- Mask some signs of infections Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe, and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages. Monitor for the development of infection and consider JAYTHARI withdrawal or dosage reduction as needed. Tuberculosis If JAYTHARI is used to treat a condition in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of tuberculosis may occur. Closely monitor such patients for reactivation. During prolonged JAYTHARI therapy, patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis. Varicella Zoster and Measles Viral Infections Varicella and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients taking corticosteroids, including deflazacort. In corticosteroid-treated patients who have not had these diseases or are non-immune, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure to varicella and measles.
- If an JAYTHARI-treated patient is exposed to varicella, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immunoglobulin may be indicated. If varicella develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.
- If an JAYTHARI-treated patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin may be indicated. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including JAYTHARI. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection. Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with JAYTHARI. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy. Fungal Infections Corticosteroids, including JAYTHARI, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid JAYTHARI use in the presence of such infections unless deflazacort is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic JAYTHARI therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, JAYTHARI withdrawal or dose reduction is recommended. Amebiasis Corticosteroids, including JAYTHARI, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating JAYTHARI in patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea. Strongyloides Infestation Corticosteroids, including JAYTHARI, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid- induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia. Cerebral Malaria Avoid corticosteroids, including JAYTHARI, in patients with cerebral malaria.

### Everolimus tablets (everolimus) [^1165joCz]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Management of Immunosuppression

Only physicians experienced in management of systemic immunosuppressant therapy in transplantation should prescribe everolimus. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for the maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. In limited data with the complete elimination of calcineurin inhibition (CNI), there was an increased risk of acute rejection.

5.2 Lymphomas and Other Malignancies

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent.

As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor.

5.3 Serious Infections

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including everolimus, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13), Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes. Because of the danger of over-immunosuppression, which can cause increased susceptibility to infection, combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution.

Antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci (carinii) pneumonia and prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus (CMV) is recommended in transplant recipients.

5.4 Kidney Graft Thrombosis

An increased risk of kidney arterial and venous thrombosis, resulting in graft loss, has been reported, usually within the first 30 days post transplantation [see Boxed Warning].

5.5 Hepatic Artery Thrombosis

Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are associated with an increase in hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT). Reported cases mostly have occurred within the first 30 days post transplant and most also lead to graft loss or death. Therefore, everolimus should not be administered earlier than 30 days after liver transplant.

Gynecologic cancer immunotherapy — infectious, autoimmune, endocrine, organ dysfunction, and transplant considerations — For patients with advanced gynecologic cancer and uncontrolled HIV infection, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy may still be considered and infectious disease consultation is recommended. Patients with advanced gynecologic cancer and chronic HBV/HCV infections can still be considered for ICI therapy (LE:1), and liver function should be checked at baseline and before every immunotherapy cycle for these patients and consultation with a hepatitis service should be considered. For patients with a history of active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppression (≥ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent, or biologics), the potential benefits of immunotherapy must be weighed against the ability to tolerate severe irAEs (LE:4). For patients who have significant organ dysfunction due to progressive cancer or to intrinsic non-immune-related disease (eg, cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or pneumonitis) the potential benefit of immunotherapy must be weighed against the potential for severe AEs as these individuals may have limited ability to tolerate irAEs. Patients with hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus can be safely treated with immunotherapy when replacement with hormone therapy is the standard of care (LE:4), and for patients on immunotherapy with pre-existing or immune-related adrenal insufficiency, physiologic replacement doses of steroids should be continued (LE:4). ICIs are generally contraindicated in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients due to the high risk of allograft rejection (LE:1), but each case should be evaluated independently in consultation with the transplant service.

### Methylprednisolone acetate (medroloan II SUIK) [^116nrgu6]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Nursing Mothers

Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from corticosteroids, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

Pediatric Use

The efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the pediatric population are based on the well-established course of effect of corticosteroids which is similar in pediatric and adult populations. Published studies provide evidence of efficacy and safety in pediatric patients for the treatment of nephritic syndrome (patients > 2 years of age) and aggressive lymphomas and leukemias (patients > 1 month of age). Other indications for pediatric use of corticosteroids (e.g., severe asthma and wheezing) are based on adequate and well-controlled clinical trials conducted in adults, on the premises that the course of the diseases and their pathophysiology are considered to be substantially similar in both populations.

The adverse effects of corticosteroids in pediatric patients are similar to those in adults (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Like adults, pediatric patients should be carefully observed with frequent measurements of blood pressure, weight, height, intraocular pressure, and clinical evaluation for the presence of infection, psychosocial disturbances, thromboembolism, peptic ulcers, cataracts, and osteoporosis. Pediatric patients who are treated with corticosteroids by any route, including systemically administered corticosteroids, may experience a decrease in their growth velocity. This negative impact of corticosteroids on growth has been observed at low systemic doses and in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression (i.e. cosyntropin stimulation and basal cortisol plasma levels). Growth velocity may therefore be a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The linear growth of pediatric patients treated with corticosteroids should be monitored, and the potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of treatment alternatives. In order to minimize the potential growth effects of corticosteroids, pediatric patients should be titrated to the lowest effective dose.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

WARNING: IMMUNOSUPPRESSION, USE IS NOT RECOMMENDED IN LIVER OR LUNG TRANSPLANT PATIENTS

Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies may result from immunosuppression

Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma may result from immunosuppression. Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of renal transplant patients should use Rapamune® for prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving renal transplants. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

The safety and efficacy of Rapamune (sirolimus) as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver or lung transplant patients, and therefore, such use is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)].
Liver Transplantation – Excess Mortality, Graft Loss, and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT)

The use of Rapamune in combination with tacrolimus was associated with excess mortality and graft loss in a study in de novo liver transplant patients. Many of these patients had evidence of infection at or near the time of death.

In this and another study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of Rapamune in combination with cyclosporine or tacrolimus was associated with an increase in HAT; most cases of HAT occurred within 30 days post-transplantation and most led to graft loss or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Lung Transplantation – Bronchial Anastomotic Dehiscence

Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence, most fatal, have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when Rapamune has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

WARNING: IMMUNOSUPPRESSION, USE IS NOT RECOMMENDED IN LIVER OR LUNG TRANSPLANT PATIENTS

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — scope and population focuses on management decisions from clinical diagnosis with radiographic confirmation through completion of antimicrobial therapy and follow-up chest imaging and does not address initial clinical diagnostic criteria or prevention. The guideline centers on patients in the United States without recent foreign travel and on adults without an immunocompromising condition, including those actively receiving cancer chemotherapy, patients infected with HIV with suppressed CD4 counts, and solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Although CAP may be diagnosed without a chest radiograph in ambulatory settings, the guideline emphasizes studies using radiographic criteria given the known inaccuracy of clinical signs and symptoms alone. Empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on agents effective against major treatable bacterial causes, traditionally including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

### Satralizumab (Enspryng) [^1119gRLa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Infections

An increased risk of infections, including serious and potentially fatal infections, has been observed in patients treated with IL-6 receptor antagonists, including ENSPRYNG.

The most common infections reported in a randomized clinical trial of patients treated with ENSPRYNG who were not on other chronic immunosuppressant therapies (Study 1), and that occurred more often than in patients receiving placebo, were nasopharyngitis (12%) and cellulitis (10%). The most common infections in patients who were on an additional concurrent immunosuppressant, and that occurred more often than in patients receiving placebo, were nasopharyngitis (31%), upper respiratory infection (19%), and pharyngitis (12%).

Delay ENSPRYNG administration in patients with an active infection, including localized infections, until the infection is resolved.

Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation

Risk of HBV reactivation has been observed with other immunosuppressant therapies. Patients with chronic HBV infection were excluded from clinical trials. Perform HBV screening in all patients before initiation of treatment with ENSPRYNG. Do not administer ENSPRYNG to patients with active hepatitis. For patients who are chronic carriers of HBV [HBsAg+] or are negative for HBsAg and positive for HB core antibody [HBcAb+], consult liver disease experts before starting and during treatment with ENSPRYNG.

Tuberculosis

Tuberculosis has occurred in patients treated with other interleukin-6 receptor antagonists. Patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis risk factors and tested for latent infection prior to initiating ENSPRYNG. Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of ENSPRYNG in patients with a history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Consult infectious disease experts regarding whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate before starting treatment. Patients should be monitored for the development of symptoms and signs of tuberculosis with ENSPRYNG, even if initial tuberculosis testing is negative.

Vaccinations

Live or live-attenuated vaccines should not be given concurrently with ENSPRYNG because clinical safety has not been established. Administer all immunizations according to immunization guidelines at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of ENSPRYNG for live or live-attenuated vaccines and, whenever possible, at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of ENSPRYNG for non-live vaccines.

Muromonab (OKT3) — indications, contraindications, and key toxicities: Muromonab has received FDA approval for treatment of steroid-resistant heart transplant rejection, steroid-resistant liver transplant rejection, and renal transplant rejection, and has been used in non-FDA-approved indications for lung transplant rejection and prophylaxis where the evidence supports a favorable outcome; muromonab-CD3 is almost always used in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Use is contraindicated during pregnancy (category C) or during breast-feeding. Serious major adverse drug effects include anaphylaxis; pulmonary edema; blindness or visual impairment, which may be irreversible; encephalopathy; increased risk of infections; and serious inflammatory disorders involving the CNS and cardiovascular and respiratory systems, with additional risks including enhanced risk of neoplastic disease; neurologic disorders and depressive symptoms. Hypotension, hypertension, and tachycardia occur frequently during administration, rash and pruritus can be observed, and extremely high fever (temperature in excess of 107°F [41.7°C]) can occur during administration of the first dose. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are present in roughly one-third of treated patients. Antibodies to muromonab will develop in a large portion of treated patients and may limit the effectiveness of this agent over time. Cytokine release syndrome with pulmonary edema may occur with administration and may be prevented or reduced in severity by pretreatment with corticosteroids, antihistamines, and acetaminophen. The use of muromonab has been associated with immunosuppression-related neoplasms, with accumulating evidence indicating an increased incidence of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder in patients who receive muromonab-CD3, and the use of this agent has also been associated with fungal, viral, and bacterial infections with an increased incidence of CMV infection observed.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^117Rt1xM]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis — management in severe acute disease and ALF: For those with AS-AIH without ALF, glucocorticoid therapy (prednisone or prednisolone alone, 0.5–1 mg/kg or a total of 60 mg daily in adults) can be beneficial without an increased risk of adverse outcomes such as infection, and therapy should not delay evaluation for liver transplantation (LT), with up to 48% of treated patients likely to require LT. The prognosis of AS-AIH ALF has improved significantly with the greater adoption of corticosteroid therapy and LT; survival rates for AS-AIH ALF in the pretransplant era were less than 20%, and more recent series show mortality rates of 16%–19%. Use of corticosteroid therapy in patients with chronic AIH with exacerbation or with ALF remains less certain, with data mixed showing both improved outcome and transplant-free survival or no benefit. Key concepts: In patients presenting with AS-AIH, we recommend the use of IV corticosteroids, and in patients with AS-AIH that has progressed to ALF, we recommend early evaluation for LT. The role of budesonide and other immunosuppressive agents such as tacrolimus in severe acute AIH is not well supported, so they cannot be recommended for general use at this time, and patients should be immediately evaluated for LT, and vigilant surveillance for infection should also be a part of the comprehensive care of patients with AS-AIH or AIH-induced ALF.

### Cyclosporine (Sandimmune) [^112hzKHk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatotoxicity

Cases of hepatotoxicity and liver injury, including cholestasis, jaundice, hepatitis, and liver failure have been reported in patients treated with cyclosporine. Most reports included patients with significant co-morbidities, underlying conditions and other confounding factors, including infectious complications and comedications with hepatotoxic potential. In some cases, mainly in transplant patients, fatal outcomes have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Postmarketing Experience).

Hepatotoxicity, usually manifested by elevations in hepatic enzymes and bilirubin, was reported in patients treated with cyclosporine in clinical trials: 4% in renal transplantation, 7% in cardiac transplantation, and 4% in liver transplantation. This was usually noted during the first month of therapy when high doses of Sandimmune (cyclosporine) were used. The chemistry elevations usually decreased with a reduction in dosage.

Malignancies

As in patients receiving other immunosuppressants, those patients receiving Sandimmune (cyclosporine) are at increased risk for development of lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly those of the skin. The increased risk appears related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of specific agents. Because of the danger of oversuppression of the immune system, which can also increase susceptibility to infection, Sandimmune (cyclosporine) should not be administered with other immunosuppressive agents except adrenal corticosteroids. The efficacy and safety of cyclosporine in combination with other immunosuppressive agents have not been determined. Some malignancies may be fatal. Transplant patients receiving cyclosporine are at increased risk for serious infection with fatal outcome.

### Consensus document for the selection of lung transplant candidates: an update from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [^115UTDCF]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung transplant candidate selection — In advanced CF, infection or colonization with multidrug‑resistant organisms, including Burkholderia cepacia complex, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and nontuberculous mycobacteria, is linked to worse natural history, and post‑transplant recolonization from sinus or upper airway reservoirs is associated with graft dysfunction. A potentially modifiable comorbidity is malnutrition; notably, median post‑transplant survival was 7.0 years in CF patients with pre‑transplant BMI < 17kg/m2. Clinically important liver disease occurs in only 3%-5%, mostly before age 20 years, and in cases of overt portal hypertension or synthetic dysfunction, combined lung‑liver transplant has had comparable outcomes to lung transplant alone. Given increased colorectal cancer risk, transplant programs should screen CF candidates with colonoscopy beginning at age 40 years based on the 2017 CF Foundation Guidelines.

American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guideline — scope and methods: Immunosuppressive pharmacologic agents prescribed to patients with diffuse interstitial and inflammatory lung disease and lung transplant recipients are associated with potential risks for adverse reactions, and strategies to minimize such risks include administering these drugs according to established, safe protocols, monitoring to detect manifestations of toxicity, and patient education. To maximize safe use, the American College of Chest Physicians established a committee to examine the clinical evidence for the administration and monitoring of immunosuppressive drugs, with the exception of corticosteroids. Committee members developed and refined questions about toxicities and current approaches to administration and monitoring, a systematic review was carried out by the American College of Chest Physicians, and the committee used this information to create an evidence-based guideline intended to improve patient safety when immunosuppressive drugs are given to lung transplant recipients and to patients with diffuse interstitial lung disease.

### Mycophenolate mofetil [^1136Mjb5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The following adverse reactions were reported with 3% to < 20% incidence in kidney, heart, and liver transplant patients treated with Mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Pediatrics

The type and frequency of adverse events in a clinical study for prevention of kidney allograft rejection in 100 pediatric patients 3 months to 18 years of age dosed with Mycophenolate mofetil oral suspension 600 mg/m2twice daily (up to 1 g twice daily) were generally similar to those observed in adult patients dosed with Mycophenolate mofetil capsules at a dose of 1 g twice daily with the exception of abdominal pain, fever, infection, pain, sepsis, diarrhea, vomiting, pharyngitis, respiratory tract infection, hypertension, leukopenia, and anemia, which were observed in a higher proportion in pediatric patients.

Safety information in pediatric heart transplant or pediatric liver transplant patients treated with Mycophenolate mofetil is supported by an open-label study in pediatric liver transplant patients and publications; the type and frequency of the reported adverse reactions are consistent with those observed in pediatric patients following renal transplant and in adults.

Geriatrics

Geriatric patients (≥ 65 years), particularly those who are receiving Mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous

The safety profile of Mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral Mycophenolate mofetil in kidney transplant patients in the immediate post-transplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of Mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse reactions attributable to peripheral venous infusion of Mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in the placebo group received active medication by the oral route.

Adverse reactions attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with Mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous.

Autoimmune hepatitis after adult liver transplantation — immunosuppression and monitoring are addressed as follows: Although there is no evidence for recommending a particular immunosuppressive regimen in patients undergoing transplantation for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), it is prudent to maintain patients on long-term, low-dose corticosteroids in addition to routine immunosuppression (with attention to maintaining bone health; grade 2, level B). Patients should be closely monitored for evidence of recurrence via liver tests every 6 months, and protocol liver biopsy should be considered at 5 yearly intervals.

14.1	Treatment of Invasive Aspergillosis with Noxafil Injection and Noxafil Delayed-Release Tablets

Aspergillosis Treatment Study (NCT01782131) was a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial which evaluated the safety and efficacy of Noxafil injection and Noxafil delayed-release tablets versus voriconazole for primary treatment of invasive fungal disease caused by Aspergillus species. Eligible patients had proven, probable, or possible invasive fungal infections per the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group, EORTC/MSG criteria. Patients were stratified by risk for mortality or poor outcome where high risk included a history of allogeneic bone marrow transplant, liver transplant, or relapsed leukemia undergoing salvage chemotherapy. The median age of patients was 57 years (range 14–91 years), with 27.8% of patients aged ≥ 65 years; 5 patients were pediatric patients 14–16 years of age, of whom 3 were treated with Noxafil and 2 with voriconazole. The majority of patients were male (59.8%) and white (67.1%). With regard to risk factors for invasive aspergillosis, approximately two-thirds of the patients in the study had a recent history of neutropenia, while approximately 20% with a history of an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Over 80% of subjects in each treatment group had infection limited to the lower respiratory tract (primarily lung), while approximately 11% to 13% also had infection in another organ. Invasive aspergillosis was proven or probable in 58.1% of patients as classified by independent adjudicators blinded to study treatment assignment. At least one Aspergillus species was identified in 21% of the patients; A. fumigatus and A. flavus were the most common pathogens identified.

### Everolimus (Zortress) [^112Mj26p]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1

	Management of Immunosuppression

Only physicians experienced in management of systemic immunosuppressant therapy in transplantation should prescribe Zortress. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for the maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. In limited data with the complete elimination of calcineurin inhibition (CNI), there was an increased risk of acute rejection.

5.2

	Lymphomas and Other Malignancies

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including Zortress, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent.

As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor.

5.3

	Serious Infections

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including Zortress, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections [s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.1 3), Adverse Reactions (6. 1, 6. 2)]. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes. Because of the danger of over-immunosuppression, which can cause increased susceptibility to infection, combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution.

Antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci (carinii) pneumonia and prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus (CMV) is recommended in transplant recipients.

5.4

	Kidney Graft Thrombosis

An increased risk of kidney arterial and venous thrombosis, resulting in graft loss, has been reported, usually within the first 30 days posttransplantation [s ee Boxed Warning].

5.5

	Hepatic Artery Thrombosis

Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are associated with an increase in hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT). Reported cases mostly have occurred within the first 30 days posttransplant and most also lead to graft loss or death. Therefore, Zortress should not be administered earlier than 30 days after liver transplant.

### Long-term management of the successful adult liver transplant: 2012 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^114WcPum]. Liver Transplantation (2013). Medium credibility.

PSC after liver transplantation — surveillance, recurrence, and risk factors — has several key points. PSC is an excellent indication for LT with good long-term outcomes. Recipients with a Roux loop are at increased risk for recurrent cholangitis; those few who have a retained native bile duct are at risk for cholangiocarcinoma. LT recipients with chronic ulcerative colitis (CUC) are at greater risk of developing colonic polyps and cancer and should have an annual colonoscopy; there is no evidence for the optimal screening approach in PSC LT recipients without CUC, but many advocate an annual colonoscopy in this group also. Recurrent PSC is seen in up to 50% of patients at 5 years, with graft loss due to recurrent PSC occurring in as many as 25% of patients with recurrent PSC. Risk factors for recurrent PSC include male sex, an intact colon before or during transplantation, a history of steroid-resistant or recurrent rejection, active CUC after transplantation, the use of anti-lymphocyte therapy for the treatment of cellular rejection, sex mismatch between the donor and the recipient, CMV infection, and the presence of specific HLA haplotypes (eg, HLA-DRB1✱08). In PSC recipients with CUC, prophylactic colectomy does not reduce the risk of recurrent PSC, and there is insufficient evidence to support maintaining corticosteroids in patients undergoing transplantation for PSC.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^116woNm2]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

AASLD–IDSA Hepatitis C guidance — monitoring and safety in acute HCV infection notes that monitoring with hepatic panels (ALT, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], bilirubin, and INR in the setting of an increasing bilirubin level) is recommended at 2-week to 4-week intervals until resolution of acute hepatitis, and acetaminophen and alcohol consumption should be avoided during acute HCV infection. Patients with acute HCV infection rarely require hospitalization unless nausea and vomiting are severe; although acute liver failure is very rare (< 1%), patients with an INR > 1.5 and those with signs of acute liver failure (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy) should be immediately referred to a liver transplant center, and use of HCV antiviral regimens in acute liver failure should be managed by a clinician experienced in HCV treatment, ideally in consultation with a liver transplant specialist.

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) — immunotherapy in special populations: For solid organ transplant recipients with CSCC who are potential candidates for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, healthcare professionals should have a careful risk–benefit discussion with the patient that includes the potential risk of allograft loss, which may result in the need for dialysis (ie, for kidney transplant recipients) or death (eg, recipients of heart, lung, or liver transplants), and chemotherapy and/or EGFR inhibitors are acceptable alternative first-line therapies in this population; Enrollment in clinical trials should be encouraged. For patients with CSCC who are receiving high-dose corticosteroids for reasons other than solid organ allograft preservation, the dose of corticosteroids should be reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone (or equivalent) per day, if possible, prior to initiation of ICI therapy. Caution is advised when treating with ICIs in patients with CSCC who have a history of autoimmune disease, and healthcare professionals should have a careful risk–benefit discussion with the patient, which includes the potential risks associated with an autoimmune flare. For patients with CSCC on therapeutic immune suppression, a discussion should be initiated on reducing or modifying immune suppression, if appropriate, before proceeding with ICI therapy.

### Acute pharyngitis… [^113M7avZ]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

An analysis of national claims data found that 21% of adults received at least one outpatient prescription for a short-term systemic corticosteroid over a three-year period, even after excluding patients who had asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, or inflammatory conditions for which chronic steroids may be indicated. The most common diagnoses associated with outpatient prescribing of short-term corticosteroids included upper respiratory infection, spine conditions, allergic rhinitis, acute bronchitis, connective tissue and joint disorders, asthma, and skin disorders. 1 Most of these short courses of corticosteroids were prescribed by family medicine and internal medicine physicians.

1 Several recent studies have confirmed high rates of prescribing systemic corticosteroids for patients with acute respiratory tract infections, ranging from 11% of all outpatient respiratory infections in a national study 2 to 70% of patients with at least one week of cough in a small study at two urgent care clinics. Acute Pharyngitis Short-term systemic corticosteroids may provide some benefit for patients with peritonsillar abscess. 13 Current allergy society guidelines do not recommend systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, especially because nasal steroids are effective for this condition and do not have systemic side effects.

14, 15 Before the wide adoption of nasal steroid use, a group in Denmark found a higher rate of diabetes mellitus and osteoporosis in patients who had received repeated steroid intramuscular systemic injections for allergic rhinitis compared with those who received allergy immunotherapy. 16 In summary, a short course of systemic steroids is not recommended for allergic rhinitis. 19 There were mixed results regarding possible benefit for the corticosteroid group vs. placebo. Three weeks after randomization, there was a small statistically significant, but not clinically significant, improvement in a disability index score and no difference in pain, with similar results at one year.

19 Given the lack of consistent supporting evidence, short-term systemic corticosteroids should not be routinely offered for patients with lumbar radiculopathy. To date, there is no high-quality evidence evaluating the use of systemic steroids for cervical radiculopathy or for patients with nonradicular, noncancer-related back or neck pain.

5.6 Liver Injury

The liver is a site of accumulation of antisense oligonucleotides. In clinical studies, 8% of TEGSEDI-treated patients had an increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at least 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), compared to 3% of patients on placebo; 3% of TEGSEDI-treated patients had an ALT at least 8 times the ULN, compared to no patient on placebo. One clinical study patient experienced an increased ALT more than 30 times the ULN. After a course of corticosteroids and discontinuation of TEGSEDI, the patient's ALT returned to normal levels. Some patients had resolution of the liver laboratory abnormalities with continued use of TEGSEDI.

In clinical studies, demonstrated or possible cases of immune-mediated biliary disease occurred in TEGSEDI-treated patients. There was a single case of autoimmune hepatitis with primary biliary cirrhosis in a patient with a family history of primary biliary cirrhosis, as well as a single case of biliary obstruction of unclear etiology.

Monitor alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin at baseline and monthly during treatment with TEGSEDI. If a patient develops clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine), promptly measure serum transaminases and total bilirubin and interrupt treatment with TEGSEDI, as appropriate.

If a patient is suspected to have developed liver injury induced by TEGSEDI treatment, TEGSEDI should be discontinued.

Liver Transplant Rejection

In a clinical study, cases of liver transplant rejection were reported 2–4 months after starting TEGSEDI in patients whose liver allografts had previously been clinically stable (for over 10 years) prior to starting TEGSEDI. In these cases, the patients clinically improved and transaminase levels normalized after glucocorticoid administration and cessation of TEGSEDI.

In patients with a history of liver transplant, monitor ALT, AST, and total bilirubin monthly. Discontinue TEGSEDI in patients who develop signs of liver transplant rejection.

### Systemic corticosteroid use for acute respiratory tract illnesses… [^114m3PfB]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Clinical practice guidelines do not recommend systemic steroids in the treatment of acute respiratory tract infections. 1 While some studies have shown earlier symptom resolution with steroids given for pharyngitis, 2 clinical trials show no efficacy of systemic steroids for sinusitis3 and bronchitis. 4 Adverse events can develop within 30 days of short-term steroid use, which raises concern about the safety of systemic steroids for ARTIs. 5 We conducted the present study to examine the frequency of steroid use for ARTIs in Louisiana and nationally and to examine factors associated with this clinical practice.

We conducted a retrospective observational study of adults who had outpatient ambulatory care encounters that included an ARTI diagnosis through Ochsner Health System primary care clinics in 2014 and as reported in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey in 2012 to 2013. In multivariate analysis, there were significantly higher odds for steroid prescriptions among patients' with a medical history of COPD or asthma, visit diagnosis of bronchitis; visit diagnoses of sinusitis or otitis, allergic rhinitis, upper respiratory infection, or bronchitis; and encounters with a NP. Odds for steroid injection were lower among encounters with patients who were nonwhite (eg, African American, or Medicaid or Medicare insured [OR, 0. 80; 95% CI,

Leflunomide — laboratory monitoring, hepatic safety actions, and interactions in lung disease and lung transplant recipients: Patients should have a CBC count, liver function panel, and phosphate and creatinine tests when commencing leflunomide therapy; these are repeated every 4 to 6 weeks for the first 6 months of treatment, and if stable after 6 months, these parameters can be checked every 6 to 12 weeks; if leflunomide is coadministered with methotrexate (MTX), CBC count, liver function panel, and phosphate and creatinine levels should be obtained every 1 to 3 months indefinitely, and clinical monitoring for infections and signs of hepatotoxicity is also recommended. In some cases, investigators who encountered ALT elevations between twofold and threefold the upper limit of normal allowed a dose reduction to 10 mg/d with continued administration of leflunomide under close monitoring, and if elevations between twofold and threefold the upper limit of normal persisted despite dose reduction or if ALT elevations more than threefold the upper limit of normal were present, leflunomide was discontinued; in some cases, cholestyramine or charcoal were administered. Additional considerations state that leflunomide is renally cleared, and dose modification should be considered for moderate to severe renal disease; the half-life of the drug is prolonged, and for patients with toxicity, cholestyramine should be used for rapid elimination; leflunomide will interact with methotrexate and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, however the drugs can be given concurrently but may require more frequent monitoring of the CBC count, and screening for the excessive use of alcohol or history of hepatitis C is recommended.

Infectious disease — general overview after liver transplant (LT) highlights that the interval from the third to sixth month after LT is a high-risk period for opportunistic pathogens and that risk decreases after the sixth month with reduced immunosuppression; from 3 to 24 months after LT, infections are commonly intra-abdominal, lower respiratory, or community-acquired. The implementation of prophylactic antimicrobials, avoidance of high-risk exposures, and minimization of immunosuppression may reduce these pathogens, while rare infections related to immunosuppression are noted but not reviewed here; Table 12 outlines prophylactic strategies and Table 4 outlines anti-infective–immunosuppressant interactions.

### Reproductive health after thoracic transplantation: an ISHLT expert consensus statement [^114Db7wn]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Corticosteroid safety in pregnancy — there is concern for an increased risk of fetal malformations specifically orofacial clefts; a prospective cohort study of prednisone use noted an increased rate of premature delivery and low birth weight but no significant difference in major birth defects between exposed and unexposed groups; a meta-analysis found a 3-fold increased risk of oral clefts with first trimester corticosteroid exposure, though it included studies with any corticosteroids at any dose for any duration. Overall prednisone and prednisolone use during pregnancy appears relatively safe at contemporary dosing in transplantation, recognizing that premature delivery risk with corticosteroids may be dose-related; there is no therapeutic drug monitoring for corticosteroids, dose adjustments are generally not performed due to pregnancy, and there is little evidence of a clinically relevant impact of pregnancy on blood concentration.

### Long-term management of the successful adult liver transplant: 2012 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^111VJ5xA]. Liver Transplantation (2013). Medium credibility.

AASLD/AST adult liver transplant infection assessment — An assessment for infections following LT should take into account the intensity of immunosuppression, the timing of the presentation, the environmental and donor exposures, the recipient's history of both symptomatic and latent infections, and the utilization of prophylactic antimicrobials and immunizations (grade 1, level A). The interval from the third to sixth month after LT is a high-risk period because of opportunistic pathogens, including herpes viruses (especially CMV, herpes zoster and simplex, and EBV), fungi (including Aspergillus and Cryptococcus), and unusual bacterial infections such as Nocardia, Listeria, and mycobacteria. The implementation of prophylactic antimicrobials, the avoidance of high-risk exposures, and the minimization of immunosuppression may reduce the occurrence of these pathogens. After the sixth posttransplant month, the risk of infection is lower, and this is related to the reduction of immunosuppression. From 3 to 24 months after LT, in the standard-risk LT recipient, the most common infections are intra-abdominal or lower respiratory tract or infections by community-acquired pathogens such as enteric gram-negative infections, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and respiratory viruses.

Medication and immunosuppression management in pediatric HCV — In children with HCV-related advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, medications known to accelerate hepatic fibrosis (e.g., methotrexate) should be avoided, if possible. Although corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants may enhance HCV replication, they are not contraindicated in children with HCV infection, and chronic HCV infection should not delay bone marrow transplantation despite underlying liver disease being a risk factor for hepatic veno-occlusive disease. No dosage adjustments are necessary for commonly prescribed medications such as antimicrobial, antiepileptic, and cardiovascular agents. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin should be avoided, if possible, for patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices due to gastrointestinal bleeding and nephrotoxicity risks, and acetaminophen is a safe and effective analgesic for children and adolescents with chronic HCV infection when dosed per packaging recommendations.

### Deflazacort [^112HseeK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection

Corticosterosids, including deflazacort, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can:

- Reduce resistance to new infections
- Exacerbate existing infections
- Increase the risk of disseminated infections
- Increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections
- Mask some signs of infections Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe, and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages. Monitor for the development of infection and consider deflazacort withdrawal or dosage reduction as needed. Tuberculosis If deflazacort is used to treat a condition in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of tuberculosis may occur. Closely monitor such patients for reactivation. During prolonged deflazacort therapy, patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis. Varicella Zoster and Measles Viral Infections Varicella and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients taking corticosteroids, including deflazacort. In corticosteroid-treated patients who have not had these diseases or are non-immune, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure to varicella and measles.
- If an deflazacort-treated patient is exposed to varicella, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immunoglobulin may be indicated. If varicella develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.
- If an deflazacort-treated patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin may be indicated. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including deflazacort. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection. Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with deflazacort. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy. Fungal Infections Corticosteroids, including deflazacort, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid deflazacort use in the presence of such infections unless deflazacort is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic deflazacort therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, deflazacort withdrawal or dose reduction is recommended. Amebiasis Corticosteroids, including deflazacort, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating deflazacort in patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea. Strongyloides Infestation Corticosteroids, including deflazacort, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid- induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia. Cerebral Malaria Avoid corticosteroids, including deflazacort, in patients with cerebral malaria.

### International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation consensus statement on the referral and selection of pediatric lung transplant candidates [^114tzZAV]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

ISHLT pediatric lung transplant referral — information required for complete referral includes referring center details (referring medical professional contact, location/hospital, and allied health contacts), patient demographics (name, date of birth, caregiver and patient contact information), comprehensive medical and surgical history (primary and secondary diagnoses and comorbidities; prior thoracic surgeries and vascular access interventions; summary of patient's course and lung disease trajectory; functional status; current respiratory support and ventilation history including CPAP/BiPAP/invasive ventilation and prior intubations; hospitalizations with reason, length of stay, treatment course and outcomes; growth and developmental history; vaccination status including COVID-19 and influenza vaccines; medications with dose, frequency, duration and response; and allergies), investigations (pulmonary function testing including spirometry, lung volumes, DLCO, and MBW or infant PFT if relevant/available; 6-minute walk test with trends; radiologic and imaging reports including CXR, chest CT, echocardiography, MRI or ultrasound; cardiac catheterization reports or cardiac MRI if relevant; infection history with current and previous positive respiratory cultures from sputum and BAL including nontuberculous mycobacteria and atypical organisms; genetic testing reports; and blood testing including blood type [ABO], HLA, PRA, blood gas, CBC and differential, renal and liver function tests, and clotting factors), social and family history (caregiver supports, familial situation and dynamics; detailed psychosocial history; history of compliance or non-adherence with strategies used; smoking history including exposures to tobacco, vaping, or cannabis; and family history of pulmonary disease, genetic disorders, or familiarity with transplantation), and allied health involvement (dietician notes including nutritional support such as gastrostomy-tube, failure to thrive, and special diets; neuropsychological evaluations; social worker evaluation; palliative care discussions, advanced directives, or goals of care; and additional consults such as cardiology, gastroenterology, hematology, nephrology, neurology, and oncology). Importantly, early referral allows time for potential candidates to be vaccinated as some vaccine series require multiple injections over time.

### Consensus recommendations for use of maintenance immunosuppression in solid organ transplantation: endorsed by the American college of clinical pharmacy, American Society of Transplantation, and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [^111Jhztb]. Pharmacotherapy (2022). High credibility.

Belatacept in pancreas, liver, and intestine transplantation — In SPK transplantation, a phase II multicenter open-label randomized trial of concomitant corticosteroid and CNI avoidance minimized tacrolimus over the first 24 weeks and discontinued by week 40, was halted early due to significantly higher biopsy-proven acute rejection in pancreas allografts in the belatacept arm and failed to show kidney function benefit at 52 weeks and beyond; an abstract reported conversion from a corticosteroid-free, CNI–MPA–sirolimus regimen to belatacept with 4–6 weeks of tacrolimus overlap halted kidney dysfunction without improvement in eGFR, with no impact on pancreas allograft markers and no serious viral infections or donor-specific antibody; liver transplant data are limited to a case report with CKD stabilizing to eGFR 20–30 ml/min/1.73 m2 at six months post-conversion; intestine transplant data from a six-patient cohort noted that 83.3% demonstrated an immediate improvement in eGFR and two patients discontinued belatacept due to intolerance.

6.5	Pediatric Renal Transplant Patients

Safety was assessed in a controlled clinical trial in pediatric (< 18 years of age) renal transplant patients considered at high-immunologic risk, defined as a history of one or more acute allograft rejection episodes and/or the presence of chronic allograft nephropathy on a renal biopsy [see Clinical Studies (14.6)]. The use of Rapamune in combination with calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids was associated with a higher incidence of deterioration of renal function (creatinine increased) compared to calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy, serum lipid abnormalities (including, but not limited to, increased serum triglycerides and cholesterol), and urinary tract infections.

6.6	Patients with Lymphangioleiomyomatosis

Safety was assessed in a controlled trial involving 89 patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis, 46 of whom were treated with Rapamune [see Clinical Studies (14.7)]. The adverse drug reactions observed in this trial were consistent with the known safety profile for renal transplant patients receiving Rapamune, with the addition of weight decreased which was reported at a greater incidence with Rapamune when compared to placebo. Adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of ≥ 20% in the Rapamune treatment group and greater than placebo include stomatitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, nasopharyngitis, acne, chest pain, peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, dizziness, myalgia, and hypercholesterolemia.

AASLD/AST long-term management of adult liver transplant — Fungal infection diagnosis and immunosuppression management — The diagnosis of fungal infections may require diagnostic biopsy for pathological and microbiological confirmation (grade 1, level A). Blood cultures are most helpful for the diagnosis of Candida bloodstream infections (class 1, level B) and Blastomyces (grade 1, level B). Cryptococcal antigen testing of cerebrospinal fluid or blood is most helpful for the diagnosis of Cryptococcus (grade 1, level B). Urinary histoplasmosis and Blastomyces antigens are useful for the diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis and blastomycosis, respectively (grade 1, level B). A cautious reduction of immunosuppression should be initiated to prevent immune reconstitution syndrome, especially for cryptococcal infections (grade 1, level B).

### AASLD AST practice guideline on adult liver transplantation: diagnosis and management of graft-related complications [^116K2mpn]. Liver Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

AASLD AST practice guideline — T-cell–mediated rejection (TCMR) after adult liver transplantation is characterized and managed as follows: Acute TCMR occurs in 10%-30% of recipients, usually within the first three months, whereas late TCMR is defined as occurring six months after transplantation, with some defining it as 3–12 months post-LT. Initial treatment of mild acute TCMR (rejection activity index < 4) or late TCMR includes augmentation of existing immunosuppression, and mild acute TCMR may resolve without additional immunosuppression. Patients on cyclosporine (CSA) should be switched to TAC if there are no contraindications, and an additional class of immunosuppression, such as an antimetabolite or mTOR inhibitor, may be added to a CNI-based regimen. Initial treatment of moderate or severe acute or late TCMR includes high dose corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone 500–1000 mg IV daily for 1–3 days) with a subsequent taper (e.g., prednisone 40–80 mg daily, decreased by 10–20 mg decrements until tapered off). Infection prophylaxis should be administered concurrently with high-dose corticosteroids. Approximately 60%-90% of recipients with acute TCMR respond to high-dose corticosteroids, though response may be lower for late TCMR, and late TCMR has been associated with lower graft survival and development of ductopenic rejection in those with poor response. In cases of suboptimal response, repeat liver biopsy may be necessary and close clinician–pathologist collaboration is essential.

Immunosuppressive therapy reduction in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients with parainfluenza virus (PIV) or human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infections — corticosteroid use is a risk factor for poor respiratory viral infection (RVI) outcomes, with high-dose corticosteroids increasing the risk of progression to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) by 3.5-fold in HCT recipients with PIV infections and mortality more than threefold for those receiving corticosteroids at more than 2 mg/kg/day; prednisone-equivalent doses lower than 1 mg/kg/day may not be associated with poorer outcomes. We recommend reduction of systemic immunosuppression when feasible, especially when prednisone-equivalent doses are higher than 1 mg/kg/day (BII).

Pediatric corticosteroid safety — short-course systemic corticosteroids in children: Despite no adverse events reported in the three included studies, a systematic review of short-course oral corticosteroids in children included thirty-eight studies reporting a total of 3,200 children in whom 850 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported. The three most frequent ADRs were vomiting (5.4%), behavioral changes (4.7%), and sleep disturbance (4.3%), and infection during treatment occurred with a pooled prevalence of 0.9%, including 3 children with varicella zoster of whom one died and two were admitted to the ICU with severe complications. When measured, 144 of 369 patients showed increased blood pressure, 21 of 75 showed weight gain, and biochemical hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis suppression was detected in 43 of 53 patients. An additional concern of corticosteroid administration is alteration of the temperature curve (i.e., "masking of fever") and/or generation of temporary improvement in local signs of inflammation.

### Belatacept (Nulojix) [^113nSRg4]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

5.5 Other Serious Infections

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including NULOJIX, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral (cytomegalovirus [CMV] and herpes), fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes [see Boxed Warning and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus is recommended for at least 3 months after transplantation. Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci is recommended after transplantation.

Tuberculosis

Tuberculosis was more frequently observed in patients receiving NULOJIX than cyclosporine in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis and tested for latent infection prior to initiating NULOJIX. Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection should be initiated prior to NULOJIX use.

Polyoma Virus Nephropathy

In addition to cases of JC virus-associated PML [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)], cases of polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), mostly due to BK virus infection, have been reported. PVAN is associated with serious outcomes; including deteriorating renal function and kidney graft loss [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN. Reductions in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of PVAN. Physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft.

5.6 Liver Transplant

Use of NULOJIX in liver transplant patients is not recommended [see Boxed Warning]. In a clinical trial of liver transplant patients, use of NULOJIX regimens with more frequent administration of belatacept than any of those studied in kidney transplant, along with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids, was associated with a higher rate of graft loss and death compared to the tacrolimus control arms. In addition, two cases of PTLD involving the liver allograft (one fatal) and one fatal case of PML were observed among the 147 patients randomized to NULOJIX. The two cases of PTLD were reported among the 140 EBV seropositive patients (1.4%). The fatal case of PML was reported in a patient receiving higher than recommended doses of NULOJIX and MMF [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Evaluation for liver transplantation in adults: 2013 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^114rXXLa]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) — transplant indications, outcomes, and peri-illness therapy — LT is an effective therapy for patients with decompensated chronic autoimmune hepatitis and in patients with autoimmune hepatitis who present with acute liver failure. Long-term outcomes after LT for autoimmune hepatitis are excellent, with 5 to 10-year survival rates of ~75%. Factors associated with poor outcome and need for LT in type I autoimmune hepatitis include delayed aminotransferase response to therapy, younger age, greater acuity at presentation, MELD score > 12, and multiple relapses. Corticosteroid administration in acute liver failure due to autoimmune hepatitis is controversial and is best reserved for less severe disease (MELD < 28) to minimize the risk of sepsis which could preclude transplantation. 32. LT should be considered in patients with decompensated autoimmune hepatitis who do not respond to or are not appropriate candidates for medical therapies (1-A). 33. LT is indicated in autoimmune hepatitis presenting as acute liver failure if recovery is unlikely (1-B).

### Long-term management of the successful adult liver transplant: 2012 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^116EXgJH]. Liver Transplantation (2013). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) after liver transplantation — monitoring and immunosuppression: Patients should be closely monitored for evidence of recurrence via liver tests every 6 months, and protocol liver biopsy should be considered at 5 yearly intervals. Although the majority of patients with putative recurrent AIH will respond clinically, serologically, and histologically to increased immunosuppression, some will progress to end-stage graft failure and may require retransplantation. Although there is no evidence for recommending a particular immunosuppressive regimen in patients undergoing transplantation for AIH, it is prudent to maintain patients on long-term, low-dose corticosteroids in addition to routine immunosuppression (with attention to maintaining bone health; grade 2, level B).

Lung transplantation — corticosteroid withdrawal experience: In lung transplantation, corticosteroids are a standard component of maintenance immunosuppression, and a non-comparative study of 34 patients whose steroids were withdrawn a median of 877 ± 233 days post-transplant found 80% successfully remained off, although steroids were restarted in six patients due to functional deterioration. A second study attempted to withdraw steroids in 35 patients a median 70 ± 13 months post-transplant; discontinuation of steroids did not occur in 27 patients due to unstable PFTs (n = 21) and BOS with associated poor lung function (n = 6), and those with withdrawal had a decrease in mean cholesterol levels with no impact on blood pressure, weight, or FEV1.

### AASLD AST practice guideline on adult liver transplantation: diagnosis and management of graft-related complications [^1139txHa]. Liver Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Adult liver transplantation — induction immunosuppressive therapy utilization and agents are described as follows: Most liver transplantation (LT) programs use parenteral corticosteroids in the immediate post-operative phase. Induction immunosuppressive therapy, defined as potent immunosuppression given immediately prior to liver transplantation, is currently used in 27% of all LT recipients to minimize episodes of rejection within the first three months of LT and may also allow for minimization of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and corticosteroid use to decrease their adverse effects. Induction options consist of lymphocyte-depleting agents (antithymocyte globulin, anti-lymphocyte globulin, and alemtuzumab) and non-lymphocyte-depleting agents or interleukin-2 receptor antagonists (IL2-RA) (basiliximab and daclizumab). Both anti-lymphocyte globulin and daclizumab are no longer commercially available, and alemtuzumab has been associated with a higher risk for infection and malignancy, while recent data on basiliximab and anti-thymocyte globulin did not demonstrate this risk.

### Prednisolone during upper respiratory tract infection in children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome… [^116dXBXE]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

eFigure. Subgroup Analyses for Primary Outcome Measure eAppendix. Extended Acknowledgments Data Sharing Statement Question In children with relapsing corticosteroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, does daily low-dose corticosteroid given at the time of upper respiratory tract infection prevent upper respiratory tract infection–related relapse. Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 365 children, daily low-dose corticosteroid therapy resulted in no difference in the frequency of upper respiratory tract infection–related relapses compared with placebo. Meaning Results of this study suggest that low-dose corticosteroid treatment is not beneficial as a strategy to prevent upper respiratory tract infection–related relapses. Importance In children with corticosteroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, many relapses are triggered by upper respiratory tract infections.

Four small studies found that administration of daily low-dose prednisolone for 5 to 7 days at the time of an upper respiratory tract infection reduced the risk of relapse, but the generalizability of their findings is limited by location of the studies and selection of study population. Objective To investigate the use of daily low-dose prednisolone for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection–related relapses. Design, Setting, and Participants. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the incidence of first upper respiratory tract infection–related relapse. Secondary outcomes included overall rate of relapse, changes in background immunosuppressive treatment, cumulative dose of prednisolone, rates of serious adverse events, incidence of corticosteroid adverse effects, and quality of life. Results. Children were followed up for 12 months from randomization. At each 3-monthly hospital outpatient visit, children were examined clinically.

Information on relapses, medication, and specific corticosteroid adverse effects was collected. Parents also completed an Achenbach Child Behavioral Checklist. 15 Data on QoL were collected at these outpatient visits using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory16, 17 and the Child Health Utility Index–9 Dimension or EuroQoL 5-Dimension18 instruments. The primary outcome was the incidence of the first URR after any URTI during the 12-month follow-up period. Secondary outcomes were the overall rate of URRs, overall rate of relapses, escalations or reductions in background treatment, cumulative dose of prednisolone during 12 months, rates of serious adverse events, incidence of corticosteroid adverse effects, change in behavior measured by ACBC, and QoL.
