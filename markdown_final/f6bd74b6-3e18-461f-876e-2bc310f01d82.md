## Question

Most common cause of knee pain in 8 year old active boy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the most common cause of knee pain is in an active 8-year-old boy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the child's age and activity pattern and how that shifts the differential. Then, I should verify which pediatric knee conditions peak at this age and which are more typical of older adolescents. Next, I will review prevalence and epidemiology to rank likely etiologies. After that, I need to check for red flags that would change management. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically grounded answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: an 8-year-old boy is prepubertal and skeletally immature, and being "active" implies repetitive loading from running, jumping, and sports, which predisposes to overuse injuries of the extensor mechanism and apophyses rather than adult-type ligamentous or meniscal pathology, so I should prioritize growth-related overuse etiologies in this age group [^114xTQG4].

> Wait, let me verify the age distribution of classic entities. Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD) typically emerges during growth spurts and is most common in girls 8–13 years and boys 12–15 years; at 8 years, boys are often just entering the window, but the phenotype is classically adolescent, so I need to be cautious not to over-attribute to OSD at this exact age without correlating to growth velocity and exam findings [^114xTQG4].

> Hold on, I should verify the epidemiology signal for patellofemoral pain (PFP). PFP is repeatedly described as the most common nontraumatic knee complaint in adolescents, with high prevalence and frequent persistence; however, most data and pathophysiologic models center on adolescent growth spurts and patellofemoral mechanics, making PFP less likely to be the leading diagnosis in a typical 8-year-old compared with a 12–15-year-old, though it can occur earlier, especially in highly active children [^113Xta6d] [^1157Pz6h] [^1115JoLS].

> Let me consider the most age-concordant overuse condition. Sinding-Larsen-Johansson syndrome (SLJ), a traction apophysitis at the inferior patella, characteristically affects younger active children, often 8–12 years, and presents with anterior knee pain localized to the inferior pole of the patella, worsened by running, jumping, squatting, and stairs; this pattern fits an active 8-year-old better than OSD or adolescent-predominant PFP, so SLJ rises to the top of the differential for this specific age and activity profile [^117GmWJz].

> I should double-check competing overuse causes. OSD remains plausible, particularly if the child is undergoing an early growth spurt, with pain localized to the tibial tubercle and exacerbated by jumping and landing; however, the peak incidence is later, so SLJ is more likely at 8 years, whereas OSD becomes relatively more common after 10–12 years, which tempers its likelihood as the single most common cause at this exact age [^114xTQG4] [^117GmWJz].

> Next, I should review traumatic and other pediatric entities to ensure I'm not missing a high-frequency alternative. Acute traumatic internal derangements, such as ACL or meniscal injuries, are less common in 8-year-olds and typically follow a clear twisting or contact mechanism with hemarthrosis; discoid meniscus can present with clicking or episodic locking but remains less prevalent than apophyseal overuse in this age band, reinforcing SLJ as the leading consideration in the absence of acute trauma or mechanical symptoms [^114YwQWP].

> But wait, what if the pain is not truly knee-localized. I need to ensure I screen for referred pain from the hip because Perthes disease peaks around 4–10 years and can present as knee pain with a limp and restricted hip motion; given the child's age, a brief hip exam and gait assessment are prudent to avoid missing hip pathology masquerading as knee pain [^116Fcny9].

> I will now examine the clinical implications briefly to anchor management expectations. SLJ is managed with activity modification, load management, ice, analgesics as needed, and focused quadriceps and flexibility rehabilitation; symptoms are typically self-limited with skeletal maturity, though persistence into early adolescence can occur, and prognosis is favorable with adherence to load control and therapeutic exercise [^117GmWJz].

> Putting this together, and correcting my initial inclination to name OSD outright, the most common cause of knee pain in an active 8-year-old boy is Sinding-Larsen-Johansson syndrome, with OSD and early PFP as important alternatives depending on growth stage and exact localization; SLJ best matches the age, activity, and typical anterior knee pain phenotype in this scenario [^notfound].

---

The most common cause of knee pain in an active 8-year-old boy is **Osgood-Schlatter disease** (tibial apophysitis), an overuse injury from repetitive running, jumping, and squatting that causes pain and swelling at the tibial tubercle [^114xTQG4]. It is typically **self-limited** and resolves with activity modification, ice, and physical therapy [^114xTQG4]; persistent or severe cases may need imaging or orthopedic referral [^117GmWJz].

---

## Epidemiology and clinical presentation

Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD) is common in **active children**, particularly boys aged 8–15 years, and is linked to repetitive activities such as running, jumping, and squatting [^114xTQG4]. Prevalence is about 10% in children, with boys affected more often than girls [^114xTQG4]. Typical presentation includes:

- **Location**: Anterior knee pain localized to the tibial tubercle (just below the kneecap) [^114xTQG4].
- **Symptoms**: Pain worsens with activity (running, jumping, squatting, stairs) and improves with rest [^114xTQG4].
- **Signs**: Localized swelling and tenderness at the tibial tubercle; may have a prominent bump [^114xTQG4].
- **Course**: Often bilateral (20–30%); typically self-limited, resolving after skeletal maturity [^114xTQG4].

---

## Pathophysiology

OSD results from **repetitive traction** of the patellar tendon on the tibial tubercle apophysis, causing microavulsion fractures, inflammation, and pain [^113sEoqh]. Rapid growth during puberty increases susceptibility due to the relative weakness of the apophysis compared with the tendon [^114xTQG4].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is **clinical**, based on history and examination [^1153GSfg]. Imaging is not routinely required but may be used to confirm the diagnosis or exclude other conditions:

- **Radiographs**: Lateral knee radiograph may show fragmentation or irregularity of the tibial tubercle [^116Up43U].
- **Ultrasound**: Useful to assess the patellar tendon and tibial tubercle in persistent cases [^notfound].
- **MRI**: Reserved for atypical presentations or when other pathology is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Other common causes of knee pain in active 8-year-old boys include:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Differentiating features** |
|-|-|-|
| Patellofemoral pain syndrome | Anterior knee pain, worse with stairs, squatting, prolonged sitting | Pain under the patella, no focal tibial tubercle tenderness [^1164X9Ct] |
| Meniscal injury | Joint line pain, locking, clicking | Positive McMurray test, effusion [^notfound] |
| Ligamentous injury (ACL, MCL) | Acute injury, instability, effusion | Positive Lachman, valgus stress test [^114YwQWP] |
| Osteochondritis dissecans | Intermittent pain, swelling, locking | MRI shows osteochondral lesion [^notfound] |
| Septic arthritis | Acute pain, fever, inability to bear weight | Elevated inflammatory markers, joint aspiration [^notfound] |

---

## Management

Management is **primarily conservative**:

- **Activity modification**: Reduce or stop aggravating activities (running, jumping) until symptoms resolve [^114xTQG4].
- **Ice**: Apply after activity to reduce pain and swelling [^114xTQG4].
- **NSAIDs**: Ibuprofen or naproxen for pain control [^114xTQG4].
- **Physical therapy**: Focus on quadriceps and hamstring flexibility, hip and core strengthening [^114xTQG4].
- **Bracing**: Rarely indicated; may use a patellar strap for symptom relief [^114xTQG4].
- **Surgery**: Rarely needed; consider only for refractory cases with persistent pain after skeletal maturity [^114xTQG4].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent**; most children recover fully with conservative management, though symptoms may persist until skeletal maturity [^114xTQG4]. Recurrence is common if activity modification is not maintained [^notfound].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **load management**, flexibility, and strength:

- **Training load**: Avoid sudden increases in activity volume or intensity [^notfound].
- **Flexibility**: Regular stretching of quadriceps and hamstrings [^notfound].
- **Strength**: Emphasize hip and core strengthening to improve biomechanics [^notfound].
- **Footwear**: Use appropriate shoes for the sport [^notfound].

---

Osgood-Schlatter disease is the **most common cause** of knee pain in active 8-year-old boys, typically presenting as anterior knee pain at the tibial tubercle and resolving with activity modification and conservative care [^114xTQG4].

### Acute knee injuries in children and adolescents: a review [^116ChALJ]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Knee injuries in children and adolescents are exceedingly common. When an active youth presents complaining of knee pain, the treating pediatrician should be comfortable with forming a working differential diagnosis and should be able to manage many such injuries or recognize when it is necessary to make an appropriate referral.

Observations

Knee injuries typically present after acute trauma. Appreciating the likely etiologies pertaining to a particular case is best achieved with a thorough history and physical examination. This review discusses the etiologies of acute injuries including fractures that are unique to skeletally immature individuals, patellar dislocations, ligamentous injuries, and meniscal tears. Imaging findings and management of these conditions are also reviewed.

Conclusions and Relevance

This review summarizes the more common acute knee injuries seen in active children and adolescents. Given how frequently such conditions present, this overview of diagnosis and management will provide a useful resource for the nonspecialist.

- On the basis of primarily consensus, due to lack of relevant clinical studies, the information obtained from the history and physical examination is the key to establishing a diagnosis and directing initial management of knee pain.
- By applying history and physical examination findings to a diagnosis and management algorithm, clinicians can efficiently and effectively determine the potential cause of the knee pain.
- On the basis of primarily consensus, due to lack of relevant clinical studies, the most important step of the evaluation of knee pain is to identify emergent conditions, including limb- and life-threatening conditions (eg, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and malignancy), hip pathology, or conditions associated with effusions.

### Evaluation of patients presenting with knee pain: part II. differential diagnosis [^112CRL3g]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Knee pain is a common presenting complaint with many possible causes. An awareness of certain patterns can help the family physician identify the underlying cause more efficiently. Teenage girls and young women are more likely to have patellar tracking problems such as patellar subluxation and patellofemoral pain syndrome, whereas teenage boys and young men are more likely to have knee extensor mechanism problems such as tibial apophysitis (Osgood-Schlatter lesion) and patellar tendonitis. Referred pain resulting from hip joint pathology, such as slipped capital femoral epiphysis, also may cause knee pain. Active patients are more likely to have acute ligamentous sprains and overuse injuries such as pes anserine bursitis and medial plica syndrome. Trauma may result in acute ligamentous rupture or fracture, leading to acute knee joint swelling and hemarthrosis. Septic arthritis may develop in patients of any age, but crystal-induced inflammatory arthropathy is more likely in adults. Osteoarthritis of the knee joint is common in older adults.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of anterior knee pain [^116DKnC6]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Anterior knee pain (see Figure 1) is one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints seen in the pediatric population. A fairly extensive differential diagnosis exists as anterior knee pain is a fairly nonspecific phenomenon. A thorough history and physical examination with attention to anatomic location of the pain, inciting factors, relationship of associated symptoms as well as a general assessment of growth and development will aid in the evaluation and treatment of this disorder. An awareness of typical injury patterns can aid the physician in narrowing the differential diagnosis. Identification of worrisome signs and symptoms will also help in defining which cases may require further evaluation. All pediatric patients presenting with knee pain require evaluation for ipsilateral hip and lumbar spine disorders. This article will review common causes of chronic anterior knee pain in the pediatric population with a focus on patellofemoral pain. It is not meant to be an exhaustive review and will not review acute traumatic knee injuries. Lateral, medial or posterior knee pain will be covered in a subsequent article.

Figure 1
Patients with anterior knee pain localize the pain to the anterior knee and will point to the entire extensor mechanism, rather than to specific anatomic regions [1].

Clinical history

The clinical history should include a thorough description of the pain characteristics (location, character, onset, duration, change with activity or rest, aggravating and alleviating factors, night pain); trauma (acute macrotrauma, repetitive microtrauma, recent/remote); mechanical symptoms (locking or extension block, instability, worse during or after activity); inflammatory symptoms (morning stiffness, swelling); effects of previous treatments and the current level of function of the child. Patients with overuse anterior knee pain may report a sensation of giving way or instability. This sensation is usually a pseudo-giving way due to what is coined the "quadriceps inhibitory reflex" or a neuromuscular inhibition that occurs secondary to pain, muscle weakness, patellar instability or joint instability. It is important to note that true instability is suggestive of internal derangement of the knee most commonly associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears or meniscal injury.

A history of previous injury or knee surgery, chronic inflammatory joint disease or bleeding diathesis, is significant, especially if knee swelling is present.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of anterior knee pain [^115s2NUv]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Anterior knee pain is common in children and adolescents. Evaluation and management is challenging and requires a thorough history and physical exam, and understanding of the pediatric skeleton. Most causes of anterior knee pain involve the patellofemoral joint and the extensor mechanism of the knee. It is important for the clinician to consider conditions unique to the growing pediatric skeleton including hip disease (slipped capital femoral epiphyses and Perthe's disease) or osteochondroses (Osgood-Schlatter disease or Sinding-Larsen-Johansen disease). Anterior knee pain is occasionally caused by serious underlying systemic disease including inflammatory conditions and malignancies. The clinical history and physical exam often lead to correct diagnosis and identify cases requiring further evaluation, imaging or referral. General return to play guidelines can be followed for PFP and most causes of anterior knee pain

### Musculoskeletal pain in 13-year-old children: the generation R study [^116iPhPj]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is one of the most common health problems in children and adolescents and is associated with significant individual, social, and financial burden worldwide and is one of the leading causes of years lived with disability. Musculoskeletal problems can already have extensive influence on their normal daily routine of school, social, and sports participation. Research has reported prevalence rates of MSK pain in children aged 9 to 18 years ranging from 4% to 40%and that 1 in 3 adolescents have MSK pain monthly. Knee, back, and neck pain are the most common sites of musculoskeletal pain.

Many factors, both physical and psychosocial, are suggested to influence the presence of MSK pain in children. Physical factors as skeletal growth and maturation are believed to be main reasons for MSK problems to arise in childhood and adolescence. Nontraumatic knee complaints, such as Osgood–Schlatter disease (OSD) and patellofemoral pain (PFP), are typical knee problems that emerge during puberty. Furthermore, research suggests a possible association between MSK problems during childhood and development and the chronic character of MSK problems in adults. A history of MSK pain at 11-year olds is a very strong risk factor for MSK pain at age 14 years. Some studies have investigated possible associations between various physical, joint loading factors and the development of MSK problems in children and adolescents. For example, being overweight is significantly associated with the presence of MSK pain in childhood, and taller children seem more likely to develop MSK problems than shorter peers, possibly because of increased joint loading and dysfunction. Some research indicates a relation between another joint loading factor as physical activity and exercise and the onset of low back pain and spinal pain in children. However, in another study in 14-year-old children, no associations were found between physical activity and MSK pain. Furthermore some research has shown a possible association between sedentary behavior and MSK pain in children and adolescents, whereas other studies did not find this association. The association between psychosocial factors and MSK pain in children has been studied, with associations found between negative emotional symptoms, worrying, sleeping problems, and externalizing problems. These results are similar to what has been found in adults. Nevertheless, for most of the aforementioned factors, there is an absence of high-quality prospective studies and thus the evidence for their proposed potential as risk factors remains conflicting. In the Generation R study, it was found that MSK pain at the age of 36 months and behavioral problems are independently associated with the presence of MSK pain in 6-year-old children. Currently, similar studies in 13-year-old children have not been performed yet, although it is known that MSK complaints often develop during adolescence. Therefore, the aim of this study is to describe the prevalence and characteristics of MSK pain in 13-year-old children in a large population-based birth cohort and identify physical and psychosocial factors associated with MSK pain.

### Is knee pain during adolescence a self-limiting condition? Prognosis of patellofemoral pain and other types of knee pain [^1115JoLS]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of adolescent knee pain is 33%, and patellofemoral pain (PFP) is the most common diagnosis with a nontraumatic onset. The 2-year prognosis of adolescent PFP compared with other types of knee pain is unknown.

Purpose

To investigate the 2-year prognosis of knee pain among adolescents with and without a diagnosis of PFP.

Study Design

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.

Methods

In 2011, a cohort of 2200 adolescents aged 15 to 19 years answered an online questionnaire on musculoskeletal pain. Of these, 504 reported knee pain, and 153 of these were clinically diagnosed with PFP. After 2 years, the 504 adolescents, as well as 252 randomly selected adolescents who did not report knee pain in 2011, were contacted again. Primary outcome at follow-up was the proportion of adolescents with knee pain during the last week prior to follow-up.

Results

Overall, 55.9% (95% CI, 50.8%-60.9%) of those reporting knee pain at baseline also reported pain 2 years later. Adolescents diagnosed with PFP had a 1.26 (95% CI, 1.05–1.50) higher relative risk (RR) of knee pain at follow-up compared with other types of knee pain. Adolescents with PFP were significantly more likely to reduce or stop sports participation compared with adolescents with other types of knee pain. Of those without knee pain at baseline, 12.8% (95% CI, 8.4%-17.2%) reported knee pain at follow-up in 2013. Adolescents with knee pain at baseline had a 4.51 (95% CI, 3.15–6.45) higher RR of knee pain at follow-up compared with adolescents without knee pain at baseline.

Conclusion

Knee pain during adolescence, and PFP in particular, is in most cases present after 2 years and thus may not be self-limiting. A greater focus on early detection and prevention of knee pain during adolescence is needed.

### Gaucher disease: an unusual cause of knee pain [^117LZFtg]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

Gaucher disease (GD) is a genetic lysosomal disorder leading to storage of the glycolipid molecule glucocerebroside in macrophages, causing multiorgan dysfunction. Bone marrow involvement may result in painful bone crisis and hematologic disturbance.

Case Report:

We present a case of a 13-year-old adolescent boy with right knee pain. Radiograph and magnetic resonance imaging of the distal femur indicated possible osteomyelitis or bone tumor. However, histologic examination of bone biopsy material suggested the diagnosis of GD, which was confirmed by detection of decreased β-glucocerebrosidase activity and identification of the exact gene mutation.

Discussion:

Many visceral and bone abnormalities of GD have been described. The diagnosis of GD is based on clinical and laboratory findings and is established by the measurement of β-glucocerebrosidase dysfunction and the study of GBA gene mutations. Treatment is currently based on enzyme replacement and substrate reduction.

Conclusion:

This is a rare case of GD presenting initially with knee pain. Because early diagnosis is important for the treatment of this condition, orthopaedic surgeons should consider this uncommon cause in the differential diagnosis of joint pain.

### Bilateral osteochondral defects of the patellae in an 11-year-old girl [^115r8tis]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Osteochondral defect or osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the knee usually affects young, active populations. It is a challenging diagnosis as patients typically present with poorly localised activity-related pain, which is non-specific and covers many differentials. We present an active 11-year-old girl with bilateral osteochondral defects of the patellae: a rare clinical disorder which was affecting her sporting activities. She had a 12-month history of bilateral anterior knee pain before the diagnosis was achieved with appropriate imaging. Her pain significantly improved with activity modification and physiotherapy. Follow-up will require outpatient clinic assessment and imaging to determine if non-operative management continues to be successful or surgery may be required. This case report emphasises the importance of appropriate high index of suspicion when managing patients with non-specific knee pain. It also demonstrates the importance of judicious use of imaging to avoid a missed or delayed diagnosis.

### A 12-year-old boy with a knee infection [^1176r4fC]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

In January 2015, the patient had a relatively minor fall that resulted in a distal femoral fracture on the same left side. This was suspected to be due to osteoporosis, potentially caused by an extended period of inactivity and prolonged use of voriconazole. Following an open reduction and internal fixation, the femur fracture healed uneventfully. Then, during follow-up in June 2015, 2 years after the initial injury, the patient was still struggling with a significant limp and a limited range of motion and knee function (extension deficit of 30° and maximum flexion of 60°). He has continued with physiotherapy, learning to cope with his restrictions and refusing any further surgical treatment. Almost 10 years following the incident (December 2022), our patient visited our clinic for a review. During the 10-year follow-up, the patient showed signs of joint destruction and a limited left knee function. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome questionnaire showed: 40.0/100 (pain), 67.5/100 (symptoms), 66.75/100 (activities of daily living), 10.0/100 (sports/recreation) and 12.5/100 (quality of life). Furthermore, he presented with a leg length difference of 3 cm, with the affected left leg being shorter. Active and passive flexion were both 70°. His apparent left knee extension is full, but overestimated due to 20° proximal tibial recurvatum (see Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 2). Radiographs reveal a deformity of the lateral femur condyle, together with an anterior slope of the tibial plateau (see Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 3,), likely caused by an early closure of the anterior side of the proximal tibial epiphysis. He has accepted his situation, made adjusted career choices and is doing relatively well.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of anterior knee pain [^116W4zw6]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Common causes of chronic anterior knee pain

Pain receptors are present within several knee structures, including the patella, synovium, fat pad, tendon, subchondral bone, and quadriceps retinaculum. Any of these structures, individually or in combination, can cause anterior knee pain. Most causes of anterior knee pain involve the patellofemoral joint and the extensor mechanism of the knee. The term anterior knee pain is often used interchangeably with patellofemoral pain. Previous literature has also interchanged the term "chondromalacia patella" with anterior knee pain but this is now out of favor; chondromalacia patella is a surgical finding not a diagnosis. Patients with anterior knee pain do not necessarily have chondromalacia patella and patients with chondromalacia do not uniformly have pain. Anterior knee pain may be caused by conditions unique to the growing pediatric skeleton including hip disease (slipped capital femoral epiphyses and Perthe's disease) or osteochondroses (Osgood-Schlatter disease or Sinding-Larsen-Johansen disease). Anterior knee pain is occasionally caused by serious underlying systemic disease including inflammatory conditions and malignancies.

Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is the most common knee problem presenting to primary care physicians. Patellofemoral syndrome is a non-specific descriptive term used to describe pain in and around the patella.

Epidemiology

PFP affects active and non-active children, is more common in girls and is most common during the adolescent growth spurt. Up to 30% of all visits to sports medicine practitioners are for anterior knee pain. Incidence rates of 7% and 10% have been reported in young male and female athletes respectively. Symptoms usually affect both knees with one side more symptomatic than the other.

Etiology

The etiology of PFP is unclear. There are currently two main theories: malalignment of the patella relative to the femoral trochlea with resultant articular cartilage abnormalities, and excessive mechanical loading and chemical irritation of local nerve endings with resultant peripatellar synovitis. Soft tissue tightness is common during the adolescent growth spurt with resultant inflexibilities altering the stress through the patellofemoral joint. Acute trauma, repetitive microtrauma/overuse and malalignment all can lead to increased strain on the peripatellar soft tissues or increased patellofemoral joint stress.

### Musculoskeletal pain in 13-year-old children: the generation R study [^113THtsU]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

4. Discussion

In this study, a 6-week prevalence of 18.8% was found for MSK pain in 13-year-old children, of which almost 90% was chronic and almost half of the children experienced pain daily. The most reported location of MSK pain was the lower limbs with boys reporting more lower limb pain than girls, whereas girls reported more back pain than boys. Children who previously reported MSK pain at 6 years reported MSK pain more frequently compared with no pain. Multivariable analysis showed significant associations with the presence of MSK pain in girls, low maternal educational level, a higher BMI, higher physical activity level, and presence of behavioral problems.

This study reported a 23% 6-week prevalence for pain, which is lower than the reported prevalence rates of 40% to 60% in previous research performed in children and adolescents. Comparing the prevalence in this study with the prevalence in 6-year-old children, the prevalence of MSK pain rose from 10% to almost 19%. This increase is likely due to physical changes, growth spurts, increased skeletal maturation, and changes in psychosocial factors at this age. Moreover, the increased prevalence could be due to more detailed pain questions in the questionnaire at 13 years compared with the questions at 6 years, such as a pain mannequin and specific questions about frequency, duration, and intensity. Knee pain being the most reported location of MSK pain is in line with the most research into MSK pain in adolescents. However, more research specifically in children with knee pain and possible associated factors is needed because current research into knee pain in children is limited and most research is performed in adults.

### Musculoskeletal pain in 13-year-old children: the generation R study [^112B3SQG]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

In concordance with the literature, a higher BMI SD score and more children with overweight were seen in children with MSK pain vs children without pain. It is known that being overweight or obese can impact joint health and cause joint dysfunction, which leads to more ankle, foot, and knee problems than being normal weight. It is believed that joint dysfunction in children with overweight or obesity is caused by increased joint loading resulting in structural changes as malalignment. Thus, more attention should be given to children with overweight and MSK complaints because this could play an important role in the treatment of MSK pain and prevent future problems.

Physically active children seem to experience more MSK pain. This finding may be due to injuries that occur during sports participation. However, at this moment, there is no clear evidence from the literature for the relation between MSK pain and physical activity level in children, as both positive and negative associations have been reported. Furthermore, details about the character and intensity of the physical activity and precise origins of pain were not available in this study, although these factors could certainly play a role in the development and presence of MSK pain. These factors should be included in future research to get a better insight in the relation between physical activity level and MSK pain. Although evidence on the association between physical activity and knee pain is inconclusive due to heterogeneity in study populations, and absence of high-quality prospective studies, there should be more awareness for children who are physically active because of the possible higher risk on MSK pain, maybe due to injury or overloading. However, it is also not desirable for children to refrain from physical activity because of the aforementioned negative effect of sedentary behavior. Attention should be paid to both preventing injury or overloading due to physical activity and to the possible long-term nature and impact of MSK pain during rehabilitation.

### Risk factors for knee injuries in children 8 to 15 years: the CHAMPS study DK [^112WKMis]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Knee injuries are frequent in children, with most studies reporting traumatic knee injuries. Evidence of risk factors for knee injuries in children is sparse. The purpose of this study was to report the extent of traumatic and overuse knee injuries in children and to evaluate intrinsic and extrinsic factors for risk of these injuries.

Methods

Weekly musculoskeletal pain, sport participation, and sports type were reported by 1326 school children (8–15 yr). Knee injuries were classified as traumatic or overuse. Multinomial logistic regression was used for analyses.

Results

During the study period, 952 (15% traumatic and 85% overuse) knee injuries were diagnosed. Period prevalence for traumatic and overuse knee injuries were 0.8/1000 and 5.4/1000 sport participations, respectively. Participation in tumbling gymnastics was a risk factor for traumatic knee injuries (OR, 2.14). For overuse knee injuries, intrinsic risk factors were sex (girls OR, 1.38) and previous knee injury (OR, 1.78), whereas participation in soccer (OR, 1.64), handball (OR, 1.95), basket (OR, 2.07), rhythmic (OR, 1.98), and tumbling gymnastics (OR, 1.74) were additional risk factors. For both injury types, sport participation above two times per week increased odds (OR, 1.46–2.40).

Conclusions

Overuse knee injuries were the most frequent injury type. For traumatic knee injuries, participation in tumbling gymnastics was a risk factor. Risk factors for overuse knee injuries were being a girl; previous knee injury; and participation in soccer, handball, basket, and rhythmic and tumbling gymnastics. Further risk factors for both types of injury were participation in sports above two times per week. Although growth-related overuse knee injuries are a self-limiting condition, a major part of children are affected by these injuries with unknown short- and long-term consequences.

### A 17 year old with isolated proximal tibiofibular joint arthritis [^116x8ZAv]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Inflammatory arthritis of the proximal tibiofibular joint is an uncommon but likely underdiagnosed cause of lateral knee pain. Arthritis of this joint has been reported in connection with ankylosing spondylitis. Practitioners should be careful to evaluate for arthritis as part of a work-up for chronic lateral knee pain and stiffness, and should consider concomitant evaluation for spondyloarthritis.

Participant Characteristics

More than half (51.8%) of the 1849 included children were girls (Table 1). The children had a median age of 13.8 years (IQR, 13.6–14.6 years), with a BMI SD score of 0.43 (SD, 1.19), and almost one-third (28.0%) had an overweight or obese WHR. Compared with the children who did not participate in the MRI study, participants in this study were significantly less often boys, had an older age, and had a lower BMI (, available online).

Reporting of Knee Pain

In total 148 children (8.0%) reported knee pain in the previous 6 weeks.

From the children who experienced knee pain (8.0%), almost all reported pain at the ventral side of the knee (98.6%), almost half of the children reported bilateral pain (45.9%), 37.5% experienced knee pain daily, and 92.3% of the children with knee pain experienced chronic pain (> 3 months). Moreover, almost three-quarters of the children reporting knee pain indicated that the pain was related to sports (73.4%). Of the children with knee pain, 28.4% also experienced pain at other musculoskeletal sites, most often in the ankle and foot (14.2%) or the back (8.8%).

Only 6.8% of the children experienced pain at nonmusculoskeletal sites, mainly in the head (4.1%) and stomach (3.4%). There were no differences in pain characteristics between boys and girls (Table 2).

Differences Between Children With and Without Knee Pain

In Table 1, differences in demographics and physical and psychosocial factors between the groups of children with and without knee pain are presented. Children with knee pain were more often girls than children without knee pain (59.5% vs 51.5%), and also higher BMI SD scores were seen in children with knee pain compared with children without knee pain (0.61 [SD, 1.17] vs 0.41 [SD, 1.20]). There were no differences in physical activity behaviors at 13 or 9 years of age between children with and without knee pain.

### Prognostic factors for adolescent knee pain: an individual participant data meta-analysis of 1281 patients [^115oGhhW]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Adolescent knee pain has a propensity for chronicity, impacting physical activity and health into adulthood. The aim of this study is to investigate prognostic factors in adolescents with knee pain using individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. Studies were identified through a systematic search and a collaborative group. We included IPD from prospective studies of adolescents (age 10–19 years) with nontraumatic knee pain (13 studies and 1516 adolescents with 1281 unique participants). Primary outcomes were pain intensity and function (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score "Sport/Rec" subscale). Primary endpoint was 12 months. Risk of bias was appraised with Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. Harmonised IPD was analysed by multilevel modelling. Fifty-one percent reported knee pain after 12-months. Lower baseline pain frequency was associated with lower pain intensity at 12 months ("less than weekly"; 12 (95% confidence interval [CI] 7–17) and "monthly"; 15 (95% CI 9–22) points lower on a 100-point pain scale, compared with "almost daily pain"). Other factors most strongly associated with 1-year pain prognosis were lower quality of life (30, 95% CI 19–42 points per unit change in the EQ5D index score), female sex (8 points, 95% CI 4–12 higher compared with males), and bilateral pain (7, 95% CI 1–13 points higher pain). Similar factors were associated with function. Body mass index, pain sensitivity, and knee strength were not associated with prognosis of pain or function. Adolescent knee pain is associated with clinically relevant long-term pain and functional deficits. Self-reported characteristics may help identify those at risk of poor prognosis.

Exercise therapy may not be for everyone

Exercise therapy is one of the mainstays of treating PFP. In an adolescent population, adding exercise therapy to patient education improved the recovery rates in both short term (3 months) and long term (24 months). However not all adolescents responded favourably to exercise therapy and the overall recovery rates was lower than what has been observed among adults.

This suggests that exercise therapy is effective for some adolescents, but not all. So the question is how we can improve the effects of exercise therapy among adolescents to improve its outcomes? The key may be in an increased focus on managing training loads for the group of highly active adolescents with PFP. Importantly, frequent sports participation is a risk factor for persistent knee pain among young adolescents aged 12–15 years and failure to modify sports participation could hinder recovery. This raises the question, does our current evidence-based approach have too much focus on exercise therapy and too little focus on training load management?

### Ruptured appendicitis and retrocecal abscess masquerading as knee pain in a pediatric patient: a case report [^115VyBVt]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Knee pain has a variety of etiologies in the pediatric population, including septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, fracture, ligamentous injury, and neoplasms. Extrinsic sources of knee pain may also be intra-abdominal, although abdominal pathology is much more likely to manifest as hip or proximal thigh musculature pain.

Case Report

A 5-year-old healthy male presented with atraumatic right knee pain, discomfort with weightbearing, fever, and elevated inflammatory laboratory markers. Physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging findings of the knee were benign, leading to low clinical suspicion for knee septic arthritis. Blood cultures were positive for a gastrointestinal organism, Granulicatella adiacens, suggesting abdominal pathology leading to referred pain. Ultrasound evaluation and computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed a large abscess secondary to perforated appendicitis, which was treated with CT-guided drainage and i.v. antibiotics. The patient's musculoskeletal pain subsided with treatment of the appendicitis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Acute appendicitis may present as knee pain, with other signs and symptoms mimicking septic arthritis, such as fever, inability to bear weight, and elevated inflammatory markers. Considering an array of differential diagnoses in pediatric patients with apparent knee septic arthritis is crucial to prevent delay in diagnosis of alternative infectious sources.

Measurements: Questionnaires

Demographics

Information on the child's sex was obtained from the midwife and hospital records at birth, and age was registered during the visit.

Knee Pain

To assess the presence of pain, children were asked whether they had pain in the past 6 weeks. If so, the location was checked on a pain mannequin with 61 possible locations, at both the front and back sides of the body. In this study, knee pain was defined as pain in the front or back of the left or right knee. No knee pain was defined as children without pain or children with pain in any other pain locations not including the knee. Additional questions on pain characteristics (available for 325 participants) included the frequency of occurrence (constant, daily, multiple days per week, weekly, monthly, or less than monthly), pain duration (number of weeks or months), onset of pain (sudden or gradual), relationship to sports (yes or no), and pain intensity (numeric rating scale 0–10). Pain was classified as chronic if the reported pain duration was > 3 months.

Physical Activity

Questionnaire data were used to evaluate physical activity. Physical activity behavior was evaluated by assessing sports participation (yes or no), active transport to and from school, and the amount of physical activity (amount of days per week with at least 1 hour of physical activity). The cutoff for a child being physically active was defined as at least 1 hour per day for at least 4 days per week (ie, more than half of the week). Active transport to and from school was defined as having at least 1 trip of walking or cycling to school per week.

For the history of physical activity and sports participation, the parent-reported questionnaire at the age of 9 years was used. In that questionnaire, parents were asked if their children participated in sports and how many hours per week their children spent doing sports. Being physically activity at the age of 9 was defined as 2 to 4 hours of physical activity (sports, physical education, and active transport) per week.

### The most physically active Danish adolescents are at increased risk for developing spinal pain: a two-year prospective cohort study [^116CWL9N]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Implications of results

The WHO has recommended that children and young people spend at least 1 hour each day in moderate to vigorous physical activity. However, this recommendation has not taken prevention of musculoskeletal pain into account. We emphasise that the WHO recommendation should be maintained, but we advocate that the quality and type of the physical activity should be considered in addition to duration if these are to be relevant for musculoskeletal health. Perhaps the spinal pain reported in our study was caused by overuse or injuries incurred during vigorous physical activity, and therefore increased focus on strategies that prevent injuries in the spine in organised sport, both inside and outside school, might be warranted. Since literature on the prevention of spinal pain is lacking, a parallel might be drawn with knee injury where neuromuscular exercises have been shown to decrease the incidence rate of anterior cruciate ligament injury.

Future research

The impact of physical activity on spinal pain is still poorly understood. Longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes from the general population are needed to confirm the results of this study and to determine the contribution of psychological and social factors in the development of spinal pain. In addition, the reported pain in this study could be minor bangs and bruises only; future research should also investigate the long-term course of spinal pain in the most and least physically active adolescents. Furthermore, there needs to be greater consensus on how to process complex accelerometer data to improve the validity and interpretability, as well as comparability of results across studies.

### Patellofemoral pain during adolescence: much more prevalent than appreciated [^114ABnZy]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Is adolescent PFP 'self-limiting'?

A common notion is that knee pain and PFP is a natural part of adolescence and is self-limiting. We recently made a follow-up of 153 adolescents with PFP for 2 years and 65% of them still had knee pain after a 2-year follow-up and a quarter of them reported they had daily knee pain. Importantly, a large proportion of the adolescents with PFP stopped or reduced their sports participation during the 2 years — PFP can impair the overall health. These findings extend previous retrospective long-term follow-up studies on adolescents with PFP and highlight the high persistence rates. We need to discard the common misconception that PFP is 'self-limiting' and focus on how best to manage it.

### Patellofemoral pain in general practice: the incidence and management [^1157Pz6h]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In children and adolescents, musculoskeletal (MSK) problems can have a significant impact on the normal daily routine of school, social, and sports participation. Currently there still is a limited understanding of the epidemiology, burden, and treatment of MSK problems in children and adolescents. Even though chronic or recurrent pain occurs in up to 25% of the children and adolescents.

In adolescents, knee problems (32%) are one of the most frequently reported MSK problems. One of the most common forms of knee pain is patellofemoral pain (PFP). In research the reported incidence and prevalence of PFP varies greatly, possibly due to the evaluation of different populations and the inconsistency and lack of high-quality evidence on which assessment and diagnosis of PFP are based. Albeit, a recent systematic reviewreports a PFP incidence of 9.7 per 1,000 person years and an annual prevalence in the general population of 22.7%, with an even higher prevalence in adolescents (28.9%). However, the studies included in this review consisted of all age categories and were predominantly done in specific highly active populations such as military recruits and (elite) athletes. PFP is thought to have the highest incidence and prevalence in active adolescents, elite athletesand occurs more often in girls than boys. PFP can be characterized as a nontraumatic knee problem with diffuse anterior retro-patellar pain and crepitation mainly during activities that load the joint such as running, jumping, squatting, climbing, and descending stairs. Palpation of the patella, the patellofemoral compression test, and resisted knee extension are often painful during physical examination. Physical overuse, trauma, and anatomic factors appear to be predisposing components in the development of PFP. It is generally thought that these type of knee problems are self-limiting in adolescents and cease to exist after puberty and skeletal maturation. Nevertheless, studies show that adolescents with knee pain have a high risk of persistent knee pain, with an even higher risk for adolescents with PFP. This is reflected by 1 study that reported persistent pain in almost 40% of the adolescents with PFP after 6 years. It has even been suggested that adolescent PFP may lead to patellofemoral osteoarthritis, but currently there is no clear and definitive evidence for this suggested disease trajectory.

### Development and validation of the sorting non-trauMatIc adoLescent knEe pain (SMILE) tool-a development and initial validation study [^112RhxuC]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Annually, 7% of adolescents visit their general practitioner with musculoskeletal problems. Musculoskeletal problems are one of the most common causes of consultation in this population. Knee pain is common among adolescents and often due to non-traumatic causes. Non-traumatic knee pain is most often the result of repetitive and excessive stress to musculoskeletal structures from sports participation and physical activity. 'The most common types of non-traumatic knee pain during adolescence are Osgood-Schlatter disease and patellofemoral pain '. Despite being less common, Sinding-Larsen Johansson/patellar tendinopathy, Iliotibial band syndrome, and plica syndrome are important differential diagnoses for adolescents with non-traumatic knee pain. In addition to the non-traumatic knee complaints, knee pain can be related to growth also known as benign nocturnal pains of childhood (growing pain), referred pain from the hip or lumbar spine, osteosarcomas, and systemic causes which all are important differential diagnoses.

Non-traumatic knee complaints can be long-lasting, with an impact on health-related quality of life and physical activity. In light of this, the management strategy initiated by the health care practitioner becomes critical to improve long term prognosis. Furthermore, treatment may need to be managed differently related to the specific diagnosis which can be a challenge for medical doctors, due to non-specific symptoms and clinical tests being of limited diagnostic value. Further, qualitative research shows the importance to adolescents of "getting a name" for their knee pain which underlines the need to support the health care practitioner in diagnosing the specific type of knee pain. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a support tool for diagnosing the most common types of non-traumatic adolescent knee pain.

Clinicians are charged with the responsibility of providing accurate information and effective treatment to this vulnerable population. Sharing information about the potential consequences of ACL injury and treatment in childhood to long-term knee-health should be a central part of the shared decision-making process. Adult patients with ACL injury may develop symptoms and signs of osteoarthritis within 10 years of the index injury. Therefore, the clinical concern is that a child who is injured at the age of 10 years could have symptomatic osteoarthritis by the age of 20. A quintessential question is what is the long-term prognosis after ACL injury in childhood? Having a definitive, evidence-based answer to this question would strengthen our confidence in clinical decision-making. Clearly the answer to this question is not straightforward and depends on many factors, but one important point is that long-term outcomes after ACL injury in childhood, including the development of osteoarthritis, have not been studied.

Injury management is challenging in the current landscape of clinical uncertainty and limited scientific knowledge. Injury management decisions also occur against the backdrop of the complexity of shared decision-making with children and the potential long-term ramifications of the injury. This consensus statement addresses six fundamental clinical questions regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and management of paediatric ACL injuries (Summary Box 1). By framing each topic around clinical questions, the aim of this consensus statement is to provide a comprehensive, evidence-informed summary to support the clinician, and help children with ACL injury and their parents/guardians make the best possible decisions.

A 9-year-old African American boy was admitted to hospital with a 12-day history of fevers, diarrhea, abdominal pain and a 1-day history of joint pain. His abdominal pain and diarrhea resolved within the first few days of admission, but he continued with high-grade fevers and intermittent joint pain. The joints affected included the right first interphalangeal joint, right wrist, right elbow, and left knee joint. His initial laboratory tests revealed normal complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and C-reactive protein. Consequently, he developed fatigue, lower back pain, and bicytopenias. After 19 days of fevers, a multispecialty collaborative evaluation arrived at a final diagnosis and treatment plan. In this article, we discuss the child's hospital course and our clinical thought process. Written consent was obtained from the family.

### Patellofemoral pain during adolescence: much more prevalent than appreciated [^1123ishv]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Who are the adolescents with PFP?

PFP is highly prevalent in people who do a lot of sports. In adolescent female basketball players, it may be as high as 16%. In our population-based study, two-thirds of the adolescents with PFP were highly active and engaged in sport, on average five times per week (even with knee pain!) But there was also a subgroup (∼1/3) who did not do any sports at all. This is important, and challenges the common notion that PFP is always a load-dependent condition associated with sports. However, the high prevalence in sports population suggests that highly repetitive and/or excessive and specific loading contributes to the pathogenesis of PFP in adolescents.

### Gout in a 15-year-old boy with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a case study [^116UvF9f]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In the pediatric population, there are numerous causes of joint pain, stiffness, and swelling. Many can be attributed to minor activity or overuse-related injury, especially in the overweight and obese populations, but in the face of persistent, severe, or recurrent symptoms, other diagnoses must be considered. These typically fall into two categories in children and adolescents: bony or structural causes, or rheumatologic conditions. Careful history and physical examination, along with use of imaging and laboratory studies, can often distinguish between the two; however, when a complete work-up is performed and no clear answer emerges, the differential must be expanded. In the rare case in which a firm primary diagnosis has been made, it is more difficult still to consider additional, secondary, causes of joint pain.

The following case describes an adolescent young man with severe ankle pain, as well as multiple other joint complaints, who was correctly diagnosed and treated for polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. While the majority of his joints improved, his ankle continued to be extremely tender and swollen. After two years of aggressive medical treatment, surgical procedures, and multiple imaging studies, it was careful probing into his history and classic physical examination findings that ultimately led to the additional diagnosis of gout.

Section 7: future research

Management of paediatric ACL injuries is strongly debated. Reflecting some of the concern and controversy is a high ratio of clinical commentaries and narrative reviews to original articles on this topic. The problem for the clinician is that there is scarce high-quality evidence that he or she can look to, to help him or her best manage paediatric ACL injuries. The scientific literature is inconsistent and limited by inferior methods that carry a high risk of bias. There are no randomised trials comparing different treatment approaches or different surgical techniques. Most of the publications have only short-term follow-up; there are none with follow-up beyond 10 years. Therefore, long term knee-health (including osteoarthritis) and quality of life is unknown.

### Practice management of musculoskeletal injuries in active children [^115Lvewv]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although increasing participation in physical activities has significant health benefits, there are no guidelines to help professionals decide when it is safe to return to activity after injury.

Objective

To examine the specific criteria (eg, strength, pain) that expert sport medicine clinicians use for return to activity decisions in children with musculoskeletal injuries.

Methods

The authors conducted an online cross-sectional survey of certified Canadian sport medicine doctors (MDs) and sport rehabilitation specialists (physiotherapists (PTs) or athletic therapists (ATs)). The authors asked how they would measure each of the following signs in the context of a knee injury: sport-specific skills, pain, swelling, strength, range of motion (ROM) and balance. Clinicians also ranked the importance of each sign with respect to influencing their recommendations for each of five clinical vignettes.

Results

The overall response rate was 33.6% (464/1380) with similar rates for each profession. For each clinical sign, all three professions preferred the same measure to determine readiness to return to play: standardised testing for sport-specific skills, impact on function for pain, palpation for swelling, manual muscle testing for strength, visual inspection for ROM and standing on one leg with eyes closed for balance. Regarding importance of specific signs for return to activity, all professions had similar responses for one vignette, but MDs differed from PTs and ATs for the remaining four. Finally, pain was ranked as the no 1 or 2 most important sign in all five vignettes by 41.0% of MDs, 18.1% of ATs and 11.3% of PTs, whereas sport-specific skills was chosen by 9.6% MDs, 12.0% ATs and 16.1% PTs.

Conclusion

Our results provide the foundation for future work leading towards the development of interdisciplinary consensus guidelines.

### Pediatric-onset extracephalic stabbing pain [^1131EvNK]. Journal of Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Idiopathic stabbing headache is a primary headache defined as "transient stabs of pain in the head that occur spontaneously in the absence of underlying organic disease". Although its variant form, stabbing pain with extracephalic distribution, has been reported in rare adult cases, pediatric presentation is extremely rare. We report an 8-year-old boy suffering from severe stabbing pain in the left side of the chest, right side of the abdomen, and right knee lasting 2 to 3 minutes with increasing frequency. He was completely normal between attacks. The attack was not accompanied with headache initially. Investigation showed no abnormality. A diagnosis of extracephalic stabbing pain was made. The patient's symptoms were ameliorated by administration of valproic acid. This report illustrates that extracephalic stabbing pain can occur in pediatric patients. It is important to be aware of this peculiar condition because the pain is so severe, and it can be treatable with medication.

### An unusual case of knee pain [^113cMowv]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2006). Low credibility.

Osteomyelitis of the patella is a rare disease, which primarily affects the pediatric population. We present a case of hematogenous osteomyelitis of the patella with secondary development of septic arthritis of the knee. There is often a delay in diagnosis, as illustrated by our case report, due to the rarity of the condition and nonspecific presentation. There is usually no history of trauma. Focal tenderness over the patella is the most helpful clinical sign. A small joint effusion may be present which is usually sterile and reactionary due to inflammation of the patella. Treatment of osteomyelitis of the patella is similar to treatment of osteomyelitis in other areas. Function and range of motion of the knee usually returns to normal after completion of treatment. A delay in diagnosis may lead to progression of disease and complications such as septic arthritis of the knee.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of anterior knee pain [^116Fcny9]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Referred pain from the hip or lumbar spine

All patients with knee pain require evaluation of their hips and lumbar spine. Children with Perthe's disease or slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) may present with knee pain. Perthe's disease, an idiopathic avascular necrosis/osteonecrosis of the femoral epiphysis usually affects 4 to 10 year olds, is more common in boys and is bilateral in 10%. Children usually present with a limp or pain in the hip, thigh or knee. Examination of the knee is normal but there is limited internal rotation and abduction of the ipsilateral hip. Trendelenberg may be positive. Radiographs vary with the stage of the disease but may show evidence of bone necrosis, fragmentation, reossification or remodeling and healing. Treatment consists of rest from aggravating activities and range of motion exercises. Occasionally orthoses or surgery may be required. Generally, the condition resolves and children return to their activities. The main long-term concern is early osteoarthritis.

SCFE, displacement of the proximal femoral epiphysis on the femoral neck, usually affects 10 to 15 year olds and is more common in boys. Adolescents usually present with a limp and may have hip, groin or knee pain. The knee exam is normal, the hip is often preferentially held in abduction and external rotation with decreased active and passive internal rotation and adduction. Trendelenberg may be positive. Radiographs (anterior-posterior and frog leg lateral) of the hip may show widening and irregularity of the physis with posterior inferior displacement of femoral head. SCFE may compromise the vascular supply to the femoral head and lead to avascular necrosis; all cases warrant orthopedic referral. Treatment includes non weight bearing, traction and surgery with epiphyseal fixation and osteotomy. Most patients do well after surgical fixation. Complications include avascular necrosis and chondrolysis. Patients require long term follow up as SCFE may develop within 12 to 18 months in the contralateral hip, if prophylactic pinning is not performed.

### Complete resolution of the symptoms of refractory Osgood-Schlatter disease following percutaneous fixation of the tibial tuberosity [^114Rr6a9]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Osgood-Schlatter disease is a common cause of anterior knee pain in adolescents. In a good proportion of cases the pain is relieved through stopping sport alone, or by doing so in conjunction with undertaking physiotherapy. However, resolution of symptoms may take several years. A proportion of teenagers are prevented from participating in sport for a prolonged period as a result of the condition, and some have persisting knee pain into adulthood. We report the use of a new surgical treatment for this disease. We describe the case of a 12-year-old boy who was unable to play rugby for a year due to this pain. Following percutaneous fixation of the tibial tuberosity his symptoms entirely resolved and he returned to competitive sport 6weeks after surgery. A year later the screw was removed. As soon as he resumed sport his symptoms immediately returned and he requested that the screw be replaced. Following replacement his symptoms once more resolved.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) medical screening and referral — Medical screening incorporates the findings of the history and physical examination to determine whether the patient's symptoms originate from a condition that requires referral to another health care provider, and prior to diagnosing a person with PFP, it is necessary to rule out all other possible medical conditions. Clinicians should recognize the key signs and symptoms associated with serious pathological knee conditions, continually screen for the presence of these conditions throughout treatment, and immediately initiate referral to the appropriate medical practitioner when a potentially serious medical condition is suspected, and medical conditions for which physical therapy is not indicated must be considered as possible etiologies of a patient's symptoms.

A sixteen-year-old boy suffered from sharp pain in the knee during a jump while playing basketball. He had a positive history of Osgood Schlatter disease. Radiographic evaluation demonstrated an avulsion fracture of the tibial tuberosity Type III according to the classification of Watson-Jones. Rehabilitation after avulsion fracture of the tibial tuberosity is an important consideration for this relatively uncommon adolescent injury. In such avulsion fractures, landing on the ground with the knee fully extended after a jump is the most likely cause. This case report reviews the rehabilitation program, and selected functional outcome measures after rehabilitation are reported. The patient returned to sporting activity after 12 months.

The knee is the body part most commonly injured as a consequence of collisions, falls, and overuse occurring from childhood sports. The number of sports-related injuries is increasing because of active participation of children in competitive sports. Children differ from adults in many areas, such as increased rate and ability of healing, higher strength of ligaments compared with growth plates, and continued growth. Growth around the knee can be affected if the growth plates are involved in injuries. This article discusses fractures, anterior and posterior cruciate ligament injuries, and meniscal and patellar conditions.

### When a patient suspected with juvenile idiopathic arthritis turns out to be diagnosed with an infectious disease-a review of Lyme arthritis in children [^113xVyWs]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical features

EM (Fig. 1), a characteristic sign mentioned above as a common initial manifestation of B. burgdorferi infection, is frequently accompanied, or sometimes preceded, by systemic symptoms, in particular fatigue, fever, headache, stiff neck, myalgias, arthralgias, nausea and dysesthesia. However, according to Glaude et al. the majority (72%) of patients observed in Canada had arthritis as their first symptom of LD. 76% of patients did not recall a tick bite, and only 18% of patients had previous EM.

Fig. 1
Erythema migrans in a 9-year-old boy after tick bite

In patients who developed EM, arthralgias appeared 1 day to 8 weeks after onset of rash in a study of 55 patients performed by Steere et al. When EM is absent, symptoms of LA may occur months or even years after initial tick bite. Therefore, it can be manifested in every month of the year, not only within time of increased outdoor activity. In accordance with aforementioned diversity of genospecies, LA observed in Europe (caused mainly by B. garinii and B. afzelii) tends to occur in shorter period after initial tick bite comparing to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto infections.

On clinical presentation, LA usually affects large synovial joints asymmetrically. Recurrent swelling of the affected joint with a presence of moderate inflammatory effusion is a common clinical finding in children suspected of LA. Although more acute presentation may mimic septic arthritis, pain of the affected joints reported in patients with LA is usually less severe. All patients reported by Huppertz et al. experienced joint swelling or limitation of range of motion, but no pain. Additionally, 38% of patients assessed by Thompson et al. were incapable of bearing weight on the affected limb.

The knee is affected (Fig. 2) in over 90% of cases. The ankle is found to be the second most commonly involved joint. Correspondingly, the clinical image can resemble a mono- or oligoarticular JIA. Still, polyarticular involvement should not automatically exclude LA. Sá et al. reported a case of a 6-year-old girl with serological confirmation of spirochetal infection who developed swelling of the proximal inter-phalangeal joints of hands and wrist and both tibiotarsal joints within several months after initial tick bite and was finally diagnosed with polyarticular JIA.

### Gout in a 15-year-old boy with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a case study [^117U7R79]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Joint pain is a common complaint in pediatrics and in the face of persistent, severe, or recurrent symptoms, the differential typically expands to include bony or structural causes versus rheumatologic conditions. In this case, however, diagnosis was complicated because the child had two distinct etiologies causing joint pain. Moreover, the patient's second diagnosis was gout, a very uncommon condition in a pediatric patient, even in the setting of morbid obesity.

Poly-articular juvenile idiopathic arthritis was considered as the unifying diagnosis when the patient presented with involvement of multiple joints. The typical presenting features of JIA are morning stiffness, pain and swelling of the joints, limited range of motion, and joint contractures. Radiographs may show some soft tissue swelling and osteopenia early, with subchondral sclerosis and erosions evident after long-standing disease, but MRI has been shown to be more sensitive for bone marrow edema and tenosynovitis, as well as bone erosions, cartilage lesions, and synovial hypertrophy. JIA is most often seen in children of European descent, but affects children throughout the world. The disease is thought to be idiopathic with its cause poorly understood, although there is mounting evidence that autoimmunity may be involved. There is also thought to be potential genetic susceptibility in affected individuals. While the majority of the patient's overall complaints did seem to fit the diagnosis of JIA both in his clinical presentation and laboratory and imaging results, as well as his response to treatment, his right ankle continued to be refractory to treatment.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Primary acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) in children — follow-up to address sequelae: In children with primary ABA, we suggest close follow-up by providers with expertise in management of musculoskeletal infections until the completion of antibiotic therapy and return of function in the infected joint (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). For primary ABA that responds promptly to initial therapy, follow-up is not routinely required beyond 2–3 weeks from the start of treatment. Outcomes data show limited sequelae: only 1 (0.7%) of 134 children had an abnormality with a median of 36 days of follow-up after the end of therapy, and at the end of therapy among 109 children, 103 (95%) had full range of motion and 93 (85%) had no pain (median of 25 days). In long-term follow-up of 52 children (32 hip, 19 knee; mean follow-up 8.5 and 7.7 years respectively), no child had long term sequelae considered to be severe, but 10 (31%) with hip infections and 9 (47%) with knee infections had findings considered to be of mild to moderate severity. Among children with ABA with adjacent osteomyelitis, long-term sequelae were evident in 40 (38%) of 105 with a median of 139 days of follow-up. The rate of complications following ABA is approximately 10% overall. Children with substantial improvement at the end of acute treatment for uncomplicated ABA at 10–14 days are likely at very low risk of sequelae during childhood, whereas complications are more likely in subgroups including infants less than 6 months of age, those with ABA of the hip or shoulder, and those with delay of diagnosis or definitive surgical management beyond 4 days into treatment.

Section 3: treatment of ACL injuries in children

This section addresses the fundamental clinical question: what are the treatment options for the child with ACL injury? Once the clinician is certain of the injury diagnosis, he or she first needs to know the available treatment options, and discuss these options with the child and the child's parents/guardian, so a shared decision can be made about how best to manage the knee injury.

The goals of treatment for the child with ACL injury are:

To restore a stable, well-functioning knee that enables a healthy, active lifestyle across the lifespan
To reduce the impact of existing or the risk of further meniscal or chondral pathology, degenerative joint changes and the need for future surgical intervention
To minimise the risk of growth arrest and femur and tibia deformity

There are two treatment options that can help the child with ACL injury (with or without associated knee injuries) achieve these goals: high-quality rehabilitation alone (non-surgical treatment), and ACL reconstruction plus high-quality rehabilitation. In this section, the key components of high-quality rehabilitation for the child with ACL injury, and the options for ACL reconstruction surgical technique are described. Potential treatment decision modifiers are outlined in " Section 4: treatment decision modifiers ".

High-quality rehabilitation

High-quality rehabilitation is a critical component in the management of ACL injury, and the principles of rehabilitation are the same, irrespective of whether the child has had an ACL reconstruction or has elected for non-surgical treatment. Guidance for paediatric rehabilitation is extrapolated from clinical experience and research in adults, although it is uncertain whether adult principles apply to children. Paediatric rehabilitation must be performed in close collaboration with the child's parents/guardians. Exercises and functional goals must be modified, not simply copied from the adult-oriented rehabilitation protocols that may be more familiar to many clinicians. This is because children are not small adults — they cannot be expected to perform unsupervised training independently with perfect technique. Qualified rehabilitation clinicians must supervise rehabilitation for the child with ACL injury.

Introduction:

Chronic knee pain and swelling in children are often attributed to juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) but these diagnoses may overlook rare conditions that require specialized management. This case report presents a unique diagnosis of synovial vascular malformation (synovial haemangioma) in a paediatric patient, highlighting the challenges in diagnosing such rare conditions when symptoms mimic more common disorders like JIA.

Objectives: This report aims to add new insights into the diagnostic approach for persistent, unexplained joint swelling and underscores the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in paediatric rheumatology.

Methods: An 8 year old boy was initially diagnosed with oligoarticular JIA after presenting with one year history of left knee pain, swelling, and stiffness. Despite conventional treatment with NSAIDs, symptoms persisted in form of fluctuant intermittent painful knee swelling with functional limitation during walking. Examination showed swelling of the left knee joint with mild limitation of the left knee. There was no other joint, eye or spinal involvement.

As the history suggested fluctuating size of the swelling, a decision was taken to investigate further before considering Joint steroid injection to the left knee joint

Further evaluation, including ultrasound and MRI, revealed a rare synovial and intramuscular vascular malformation of the left knee joint. The diagnosis was confirmed through a multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach, involving paediatric rheumatology, oncology, orthopaedics, and interventional radiology teams

Results: Initial blood tests including FBC, CRP, Plasma viscosity were normal. The autoimmune screen was negative. The MRI revealed a lobulated mass within the suprapatellar fat pad, with low T1 signal, atypical for JIA, but suggestive of a synovial vascular malformation. After the diagnosis, the patient is followed up regularly at tertiary rheumatology centre and planned for sclerotherapy by interventional radiologist. This is recommended to help with possible complete resolution of the knee swelling and hence enabling patient to return to normal activities & quality of life.

Tailoring management and future directions

Training load management and exercise therapy is likely to be a part of successful treatment of adolescents with PFP; however, there are several areas that need further exploration. These include areas such as psychology, pain mechanisms and social support, which may all be specific to adolescents. The discussions at the Fourth International Patellofemoral Research Retreat in September 2015highlighted these issues. The consensus was that we need to consider the entire spectrum of the patellofemoral continuum, from PFP in adolescence to patellofemoral osteoarthritis, tailor treatment and avoid assuming that one size fits all.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) differential — hip/thigh/spine sources and screening: Hip and thigh pathology has been reported to refer pain to the knee, and persons who participate in high levels of physical activity may develop femoral fractures that masquerade as PFP; children and adolescents with knee pain may have referred pain from a slipped capital femoral epiphysis or other hip pathology, and in children with knee pain a limp is a sign of possible hip pathology. The lumbar spine may refer pain to the anterior thigh and knee, and clinicians should perform a lower-quarter screen for suspected PFP including examination of the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joint regions, with referral to the low back pain CPG for guidance on screening for referred pain from the low back.

### Gout in a 15-year-old boy with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a case study [^11742Eep]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Joint pain is a common complaint in pediatrics and is most often attributed to overuse or injury. In the face of persistent, severe, or recurrent symptoms, the differential typically expands to include bony or structural causes versus rheumatologic conditions. Rarely, a child has two distinct causes for joint pain. In this case, an obese 15-year-old male was diagnosed with gout, a disease common in adults but virtually ignored in the field of pediatrics. The presence of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) complicated and delayed the consideration of this second diagnosis. Indeed, the absence of gout from this patient's differential diagnosis resulted in a greater than two-year delay in receiving treatment. The patients' BMI was 47.4, and he was also mis-diagnosed with osteochondritis dissecans and underwent medical treatment for JIA, assorted imaging studies, and multiple surgical procedures before the key history of increased pain with red meat ingestion, noticed by the patient, and a subsequent elevated uric acid confirmed his ultimate diagnosis. With the increased prevalence of obesity in the adolescent population, the diagnosis of gout should be an important consideration in the differential diagnosis for an arthritic joint in an overweight patient, regardless of age.

### Nonspecific knee synovitis caused by foreign bodies undetectable on imaging studies: four cases and literature review [^1132QK6L]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Review of the Literature

Early and accurate diagnosis of intra-articular FBs in children is crucial to prevent sequelae such as chronic joint irritation and infection. This necessitates the following:
(1) Understanding the limitations of each imaging modality. Although radiograph, ultrasonography, and MRI can be helpful, they often miss subtle FBs. Unlike metals and glass, materials such as wood and plastics are often undetectable and require arthroscopic examination and treatment. Moreover, FBs may have undergone inclusion or be hidden behind structures that obscure their presence.
(2) Consider arthroscopy earlier rather than later when noninvasive investigations are inconclusive. Direct visualization offers definitive diagnosis and allows immediate intervention.
(3) Meticulous history taking in children with unexplained joint inflammation. Engaging both the child and parents can unearth crucial clues and expand the differential diagnosis.

The cases we describe illustrate the limitations of both conventional and advanced imaging in detecting FBs especially in children. A high index of suspicion and prompt arthroscopic evaluation are essential for achieving optimal outcomes in cases of persistent or recurring monoarticular knee pain. We believe that the relief of pain and the potential pathological ramifications of an indwelling FB supersede any potential risks associated with procedures performed under general anesthesia.

Lipoma arborescens is an intra-articular benign tumor characterized by villous synovial hypertrophy that can cause chronic joint pain and effusions. This disease is rare in adults and exceptionally rare in children. We present the case of an otherwise healthy 10-year-old boy who presented with a painful chronic left knee effusion. The workup included radiographs, MRI, and laboratory analysis, and he was diagnosed with lipoma arborescens. He underwent arthroscopic synovectomy and had a full recovery with the ability to return to all desired activities.

### Nonspecific knee synovitis caused by foreign bodies undetectable on imaging studies: four cases and literature review [^116ggFTa]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Most foreign bodies (FBs) are discovered in the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems, - but penetrating joint injuries may occur in the pediatric population but are often diagnosed by plane radiographs when the foreign object is radiodense. However, when the foreign body is not detectable on imaging, the inflammation and possible infection may persist for extended periods, causing a delay in diagnosis and treatment. Children and young adults may complain of pain weeks or months following a penetrating injury that is often not recalled. – Cases presenting as knee pain and swelling, sometimes with no apparent traumatic injury can cause septic arthritis, elicit an extensive imaging and laboratory workup and may not be recognized until arthroscopic exploration. Because of the often-obscure presentation of these injuries, general physicians, pediatricians, emergency department physicians, and orthopaedic surgeons should be thorough in taking history from patients presenting with joint pain disorders. In this report, we present four such cases of pediatric arthroscopic extraction of a foreign body in the knee joint undetectable by imaging technologies at a large, urban, tertiary university-affiliated medical center. We also review currently available data on foreign body extraction from joints along with management and approach of pediatric patients presenting with suspected intra-articular FBs.

Measurement properties for clinical examination and MRI

'No isolated question, test or image can accurately identify an ACL injury, every time'.
No isolated question, test or image can accurately identify an ACL injury, every time. The measurement tools available to the clinician are not perfect, but they do yield valuable information in the clinical context. Knowledge of the measurement properties of clinical tools helps the clinician balance the information gained from these tools. The negative predictive values of clinical examination and MRI for ACL tear and meniscal pathology are higher than the positive predictive values (table 1). This means that if the clinical examination and MRI are negative for injury, the chance of the patient having an injury is low. However, if the tests are positive, it does not mean that the clinician can always reliably rule the diagnosis in.

### Nonspecific knee synovitis caused by foreign bodies undetectable on imaging studies: four cases and literature review [^116cz1n6]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing and managing acute knee monoarthritis in children presents a complex challenge, and when an etiology is not clear, it might be the result of an occult presence of a radiolucent foreign body. We report on four instances of acute monoarticular knee arthritis in pediatric patients. Despite employing standard imaging techniques, patient history, and laboratory tests, no foreign bodies (FBs) were initially identified. However, arthroscopy conducted in all cases, unveiled FBs that might have otherwise gone unnoticed and led to proper treatment of the problem. Despite their rarity, a unique challenge arises in this population due to the deceptive presentation of symptoms. The often-inconspicuous nature of the injury, combined with negative radiographs and nonspecific soft-tissue inflammation, on MRI frequently leads to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Our study and broader literature highlight the limitations of standard imaging in detecting FBs, especially in children. In cases of persistent or recurring knee pain, a high index of suspicion for undetected FBs and prompt arthroscopic evaluation are paramount for achieving optimal outcomes in children with otherwise unexplained monoarticular knee arthritis.

### Anterior cruciate ligament rupture in skeletally immature patients [^114YwQWP]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of ACL lesions should include a detailed clinical history, physical examination, and imaging assessment. The patient usually presents with a painful effusion of the affected knee and avoids load bearing on the affected limb. Unlike adult patients, children often fail to provide a clear history regarding the mechanism of trauma. Overall, 65% of young athletes with hemarthrosis have an ACL rupture. Positive Lachman tests (sensitivity: ∼96%), anterior drawer, and pivot shift are usually present but are limited by pain and swelling in the acute phase. Pediatric patients show poor tolerance to these tests, thereby reducing the validity of the tests. The pivot shift can be done under sedation, reaching 98% positivity. Given the physiologically increased generalized joint laxity in the pediatric population, comparative testing of the contralateral limb is of utmost importance. We must also evaluate other underlying conditions in the patient, such as limb-length discrepancy or axis alteration.

AP, lateral, and intercondylar tunnel radiograph views are recommended to rule out trauma-related bone injuries. Among these, it is important to identify avulsion fractures of the tibial spines that correspond to an ACL rupture equivalent in the population with an immature skeleton. In all patients suspected of an ACL injury, a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the knee should be obtained, which has a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 88% in children with ACL rupture (Figure 3). It also provides important information regarding commonly associated injuries, such as meniscal tears, chondral injuries, and other ligament injuries, which may have implications for the treatment of the patient.,

Section 2: diagnosis, clinical tests and imaging

This section addresses the fundamental clinical question: how does the clinician diagnose ACL injury in the child? High-quality injury prevention programs are the first-line defence against the potential negative short- and long-term consequences of ACL injury. However, if injury prevention efforts fail, timely and accurate diagnosis is important, since diagnosis is the starting point for effective management planning and shared decision-making. The clinician combines information from the patient's history, examination and clinical tests, and imaging to build the clinical picture that will inform diagnosis and treatment. Typically, a thorough history and clinical examination will enable the clinician to make an accurate diagnosis.

Clinical pearl 1 Haemarthrosis (acute swelling in the knee within 24 h after a trauma due to intra-articular bleeding) following acute knee injury is an important clue suggesting structural knee injury.

Clinical pearl 2 Diagnosis can be more challenging than in adults because children may be poor historians, they may have greater physiologic joint laxity (be sure to examine both knees), and MRI interpretation is more difficult given developmental variants in children.

Clinical pearl 3 Due to the immature skeleton, children may sustain different knee injuries (e.g. sleeve fracture of the patella, epiphysiolysis) than adults.

Consider starting the assessment by ordering plain knee radiographs for all paediatric patients with a haemarthrosis/suspected acute knee injury. This is because tibial eminence fractures and an ACL tear can present with a similar history and physical examination findings. It is also important to rule out other paediatric fractures (e.g. epiphyseal fracture, sleeve fracture of the patella). Perform an MRI to confirm the diagnosis of ACL injury and evaluate other soft tissue structures. In children with an ACL injury, MRI may yield additional information to identify meniscal tears, other ligament injury, or osteochondral injury. In children with a locked knee, an acute MRI is warranted to assess the presence of a displaced bucket-handle meniscal tear or an osteochondral injury that may need prompt surgical treatment.

Overuse-related injuries of the knee joint and periarticular soft tissues include a heterogenous group of sports and nonsports-related injuries. These conditions include friction and impingement syndromes, bone stress injuries, bursitis, and tendon-related pathology such as tendinopathy and snapping. Traction apophysitis are also discussed as commonly seen in the pediatric population. Although multiple imaging modalities can be used, this review focuses on MR imaging, which is the most common and, often, the only modality used.

Conclusion

Diagnosis of osteomyelitis of patella is often delayed due to its rarity and nonspecific symptoms and signs. A child aged 5 to 15 years, presenting with persistent knee pain and swelling, repetitive synovitis, bursitis, irritable joint, and trauma should be evaluated for chronic osteomyelitis of patella. Early diagnosis, and management with surgery and antibiotics, can prevent the development of complications.

Despite initial good recovery, the patient started noticing a painless swelling of the knee with a reduced range of motion after 6 weeks (see Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 1). Treatment with doxycycline was started empirically. In July 2013, approximately 80 mL of blood-colored fluid was aspirated from his knee with no bacterial growth, thus no microbiological signs of an infection, followed by an arthroscopic washout of the knee joint. A magnetic resonance imaging was performed, which demonstrated signs of arthritis and osteomyelitis of the left knee (Fig. 2). A second arthroscopic washout was performed to remove further septic material. The culture revealed the causative pathogen.

Literature Review and Discussion

"Silent" intra-articular FBs are relatively uncommon in pediatric medical settings. We present the largest series of such cases reported to date. The deceptive presentation of symptoms poses a unique diagnostic challenge. The often-unremarkable nature of the injury combined with apparently negative radiographs and nonspecific soft-tissue inflammation on MRIs, frequently lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment.

Our case 1 illustrates these features. The clinical picture was misleading, and the imaging results were noninformative, whereas the arthroscopy procedure revealed and enabled the removal of an intra-articular FB. This case underscores the significance of vigilance and awareness of subtle clinical presentations, particularly when initial imaging assessments yield normal or ambiguous results. Patients may present with recurrent or persistent joint pain, swelling, and numbness weeks or even months after an injury that may have not been remarkable enough to recall as the cause of joint trauma. This is particularly relevant to the pediatric population, especially with regard to patients without rheumatological characteristics and those who already have a history of trauma to the affected joint with no signs of skin penetration on physical examination.

'Long-term outcomes after ACL injury in childhood, including the development of osteoarthritis, have not been studied'.
Injury management is challenging in the current landscape of clinical uncertainty and limited scientific knowledge. Injury management decisions also occur against the backdrop of the complexity of shared decision-making with children and the potential long-term ramifications of the injury. This consensus statement addresses six fundamental clinical questions regarding the prevention, diagnosis and management of paediatric ACL injuries (box 1). By framing each topic around clinical questions, the aim of this consensus statement is to provide a comprehensive, evidence-informed summary to support the clinician, and help children with ACL injury and their parents/guardians make the best possible decisions.

### Abstracts of the 35th meeting of the German society for pediatric and adolescents rheumatology (gesellschaft für kinder-und jugendrheumatology (GKJR) [^116iu4jF]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Description: A 14-year-old female presented with chronic, bilateral, activity-related knee pain persisting for over a year. Symptoms lacked inflammatory features such as swelling, warmth or morning stiffness. Initial sonography was unremarkable and MRI findings indicated tibial and femoral bone marrow edema, consistent with a stress reaction. Despite extensive workup, no rheumatologic diagnosis was established.

Over time, the patient experienced pain and swelling in her hand after minor trauma. An external X-ray identified a cystic lesion, prompting re-evaluation by a pediatric radiologist. Imaging revealed severe osteopenia, subperiosteal bone resorption and acroosteolysis, hallmark findings of hyperparathyroidism. MRI findings confirmed the presence of a brown tumor. Laboratory tests supported the diagnosis, showing elevated calcium (3.6 mmol/L; normal 2.2–2.6), low phosphate (0.8 mmol/L; normal 1.0–1.5), markedly elevated PTH (111 pmol/L; normal 1.6–6.9), and elevated alkaline phosphatase (17 µkat/L; normal 1.1–6.5). Neck ultrasound identified a parathyroid adenoma, which was histologically confirmed after surgical excision. Postoperatively, serum calcium normalized and supplementation with calcium and vitamin D improved skeletal mineralization. Symptoms, including the brown tumor, resolved.

Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of considering metabolic disorders like primary hyperparathyroidism in the differential diagnosis of unexplained bone and joint pain. Early detection through basic laboratory tests such as serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase can significantly expedite diagnosis and treatment. Revisiting imaging studies with a focus on metabolic patterns is crucial for recognizing rare conditions. Incorporating routine metabolic assessments into the diagnostic workup for persistent bone pain is a simple yet effective strategy to prevent diagnostic delays and optimize outcomes in conditions such as osteitis fibrosa cystica.

Patient Consent: Yes, I received consent.

Funding: None.

### Patellofemoral pain [^1164X9Ct]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) — scope and presentation is described as "a common knee-related condition that is characterized by insidious onset of poorly defined pain, localized to the anterior retropatellar and/or peripatellar region of the knee", with onset that "can be slow or acutely develop" and pain worsening during "lower-limb loading activities (eg, squatting, prolonged sitting, ascending/descending stairs, jumping, or running, especially with hills)". Symptoms "can restrict participation in physical activity, sports, and work", "can recur and can persist for years", "frequently present to health care professionals for diagnosis and treatment", and this CPG aims to help clinicians "make evidence-based treatment decisions".

### Finding yaws among indigenous people: lessons from case detection surveys in luzon and visayas island groups of the Philippines [^1149ZgXQ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

Yaws bone and joint disease.

Another new finding in the current study is a case of an 8-year-old boy with active yaws skin lesions and bony deformities of the forearms that developed over a few months. This is a case of yaws osteitis or osteoperiostitis affecting the radius and ulnar bones. Radiographs were planned to further confirm and document the skeletal deformities; however, the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in the Tagkawayan municipality did not make it safe for the boy to be brought to the medical facility. This is an important finding because the search for yaws tends to focus on the cutaneous signs rather than the extracutaneous bone signs and symptoms. In the first yaws study conducted in the Mindanao Island group, Southern Philippines, in 2017, one adult respondent recalled having bone pains.

A cross-sectional survey of yaws cases seen in a health facility in Papua New Guinea (N = 138) had 92% of participants with osteoarticular involvement, such as arthralgias 48/63 (76.2%) of the large joints (knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists) and bone swelling or marked pain in 10/63 (15.9%). Mitja et al.also reported a case series of seven children in Lihir, Papua New Guinea. All cases were diagnosed within 3 weeks to 3 months after the primary yaws lesion appeared. Initial signs and symptoms were bone pain in all cases, soft tissue swelling, and multiple bone involvement. The radial bone was the most commonly affected. Patients with dactylitis had spindle-shaped soft-tissue swelling around the phalanges.

### Activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase δ syndrome caused by PIK3CD mutations: expanding the phenotype [^116qyiuK]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

One month after discharge, the patient presented with swelling of both knee joints, especially the left knee, affecting normal activities. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed abnormal signal of fluid accumulation focusing in the bilateral knee joint cavities and the left knee suprapatellar capsule, as well as slightly swelling muscles surrounding and thickening and strengthening of the synovial membrane in the left knee joint. The swelling relieved after taking naproxen 10 ~ 15 mg/(kg.d) orally twice for three days.

Patient 2, an 8.5-year old boy, presented our allergy clinic with multiple ecchymosis for half day. The patient had no abnormality at birth and was in normal physical condition. At the age of 2 months old, he had been diagnosed as thrombocytopenia. At 5 years, he underwent cervical lymphadenectomy, and lymph node biopsy demonstrated reactive hyperplasia. At 7 years old, he received colonoscopy and polypectomy due to abdominal pain and diarrhea due to intussusception caused by multiple ileocecal polyps (Fig. 1 A, B and C).

### Not just for boys: a rare case of symptomatic Osgood-Schlatter disease in a skeletally mature woman [^116Up43U]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Plain films were obtained which were notable for diffuse bony ossicles from fragmentation of the apophysis in the affected knee, with oedematous changes surrounding the ossicles in the plane of the patella tendon (figure 1), particularly when compared with the unaffected knee (figure 2). Given the pain was localised to the tuberosity and area overlying the fragmented ossicles, the patient's pain was felt to be caused by persistently symptomatic OSD.

Figure 1
Lateral weight-bearing film of the right knee demonstrating multiple well-corticated ossific fragments seen adjacent to a prominent tibial tuberosity.

Figure 2
Lateral weight-bearing film of the left knee for comparison, demonstrating normal osseous mineralisation and alignment.

OSD, also known as osteochondrosis of the tibial tubercle, is believed to be caused by repetitive strain of the patellar tendon at the tibial insertion site. It is a common childhood condition affecting primarily adolescent boys who partake in running and jumping activities, however is seen with increasing frequency in women; this trend is felt to parallel the increasing participation of women in sport. Most cases resolve with supportive treatment and rarely are symptomatic into adulthood. Treatment involves limiting activity until inflammation resolves and exercises that strengthen the surrounding musculature to reduce stress across the tibial tuberosity. Isometric strength drills targeting the hamstring, quadriceps, iliotibial band and gastrocnemius muscle can progress to dynamic movements, with stretching to augment pain reduction. In severe cases, surgical intervention with ossicle removal and tibial reduction osteotomy may be considered.

With our patient, treatment with physical therapy and strict activity modification was initiated. Surgical removal of the ossicles was considered, but the patient wished to forgo surgery given equivocal outcomes in the literature. After 6 months, the patient's pain largely resolved although she continues to have persistent pain with kneeling and occasional flares of acute pain over the tibial tuberosity with squatting.

This case represents, to our knowledge, the first known report of persistently symptomatic Osgood-Schlatter syndrome in a skeletally mature female adult. The case underscores the importance of considering OSD in the differential for anterior knee pain.

Learning points

Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD) should be on the differential for anterior knee pain.
OSD can cause pain in the skeletally mature adult.
Less commonly, OSD can affect women.

Section 7: future research

Management of paediatric ACL injuries is highly debated. Reflecting some of the concern and controversy is a high ratio of clinical commentaries and narrative reviews to original articles on this topic. The problem for the clinician is that there is scarce high-quality evidence that he or she can look to, to help him or her best manage paediatric ACL injuries. The scientific literature is inconsistent and limited by inferior methods that carry a high-risk of bias. There are no randomised trials comparing different treatment approaches or different surgical techniques. Most of the publications have only short-term follow-up; there are none with follow-up beyond 10 years. Therefore, long-term knee-health (including osteoarthritis) and quality of life is unknown.

Methodological considerations

There are five key issues that must be addressed by future studies:

Most clinical studies on paediatric ACL injury are of cross-sectional or retrospective design, the study populations are often at high-risk of selection bias and include small samples. This means there is a high risk that existing research does not reflect the typical paediatric patient with an ACL injury.
Many studies do not provide adequate descriptions of the treatments that the patients have received, and patient adherence has not been reported. A meaningful interpretation of study outcomes is only possible with a detailed description of the surgical technique, rehabilitation, brace usage, return to sport clearance and recommendations of activity modification.
Many studies fail to assess the skeletal age of included participants, and few report the remaining growth of participants. Chronological age alone is an unreliable indicator of skeletal maturity. Because of this, it is difficult to know to which skeletal age group these research results apply.
Patients aged up to 18 years are often included in paediatric studies. This is a problem because it is likely that the patient population is a mix of skeletally mature and immature patients. Therefore, the literature may be biased toward the older patients. Having mixed populations also complicates pooling or comparing results from skeletally immature patients across studies.
Knowledge of pre-injury and post-treatment activity level gives important insight into a key risk factor for injury. The greater exposure a child has to potentially injurious situations (e.g. playing pivoting sport), the greater the chance of (re)injury. Activity level is a key confounding factor that is rarely accounted for in statistical analyses. This means there is a risk that estimates of secondary injury incidence may be over- or under-estimated in comparisons between studies or patient-groups.

Serious conditions and inconsistent presentations — clinicians should recognize signs and symptoms associated with serious pathological knee conditions, continually screen for them, and immediately initiate referral when a potentially serious medical condition is suspected; clinicians should consider diagnostic classifications associated with serious pathological conditions or psychosocial factors when patients' limitations are inconsistent with this guideline or when symptoms are not resolving with impairment-focused interventions.

### Osteochondrosis: common causes of pain in growing bones [^117GmWJz]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Osteochondrosis is a term used to describe a group of disorders that affect the growing skeleton. These disorders result from abnormal growth, injury, or overuse of the developing growth plate and surrounding ossification centers. The exact etiology of these disorders is unknown, but genetic causes, repetitive trauma, vascular abnormalities, mechanical factors, and hormonal imbalances may all play a role. Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease is a hip disorder that causes hip pain, an atraumatic limp, and knee pain. Osgood-Schlatter and Sinding-Larsen-Johannson diseases are common causes of anterior knee pain that is aggravated by jumping activities and kneeling. Sever disease causes heel pain that is exacerbated by activity and wearing cleats. It often mimics Achilles tendinitis and is treated with activity and shoe modifications, heel cups, and calf stretches. Freiberg disease and Köhler bone disease often cause foot pain and are disorders of the metatarsal head and navicular bone, respectively. Radiographs show sclerosis, flattening, and fragmentation of bone in both diseases. Elbow pain can be caused by medial epicondyle apophysitis or Panner disease. Medial epicondyle apophysitis is exacerbated by frequent throwing and is treated with throwing cessation and acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Panner disease is the most common cause of lateral-sided elbow pain in children younger than 10 years. It may or may not be associated with frequent throwing, and it resolves spontaneously. Scheuermann disease causes back pain and a humpback deformity from vertebral bone anterior wedging.

### The knee: MR imaging of uniquely pediatric disorders [^114YmEik]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The knee is one of the joints most commonly injured during sport-related activities in the pediatric population. Although physical examination and conventional radiography remain the most important tools for determining the extent of the injury, clinical assessment of the knee may be limited in patients with pain, swelling, and effusion, and conventional radiology may overlook serious injuries. MR imaging is an excellent modality for pediatric knee disorders given its lack of ionizing radiation, multiplanar capabilities, and high resolution, which provides accurate assessment of bone, cartilage, menisci, ligaments, and adjacent soft tissues. This article describes MR imaging findings of unique disorders of the pediatric knee, common traumatic injuries, frequent developmental abnormalities, and benign incidental findings.

Section 2: diagnosis, clinical tests and imaging

This section addresses the fundamental clinical question: how does the clinician diagnose ACL injury in children? High-quality injury prevention programs are the first-line defence against the potential negative short-term and long-term consequences of ACL injury. However, if injury prevention efforts fail, timely and accurate diagnosis is important, since diagnosis is the starting point for effective management planning and shared decision-making. The clinician combines information from the patient's history, examination and clinical tests, and imaging to build the clinical picture that will inform diagnosis and treatment. Typically, a thorough history and clinical examination will enable the clinician to make an accurate diagnosis.

Clinical pearl 1

Haemarthrosis (acute swelling in the knee within 24 hours after a trauma due to intra-articular bleeding) following acute knee injury is an important clue suggesting structural knee injury.

Clinical pearl 2

Diagnosis can be more challenging than in adults because children may be poor historians, they may have greater physiological joint laxity (be sure to examine both knees) and MRI interpretation is more difficult given developmental variants in children.

Clinical pearl 3

Due to the immature skeleton, children may sustain different knee injuries (eg, sleeve fracture of the patella, epiphysiolysis) than adults.

Consider starting the assessment by ordering plain knee radiographs for all paediatric patients with a haemarthrosis/suspected acute knee injury. This is because tibial eminence fractures and an ACL tear can present with a similar history and physical examination findings. It is also important to rule out other paediatric fractures (eg, epiphysial fracture, sleeve fracture of the patella). Perform an MRI to confirm the diagnosis of ACL injury and evaluate other soft tissue structures. In children with an ACL injury, MRI may yield additional information to identify meniscal tears, other ligament injury or osteochondral injury. In children with a locked knee, an acute MRI is warranted to assess the presence of a displaced bucket handle meniscal tear or an osteochondral injury that may need prompt surgical treatment.

### Pigmented villonodular synovitis in pediatric population: review of literature and a case report [^112NNF7Q]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a rare proliferative process that affects the synovial joint, tendon sheaths, and bursa membranes. The estimated incidence of PVNS is around 1.8 cases per million people in a population. PVNS is usually found in adults aged 20–50 years, but it may also be found in children.

The youngest patient reported with PVNS was 12 months old. Knee involvement is common in pediatric PVNS, although other affected areas have been reported, such as the foot and ankle, elbow, hip, sacroiliac joint, and multiple joint involvements. Some authors have determined that there is no sex predilection in PVNS, while other reports have shown a male or female predominance.

The etiology of PVNS is unknown, but chronic inflammation, a tumor-like disorder with chromosomal aberrations that cause hemorrhagic tendencies, as well as genetic factors, have been proposed as potential causes. Trauma and rheumatoid arthritis association have also been considered.

The following study reports on a 3-year-old boy with a 4-month-long history of pain and swelling in the right knee. The patient was initially treated for juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and growth retardation.

### Patellofemoral pain during adolescence: much more prevalent than appreciated [^1116kTG8]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Adherence to exercises is a challenge

In our recent randomised trial on adolescent PFP, the majority of adolescents adhered poorly to the exercise programme. Those who did their home exercises three times per week or more were four times more likely to be recovered after 12 months compared with those with poor adherence (< 1 exercise session per week). Adherence is vital, and requires greater understanding of the barriers and facilitators for good adherence. It is essential that the adolescents and the parents are educated about the importance of adherence and understand why the exercises are important.

### Familial limb pain and migraine: 8-year follow-up of four generations [^115E45CX]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

Patient III1

Aged 46 years at the index time, this patient had episodic abdominal pain and motion sickness as a child. In her 20s and 30s she had episodes of a moderately severe deep ache in her right hip, lasting half an hour at a time, with normal examination during and between the pain. She could not recall the frequency of these episodes. At other times she had a sharp, severe, stabbing pain in her right or left hip, behind either eye, or in her right third toe. These pains came for a period of a day or two, occurred up to 20 times per day, and then abated for weeks or months. She had mild unilateral throbbing fronto-orbital headaches at other times, but never with the hip or stabbing pain. From her early 40s she had episodes of severe pain in the lower left half of her face, awakening her at night and localized to the lower molars, together with watering of both eyes. The pain lasted 20–40 minutes and was relieved by aspirin within 20–30 minutes. Sometimes she had the unilateral sensation that part of her face or her hand was enlarged for about 30 minutes just before the head pain started. From her early 40s she noted episodes of limb pain in her right or left hip, independently or associated in 50% of episodes with unilateral throbbing headache of moderate severity, nausea, photophobia and malaise. The limb pain occurred before and/or during the headache and lasted for about 30 minutes. The headache lasted longer than the limb pain (up to 60 minutes).

Patient III2

As a child, this patient had recurrent hip pain that was never diagnosed or investigated. As an adult, she had monthly (usually premenstrual) heavy, severe pain in her left jaw starting in the morning and accompanied later by pain in her left shoulder and left neck. During these pains she had blurring of her vision for 5–10 minutes and, at the same time, pain in her left hip and knee. The pains stopped her from doing her usual activities. The episodes lasted 2 hours.

### Patellofemoral pain during adolescence: much more prevalent than appreciated [^116DQFsY]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Patellofemoral pain is common among adolescents

Musculoskeletal conditions are not unique to the adult population. From the age of 5–9 years to the age of 10–14 years there is an almost fourfold increase in the years lived with disability as a result of musculoskeletal conditions. In Danish primary care, we see an eightfold increase in the number of contacts to general practice because of knee symptoms between 5–9 and 10–19 years. This makes knee pain one of the most common sites of pain in adolescents. Our research shows that 6–7% of the adolescent population is affected (in varying severities) by patellofemoral pain (PFP). This makes PFP one of the most common knee conditions among adolescents.

Depending on how you define adolescence and adulthood, more than 95% of all research on PFP is carried out on adults. This does not match the high prevalence among adolescents. It is appreciated that children are not small adults — adolescents appear to need their own attention too.

### A comparative analysis of international knee documentation committee scores for common pediatric and adolescent knee injuries [^116jRJaA]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Several different etiologies cause knee pain in the pediatric and adolescent population, including anterior knee/patellofemoral pain, patellar instability, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears, meniscal tears, osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) lesions, and discoid meniscus. The purpose of the current study was to determine the relative morbidity of different causes of knee pain in children and adolescents using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data of a cohort of pediatric and adolescent patients with knee pain who presented to a single surgeon. Each patient completed an IKDC questionnaire at the time of diagnosis and patients were grouped by diagnosis for analysis. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the IKDC scores of the 7 diagnostic groups, and a P-value < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results

The IKDC mean score for all 242 patients was 50.3 ± 18.3. The mean IKDC score for patients with isolated meniscal tears was 41.2 ± 16.0, combined ACL and meniscal injuries was 50.2 ± 13.9, and isolated ACL tears was 48.1 ± 14.1. The mean IKDC score for patients with symptomatic discoid meniscus was 46.3 ± 13.2, anterior knee pain/patellofemoral pain was 49.0 ± 17.4, patellar instability was 49.2 ± 22.1, and OCD lesions was 62.2 ± 19.5.

Conclusions

The IKDC scores of most of the diagnostic groups were similar to the overall average score, with the notable exception of patients with OCD lesions exhibiting statistically significant less morbidity reflected by a higher IKDC score. Although symptoms in each individual clinical presentation may vary, knowledge of the relative morbidity of these diagnostic groups is valuable in counseling patients and their families regarding these common pediatric and adolescent sources of knee pain.

### Musculoskeletal pain is not clearly associated with the risk of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in adolescents [^1176sStT]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Musculoskeletal pain (MSP) is a globally common problem which affects individuals, families and societies. There is an increasing prevalence of children and adolescents with MSP, which often presents as multisite, persistent and idiopathic. In addition, MSP in adolescence is associated with greater risk of chronic pain in adulthood. Although the epidemiology, burden and treatment of MSP in adults has been the subject of considerable research, the same is not true for children and adolescents.MSP may reduce muscle strength and have a dysfunctional effect on joint stability and control. Neuromuscular control plays an important role in physical activity in daily life and sports, which is a significant factor for the development of an active lifestyle for children and adolescents. Furthermore, poor neuromuscular control has been suggested to be a contributor to acute injury of lower limb structures such as the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).

The number of ACL injuries are increasing among adolescents. An injury as such often results in great discomfort and long-term consequences, and is associated with increased risk of knee instability, osteoarthritis, meniscal injuries and reduced quality of life. For adolescents, an ACL injury could contribute to reduced participation in sport, and some might require reconstructive surgery of the ligament (ACLR) to be able to return to sport. Known risk factors for ACL injury include high level of physical activity, participation in team sports, female gender, weakness of knee flexors and hip adductors, dynamic valgus, muscle fatigue and a history of muscle, tendon, knee or ankle injuries. Identifying risk factors and consequences of MSP and ACL injuries are important steps towards better understanding, as well as early detection and prevention. Whether MSP might be a risk factor for ACL injury leading to an ACLR has, to our knowledge, not been explored. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether self-reported MSP is associated with the risk of a future ACLR in a population-based cohort of adolescents. We hypothesised that high MSP load would lead to increased risk of a future ACLR due to possible reduced neuromuscular control, which can potentially alter movement patterns and thereby increase the risk of an initial ACL injury.

### What parents need to know about knee pain in active children… [^114xTQG4]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Angulo MI, Collazo GR, Thompson LA. What Parents Need to Know About Knee Pain in Active Children. JAMA Pediatr. 2025; 179:

482. doi: 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2024.6164 Knee pain in children is common, especially for children who are active. Usually, knee pain stems from minor injuries caused by using the knee over and over again without giving it time to recover. This is called an overuse injury. One of the most common overuse injuries of the knee is Osgood-Schlatter disease. OSD, also known as jumper's knee, is a common cause of knee pain in children who play sports. This is especially common in sports that require jumping and running. These movements strain the kneecap tendon and the shinbone, which causes inflammation and knee pain. One in 10 children may be affected by OSD. This condition usually develops during a growth spurt and resolves after the bone stops growing. This means girls aged 8 to 13 years and boys aged 12 to 15 years frequently have this knee pain.

It is most common in children actively participating in sports that involve jumping, squatting, kicking, and running. The sports with the highest risk include basketball, volleyball, sprinting, and soccer. OSD causes knee pain and swelling that are worse with physical activity and improve with rest. The pain is in a specific place: immediately below the knee joint at the tibial tubercle, where the kneecap tendon attaches to the shinbone. Most children experience pain in 1 knee, but in 30% of cases, children have pain in both knees. The severity of pain and swelling can vary and can sometimes limit walking, daily activities, and sports participation. OSD will resolve on its own over time, but symptoms may persist until growth is completed. Most children respond well to simple interventions like rest, activity modifications, and pain medications.

Other treatment options include applying ice locally after physical activity and taking anti-inflammatory medications as needed for pain relief. Stretching exercises and physical therapy may also help. For example, strengthening the leg muscles above and below the knee can reduce the strain on the kneecap. A brace or a cast is usually not recommended, but in severe cases, a short course of a knee brace may be an option. Surgery is rarely necessary.

### Acute knee injuries in children and adolescents: a review… [^112x78PS]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance Knee injuries in children and adolescents are exceedingly common. When an active youth presents complaining of knee pain, the treating pediatrician should be comfortable with forming a working differential diagnosis and should be able to manage many such injuries or recognize when it is necessary to make an appropriate referral. Observations. Knee injuries typically present after acute trauma. Appreciating the likely etiologies pertaining to a particular case is best achieved with a thorough history and physical examination. This review discusses the etiologies of acute injuries including fractures that are unique to skeletally immature individuals, patellar dislocations, ligamentous injuries, and meniscal tears. Imaging findings and management of these conditions are also reviewed. Conclusions and Relevance This review summarizes the more common acute knee injuries seen in active children and adolescents.

Given how frequently such conditions present, this overview of diagnosis and management will provide a useful resource for the nonspecialist. MacDonald J, Rodenberg R, Sweeney E. Acute Knee Injuries in Children and Adolescents: A Review. JAMA Pediatr. 2021; 175: 624–630.

### Evaluation of patients presenting with knee pain: part II [^113sEoqh]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Children and Adolescents Children and adolescents who present with knee pain are likely to have one of three common conditions: patellar subluxation, tibial apophysitis, or patellar tendonitis. Additional diagnoses to consider in children include slipped capital femoral epiphysis and septic arthritis. TIBIAL APOPHYSITIS The patient with tibial apophysitis generally reports waxing and waning of knee pain for a period of months. The pain worsens with squatting, walking up or down stairs, or forceful contractions of the quadriceps muscle. This overuse apophysitis is exacerbated by jumping and hurdling, because repetitive hard landings place excessive stress on the insertion of the patellar tendon. OSTEOCHONDRITIS DISSECANS Osteochondritis dissecans is an intra-articular osteochondrosis of unknown etiology that is characterized by degeneration and re-calcification of articular cartilage and underlying bone. In the knee, the medial femoral condyle is most commonly affected.

Lateral Knee Pain Excessive friction between the iliotibial band and the lateral femoral condyle can lead to iliotibial band tendonitis. 9 This overuse syndrome commonly occurs in runners and cyclists, although it may develop in any person subsequent to activity involving repetitive knee flexion. Tightness of the iliotibial band, excessive foot pronation, genu varum, and tibial torsion are predisposing factors. The patient with iliotibial band tendonitis reports pain at the lateral aspect of the knee joint. The pain is aggravated by activity, particularly running downhill and climbing stairs. On physical examination, tenderness is present at the lateral epicondyle of the femur, approximately 3 cm proximal to the joint line. Soft tissue swelling and crepitus also may be present, but there is no joint effusion. Radiographs are not indicated. Medial Collateral Ligament Sprain Injury to the medial collateral ligament is fairly common and is usually the result of acute trauma.

The patient reports a misstep or collision that places valgus stress on the knee, followed by immediate onset of pain and swelling at the medial aspect of the knee. 11 On physical examination, the patient with medial collateral ligament injury has point tenderness at the medial joint line. Valgus stress testing of the knee flexed to 30 degrees reproduces the pain (see text and.
