## Question

Steroids for plantar fasciitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether corticosteroid injections are appropriate for plantar fasciitis, and if so, when they should be used, how they are administered, and how they compare to alternatives like PRP, ESWT, and exercise-based care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and where corticosteroids fit in the treatment pathway. Then, I should verify the strength and limits of evidence for short-term versus long-term benefits. Next, I will examine safety and technique, especially guidance and dosing. After that, I should compare corticosteroids with PRP, ESWT, and exercise-based interventions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and note special populations and uncertainties that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and guideline positioning, because I need to ensure I'm not overpromising on injections as first-line therapy. Plantar fasciitis is common and often self-limited, and first-line care remains conservative with stretching, activity modification, footwear/orthoses, NSAIDs, and night splints; corticosteroid injection is generally reserved after a trial of conservative therapy or when pain is severe and function-limiting, with AAFP and ACFAS suggesting consideration for short-term relief rather than as routine first-line therapy [^1175KZzD] [^117PsVev] [^116sXxzw].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and durability of benefit, because patients often ask "how much relief and for how long". The best-quality synthesis, the 2017 Cochrane review, found low-quality evidence for a small short-term pain reduction at less than 1 month (about 6 points on a 0–100 VAS), with no clinically meaningful benefit beyond 1 month and very low-quality evidence for other outcomes; a high-quality RCT using ultrasound-guided dexamethasone showed a roughly 11-point pain reduction at 4 weeks versus placebo, with no significant advantage thereafter, reinforcing a transient benefit window [^1162gKrT] [^114nNQXv].

> Hold on, I should double-check safety before recommending any injection. Serious adverse events are uncommon but consequential, including plantar fascia rupture and fat pad atrophy. Nerve injury has also been reported, and underreporting is suspected in trials, so I need to counsel on these risks explicitly and avoid repeated injections that could compound tissue harm. A posterior tibial nerve block can mitigate injection pain but does not change the underlying risk profile of corticosteroid exposure [^1162gKrT] [^115ENekK] [^112E2nF9].

> I need to check technique next, because accuracy likely affects both efficacy and safety. Ultrasound guidance improves placement accuracy and is associated with better short-term outcomes than palpation-guided injection in meta-analytic data, and contemporary interventional pain guidelines recommend US guidance for small-joint and foot injections when feasible; dosing commonly uses 20–40 mg triamcinolone or methylprednisolone equivalents, often mixed with local anesthetic, with the understanding that higher cumulative doses increase complication risk [^113UiQVq] [^116PRmKi].

> Let me consider comparative effectiveness, especially versus PRP, because many patients ask which injection is "better". Multiple meta-analyses suggest PRP and corticosteroids have similar short-term pain relief, but PRP shows superior pain and function at 3–6 months and possibly longer in several analyses; however, heterogeneity is high, PRP protocols vary, and some trials show no long-term difference, so I should frame PRP as having a plausible medium-term advantage with evolving evidence rather than a definitive superiority claim [^116y2oCP] [^111QkvHm] [^112hmeHy].

> Next, I should review ESWT, since it is a noninvasive alternative often offered when injections are undesirable. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate ESWT yields better medium-term pain and function than corticosteroid injection at around 3–6 months, with favorable safety profiles, making it a reasonable option particularly for patients prioritizing noninvasive care or those at higher risk for injection complications [^116tVDhZ] [^115X47wq].

> But wait, what about exercise-based care alone or combined with injection? I should confirm whether adding a steroid to exercise adds value. A Danish RCT found that combining corticosteroid injection with structured strength and stretching outperformed either modality alone at 6 months, suggesting synergy when load management and progressive loading are enforced; conversely, a more recent randomized trial found that adding a single ultrasound-guided steroid injection to exercise and advice produced only small, statistically detectable but not clinically meaningful differences versus advice and exercise, highlighting that single-injection strategies may not augment outcomes meaningfully in all settings [^111QPRiU] [^11789j79].

> I should confirm special populations and modifiers of expected response. In obese patients, a small RCT suggested corticosteroid outperformed PRP at 24 weeks, contradicting the general trend seen in non-obese cohorts; this is hypothesis-generating and should be interpreted cautiously given small samples and potential confounding, but it nudges me to individualize injection choice by phenotype and goals [^111p6SzR].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation, and I will now examine whether it aligns with guidelines and the highest-quality trials. For patients with persistent, function-limiting plantar fasciitis after an adequate trial of conservative therapy, a single ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection can provide modest, short-lived pain relief that may facilitate participation in rehabilitation, but it should not be expected to change long-term outcomes; if medium-term durability is prioritized, PRP or ESWT are reasonable alternatives, and exercise-based programs remain foundational regardless of injection choice; I should explicitly counsel on rupture and fat pad atrophy risks and avoid repeat injections unless benefits clearly outweigh harms [^1175KZzD] [^1162gKrT] [^114nNQXv] [^116tVDhZ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that combining injection with exercise is universally superior. I should correct that to "may be superior in some protocols", because the Danish trial used repeated injections and strict load control, whereas a recent three-arm trial found no clinically meaningful advantage of adding a single injection to exercise and advice, underscoring that protocol details and adherence to load management likely drive outcomes and that we should avoid overgeneralizing [^111QPRiU] [^11789j79].

> Finally, I need to ensure shared decision-making captures uncertainties: evidence quality for injections is low to moderate, PRP evidence remains heterogeneous, and natural history favors improvement for many patients over 6–12 months. Therefore, aligning the intervention with patient goals (rapid short-term relief versus sustained medium-term benefit), comorbidities, activity demands, and tolerance for procedural risks is essential, and we should revisit expectations at 4–6 weeks to reassess trajectory and pivot if benefits are not realized [^1162gKrT] [^115X47wq] [^113hxLb8].

Steroid injections are effective for **short-term pain relief** in plantar fasciitis, with benefits peaking at 4–6 weeks and diminishing by 3–6 months [^114nNQXv] [^1162gKrT]. They are best reserved for **refractory cases after 3–6 months of conservative care**, and repeated injections increase the risk of plantar fascia rupture and fat pad atrophy [^113QHc6Y]. Ultrasound guidance improves accuracy and may reduce complications, but **does not extend benefit beyond 3–6 months** [^113UiQVq] [^114nNQXv]. For longer-term relief, consider PRP or ESWT, which outperform steroids at 6–12 months [^116y2oCP] [^116tVDhZ].

---

## Clinical evidence for steroid injections

### Short-term efficacy

Short-term efficacy includes a **significant reduction in pain at 4–6 weeks**, with a mean difference of about 10 points on a 100-point VAS in high-quality RCTs [^114nNQXv]. However, **no sustained benefit** is observed beyond 3–6 months, with effects diminishing thereafter [^1162gKrT].

---

### Long-term efficacy

Long-term efficacy is **limited**, with **no significant benefit** beyond 3–6 months and **no superiority** over placebo or conservative care at 6–12 months [^1162gKrT] [^11789j79].

---

## Comparison with other treatments

| **Treatment** | **Short-term efficacy (≤ 3 months)** | **Long-term efficacy (≥ 6 months)** | **Safety profile** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Steroid injection | Effective | Limited | Risk of rupture, atrophy, infection |
| PRP injection | Similar to steroid | Superior to steroid | Minimal, transient pain |
| ESWT | Similar to steroid | Superior to steroid | Minimal, transient pain |
| Conservative care | Effective | Effective | Minimal |

---

Steroids provide **short-term relief** but are inferior to PRP and ESWT for **long-term outcomes** [^116y2oCP].

---

## Safety and complications

- **Plantar fascia rupture**: Rare but serious; risk rises with repeated injections [^113QHc6Y].
- **Fat pad atrophy**: Can cause chronic heel pain and altered biomechanics [^notfound].
- **Infection**: Rare but possible [^1162gKrT].
- **Transient pain increase**: Common immediately post-injection [^notfound].

---

## Patient selection criteria

Steroid injections are appropriate for:

- **Refractory cases**: Persistent pain after 3–6 months of conservative therapy [^notfound].
- **Severe pain**: Limiting function or causing significant disability [^112w7HoN].
- **Short-term relief**: Needed for rapid symptom control (e.g. athletes, acute cases) [^1162gKrT].

---

## Injection technique and guidance

Ultrasound guidance **improves accuracy**, reduces complications, and may enhance short-term outcomes compared with landmark-based injection [^113UiQVq] [^112L2h8s]. Deep injection (beneath the fascia) may yield greater pain and thickness reduction than superficial injection [^114ypPQE].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend steroid injections for **short-term relief** in refractory cases, but not as first-line therapy; they also advise limiting injections to **minimize complications** [^1175KZzD] [^111QDiRD].

---

## Alternative treatments

- **PRP**: Superior to steroids at 6–12 months; similar short-term relief [^116y2oCP].
- **ESWT**: Superior to steroids at 6–12 months; noninvasive [^notfound].
- **Conservative care**: Stretching, orthotics, night splints, NSAIDs remain first-line [^notfound].

---

Steroid injections offer **short-term pain relief** for plantar fasciitis but have limited long-term benefit and meaningful complication risks. Use after conservative failure, prefer ultrasound guidance, and limit repeats; for durable relief, consider PRP or ESWT [^1162gKrT] [^116y2oCP] [^116tVDhZ].

### Heel pain-plantar fasciitis: revision 2023 [^115X47wq]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Plantar fasciitis — ESWT, CSI, and PRP: ESWT is a noninvasive treatment that attempts to use direct mechanical forces to promote tissue healing, and a meta-analysis found that ESWT was effective in the medium and long term in decreasing pain when compared to control interventions. Reviews of corticosteroid injection (CSI) have conflicting conclusions; a comprehensive network meta-analysis found some evidence that CSIs alone or with exercise and ESWT may improve short-, medium-, and long-term pain or function, but estimates varied widely, and there is also some evidence that platelet-rich plasma (PRP) can be effective in short-term pain reduction compared to control interventions. For medium-term outcomes, ESWT decreased pain compared to CSI, but no difference was found among these 3 treatments in short- and long-term pain control. A Cochrane review noted low-quality evidence supporting CSI and that although serious adverse events were rare, these were underreported and a higher risk cannot be ruled out; potential adverse effects after CSI included postinjection steroid-induced increase in pain, fat pad atrophy, nerve injury, and rupture of the plantar fascia.

### The role of ultrasonography in the diagnosis and management of idiopathic plantar fasciitis [^114uKSc5]. Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare ultrasonography with bone scintigraphy in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis and to compare ultrasound-guided injection with palpation-guided injection in the management of idiopathic plantar fasciitis.

Methods

Twenty-three patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic plantar fasciitis in 28 heels underwent ultrasonography and bone scintigraphy of both heels at baseline. The patients were randomized to ultrasound- or palpation-guided injection of triamcinolone hexacetonide and xylocaine into the plantar fascia. The 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain, the heel tenderness index (HTI), and ultrasonography were performed at baseline and follow-up (mean = 13.4 weeks).

Results

The mean thickness (± standard error of the mean) of the plantar fascia, measured by ultrasonography, was 5.7 ± 0.3 mm in symptomatic heels as compared with 3.8 ± 0.2 mm in asymptomatic heels (P < 0.001). Ultrasonography findings correlated with bone scintigraphic findings in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis (P < 0.001). Fourteen heels were randomized to ultrasound-guided injection, 10 heels were randomized to palpation-guided injection and four heels were not injected. Ultrasound- and palpation-guided injection resulted in significant mean improvements in VAS [39.6 ± 9.2 (ultrasound) vs 41.5 ± 8 (palpation)] and HTI [1.35 ± 0.2 (ultrasound) vs 1.3 ± 0.4 (palpation)]. There was no significant difference in the response rate following corticosteroid injection by either modality (ultrasound = 13/14, palpation = 8/10). Following injection, the mean thickness of the plantar fascia decreased from 5.7 ± 0.3 mm to 4.65 ± 0.4 mm (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

Ultrasonography and bone scintigraphy are equally effective in the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis. Ultrasound-guided injection is effective in the management of plantar fasciitis but is not more effective than palpation-guided injection. Ultrasonography may be used as an objective measure of response to treatment in plantar fasciitis.

### Shall we inject superficial or deep to the plantar fascia? An ultrasound study of the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis [^114ypPQE]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

We compared the effectiveness of ultrasound (US)-guided corticosteroid, injected superficial or deep to the fascia, in patients with plantar fasciitis. Thirty patients (24 females [75%] and 6 males [25%]) with unilateral chronic plantar fasciitis were divided into 2 groups according to the corticosteroid injection site: superficial (n = 15) or deep (n = 15) to the plantar fascia. Patient heel pain was measured using a Likert pain scale and the Foot Ankle Outcome Scale (FAOS) for foot disability, evaluated at baseline and repeated in the first and sixth weeks. The plantar fascia and heel pad thicknesses were assessed on US scans at baseline and the sixth week. The groups were similar in age, gender, and body mass index (p > .05 for all). Compared with the baseline values, the Likert pain scale (p < .001 for all) and FAOS subscale (p < .01 for all) scores had improved at the first and sixth week follow-up visits in both groups. Although the plantar fascia thickness had decreased significantly in both groups at the sixth week (p < .001 for both), the heel pad thickness remained unchanged (p > .05 for both). The difference in the FAOS subscales (pain, p = .002; activities of daily living, p = .003; sports/recreational activities, p = .008; quality of life, p = .009) and plantar fascia thickness (p = .049) showed better improvement in the deep than in the superficial injection group. US-guided corticosteroid injections are safe and effective in the short-term therapeutic outcome of chronic plantar fasciitis. Additionally, injection of corticosteroid deep to the fascia might result in greater reduction in plantar fascia thickness, pain, and disability and improved foot-related quality of life.

### Management of plantar heel pain: a best practice guide informed by a systematic review, expert clinical reasoning and patient values [^112UW191]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroid and platelet-rich plasma injection therapy was very carefully assessed, both in the trials and the semi-structured interviews as this is a commonly used intervention. Interestingly, although injection therapy using steroid or platelet-rich plasma is readily amenable to placebo or sham administration, no such RCTs have been performed. It was judged that insertion of a needle with no subsequent drug injection into the plantar fascia could not be considered a no-treatment placebo, as it was likely to have an effect given the findings of Cotchett et al with dry needling. Furthermore, injection of any drug or saline would also have chemical and physical effects, which could lead to confounded RCT results. This is an intervention for which placebo control is readily achievable and represents a priority for future research — perhaps in patients where ESWT has failed to yield optimal results.

Resistance exercises of the affected area and limb are often effective as part of first-line care for chronic musculoskeletal problems such as osteoarthritis of the hip or knee and common tendinopathies. While there is moderate evidence for stretching the plantar fascia, our stringent systematic review could not identify evidence in favour of more comprehensive exercise approaches. Furthermore, the expert interviews did not provide a theme on hidden efficacy and was divided on whether such resistance exercises are useful or not (online supplemental file 1). Trials currently in development may clarify this issue in the future.

Agreement between SR, expert interviews and patient survey

Information obtained from the three methods used to formulate the BPG was generally consistent. For example, the need for positivity when discussing prognosis was expressed by experts and mirrored in the patient survey responses. Furthermore, there was strong agreement between the patient survey findings and the content of the core intervention while expert interviews and the SR were in agreement about the efficacy of the various interventions. The agreement was also good where the SR evidence was unclear. For example, there is an absence of high-quality trials of progressive strengthening while the expert interviews showed very divergent views on likely efficacy.

### The diagnosis and treatment of heel pain: a clinical practice guideline-revision 2010 [^115J6qtB]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Medium credibility.

Plantar heel pain initial (tier 1) management — evidence-based medicine (EBM) conclusions cite Padding and strapping of the foot [Grade B recommendation], Therapeutic orthotic insoles [Grade B recommendation], Cortisone injections [Grade B recommendation], and Achilles and plantar fascia stretching [Grade B recommendation]. Initial treatments include regular Achilles and plantar fascia stretching, avoidance of flat shoes and barefoot walking, cryotherapy applied directly to the affected part, over-the-counter arch supports and heel cups, and limitation of extended (high-impact) physical activities, and patients usually have a clinical response within 6 weeks of initiation of treatment; if little or no improvement is noted, the patient should be referred to a foot and ankle surgeon if not already under this specialist's care.

### Efficacy of extracorporeal shockwave therapy, compared to corticosteroid injections, on pain, plantar fascia thickness and foot function in patients with plantar fasciitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116tVDhZ]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of extracorporeal shock waves versus corticosteroids injections on pain, thickness of plantar fascia and foot function in patients with plantar fasciitis. Secondarily, to assess the efficacy of radial and focused extracorporeal shock waves and the most appropriated intensity (high, medium or low).

Data Sources

PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL and PEDro, until April 2024, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

Review Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of extracorporeal shock waves versus corticosteroids injections on pain intensity and sensitivity, thickness of plantar fascia and foot function in patients with plantar fasciitis. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed using PEDro Scale and Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Pooled effect was calculated using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and its 95% confidence interval (95%CI).

Results

Sixteen studies involving 1121 patients, showing a mean of 6 points in PEDro scale, were included. At three months, extracorporeal shock waves were better than corticosteroids injections in reducing pain (SMD -0.6; 95%CI -1.1 to -0.11) and thickness of the plantar fascia (SMD -0.4; 95%CI -0.8 to -0.01) and increasing foot function (SMD 0.27; 95%CI 0.12–0.44). At six months, extracorporeal shock waves are more effective in reducing pain (SMD -0.81; 95%CI -1.6 to -0.06) and increasing foot function (SMD 0.67; 95%CI 0.45–0.89). Local pain and slight erythema were the most frequent adverse events.

Conclusions

Extracorporeal shock waves are a safe therapy, presenting more efficacy than corticosteroids injections in improving pain, thickness of plantar fascia and foot function at mid-term.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on regenerative medicine treatment for chronic pain: a consensus report from a multispecialty working group [^112w7HoN]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Plantar Fasciitis

Plantar fasciitis (PF) presents with stiffness and pain near the medial tuberosity of the calcaneus that is typically worse when initiating walking. In the majority of cases, symptoms resolve with conservative management. For recalcitrant PF, local interventions such as extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) or injections have been utilized. CSI is commonly administered to manage severe pain associated with PF. However, several trials and meta-analyses have found them to offer similar analgesia to dry needling and inferior analgesia to alternatives such as ESWT and PRP.CSI has also been associated with an increased risk of plantar fascia rupture. Meta-analyses have demonstrated low-quality evidence supporting the superiority of dextrose prolotherapy to placebo, although there was moderate-quality evidence of its inferiority to other modalities such as CSI for PF. Similarly, a series of five HA injections alleviated PF pain more than placebo at 5 weeks in another RCT, although additional studies are warranted to confirm this effect.

Most RCTs generally support that PRP injections were superior to placebo and CSI for pain relief and functional outcomes over 6 to 24 months. Some RCTs with shorter follow-up and lack of sham controls reported comparable outcomes to CSI in the early study phase, which may be confounded by anesthetic or placebo effect. Despite the heterogeneity and inconsistent blinding in these studies, multiple meta-analyses have reiterated that PRP is superior to CSI by 6 months for PF.

Two RCTs reported significant improvements in pain and function with injection of human amniotic/chorionic membrane (HACM) versus sham injections for PF up to 3 months, while a pilot RCT demonstrated comparable outcomes to CSI over 12 weeks. A meta-analysis comparing different injections for PF found HACM likely to be superior to placebo, although this warrants further study.

Consensus Point 9. There is low-quality evidence supporting superiority of dextrose prolotherapy compared to placebo for plantar fasciitis, although moderate-quality evidence suggests that it is inferior to corticosteroid injections. Therefore, prolotherapy is not the first recommended injection option for plantar fasciitis (Level I, Grade C).

Consensus Point 10. There is consistent evidence supporting that PRP injections for plantar fasciitis are associated with superior analgesia and physical function compared to placebo and corticosteroid injections over the long-term (6 to 24 months), although outcomes may be comparable in the short-term (Level I, Grade B).

### Posterior tibial nerve block for the treatment of plantar fasciitis in the emergency department [^112E2nF9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Plantar fasciitis (PF) is a common, painful condition for which patients sometimes seek treatment in the emergency department. Although corticosteroid injections are helpful for PF, they are painful.

Discussion

A posterior tibial nerve block provides immediate pain relief and allows the physician to also perform a corticosteroid injection into the heel, which could provide up to 1 month of analgesia.

Conclusions

Patients may not have to wait until an appointment with a specialist to begin experiencing analgesia for PF.

### Ultrasound-guided injection of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid versus corticosteroid in management of plantar fasciitis: a 24-week randomized clinical trial [^1151M1k6]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Randomization and Patients' Enrolment

A computer‑generated block randomization method was used to assign participants with a 1:1 ratio to both groups. It was presumed that participants were distributed almost equally with respect to gender and age in both intervention and positive control groups.

Group 1. (HA) A syringe containing 20 mg in 1 mL high-molecular-weight HA (> 2000 kDa) with 2% concentration of non-animal origin (Viscor ®; Nikan Teb Kimia Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Tehran, Iran) and 1 mL Lidocaine 2% for a total of 2 mL volume in one syringe was used in this study.

Group 2. (CS) The patients in this group receive 40 mg in 1 mL methylprednisolone acetate (methylprednisolone acetate, 40 mg/mL vial, DEPO-MEDROL ®, PFIZER) and 1 mL Lidocaine 2% for a total of 2 mL volume in one syringe.

Although CS and HA were filled in same shaped prefilled syringes, because of the physical differences (viscosity of the solution) between treatments, accidental unblinding of the injector would be unpredictable; hence, we decided not to include the physician who did the injections in the investigation team, and effective blinding of the assessment physician was achieved by the physical separation of the injecting and assessment department and by document control protocols. Patients and the physicians performing the assessments were blinded to the groups. Every prefilled syringe placed in a sealed envelope by a nurse to cover the turbidity of the CS suspension.

### Heel pain-plantar fasciitis: revision 2023 [^113o2Y1a]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Heel pain–plantar fasciitis clinical practice guideline (2023) scope and evidence sources emphasize that the primary intent was to focus on updating recommendations for interventions to be used in physical therapist practice; the body of research identified 64 meta-analyses and 126 systematic reviews (SRs) that have been published after the search date of 12/31/2012 for the prior 2014 CPG revision; this CPG excludes interventions outside the scope of physical therapist practice, including but not limited to pharmacological and surgical interventions, unless directly compared to PT management; and although used by some physical therapists outside the United States, extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) was considered outside the scope, with a scoping review and summary presented for ESWT, as well as corticosteroid injection (CSI) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection, because they are frequently prescribed as conservative interventions and may be of interest for consideration in patients who are not benefiting from PT.

### The addition of a tension night splint to a structured home rehabilitation programme in patients with chronic plantar fasciitis does not lead to significant additional benefits in either pain, function or flexibility: a single-blinded randomised controlled trial [^113hxLb8]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Most patients with plantar fasciitis will improve within 12 months, but at least 10% may go on to develop persisting symptoms. There is evidence of benefit from treatment with various low-risk conservative therapies including rest/activity modification, stretches and/or taping, insoles/orthoticsand possibly some evidence for the use of tension night splints (TNS) although this remains uncertain.

Corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injections are often used in patients with plantar fasciitis, and a variety of differing techniques and broad outcome figures for success rates are reported in the literature; however, some papers report a plantar fascia rupture rate of up to 10% indicating that some caution may be needed. If these measures prove unsuccessful, then a range of more invasive options have been suggested including extracorporeal shockwave therapy, autologous blood injectionsor surgery. However, comparing outcomes from these different options is often difficult due to the heterogeneity of patient populations, treatment interventions and follow-up, and many of these have not been subject to rigorously designed investigation.

### Injection therapies for plantar fasciopathy (' plantar fasciitis'): a systematic review and network meta-analysis of 22 randomised controlled trials [^111v4zwt]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of different injection therapies for plantar fasciopathy (historically known as 'plantar fasciitis').

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Electronic databases (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Web of Science and Scopus) were searched up to 11 July 2015 for completed studies.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

We considered randomised trials comparing various injection therapies in adults with plantar fasciopathy. The primary outcome was pain relief. Secondary outcomes included functional disability, composite and health-related outcomes. All outcomes were assessed (1) in the short term (up to 2months), (2) the intermediate term (2–6months) and (3) the medium term (more than 6months to 2years). Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.

Results

We included 22 trials comprising 1216 patients. Dehydrated amniotic membrane injections were significantly superior to corticosteroids in the short term in achieving the primary and composite outcomes (mean difference (MD) in visual analogue scale (VAS) was -7.32, 95% CIs -11.2 to -3.38; and MD in the foot health status questionnaire was 31.2, 95% CIs 13.9 to 48.6, respectively). For pain relief, botulinum toxin-A provided a significant short-term advantage over placebo, which was still present at 6months (MD in VAS was -2.9, 95% CIs -4.44 to -1.39; and MD -4.34, 95% CIs -7.18 to -1.54, respectively).

Summary

Although the dehydrated amniotic membrane provided significant clinical relief at 0–2months, there were no data about this treatment at 2months and beyond. Botulinum toxin-A injections significantly reduced pain intensity at 0–6months.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroids in the treatment of plantar fasciitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113QHc6Y]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Typically, the first line of treatment for plantar fasciitis is nonsurgical, involving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, orthotics, and physical therapy. For patients who do not respond to these interventions, different types of injections are available. The current standard for local injection therapies includes corticosteroid (CS) injections, which provide short-term pain relief in approximately 70%–80% of patients. The effects generally last between 4 and 12 wks, with the greatest relief observed around 4 wks after injection. In most cases, a single injection is sufficient to achieve significant pain reduction. However, in refractory cases, up to three injections may be administered, although this increases the risk of complications. These complications may include plantar fascia rupture, infection, skin pigmentation changes, muscle damage, and fat pad atrophy. Although many patients experience partial improvement, the benefits tend to diminish over time, and full resolution of symptoms is not guaranteed. – In recent years, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections have gained prominence in the treatment of plantar fasciitis by leveraging the regenerative potential of platelets and leukocytes.PRP releases a concentrated array of growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor beta, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), all of which are pivotal in tissue repair and regeneration. These growth factors enhance cellular proliferation, stimulate collagen synthesis, and promote angiogenesis, which are critical for the restoration of damaged plantar fascia. Moreover, the leukocytes in PRP contribute to its antimicrobial properties, reducing the risk of infection and further supporting the healing process. This multifaceted approach positions PRP as a promising therapeutic option, particularly for patients who have not responded adequately to conventional treatments.

### Prolotherapy versus phonophoresis and corticosteroid injections for the treatment of plantar fasciitis: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial [^114kpYit]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of prolotherapy with phonophoresis and steroid injection in patients with plantar fasciitis (PF). One hundred forty-six patients with PF were randomly divided into prolotherapy, phonophoresis, and injection groups. The treatment method to be applied to them was determined by drawing lots of equal numbers of papers with "Prolotherapy", "Corticosteroid", and "Phonophoress" written on it among those who accepted to be treated. Patients were evaluated using heel sensitivity index (HSI), visual analog scale (VAS), foot function index (FFI), and Short Form (SF)-36 at baseline, first and third months after the therapy. Plantar fascia thickness (PFT) was measured by ultrasonography (USG) at baseline, first and third months after the therapy. Statistically significant improvements were found in all parameters at 1 and 3 months after treatment in all groups (p < .05). There was no significant difference between VAS and FFI scores between the 3 groups (p > .05). Improvement in the HSI (p = .021) and SF-36 general health (GH) subscales at the third month after treatment in the prolotherapy group was significantly better at the first and third months compared to the other groups (p = .033 and p < .01). No complications were observed in any of the patients. Our study results suggest that prolotherapy, phonophoresis, and steroid injection are beneficial as safe treatment modalities in the early period of PF treatment. The improvement of HSI and SF-36 GH subscale lasts longer with prolotherapy, but ultrasonographic findings do not change in the third month of these treatment applications.

### Injected corticosteroids for plantar heel pain… [^114QAkTg]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Do corticosteroid injections improve plantar heel pain. Evidence-Based Answer There is low-quality evidence that corticosteroid injections slightly reduce heel pain at one month, but they make no significant difference beyond that time. Patients treated with corticosteroid injections were less likely to experience treatment failure — a designation that was defined differently between studies. Injections do not appear to provide any functional benefits.

1. 3 Plantar fasciopathy is common in runners, with an incidence of 31% over five years in one study. 4 The authors of this review sought to evaluate the effect of corticosteroid injections on plantar heel pain in adults. 1 This Cochrane review included 39 randomized trials with 2, 492 adults who had plantar heel pain.

Between one and six months, corticosteroid injections had no significant pain benefit. Two studies evaluated function, although neither revealed benefit at any time during follow-up. Three very-low-quality studies with a total of 363 patients evaluated treatment failure, defined as persistent pain at eight weeks, the need for repeat treatment at 12 weeks, or no pain relief at six months. Treatment failure was significantly reduced by corticosteroid injections. This review also included comparisons between corticosteroid injections and 15 other interventions. No useful comparisons could be made because of the small sample sizes for the different interventions. Types and doses of corticosteroid varied between studies, with two studies not reporting the corticosteroid used. Injections generally included local anesthetic.

Adverse effects included postinjection pain, injection-site infection, and, rarely, rupture of the plantar fascia. A network systematic review published in 2016 included some of the studies from this Cochrane review and determined that corticosteroid injections significantly improved pain over placebo at two months, but showed no difference at six months after treatment. 5 Guidelines from the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons from 2010 recommend corticosteroid injections as a first-tier intervention, along with weight loss, padding or strapping, orthotics, anti-inflammatory medication, and patient-directed Achilles and plantar fascia stretching. 6.

### Ultrasound-guided injection of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid versus corticosteroid in management of plantar fasciitis: a 24-week randomized clinical trial [^115cA1Xk]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Plantar fasciitis (PF) is the leading cause of heel pain in adults. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of hyaluronic acid (HA) injection in reducing the symptoms of PF, compared with corticosteroid (CS) injection as a conventional treatment.

Methods

In this triple-blind, randomized, clinical trial, 75 patients who had the symptoms of PF for at least 3 months were randomly divided into two groups of 38 and 37 individuals. Then, each patient received either a single injection of high molecular weight (> 2000 kDa) HA (1 mL HA 20 mg + 1 mL lidocaine 2%) or CS (1 mL methylprednisolone 40 mg + 1 mL lidocaine 2%) under the ultrasonography (US) guidance. Visual analog scale (VAS), foot ankle ability index (FAAI), pressure pain threshold (PPT), functional foot index (FFI), and plantar fascia thickness (PFT) were measured using US at baseline, 6 weeks and 24 weeks after the injection. Eventually, at the end of the treatment period, the patients' satisfaction was measured. Intention to treat analysis was used to assess the results.

Results

After 24 weeks of follow-up, results from 60 subjects were fully obtained; however, results of 73 patients included into intention to treat analysis in the sixth-week follow-up. In both groups, VAS, PFT and FFI decreased, while FAAI and PPT increased significantly (P < 0.001). At the baseline and at the 24th-week, no significant difference between the two groups was observed in any of the variables. However, a comparison between the baseline and the sixth-week results shows a prominent decrease in PPT and PFT in the CS group compared to the HA group (P = 0.004 and P = 0.011). Finally, there were no statistical differences between the two groups in treatment satisfaction (P = 0.618).

Conclusion

Both CS and HA were effective modalities for PF and can improve pain and function with no superiority in 24th-week follow-ups, although CS seems to have a faster trend of improvement in the short term.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroids in the treatment of plantar fasciitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115L5xsa]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Common adverse reactions following CS injections primarily include local infections and heel fat pad atrophy, with repeated injections potentially leading to plantar fascia rupture. In contrast, the primary adverse effect associated with PRP injections is pain, which typically lasts from a few hours to 3 days and generally does not result in long-term complications. This pain is largely due to the inhibition of platelet aggregation and reduced growth factor release when PRP is mixed with anesthetics such as lidocaine. Consequently, PRP is usually administered without anesthetics, leading to significant discomfort. Additionally, PRP-induced pain may be linked to proinflammatory substances released by leukocytes and residual red blood cells in the preparation. In contrast, CSs are almost always combined with anesthetics like lidocaine to minimize immediate postinjection pain. The short-term pain associated with PRP injections can restrict patient mobility, potentially requiring assistance after treatment, which negatively impacts the overall patient experience and acceptance of PRP therapy. Therefore, further research is necessary to elucidate the mechanisms underlying PRP-induced pain and to develop strategies for its mitigation.

Future studies require more stringent RCTs to compare the long-term efficacy of PRP and steroid treatments for plantar fasciitis. Currently, there is no standardized protocol for PRP treatment of plantar fasciitis, and the preparation of PRP lacks uniform standards, leading to significant variability. Almost no trials report on the concentration of platelets, yet this concentration is crucial to PRP's effectiveness. Some studies suggest that the number of growth factor receptors varies across different tissue types, implying that too low a concentration of platelets might not provide enough growth factors, affecting therapeutic outcomes. Conversely, too high a concentration might lead to adverse effects, such as cell apoptosis, receptor desensitization, and downregulation of growth factor receptors, potentially inhibiting the therapeutic effect. Thus, the appropriate concentration of platelets for PRP treatment of plantar fasciitis requires further exploration. Additionally, while each injection is typically 2–3 ml, whether multiple injections are more effective than a single injection needs investigation. Steroids are limited to single injections due to the risk of plantar fascia rupture with multiple injections, whereas PRP, aside from causing temporary pain after injection, has not shown other side effects, suggesting that a multiple-injection regimen could be considered. However, whether multiple injections can enhance the effect and the optimal interval between injections still need further study. Two studies chose to activate PRP with calcium chlorideor calcium gluconatebefore injection, while others did not use an activator, indicating that the use of activators also requires more research.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroids in the treatment of plantar fasciitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117WHYAb]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Data Extraction

Two independent researchers meticulously screened all the studies included in the meta-analysis, extracting data in accordance with the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The demographic and clinical characteristics extracted for the meta-analysis included the first author, year of publication, country of origin, study design, sample size per study, gender distribution (male/female ratio), average age of participants, detailed descriptions of the interventions (specifically PRP and steroid treatments), injection guidance, defined outcome measures, and the duration of follow-up. In cases where trials featured more than two intervention groups, data were specifically extracted from the groups receiving PRP and steroid interventions only. All extracted data were systematically entered into a digital spreadsheet for analysis. Any discrepancies encountered during this process were resolved through discussion, with a consensus reached through the involvement of a third researcher when necessary.

Assessment of Methodological Quality

Two independent reviewers evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2 (RoB 2). This tool is organized into the following five distinct domains of bias: bias arising from the randomization process, bias due to deviations from intended interventions, bias due to missing outcome data, bias in the measurement of the outcome, and bias in the selection of the reported result. This comprehensive approach ensures a thorough assessment of potential biases within each study.

Statistical Analysis

The statistical analysis of our meta-analysis was independently conducted using Stata 16.0 by two researchers. We calculated the weighted mean difference (WMD) between the PRP and steroid groups, reporting these differences along with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). This approach was applied to evaluate continuous variables. The I² statistic was used as an objective measure to assess heterogeneity across studies. When the I² value exceeded 50%, indicating significant heterogeneity, we employed a random-effects model. Conversely, a fixed-effects model was used in instances of low heterogeneity (I² ≤ 50%). Sensitivity analysis was conducted for I² statistics greater than 50%. Forest plots were generated to visually depict the comparative outcomes between PRP and steroid groups across all included studies. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered indicative of statistical significance.

### Effectiveness of trigger point dry needling for plantar heel pain: a meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials [^115tpnZ3]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of interior heel pain and affects approximately 10% of the general population. It is characterized by heel pain and tenderness centered on the medial tubercle of the calcaneus on weight bearing, especially immediately after rest, such as getting out of bed in the morning. Although plantar fasciitis is regarded as a self-limiting disease, it can take up to months or even years to recover.

The etiology of plantar fasciitis is still unclear. Simons et alproposed that the presence of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) within the plantar intrinsic foot musculature and muscles proximal to the foot might play an important role in plantar heel pain. MTrPs have been defined as hyperirritable points located in taut bands of skeletal muscle or fascia. The spot is tender when pressed and can give rise to characteristic referred pain, motor dysfunction, and autonomic phenomena.

Current conventional treatments include rest, administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, foot taping, physical therapy, stretch exercise, and steroid injection. Steroid injection is one of the most popular methods used in this condition, and it has been reported to be effective in the short term; however, it may lead to serious adverse events such as a recognized risk of subsequent plantar fascia rupture. Dry needling and acupuncture are increasingly being used to treat heel pain, as well as many other musculoskeletal pain conditions.

Dry needling and acupuncture are alternative and less-invasive procedures, which stimulate the MTrPs. It has been reported that dry needling can alter the biochemical environment surrounding an MTrP and reduce spontaneous electrical activity within the MTrP regions of skeletal muscle. Moreover, this method is safe with minimal side effects when treating chronic pains. Several studies have assessed the effects of MTrP dry needling in the treatment of plantar heel pain. However, their results remain controversial. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to assess the effects of MTrP dry needling in patients with heel pain due to plantar fasciitis.

### Effectiveness of four different treatment modalities in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis during a 36-month follow-up period: a randomized controlled trial [^116Xmbg3]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

No consensus has been reached about the best treatment method of plantar fasciitis and the results of the treatment methods have been inconsistent. The objective of the present study was to compare the therapeutic effects of extracorporeal shock wave therapy, platelet-rich plasma injection, local corticosteroid injection, and prolotherapy for the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis using a randomized, controlled, prospective study. We performed a randomized controlled prospective clinical study of 4 groups. The first group received extracorporeal shock wave therapy, the second group received prolotherapy, the third group received platelet-rich plasma injection, and the fourth group received a local corticosteroid injection. The study included 158 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of chronic plantar fasciitis with a symptomatic heel spur. The clinical outcomes were assessed using the visual analog scale and Revised Foot Function Index. At the end of the follow-up period, the mean visual analog scale scores for all 4 groups were similar to the mean visual analog scale scores before treatment. At the end of the follow-up period, no significant improvement was noted in the Revised Foot Function Index score in any of the groups. The corticosteroid injection was more effective in the first 3 months and extracorporeal shock wave therapy was an effective treatment method in the first 6 months in regard to pain. The corticosteroid injection lost its effectiveness during the follow-up period. The effect of prolotherapy and platelet-rich plasma was seen within 3 to 12 months; however, at the 36-month follow-up point, no differences were found among the 4 treatments.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroids in the treatment of plantar fasciitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111QkvHm]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aims to compare the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma and corticosteroids in treating plantar fasciitis, focusing on pain relief, foot function, and plantar fascia thickness to identify the optimal treatment approach.

Design

A comprehensive search of medical databases was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, utilizing an extensive keyword strategy. Inclusion criteria encompassed prospective randomized controlled trials involving adult patients with plantar fasciitis treated with local platelet-rich plasma or corticosteroid injections, specifically assessing outcomes such as the visual analog scale, American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society scores, and plantar fascia thickness.

Results

The meta-analysis included 24 randomized controlled trials with 1653 participants. Platelet-rich plasma injections yielded significantly better visual analog scale scores compared to corticosteroid injections at 3 mos (P = 0.03) and 6 mos (P < 0.001), with no significant differences at 1 mo (P = 0.12) and 12 mos (P = 0.08). American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society scores demonstrated that platelet-rich plasma was superior to corticosteroid at 3 (P = 0.05), 6 (P < 0.001), and 12 mos (P < 0.001), with no significant differences at 1 mo (P = 0.31). Regarding plantar fascia thickness, there were no significant differences between platelet-rich plasma and corticosteroid at 1–1.5 mos (P = 0.18), 3 mos (P = 0.64), and 6 mos (P = 0.05).

Conclusions

Platelet-rich plasma injections offer superior pain control compared to corticosteroids in the medium term (3–6 mos) but not in the short term or at 1 yr.

### Does a corticosteroid injection plus exercise or exercise alone add to the effect of patient advice and a heel cup for patients with plantar fasciopathy? A randomised clinical trial [^115sfQy9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Patient and public involvement

The patient advice used was based on the results of semistructured interviews with both patients and general practitioners. To include patients in the interpretation of the results, one woman and one man from each group were randomly selected and interviewed via single-person semistructured interviews after the trial. We presented the results of FHSQ pain, GROC and PASS after 12 weeks first and asked them how they evaluated the results, which general treatment they would recommend to a friend, and to which group they would have preferred being randomised. After this, we presented the results after 26 and 52 weeks and asked them if that would change their recommendation to others or their own preferred treatment.

Equity, diversity, and inclusion statement

The author group consists of men from different disciplines, career stages (junior and senior) and countries (Denmark and Australia). We included all eligible patients regardless of sex, race/ethnicity/culture or socioeconomic level. We did not take sex, race or socioeconomic level into account in the analyses; however, the socioeconomic level will be included in our future cost-effectiveness analyses.

Protocol deviations

(1) The analyses regarding exercise compliance were not initially planned but described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.(2) To perform meaningful analyses of exercise compliance, patients who had achieved PASS were excluded from these as they were allowed to stop performing exercises 4 weeks after achieving PASS. (3) Physical activity levels expressed as weekly metabolic equivalent would not allow us to explore the proportion of time spent at various intensities. Therefore, instead, we present time spent at various intensities. (4) Due to the COVID-19 restrictions, no inclusions were made between 11 March 2020 and 24 April 2020, and 12-week follow-ups were conducted electronically during this period. (5) Outcomes for the cost-effectiveness analysis will be published separately as well as the cohort of potential participants not meeting the eligibility criteria.

### Plantar fasciitis: evidence-based review of diagnosis and therapy [^115dWR7G]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis causes heel pain in active as well as sedentary adults of all ages. The condition is more likely to occur in persons who are obese or in those who are on their feet most of the day. A diagnosis of plantar fasciitis is based on the patient's history and physical findings. The accuracy of radiologic studies in diagnosing plantar heel pain is unknown. Most interventions used to manage plantar fasciitis have not been studied adequately; however, shoe inserts, stretching exercises, steroid injection, and custom-made night splints may be beneficial. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy may effectively treat runners with chronic heel pain but is ineffective in other patients. Limited evidence suggests that casting or surgery may be beneficial when conservative measures fail.

Meta-analysis of VAS

A total of 21 studies provided data on visual analog scale (VAS) scores following local injections, with 756 patients in the PRP group and 756 in the steroid group. The results of the pooled analyses are presented in Figures 3 and 4. These findings revealed that the VAS scores in the local PRP injection group were significantly lower compared to the local steroid injection group at the 3-mo (WMD = −0.61; 95% CI, −1.17 to −0.05; P = 0.03; I² = 96.07%) and 6-mo (WMD = −1.55; 95% CI, −2.23 to −0.87; P < 0.001; I² = 97.04%) follow-ups. However, no significant differences were observed in the VAS scores between the two groups at the 1-mo (WMD = 0.41; 95% CI, −0.10 to 0.93; P = 0.12; I² = 93.50%) and 1-yr (WMD = −1.11; 95% CI, −2.33 to 0.11; P = 0.08; I² = 53.18%) follow-ups.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroids for the treatment of plantar fasciitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116y2oCP]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of heel pain. Corticosteroid injections are commonly used and proven to be effective, and lately platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been used with mixed results.

Purpose

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing intralesional injections of PRP and steroid infiltration.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

A systematic review of Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar including all level 1 and 2 studies from 2010 to 2019 was perfomed. American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society and visual analog scale for pain scores were used as outcome variables. Publication bias and risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration tools. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations system was used to assess the quality of the body of evidence. Heterogeneity was assessed with χ² and I² statistics.

Results

Fifteen studies were included in the analysis. Nine studies had a high risk of bias. There was 1 study with high quality, 9 with moderate, 2 studies with low, and 3 with very low quality. The pooled estimate for the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score demonstrated nonsignificant differences at 1 month (P = 0.4) and 3 months (P = 0.076). At 6 months (P = 0.009) and 12 months (P = 0.009), it indicated significant differences in favor of PRP. The pooled estimate for visual analog scale demonstrated nonsignificant differences at 1 month (P = 0.653). At 3 months (P = 0.0001), 6 months (P = 0.002), and 12 months (P = 0.019), it yielded significant differences in favor of PRP.

Conclusion

The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that PRP is superior to corticosteroid injections for pain control at 3 months and lasts up to 1 year. In the short term, there is no advantage of corticosteroid infiltration. However, the low study quality, high risk of bias, and different protocols for PRP preparation reduce the internal and external validity of these findings, and these results must be viewed with caution.

### Ultrasound-guided injection of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid versus corticosteroid in management of plantar fasciitis: a 24-week randomized clinical trial [^1165ZAiT]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Plantar fasciitis (PF) is the leading cause of heel pain in adults. Nearly 1 million patients visit physicians for the diagnosis and management of PF symptoms each year. The prevalence of heel pain in public is 4–7% and about 80% of this is caused by PF. It is more prevalent among women versus men, in those aged 45–64 years versus those aged 18–44 years, and in the obese versus those with a body mass index (BMI) of less than 25 kg/m2.PF can cause significant morbidity and activity limitations in the affected patients. Nonsurgical treatment options include rest, ice application, stretching, exercise, proper footwear, arch supports, orthotics, night splints, extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT), anti-inflammatory agents, and various injections including corticosteroid (CS), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), prolotherapy, autologous whole blood, botulinum toxinor ozone.

CSs are the most common injection modality for PF. Based on a Cochrane review, CS injections have temporary effects for near 24 weeks. Some adverse effects associated with CS injection are plantar fascia rupture, fat pad atrophy, lateral plantar nerve injury, and calcaneal osteomyelitis.

Hyaluronic acid (HA) injection has been used for many musculoskeletal disorders including osteoarthritis of the knee, persistent shoulder pain, osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint, knee pain in rheumatoid arthritis patients, and soft tissue and periarticular conditions such as lateral epicondylitis and patellar tendinopathy. Recently, Kumai and colleagues reported that a single injection of HA is clinically effective for the treatment of PF.

The plantar fascia is a thick aponeurosis with its origin at the medial calcaneal tubercle. The arch of the foot is supported by this fascia. Excessive running or standing for prolonged periods of time may cause an increased amount of tension along the plantar fascia which in turn makes changes in the aponeurosis that can be either acute or chronic. More recently, the term plantar fasciosis has been used instead of PF to show that the inflammation is not the main cause of the pain. Histopathologic investigation showed fibrous tissue has more disorganization rather than inflammation in PF, this finding is more likely to what happened in degenerative tendinosis.

Meta-analysis of AOFAS Scores

A total of 11 studies reported on the AOFAS scores following local injection treatment, encompassing 339 patients in the PRP group and 337 in the steroid group. The results of these pooled analyses are depicted in Figure 5. They indicated that the AOFAS scores in the local PRP injection group were significantly higher than those in the local steroid injection group at the 3-mo (WMD = 7.11; 95% CI, 0.15 to 14.06; P = 0.05; I² = 96.15%), 6-mo (WMD = 10.28; 95% CI, 5.42 to 15.14; P < 0.001; I² = 89.83%), and 1-yr (WMD = 8.33; 95% CI, 3.54 to 13.12; P < 0.001; I² = 00.00%) follow-ups. However, there were no significant differences in AOFAS scores between the two groups at the 1-mo follow-up (WMD = −2.84; 95% CI, −2.62 to 8.30; P = 0.31; I² = 78.99%).

### Ultrasound guided corticosteroid injection for plantar fasciitis: randomised controlled trial [^114nNQXv]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness of ultrasound guided corticosteroid injection in the treatment of plantar fasciitis.

Design

Randomised, investigator and participant blinded, placebo controlled trial.

Setting

University clinic in Melbourne, Australia.

Participants

82 people with a clinical and ultrasound diagnosis of plantar fasciitis unrelated to systemic inflammatory disease.

Interventions

Participants were randomly allocated to ultrasound guided injection of the plantar fascia with either 1 mL of 4 mg/mL dexamethasone sodium phosphate (experimental group) or 1 mL normal saline (placebo). Before injection the participants were given an ultrasound guided posterior tibial nerve block with 2% lidocaine (lignocaine).

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcomes were pain, as measured by the foot health status questionnaire (0–100 point scale), and plantar fascia thickness, measured by ultrasound at 4, 8, and 12 weeks.

Results

Reduction in pain at four weeks favoured the dexamethasone group by 10.9 points (95% confidence interval 1.4 to 20.4, P = 0.03). Between group differences for pain scores at eight and 12 weeks were not statistically significant. Plantar fascia thickness measured at four weeks favoured the dexamethasone group by -0.35 mm (95% confidence interval -0.67 to -0.03, P = 0.03). At eight and 12 weeks, between group differences for plantar fascia thickness also favoured dexamethasone, at -0.39 mm (-0.73 to -0.05, P = 0.02) and -0.43 mm (-0.85 to -0.01, P = 0.04), respectively. The number needed to treat with dexamethasone for one successful outcome for pain at four weeks was 2.93 (95% confidence interval 2.76 to 3.12). There were no reported adverse events associated with the intervention.

Conclusion

A single ultrasound guided dexamethasone injection is a safe and effective short term treatment for plantar fasciitis. It provides greater pain relief than placebo at four weeks and reduces abnormal swelling of the plantar fascia for up to three months. However, clinicians offering this treatment should also note that significant pain relief did not continue beyond four weeks.

### Sterile abscess formation following a corticosteroid injection for the treatment of plantar fasciitis [^115BgKED]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

A sterile abscess following a corticosteroid injection for the treatment of plantar fasciitis has not been reported in the literature. This case report demonstrates such a complication. A 45-year-old man presented with pain, erythemia, edema, and increased warmth to his left foot after 2 cortisone injections into his left heel over a 2-month period for plantar fasciitis. The symptoms began shortly after the second injection and after a 10-day course of oral antibiotics, the condition slowly worsened. A computerized axial tomography scan was suggestive of an abscess. Following incision and drainage, cultures that were taken during the surgical procedure did not produce any organism, prompting a diagnosis of a sterile abscess. The patient was discharged home and recovered from the abscess without reoccurrence or further surgical intervention.

### Preliminary report on the role of dry needling versus corticosteroid injection, an effective treatment method for plantar fasciitis: a randomized controlled trial [^116pyXSJ]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Plantar fasciopathy (PF) is a common disorder for which there is no consensus regarding an optimal treatment strategy. We hypothesized that dry needling would be as effective as the use of corticosteroid injections for treating PF while avoiding the potential adverse effects of corticosteroids. After approval was received from the institutional review board, patients diagnosed with PF were prescribed a 3-week nonoperative treatment regimen. In addition to using oral and topical antiinflammatory drugs, patients engaged in plantar fascia and gastrocnemius stretching exercises. A study population of 98 patients was planned. An appointment was made in the third week of first-line treatment. Patients whose pain did not abate and who required further treatment were included in the study. One week later, we randomly divided patients into 2 groups using an online random number generator. Group 1 underwent dry needling, and group 2 underwent corticosteroid injection. All dry needling was performed by a single physiotherapist, and all corticosteroid injections were performed by the second author. Patients were assessed in the third week and sixth month by a single investigator using the foot function index. In terms of foot function index scores, dry needling caused significant decrease in the third week and also in the sixth month. However, although corticosteroid use led to a significant decrease at the third week, it lost efficacy in the sixth month (p < .001). In conclusion, dry needling seems to be a reliable procedure for treating PF, with better outcomes than corticosteroid injection.

### Plantar fascia calcification a sequelae of corticosteroid injection in the treatment of recalcitrant plantar fasciitis [^116QUwJk]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We report the case of a 72-year-old woman suffering with severe plantar fasciitis who received a therapeutic corticosteroid injection. Two-and-a-half years after the injection she developed a small calcified lump under the skin which subsequently caused ulceration and infection. She went on to develop a diabetic foot infection requiring an extended course of intravenous antibiotics.

### Prospective randomized comparison of the effectiveness of radiation therapy and local steroid injection for the treatment of plantar fasciitis [^1129hhqf]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to conduct a randomized trial of radiation therapy for plantar fasciitis and to compare radiation therapy with local steroid injections.

Methods and Materials

Between March 2013 and April 2014, 128 patients with plantar fasciitis were randomized to receive radiation therapy (total dose of 6.0 Gy applied in 6 fractions of 1.0 Gy three times a week) or local corticosteroid injections a 1 mL injection of 40 mg methylprednisolone and 0.5 mL 1% lidocaine under the guidance of palpation. The results were measured using a visual analog scale, a modified von Pannewitz scale, and a 5-level function score. The fundamental phase of the study was 3 months, with a follow-up period of up to 6 months.

Results

The median follow-up period for all patients was 12.5 months (range, 6.5–18.6 months). For the radiation therapy patients, the median follow-up period was 13 months (range, 6.5–18.5 months), whereas in the palpation-guided (PG) steroid injection arm, it was 12.1 months (range, 6.5–18.6 months). After 3 months, results in the radiation therapy arm were significantly superior to those in the PG steroid injection arm (visual analog scale, P < .001; modified von Pannewitz scale, P < .001; 5-level function score, P < .001). Requirements for a second treatment did not significantly differ between the 2 groups, but the time interval for the second treatment was significantly shorter in the PG steroid injection group (P = 0.045).

Conclusion

This study confirms the superior analgesic effect of radiation therapy compared to mean PG steroid injection on plantar fasciitis for at least 6 months after treatment.

### Ultrasound-guided injection of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid versus corticosteroid in management of plantar fasciitis: a 24-week randomized clinical trial [^113iWhs4]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods & Materials

Patients and Setting

The participants of this study were patients with signs and symptoms of PF who were referred to the Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation clinic of Shahid Modarres Hospital in Tehran from March 2017 to January 2019.

Inclusion Criteria

Inclusion criteria of this study were aging between 25 and 60, having clinical diagnosis of PF based on history and physical examination for at least 3 months, and finally not having responded to primary conservative managements such as rest, shoe insoles, conventional physical therapy, exercise therapy, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Exclusion Criteria

Patients were excluded from the study if they had done ESWT or received any injection for PF within the past 3 months, had history of previous surgery for PF, had active bilateral PF, and had systemic inflammatory disease such as rheumatologic diseases, a history of vascular insufficiency and neuropathic heel pain, associated pathology involving the lower limb such as history of tarsal tunnel syndrome, effusion of the ankle indicating an intra-articular disease, old-healed calcaneal fracture, retrocalcaneal bursitis, achilles tendinopathy, ankle osteoarthritis, and finally, any deformity of foot and ankle, including pes planus or pes cavus. Other reasons for exclusion include pregnancy, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, BMI > 33, low back pain with radiation to lower limb, and infection or local trauma near the injection site.

Ethical Considerations

This trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki; hence the process of the treatment was explained to the patients. Once the physician assures that the patient completely agrees with the study protocol, the written consent form was signed or fingerprinted by the patient. The institutional review board of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (SBUMS) agreed on the protocol of this study. The treatment carried a low risk of adverse side effects and patients were advised that they can withdraw their participation at any time. Patients also had access to the project's physician whenever they experience injection-related infection or fibrosis, persistent pain, and swelling, or any neuromuscular complications. This study was approved by ethical community of SBUMS (code: IR.SBMU.MSP.REC.1397.403) and was registered in the Iranian Center of Clinical Trials (code: IRCT20130523013442N26).

### Bone scintigraphy predicts outcome of steroid injection for plantar fasciitis [^111yTSkz]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of foot pain and may be disabling. Although localized injection is painful, anesthetics or corticosteroids can relieve symptoms well. Bone scintigraphy can confirm the diagnosis. We hypothesized that blood-pool abnormalities could provide prognostic information on the response to such injections.

Methods

We devised scintigraphic criteria that graded the blood-pool abnormalities as being localized to the plantar enthesis, being localized to half the length of the aponeurosis, or involving the whole aponeurosis. We evaluated 24 patients with an established diagnosis of plantar fasciitis, 8 of whom had bilateral disease, leading to a total of 32 feet injected.

Results

After injection, pain was relieved either completely or nearly completely in 20 feet. The other 12 feet had short-term or no improvement, with persistent pain and loss of function at 4–5 wk after injection. Of the 20 feet responding to injection, 14 had focal hyperemia on blood-pool images and 6 had minimal extension into the proximal third of the plantar soft tissues. No patient with diffuse hyperemia in the plantar fascia had a response (5/12 feet). On the delayed images of the 20 responders, mild inferior calcaneal uptake was seen in 8 feet, moderate uptake in 6, and severe uptake in 6. These groups did not significantly differ (P > 0.05). The blood-pool studies had good reproducibility, with a kappa-value of 0.64.

Conclusion

Critical evaluation of plantar blood-pool images provides prognostic information on the response to localized injection into the enthesis. Reporting such studies is simple and reproducible.

### Injected corticosteroids for treating plantar heel pain in adults [^1162gKrT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Plantar heel pain, commonly resulting from plantar fasciitis, often results in significant morbidity. Treatment options include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), orthoses, physical therapy, physical agents (e.g. extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), laser) and invasive procedures including steroid injections.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of injected corticosteroids for treating plantar heel pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, clinical trials registries and conference proceedings. Latest search: 27 March 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of corticosteroid injections in the treatment of plantar heel pain in adults were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcome measures. We used a fixed-effect model unless heterogeneity was significant, when a random-effects model was considered. We assessed the overall quality of evidence for individual outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included a total of 39 studies (36 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 3 quasi-RCTs) that involved a total of 2492 adults. Most studies were small (median = 59 participants). Participants' mean ages ranged from 34 years to 59 years. When reported, most participants had heel pain for several months. The trials were usually conducted in outpatient specialty clinics of tertiary care hospitals in 17 countries. Steroid injection was given with a local anaesthetic agent in 34 trials. Follow-up was from one month to over two years. With one exception, trials were assessed at high risk of bias in one or more domains, mostly relating to lack of blinding, including lack of confirmation of allocation concealment. With two exceptions, we rated the available evidence as very low quality, implying in each case that we are 'very uncertain about the estimate'. The 39 trials covered 18 comparisons, with six of the seven trials with three or four groups providing evidence towards two comparisons. Eight trials (724 participants) compared steroid injection versus placebo or no treatment. Steroid injection may lead to lower heel pain visual analogue scores (VAS) (0 to 100; higher scores = worse pain) in the short-term (< 1 month) (MD -6.38, 95% CI -11.13 to -1.64; 350 participants; 5 studies; I² = 65%; low quality evidence). Based on a minimal clinically significant difference (MCID) of 8 for average heel pain, the 95% CI includes a marginal clinical benefit. This potential benefit was diminished when data were restricted to three placebo-controlled trials. Steroid injection made no difference to average heel pain in the medium-term (1 to 6 months follow-up) (MD -3.47, 95% CI -8.43 to 1.48; 382 participants; 6 studies; I² = 40%; low quality evidence). There was very low quality evidence for no effect on function in the medium-term and for an absence of serious adverse events (219 participants, 4 studies). No studies reported on other adverse events, such as post-injection pain, and on return to previous activity. There was very low quality evidence for fewer treatment failures (defined variously as persistent heel pain at 8 weeks, steroid injection at 12 weeks, and unrelieved pain at 6 months) after steroid injection. The available evidence for other comparisons was rated as very low quality. We are therefore very uncertain of the estimates for the relative effects on people with heel pain of steroids compared with other interventions in:1. Tibial nerve block with anaesthetic (2 trials); orthoses (4 trials); oral NSAIDs (2 trials); and intensive physiotherapy (1 trial).2. Physical modalities: ESWT (5 trials); laser (2 trials); and radiation therapy (1 trial).3. Other invasive procedures: locally injectable NSAID (1 trial); platelet-rich plasma injections (5 trials); autologous blood injections (2 trials); botulinum toxin injections (2 trials); cryopreserved human amniotic membrane injection (1 trial); localised peppering with a needle (1 trial); dry needling (1 trial); and mini scalpel needle release (1 trial). We are also uncertain about the estimates from trials testing different techniques of local steroid injection: ultrasonography-guided versus palpation-guided (5 trials); and scintigraphy-guided versus palpation-guided (1 trial). An exploratory analysis involving pooling data from 21 trials reporting on adverse events revealed two ruptures of plantar fascia (reported in 1 trial) and three injection site infections (reported in 2 trials) in 699 participants allocated to steroid injection study arms. Five trials reported a total of 27 participants with less serious short-term adverse events in the 699 participants allocated steroid injection study arms. Reported treatments were analgesia, ice or both. Given the high risk of selective reporting for these outcomes and imprecision, this evidence was rated at very low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low quality evidence that local steroid injections compared with placebo or no treatment may slightly reduce heel pain up to one month but not subsequently. The available evidence for other outcomes of this comparison was very low quality. Where available, the evidence from comparisons of steroid injections with other interventions used to treat heel pain and of different methods of guiding the injection was also very low quality. Although serious adverse events relating to steroid injection were rare, these were under-reported and a higher risk cannot be ruled out. Further research should focus on establishing the effects (benefits and harms) of injected steroids compared with placebo in typical clinical settings, subsequent to a course of unsuccessful conservative therapy. Ideally, this should be preceded by research, including patient involvement, aimed to obtain consensus on the priority questions for treating plantar heel pain.

### Efficacy of high-volume injections with and without corticosteroid compared with sham for achilles tendinopathy: a protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^113EgXc6]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Limitations

The radiologist is not blind to the sham interventions, but we will implement measures including a standardised script to ensure that all participants have comparable interventions with this caregiver. It is possible that people who have had a corticosteroid injection close to 3 months ago and up to a year prior may still have long-term adverse events from this injection that influences our findings. These effects are likely to be equal across groups given the randomisation process. A potential limitation to external validity is the single-centre design; however, this is appropriate for the efficacy paradigm adopted in this trial.

### Clinical indications for image-guided interventional procedures in the musculoskeletal system: a Delphi-based consensus paper from the European society of musculoskeletal radiology (ESSR)-part VI, foot and ankle [^113UiQVq]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

High-volume injections seem to be effective at treating AT, but confounding factors such as corticosteroid, aprotinin, dry needling, or eccentric exercise prevent assessment of this method alone.
2 Image-guided anesthetic-corticosteroid injections into the anterior and posterior tibial tendon sheaths are safe and may provide effective diagnosis and treatment in patients with anterior and posterior tibial tendon tenosynovitis.

Level of evidence: 3

Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100%

Several studies reported complete or near-complete prolonged symptom relief after anesthetic-corticosteroid injections for tenosynovitis unresponsive to conservative management. A study using US guidance successfully demonstrated excellent improvement of the tendon sheath effusion and synovial hypertrophy around the anterior and posterior tibial tendon 4 weeks after injection.
3 US-guided corticosteroid injections are more effective than palpation-guided injections to treat plantar fasciitis (PF) providing significant short-term pain relief, particularly when combined with strength training and stretching.

Level of evidence: 2

Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100%

A meta-analysis included 5 RCTs with 149 patients and concluded that US-guided injections were superior with regard to VAS, tenderness threshold, response rate, plantar fascia thickness, and hypoechogenicity. There was no difference in heel pad thickness and heel tenderness index. A comparative trial concluded that device-assisted US-guided injection for treating PF was superior to palpation-guided injection. US-guided corticosteroid injections are associated with lower heel pain recurrence when compared to palpation guidance. Comparative trials of US-guided corticosteroid injections versus placebo reported greater pain relief in the corticosteroid arm lasting up to 12 weeks. Case series in the literature report efficacy of corticosteroid injections for PF with objective measurement of the therapeutic effect on proximal PF without significant deterioration of heel pad mechanical properties. Combining corticosteroid injections with strength training and stretching is superior both in the short- and in the long term and can be recommended as a first-line treatment in patients with PF.
4 US-guided PRP injections for PF are safe and provide significant pain relief in chronic PF, with better clinical outcome at mid- and long-term follow-up if compared with corticosteroid injections.

### Evaluation of the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection treatment in plantar fasciitis using shear wave elastography [^113K5Pco]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection in patients with plantar fasciitis (PF) and assess changes in shear wave elastography (SWE) measurements and clinical outcomes.

Methods

Between March and August 2024, 66 patients (aged 27 to 67 years) diagnosed with PF were enrolled in the study. Plantar fascia thickness, shear wave velocity (SWV) in meters per second (m/s), and Young's modulus in kilopascals (kPa) were measured before the injection and at a 1-month follow-up. The correlation of these measurements with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS, 0–10) and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores was analyzed.

Results

Before treatment, the plantar fascia thickness, SWV, and Young's modulus were recorded as 5.02 ± 0.66 mm, 2.37 ± 0.22 m/s, and 18.64 ± 3.28 kPa, respectively. At the 1-month follow-up, these values significantly changed to 3.53 ± 0.39 mm, 3.39 ± 0.32 m/s, and 35.49 ± 7.25 kPa, respectively (p < 0.001 for all). A significant reduction in plantar fascia thickness and a significant increase in SWV and Young's modulus were observed. Additionally, improvements in VAS and AOFAS scores were strongly correlated with increases in SWV and Young's modulus (VAS-m/s: r = -0.632, p = 0.011; AOFAS-m/s: r = 0.695, p = 0.001; VAS-kPa: r = -0.673, p < 0.001; AOFAS-kPa: r = 0.798, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection significantly increased plantar fascia stiffness, and SWE measurements strongly correlated with clinical improvements. SWE proves to be a valuable adjunctive tool for evaluating treatment response in PF.

### Randomized controlled study of the efficacy of the injection of botulinum toxin type A versus corticosteroids in chronic plantar fasciitis: results at one and six months [^114YbqRi]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of botulinum toxin type A in chronic plantar fasciitis compared to the local injection of a corticosteroid plus local anaesthetic.

Methods

Patients with a clinical diagnosis of plantar fasciitis made at least six months earlier were selected to enter a randomized, single-blind study of treatment with injections of botulinum toxin type A or corticosteroid. There were 28 patients in each treatment group. Patients were evaluated at one month using the Foot Health Square Questionnaire and those with no clinical response subsequently received a second injection with the drug of the other arm of the study, creating two new treatment groups. Re-evaluation was performed at six months.

Results

One month after injection there was a clear clinical improvement in both treatment groups but it was greater in the botulinum toxin group, with a significant difference for the pain item (P = 0.069), though not in other items. At six months, patients treated with botulinum toxin type A had continued to improve in all items, whereas the corticosteroid group lost part of the improvement achieved at one month (improvement with botulinum toxin vs. corticosteroid: pain 19.10/-6.84 (P = 0.001), function 16.00/-8.80 (P < 0.001), footwear 13.48/-7.95 (P = 0.004), self-perceived foot health 25.44/-5.41 (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Botulinum toxin type A should be considered for the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis in view of the improvement found at one month, and particularly at six months, when this treatment clearly has better results than corticosteroid injections. Further studies with larger samples are necessary to confirm these results.

### The diagnosis and treatment of heel pain: a clinical practice guideline-revision 2010 [^116i3trX]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Medium credibility.

Plantar heel pain — initial nonoperative management states that initial treatment options may include padding and strapping of the foot, therapeutic orthotic insoles, oral anti-inflammatories, and a corticosteroid injection localized to the area of maximum tenderness; patient-directed treatments appear to be as important as these approaches in resolving symptoms.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Small joint injections — evidence statements indicate that ultrasound (US) guidance is superior to landmark-based guidance when performing small joint injections (Level of certainty: high). The use of intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) injection for osteoarthritis of the carpometacarpal joints of the hands and wrists does not result in short-term or long-term improvement in pain or function, while IACS results in less pain with movement in interphalangeal joints of the hand (Level of certainty: moderate). In rheumatoid arthritis of the joints of the hands and wrists, IACS results in short-term (12 weeks) or long-term (12 months) improvement in pain, function, and inflammation (Level of certainty: high). Trigger finger corticosteroid injection (CSI) confers a short-term to intermediate-term (3–6 months) benefit in resolving symptoms (Level of certainty: moderate). For trigger finger injections, triamcinolone, 20 mg, is superior to 5 mg and 10 mg (Level of certainty: low). In rheumatic inflammatory diseases such as spondyloarthritis, plantar fascia injections with corticosteroids are beneficial in the treatment of pain and inflammation (Level of certainty: low).

### Effect of ultrasonography-guided corticosteroid injection vs placebo added to exercise therapy for achilles tendinopathy: a randomized clinical trial [^114q76Ks]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Comparison With Previous Findings

Previous trials have investigated different types of injections for AT, including monotherapy and when combined with, for example, exercise therapy. A recent network meta-analysison all trials investigating injection therapy for AT combined many types of injections (platelet-rich plasma, corticosteroid, high-volume injections, and autologous blood) found that exercise therapy was comparable to injection therapy for midportion tendinopathy. It has also been shown that platelet-rich plasma is not effective compared with placebo injection. This finding suggests that some types of injections (eg, platelet-rich plasma) are unlikely to be effective treatment options for AT, whereas our study suggests that corticosteroid injection is effective when combined with exercise therapy.

In a systematic reviewof corticosteroid injections as treatment for tendinopathy, good short-term (4–8 weeks) but poor intermediate (13–26 weeks) and long-term (≥ 52 weeks) outcomes were reported. However, most of the included studies were of patients with lateral epicondylitis (ie, a non–weight-bearing tendon). Only 1 studyincluded patients with AT treated with 3 corticosteroid injections as monotherapy followed by unrestricted rehabilitation. Importantly, in the present study, all patients were recommended to refrain from all running and jumping activities in the first 3 months (99% complied), and all patients followed a progressive exercise therapy. This could explain the superior effect of corticosteroid injections in both the short and intermediate term (1–6 months), as well as the continued good results in the long term (≥ 1 year) in our study. However, these findings may not necessarily apply to all tendons since corticosteroid injection has not provided an additive effect to exercises for shoulder painor lateral epicondylitis, whereas it has been suggested to have an additive effect in plantar fasciitis. In our study, no severe adverse events associated with the corticosteroid were registered, and the injections were almost pain free. Tendon ruptures after corticosteroid injections are often described in case studies, but in controlled studies only 1 Achilles tendon rupture has previously been reported after 3 corticosteroid injections in patients with AT who underwent aggressive rehabilitation that included running after only a few days. It should be noted that the reduction in tendon size with corticosteroid injection represented a normalization upon a tendinopathy-enlarged tendon, not tendon atrophy. In our study, the patients refrained from running and jumping activities during the first 3 months, but started exercise therapy a few days after the injection.

### Ultrasound-guided injection of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid versus corticosteroid in management of plantar fasciitis: a 24-week randomized clinical trial [^114tmeEc]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Both corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid are effective interventions for plantar fasciitis and can improve pain and function with no superiority in 24-week follow-up, although corticosteroid seems to have a faster trend of improvement in the short term. No serious adverse effects were seen in any groups.

### Comparison of ultrasound-guided local ozone (O2-O3) injection vs corticosteroid injection in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis: a randomized clinical trial [^111gQNhu]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Plantar fasciitis (PF) is one of the most common causes of heel pain. The affected area is often close to the attachment of plantar fascia to calcaneus bone. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of ozone (O2-O3) injection to corticosteroid injection under ultrasound guidance for the treatment of chronic PF.

Design

Randomized clinical trial.

Setting

Academic University and Neuromusculoskeletal Research Center.

Subjects

Thirty patients with chronic PF.

Methods

The patients were randomly divided into two groups receiving methylprednisolone (15 subjects) vs ozone (O2-O3; 15 subjects). The following outcome measures were assessed before injection and then two weeks and 12 weeks after the injection in each group; morning and daily pain via visual analog scale, daily life and exercise activities via the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure, and plantar fascia thickness at insertion and 1cm distal to its insertion into the calcaneus via ultrasound imaging.

Results

Intragroup changes showed significant improvement in pain, functional parameters, and sonographic findings in both groups (P < 0.05). Pain reduction (both daily and morning) and daily activity improvement were better in the corticosteroid group two weeks after injection; however, at 12weeks, the ozone (O2-O3) group had significantly more improvement (P = 0.003, P = 0.001, and P = 0.017, respectively).

Conclusions

Both methods were effective in the treatment of chronic PF. Steroid injection provided a more rapid and short-term therapeutic effect. However, ozone (O2-O3) injection led to a slow and longer-lasting treatment outcome. Ozone (O2-O3) injection can be an effective treatment, with slow onset and a longer durability in the treatment of chronic PF.

### WITHDRAWN. interventions for treating plantar heel pain [^113EXjHL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Ten percent of people may experience pain under the heel (plantar heel pain) at some time. Injections, insoles, heel pads, strapping and surgery have been common forms of treatment offered. The absolute and relative effectiveness of these interventions are poorly understood.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to identify and evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of treatments for plantar heel pain.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group specialised register (September 2002), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2002), EMBASE (1988 to September 2002) and reference lists of articles and dissertations. Four podiatry journals were handsearched to 1998. We contacted all UK schools of podiatry to identify dissertations on the management of heel pain, and investigators in the field to identify unpublished data or research in progress. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of interventions for plantar heel pain in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently evaluated randomised controlled trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed trial quality. Additional information was obtained by direct contact with investigators. No poolable data were identified. Where measures of variance were available we have calculated the weighted mean differences based on visual analogue scale (VAS) scores.

Main Results

Nineteen randomised trials involving 1626 participants were included. Trial quality was generally poor, and pooling of data was not conducted. All trials measured heel pain as the primary outcome. Seven trials evaluated interventions against placebo/dummy or no treatment. There was limited evidence for the effectiveness of topical corticosteroid administered by iontophoresis, i.e. using an electric current, in reducing pain. There was some evidence for the effectiveness of injected corticosteroid providing temporary relief of pain. There was conflicting evidence for the effectiveness of low energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy in reducing night pain, resting pain and pressure pain in the short term (6 and 12 weeks) and therefore its effectiveness remains equivocal. In individuals with chronic pain (longer than six months), there was limited evidence for the effectiveness of dorsiflexion night splints in reducing pain. There was no evidence to support the effectiveness of therapeutic ultrasound, low-intensity laser therapy, exposure to an electron generating device or insoles with magnetic foil. No randomised trials evaluating surgery, or radiotherapy against a randomly allocated control population were identified. There was limited evidence for the superiority of corticosteroid injections over orthotic devices.

Authors' Conclusions

Although there is limited evidence for the effectiveness of local corticosteroid therapy, the effectiveness of other frequently employed treatments in altering the clinical course of plantar heel pain has not been established in randomised controlled trials. At the moment there is limited evidence upon which to base clinical practice. Treatments that are used to reduce heel pain seem to bring only marginal gains over no treatment and control therapies such as stretching exercises. Steroid injections are a popular method of treating the condition but only seem to be useful in the short term and only to a small degree. Orthoses should be cautiously prescribed for those patients who stand for long periods; there is limited evidence that stretching exercises and heel pads are associated with better outcomes than custom made orthoses in people who stand for more than eight hours per day. Well designed and conducted randomised trials are required.

### Comparison of the effect of ultrasound-guided injection of botulinum toxin type A and corticosteroid in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis: a randomized controlled trial [^1113kZXK]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of ultrasound-guided injection of botulinum toxin type A with corticosteroid in patients with chronic plantar fasciitis (PF).

Design

This randomized controlled trial was conducted on 35 patients with chronic plantar fasciitis. Participants were randomly allocated into two groups: one group received methylprednisolone in to the plantar fascia (n = 18) and the other group received botulinum toxin type A injection into the flexor digitorum brevis and quadratus plantae (n = 17). All injections were performed under ultrasound guidance. Patients were evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale, Foot and Ankle Ability Measures, and plantar fascia thickness before the intervention, 3 wks, 12 wks, and 6 mos after the treatment.

Results

In both groups, patients' pain and function improved significantly up to 3 wks after injection. In the botulinum toxin type A group, morning Visual Analog Scale improved significantly at 12 wks after intervention and the improvement was sustained for another 3 mos. In the botulinum toxin type A group, Foot and Ankle Ability Measures-sports subscale improved in all evaluated points, whereas in the corticosteroid group, the improvement was significant only when comparing follow-ups values to baseline.

Conclusions

Both ultrasound-guided botulinum toxin type A and corticosteroid injection were effective in the treatment of plantar fasciitis. Our study showed that the effects of botulinum toxin type A injection last longer than those of steroid injection.

### Does a corticosteroid injection plus exercise or exercise alone add to the effect of patient advice and a heel cup for patients with plantar fasciopathy? A randomised clinical trial [^11789j79]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of patient advice plus heel cup alone (PA) versus PA and lower limb exercise (PAX) versus PAX plus corticosteroid injection (PAXI) to improve self-reported pain in patients with plantar fasciopathy.

Methods

We recruited 180 adults with plantar fasciopathy confirmed by ultrasonography for this prospectively registered three-armed, randomised, single-blinded superiority trial. Patients were randomly allocated to PA (n = 62), PA plus self-dosed lower limb heavy-slow resistance training consisting of heel raises (PAX) (n = 59), or PAX plus an ultrasound-guided injection of 1 mL triamcinolone 20 mg/mL (PAXI) (n = 59). The primary outcome was changed in the pain domain of the Foot Health Status Questionnaire (ranging from 0 'worst' to 100 'best') from baseline to the 12-week follow-up. The minimal important difference in the pain domain is 14.1 points. The outcome was collected at baseline and at 4, 12, 26, and 52 weeks.

Results

The primary analysis found a statistically significant difference between PA and PAXI after 12 weeks favouring PAXI (adjusted mean difference: -9.1 (95% CI -16.8 to -1.3; p = 0.023)) and over 52 weeks (adjusted mean difference: -5.2 (95% CI -10.4 to -0.1; p = 0.045)). At no follow-up did the mean difference between groups exceed the pre-specified minimal important difference. No statistically significant difference was found between PAX and PAXI or between PA and PAX at any time.

Conclusion

No clinically relevant between-group differences were found after 12 weeks. The results indicate that combining a corticosteroid injection with exercise is not superior to exercise or no exercise.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroids in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective comparative studies [^1157A8vq]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of heel pain, which often results in a significant limitation of daily activity. The objective of this review was to compare platelet-rich plasma injection (PRP) and corticosteroids injection in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis. MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library of clinical trials were searched in March 2019. Inclusion criteria were prospective comparative studies reporting functional scores or pain score with a minimum follow-up of 1 month. We excluded studies with patients younger than 18 years and patients with a history of surgical intervention, infection, or rheumatological disease. First author, publication year, sample size, type of intervention, outcome measures, and follow-up period were recorded. The American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society score was significantly better in the PRP group at 6 months' follow-up, with a lower visual analogue scale at 6- and 12-month intervals. The Foot and Ankle Disability Index and Roles-Maudsley score were similar in the 2 treatments at 3 and 6 months. PRP injection in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis is considered safe, with a favorable functional outcome and pain control at intermediate and long-term follow-up in comparison to corticosteroid injection.

Figure 8
Treatment of plantar heel pain in three steps according to the 2010 CPG Heel Pain Committee of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons guidelines. ESWT, extracorporeal shockwave therapy.

The 2014 guidelines show a model that guides clinical decisions on the evaluation, diagnosis and treatment planning for individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis: in the diagnosis, the ICD category of plantar fasciitis and the associated International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health impairment-based category of heel pain should be used. Clinicians should assess for diagnostic classifications other than heel pain/plantar fasciitis, including spondyloarthritis, fat pad atrophy and proximal plantar fibroma, when the individual's reported activity limitations or impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with those presented in the diagnosis/classification section of this guideline, or when the individual's symptoms do not resolve with interventions aimed at normalisation of body function.

As regards therapy, Karl B Landorf, in a review of literature, reported the following: customised foot orthoses are more effective than sham orthoses in improving functions up to 12 months in people with plantar heel pain, but with less effect in reducing pain; heel pads and heel cups are effective but lack randomised studies; taping may be more effective than no taping or sham taping in reducing pain in the short term (at 1 week); stretching exercises are more effective than no treatment or taping in reducing pain or improving function in people, but the evidence is weak and inconsistent; EWST may be more effective than placebo in reducing pain at 12 weeks in people with chronic heel pain, but there is a need for more randomised controlled trials; and corticosteroid injections may be associated with a high rate of plantar fascia rupture and other complications, which may lead to chronic disability in some people.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Small joint injections — clinical recommendations state that clinicians should preferably offer US guidance when performing injections into the small joints of the wrists, hands, feet, and ankles, as it may provide benefit (eg, reduced procedural pain) over landmark-based guidance (Grade C). In patients with active rheumatoid arthritis in the small joints of the wrists and hands, IACSSI may be used as an adjunct therapy to decrease pain, improve function, and reduce signs and symptoms of inflammation (Grade C). For trigger finger, clinicians should perform CSI with 20 mg triamcinolone/methylprednisolone corticosteroid equivalent rather than 5 or 10 mg (Grade C), and clinicians should offer thumb splints in conjunction with CSI for De Quervain's tenosynovitis (Grade C). For plantar fascia, clinicians can perform corticosteroid injections for rheumatic inflammatory heel pain not responsive to conservative measures (Grade C) and should avoid plantar fascia injections with corticosteroids for noninflammatory plantar heel pain.

### Ultrasound-guided injection of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid versus corticosteroid in management of plantar fasciitis: a 24-week randomized clinical trial [^117VRCpw]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

As presented in Table 1, no significant difference was observed in the two groups with respect to their demographic data including age, sex, height, weight, BMI, job difficulty, level of education and pain duration. Thus, we could conclude that the population was homogeneously distributed in the groups.

Table 1
Baseline Characteristics of the Participants in the Groups

VAS, PPT, FFI, FAAM and plantar fascia thickness by US was measured at baseline, 6 weeks and 24 weeks after the intervention. Also, satisfaction based on the Likert 5-point scale was measured in the 24th week.

Table 2 summarizes the changes of the mean VAS, PPT, FAAM, FFI, and USV within groups at baseline, 6 weeks and 24 weeks after the treatment. It also showed the mean satisfaction in each group at the end of the 24-week follow-up. At the baseline and the 24th week, no significant difference was observed between the two groups for any of the variables (P > 0.05). However, between baseline and the sixth week, the increase in PPT and decrease in plantar fascia USV was significantly higher in the CS group compared to HA group (P = 0.004 and P = 0.011, respectively). Table 3 compares the results between the two groups over the time.

Table 2
Within Group Analysis of Outcomes Over the Time

Table 3
Between Group Analysis of Outcomes Over the Time

Participants' satisfaction, measured at the end of the study, was relatively similar for both groups (P = 0.618). We defined success rates for both interventions as any decrease in about 30% or higher from the baseline scores on the third assessment (24 weeks after intervention). According to this definition, success rates30% for each scale are as follows (HA vs CS): VAS 93.5% vs 86.2% (P = 0.304), FAAM 77.4% vs 75.9% (P = 0.564), PPT 51.6% vs 62.1% (P = 0.289), and FFI 87.1% vs 79.3% (P = 0.322). Table 4 compares success rates between the two groups.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroids in the treatment of plantar fasciitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111TpYFK]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Our meta-analysis exhibits several limitations. The quality of some included studies is suboptimal, particularly in terms of blinding procedures, which introduces potential biases. Despite recommendations against its use due to its high ceiling effect, the AOFAS score was utilized. High I² values further underscore potential limitations of this study. Variability in PRP preparation protocols across different trials has led to inconsistencies in PRP quality and, consequently, therapeutic outcomes. Although control groups uniformly received CSs, variations in the types and brands of CSs used highlight the necessity for more comprehensive and rigorous RCTs to validate the efficacy of PRP injections in treating plantar fasciitis.

### Does a corticosteroid injection plus exercise or exercise alone add to the effect of patient advice and a heel cup for patients with plantar fasciopathy? A randomised clinical trial [^113CFE1M]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As hypothesised, a statistically significant difference was present between PAXI and PA in FHSQ pain. However, the mean between-group difference was less than the minimal important difference, which questions the clinical relevance. No other statistically significant differences in FHSQ pain were found; thus, performing HSR was no better than not performing HSR. Nor was it better to receive a corticosteroid injection and perform HSR compared with just HSR.

This was the first trial to investigate the effect of HSR versus HSR and corticosteroid injection. Johannsen et al have previously compared the effect of strength training plus stretching against either a corticosteroid injection alone or a combination of the two. They concluded that the combination was superior to the other two groups. In contrast, PAXI was not superior to PAX, however; we used a single injection, whereas Johannsen et al used repeated injections. Repeated injections may add to the effect of the treatment, but every additional injection may also give an additional placebo effect, and repeated corticosteroid injections have yet to be compared with repeated placebo injections for PF. It has been suggested that repeated injections may increase the risk of plantar fascia rupture as corticosteroid may affect the mechanical properties of collagen tissue, although this has not been demonstrated in a randomised trial. Studies using an injection in isolation find a significant short-term improvement within 6–8 weeks with no further long-term improvements. In our trial, PAXI kept improving from 4 to 12 weeks. This suggests that HSR may add to the effect of an injection.

RESULTS

Included Studies

Following the literature search, a total of 233 relevant publications were initially identified. After the removal of duplicates, 149 studies were screened based on their titles and abstracts. Of these, 125 records were excluded for being reviews, letters, or not pertinent to our research topic. Consequently, 24 RCTs. encompassing a collective total of 1,653 participants, met the selection criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. The process of study selection and inclusion is illustrated in the flow diagram presented in Figure 1 of the current study.

FIGURE 1
PRISMA flowchart of the study search process.

Studies Characteristics

The 24 RCTs included in our meta-analysis are detailed in Supplementary Table 1. These studies were globally distributed, with 14 conducted in India, four in Egypt, and one each in the UK, Mexico, Iran, Turkey, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. The studies focused on patients with plantar fasciitis, treated in the experimental groups with local injections of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and in the control groups with local steroid injections. The PRP, derived from the patient's own peripheral blood, was consistently produced following detailed methodologies outlined in each study, with administered volumes ranging from 2 mL to 5 ml. Notably, two studies utilized calcium gluconate as an activating agent for PRP. The steroid injections varied across studies: 16 used methylprednisolone, four used triamcinolone, and the remainder employed betamethasone, dexamethasone, or an unspecified steroid, often in combination with local anesthetics like prilocaine or lidocaine. These RCTs were published between 2013 and 2023.

Quality Assessment of Individual Trials

Figure 2 provides a summary of the methodological quality of all the studies included in our analysis. Among these, 23 studies demonstrated adequate random sequence generation. Allocation concealment was appropriately implemented in 16 of the included studies. Nine studies reported blinding of outcome assessors, ensuring an objective assessment of results. Furthermore, our evaluation did not reveal any other obvious sources of bias within the trials.

### Ultrasound-guided injection of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid versus corticosteroid in management of plantar fasciitis: a 24-week randomized clinical trial [^114ctzBy]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

In this study, we used a single injection of 20 mg high-molecular-weight, linear HA (> 2000 kDa) of non-animal origin in 1 mL (Viscor ® 2%; Nikan Teb Kimia Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Tehran, Iran). Based on the brand of the HA and its properties such as molecular weight, concentration, linear or reticulated HA, different results may be achieved, and the results of this study may not be generalizable to other HA products. Investigating the molecular weight effect and dose response on the efficacy of HA in PF would be a research target for future studies. Another limitation of this study is that no economic analysis between two injections was directed in our trial.

HA is a polysaccharide that can be found in the extracellular matrix of soft connective tissues and synovial fluid. It plays different roles in maintaining elasticity and viscosity of synovial fluid and integrity of connective tissues such as joints.HA has been reported to alleviate the pain, inhibit cartilage deterioration, avoid tissue adhesion, and inhibit the development of blood vessels and sensory nerves. Yoshida and colleaguesreported that in a rat tendinopathy model, HA was effective for pain relief and partial repair of the patellar tendon. Wu et alalso showed that in patients with tendinopathy of the long head of biceps, HA decreases metalloproteinase-1 and −3 expressions in tenocytes and would attenuate tendinopathy. Also, other researchers demonstrated that in patients with rotator cuff tears, intra-articular injections of HA provide immediate clinical improvement compared with ESWT.

The aim of this clinical trial is to compare the outcomes of local administration of HA with CS injections for patients with chronic plantar fasciopathy.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that compares the effects of US-guided injection of CS and HA in patients with chronic PF at 6 weeks and 24th-week follow-ups.

The results of this study show that there was no significant difference between the two groups for VAS, PPT, FAAM, FFI and fascia thickness measured by the US before treatment. However, 6 weeks after the treatment, plantar fascia thickness measured by US (P < 0.001) and PPT (P < 0.001) became significantly better in the CS group compared to the HA group. Also, 24 weeks after the treatment, no significant difference between any variable was observed in both groups. In this study, no serious adverse events were seen in any of the groups.

CS and HA were both effective treatments for PF and can improve pain and function with no superiority in 24-week follow-up; however, CS seems to have a faster trend of improvement in the short term.

Steroid injection is commonly used to treat PF. There is some evidence that injected CS were effective in providing transitory pain relief. The rapid effects of steroid injection on pain inspire its common use in treating PF. However, current scientific evidence shows that steroid injection should be avoided in treating PF in athletes because of its greater risk of causing spontaneous ruptures.

The efficacy of CS in treating chronic inflammation has been well demonstrated. Intralesional injection of CS in chronic PF (defined as persistence of symptoms more than 8 weeks despite conservative care) has been shown to be effective. In a review by Ang TW, the effectiveness of CS injection in the treatment of PF was evaluated. All placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed a significant reduction in pain with the use of CS injections. However, it is evident from these studies that the effects of CS injections are usually short term, lasting only for a duration of 4–12 weeks.

### Platelet-rich plasma vs. corticosteroids for refractory plantar fasciitis… [^1128M2di]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer Platelet-rich plasma injections are similar to corticosteroids for pain relief and improvement in function in patients with refractory plantar fasciitis lasting less than 12 weeks. Platelet-rich plasma injections may provide greater pain relief and improvement in function than corticosteroid injections in refractory plantar fasciitis lasting more than 12 weeks. Evidence Summary A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis compared corticosteroid therapy with several other treatments in patients with plantar fasciitis in whom conservative therapy was ineffective. The review included a subgroup analysis of eight RCTs comparing corticosteroid injections with platelet-rich plasma injections.

1 In the short and medium terms, both treatments had a similar effect on pain and function. In the long term, corticosteroid and platelet-rich plasma were still similar in functional impact, but platelet-rich plasma was more effective for pain relief. The difference in pain response was reported to be clinically significant. 2 At four and 12 weeks, no significant differences were noted between the groups. At 24 weeks, platelet-rich plasma was more effective than corticosteroids at reducing pain scores on a 10-point visual analog scale. The methylprednisolone group showed the greatest improvement in pain at one week, platelet-rich plasma was equivalent at three months, and platelet-rich plasma was superior after 18 months.

The mean VAS scores for platelet-rich plasma at baseline and 18 months were 8. 2, lowered to
2. 1, and for methylprednisolone were 8. 8, lowered to 3.
6. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups at 18 months. Mean scores on the function scale at baseline and 18 months for platelet-rich plasma were 1. 7 and
3. 7 and for methylprednisolone were 1. 2 and
3. 1.

Background

Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of varying degrees of in heel pain and functional loss. It is related to repetitive microtrauma of the plantar fascia. Short-term increases in body weight, being overweight, and physical activity are also risk factors for plantar fasciitis. Although no long-term complications have been reported, participants may experience persistent symptoms after the initial onset. These symptoms may lead to a decrease in physical activity, which may result in weight gain. In turn, the weight gain can exacerbate the symptoms or make recovery more difficult.

Initial treatments for plantar heel pain, such as stretching, taping, or manual physical therapy, may provide short-term (1 week to 4 months) pain relief and may improve foot function. NSAIDs can also be used as initial treatments for mild-to-moderate pain, but they may cause adverse effects. Night splints, corticosteroid local injections, and extracorporeal shock wave therapy can be used for persistent pain. Night splints are recommended for participants with plantar fasciitis who consistently experience pain with the first step in the morning, and they require a long treatment period. Local corticosteroid injection is not typically recommended as a first-line treatment. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy can reduce heel pain in participants with chronic plantar fasciitis, although there is no significant difference in overall heel pain improvement. Weight gain and inactive due to plantar heel pain could worsen plantar fasciitis. Thus, it is important to treat plantar fasciitis rather than neglect it. However, no treatments with a high level of evidence are available for plantar fasciitis, although several treatments, such as stretching and orthotics, have a moderate level of evidence supporting their use. Although most participants with plantar fasciitis will resolve their symptoms within 12 months or after various treatments, 11% of participants with plantar heel pain experience recurrent pain and function loss.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroids in the treatment of plantar fasciitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1111sGXg]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

What Is Known

The efficacy of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and corticosteroid (CS) injections for treating plantar fasciitis has been a subject of ongoing debate.

What Is New

This systematic review reveals that while PRP injections do not outperform CS in the short term or at 1-yr follow-up, they provide significantly better pain relief in the medium term (3–6 mos). These insights can help doctors make informed decisions when choosing between PRP and CS treatments for plantar fasciitis, especially for patients seeking longer-term pain management.

Plantar fasciitis (PF) is a common and debilitating degenerative condition of the plantar fascia, primarily caused by repetitive microtrauma and excessive tension on the plantar surface. This repeated stress leads to microtears within the fascia, which precipitate fibroblastic proliferation and subsequent abnormal collagen deposition, ultimately culminating in tissue degeneration and structural changes. These microtears result in edema and degenerative alterations, which are key mechanisms responsible for the pain experienced by patients with plantar fasciitis. While traditionally associated with inflammatory processes, emerging evidence suggests that PF is predominantly a degenerative condition with minimal inflammation, characterized by vascular dysfunction and structural damage within the fascia.PF is the most frequent cause of heel pain, with a global lifetime prevalence of 10%, and is more prevalent among females. The condition significantly impairs patients' quality of life, as the resulting pain and mobility restrictions limit daily activities, potentially leading to decreased physical fitness, work absenteeism, and psychological stress.

Injection Technique

US is an accurate, reliable, and non-invasive technique for measuring PF thickness, monitoring effects of different interventions, and guiding therapeutic interventions in patients with PF. It can visualize increases in thickness of the plantar fascia, hypoechoic changes, perifascial fluid collections, and calcaneal spur. The US-guided injection is better than palpation-guided injection because the latter provides better relief in pain (VAS scores) and control of PFT by enhancing the accuracy of the injection site by exact localization of the plantar fascia during the injection. Kane et al claimed that the US-guided injection of four heels with recalcitrant PF is highly effective.

In this study, the plantar fascia was examined with a 3- to 12-MHz real-time linear-array transducer (Ecube7 US system (Alpinion, Seoul, Korea)) with the patient lying prone with 90° of knee flexion and neutral ankle position. The injection was performed under aseptic conditions using a 22-gauge needle. Plantar fascia thickening of > 4 mm and/or abnormal hypoechoic areas in plantar fascia were targeted under the longitudinal plane of US-guidance. Figure 1 presents our injection practice. Also, the needle was inserted through the medial heel along with the long-axis view (in-plane technique) toward the target area. Then, 2 mL of HA or CS were injected using a peppering technique, which involves a single skin portal followed by several penetrations of the fascia. Patients were kept in the sitting position without moving their foot for 30 min after the injection. They were sent home with instructions to limit the use of the affected foot for approximately 72 h and to use acetaminophen in case of pain. Moreover, they were taught to perform stretching exercises. It should be noted that the use of NSAIDs was not allowed.

Outcome Measures

Visual Analog Scale (VAS)

Patients were asked to rate pain by marking a horizontally positioned 10-cm VAS with anchor points of "no pain" and "worst possible pain". Patients were also asked to verbally rate their pain "on a scale of 0 to 10", with 0 indicating no pain and 10 showing the worst possible pain.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroids in the treatment of plantar fasciitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114DqDWJ]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Plantar fasciitis results from inflammation and degeneration due to microtears in the plantar fascia. A plantar fascia thickness greater than 4 mm is considered abnormal. Several RCTs have used plantar fascia thickness to evaluate the efficacy of PRP and CS treatments. Our meta-analysis revealed no significant difference in plantar fascia thickness between PRP and CS treatments at 1, 3, and 6 mos. However, both interventions were associated with a significant reduction in thickness over time. This reduction is clinically meaningful, likely reflecting a decrease in inflammation and a potential restoration of normal fascial architecture — key therapeutic objectives in managing plantar fasciitis. The ability of ultrasound to detect these subtle changes in thickness underscores its utility as an objective marker for treatment efficacy. Given its high sensitivity, noninvasive nature, and capacity for precise, repeatable measurements, ultrasound is an indispensable tool not only for the initial diagnosis of plantar fasciitis but also for the ongoing monitoring of treatment outcomes. The increased thickness of the plantar fascia in patients with plantar fasciitis is primarily attributed to inflammation and degenerative changes within the fascia. Inflammation leads to fluid accumulation within the tissue, causing edema and contributing to the increase in thickness. Degenerative changes, including collagen fiber disorganization, fibrosis, and fibroblast proliferation, also contribute to the overall thickening of the fascia. On ultrasound imaging, inflammation is typically manifested as an increase in plantar fascia thickness, whereas degenerative changes are more likely to be reflected in alterations of echo intensity rather than in thickness alone. Our study found no significant differences in thickness between PRP and CS treatments, indicating that both treatments have similar anti-inflammatory effects. However, the reparative advantages of PRP may not be fully captured by thickness measurements alone and might be better indicated by changes in echo intensity. Therefore, future research should consider incorporating echo intensity measurements into assessments to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of treatment efficacy and gain deeper insights into the tissue changes associated with plantar fasciitis.

### Treatment outcomes of corticosteroid injection and extracorporeal shock wave therapy as two primary therapeutic methods for acute plantar fasciitis: a prospective randomized clinical trial [^1174pchD]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The outcome of corticosteroid injection (CSI) and extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) as primary treatment of acute plantar fasciitis has been debated. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare the therapeutic effects of CSI and ESWT in patients with acute (< 6-week duration) symptomatic plantar fasciitis. Of the 116 eligible patients, 68 were randomized to 2 equal groups of 34 patients, each undergoing either ESWT or CSI. The ESWT method included 2000 impulses with energy of 0.15 mJ/mm² and a total energy flux density of 900 mJ/mm² for 3 consecutive sessions at 1-week intervals. In the CSI group, 40 mg of methyl prednisolone acetate plus 1 mL of lidocaine 2% was injected into the maximal tenderness point at the inframedial calcaneal tuberosity. The success and recurrence rates and pain intensity measured using the visual analog scale, were recorded and compared at the 3-month follow-up visit. The pain intensity had reduced significantly in all patients undergoing either technique. However, the value and trend of pain reduction in the CSI group was significantly greater than those in the ESWT group (p < .0001). In the ESWT and CSI groups, 19 (55.9%) and 5 (14.7%) patients experienced treatment failure, respectively. Age, gender, body mass index, and recurrence rate were similar between the 2 groups (p > .05). Both ESWT and CSI can be used as the primary and/or initial treatment option for treating patients with acute plantar fasciitis; however, the CSI technique had better therapeutic outcomes.

Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT)

The PPT is a popular model for inducing acute, experimental pain. Algometry is a useful technique in determining PPT measures that is used widely in both clinical and laboratory settings.

Pressure algometry is mainly a manual procedure that requires a perceptual response from the participant or patient. The results of previous studies have shown that this test has very good measurement reliability, with intra-class correlations (ICC) greater than 0.8 for the PPT measurements, which indicates that participants were indeed capable of judging their pain and discomfort thresholds. An analog algometer (SM100 Sundoo ®) was used to measure the tenderness threshold (TT). It is a force gauge fitted with an elastic disc with a surface area of 1 cm² and is calibrated in kg/cm². The algometer is applied on the medial calcaneal tuberosity by placing the algometer at a 90° vertical angle to the skin surface. The maximum pressure applied is up to 11 kg/cm². If no pain was recorded in the maximum pressure, the TT is defined as 11 kg/cm². The minimum pressure to provoke pain was written down. Then, the measurement was done three times with 30-s intervals at the same location and the average value was recorded.

Foot Function Index-Revised (FFI-R)

The FFI-R is a 17-item questionnaire in which each item is scored on a 10-point Likert scale. FFI is used widely worldwide. This instrument that establishes a quantifiable measure of foot health has changed the approach of outcome measurement to subjective, patient-centered, valid, reliable, and responsive hard data endpoints. Editing FFI-R into four response categories will enhance its user-friendliness for measuring foot health.

### The effect of corticosteroid local injection versus platelet-rich plasma for the treatment of plantar fasciitis in obese patients: a single-blind, randomized clinical trial [^111p6SzR]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic plantar heel pain (CPHP) is one of the most common painful and disabling foot conditions, for which various treatments have been proposed. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of local injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) compared with the conventional method of local corticosteroid injection in obese patients who were resistant to other nonsurgical treatments. In this single-blind, randomized clinical trial, 32 obese patients with chronic plantar heel pain were randomly allocated to 2 groups of 16 participants each. In 1 group, 40 mg of dimethylprednisolone was injected once into the painful heel, whereas the other group received 3 separate injections of PRP, with each injection administered 1 week apart. The groups were compared at baseline and at 24 weeks after the injection, or course of injections, was administered. Exposures, total morning pain, and foot function index were not statistically significantly different between the groups at baseline; however, at 24 weeks after the treatment, final pain and morning pain scores were statistically significantly (p < .001) better in the corticosteroid group, and the mean foot function index scores were 65.4 ± 3.2 and 58.3 ± 2.9 (p < .001) in patients treated with corticosteroid and PRP, respectively. In obese patients with plantar fasciitis, injection with corticosteroid was more effective than PRP at reducing pain and improving function.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroids in the treatment of plantar fasciitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115mhWZs]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement(See Supplementary Checklist). The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024496055).

Search Strategy

Two independent reviewers systematically conducted a comprehensive search for relevant studies in major electronic medical databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. This search encompassed all records available up to February 1, 2024. The search strategy employed a targeted set of keywords aligned with the PICOS framework: "Plantar Fasciitis", "Platelet-Rich Plasma", "PRP", "Autologous Plasma", "Corticosteroids", "Steroids", "Methylprednisolone", "Betamethasone", "Dexamethasone", "pain relief", "healing rate", "functional improvement", "symptom reduction", "treatment outcomes", "Randomized Controlled Trials", "RCTs", and "Clinical Trials". This methodology was tailored to each database, with no specific filters applied.

Eligibility Criteria

The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (1) prospective RCTs; (2) Studies involving local injections of PRP and CSs; (3) reporting of at least one of the following outcomes: the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain assessment, the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores for functional evaluation, or the thickness of the plantar fascia. The thickness of the plantar fascia was measured using sonographic examination with a 5- to 12-MHz linear array transducer on heels, specifically in the longitudinal view from the anterior edge of the inferior calcaneal border; (4) Adult participants diagnosed with plantar fasciitis (aged 18 yrs or older); (5) studies in which injections were administered following at least 3 mos of unsuccessful conservative treatment.

The exclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (1) animal studies; (2) nonoriginal research articles, such as reviews or technical reports; (3) duplicate publications; (4) studies presented only as abstracts; and (5) studies involving patients with concomitant foot or ankle pathologies, such as rheumatoid arthritis, tarsal tunnel syndrome, or Achilles tendinopathy, which may contribute to pain beyond that caused by plantar fasciitis alone.

### Corticosteroid injection is the best treatment in plantar fasciitis if combined with controlled training [^111QPRiU]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Plantar fasciitis is a very common (lifetime incidence ~10%) and long-lasting injury with major impact on daily function. Combining corticosteroid injection and physical training (strength training and stretching) was hypothesized to result in a superior effect compared to each treatment separately.

Methods

A single blinded randomized controlled superiority trial conducted in 2013–2014 with a 2-year follow-up (end Sept 2016). 123 consecutive patients (20–65 years) referred to two study centers in Denmark: Institute of Sports Medicine, Bispebjerg Hospital, University of Copenhagen and a private rheumatology clinic with symptoms of plantar fasciitis, and ultrasound measured thickness above 4.0 mm were invited. 25 did not fulfill the inclusion criteria (mainly ultrasound criteria) and 8 refused participation. 90 patients were randomized (pulling sealed envelopes) to 3 groups: (1) 3 months strength training and stretching (n = 30), (2) corticosteroid injections with monthly intervals until thickness < 4.0 mm (maximum 3 injections) (n = 31), (3) combination of the two treatments (n = 29). During the 3 months intervention period load reduction was recommended (cushioning shoes and insoles and abstaining from running and jumping). The main outcome was improvement in Pain at function on a 100-mm VAS score and in Foot Function Index (FFI, range 0–230) at 6 months (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01994759).

Results

All groups improved significantly over time, but the combination of corticosteroid injection and training (strength training and stretching) had a superior effect at all time points. The mean difference between the combined treatment and training was 40 points in FFI (95% confidence interval (CI) 63–17 points, p < 0.001) and 20 mm for VAS function pain (CI 35–5 mm, p < 0.01). The mean difference between the combined treatment and corticosteroid injections only was 29 points in FFI (CI 52–7 points, p < 0.01) and 17 mm for VAS function pain (CI 32–2 mm, p < 0.05). All differences were clinically relevant.

Conclusion

The best treatment for plantar fasciitis is the combination of corticosteroid injections and training (strength training and stretching). This combined treatment is superior both in the short- and in the longterm. Corticosteroid injections combined with controlled training are recommended as first line treatment in patients with plantar fasciitis.

### Effectiveness of device-assisted ultrasound-guided steroid injection for treating plantar fasciitis [^112L2h8s]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of device-assisted ultrasound-guided steroid injection for treating plantar fasciitis.

Design

An ultrasound-guided injection device designed with space for securing a transducer and syringe was used to guide steroid injection. Patients with unilateral plantar fasciitis were enrolled and randomly divided into device-assisted ultrasound-guided and palpation-guided groups. Pain intensity was measured using a visual analog scale and tenderness threshold. Ultrasound and pain intensity evaluations were performed before injection and at 3 wks and at 3 mos postinjection. Betamethasone (7 mg) and 1% lidocaine (0.5 ml) were injected into the inflamed plantar fascia.

Results

Thirty-three patients who received either device-assisted ultrasound-guided or palpation-guided injection had significantly lower visual analog scale scores (P < 0.001) and higher tenderness threshold (P < 0.01) postinjection. However, the device-assisted group had higher tenderness threshold (9.02 ± 1.38 vs. 7.18 ± 2.11 kg/cm; P = 0.007), lower visual analog scale score (1.88 ± 2.13 vs. 3.63 ± 2.60; P = 0.046), and lower hypoechogenicity incidence in the plantar fascia (3/16 vs. 9/16; P = 0.033) than the palpation-guided group did at 3 mos postinjection. The heel pad was significantly thin (P = 0.004) in the palpation-guided group postinjection.

Conclusions

Device-assisted ultrasound-guided injection for treating plantar fasciitis results in better therapeutic outcomes than palpation-guided injection does.

### Plantar heel pain and fasciitis [^113bPH74]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Plantar heel pain causes soreness or tenderness of the sole of the foot under the heel, which sometimes extends into the medial arch. The prevalence and prognosis are unclear, but the symptoms seem to resolve over time in most people.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for plantar heel pain? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to January 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 15 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: casted orthoses (custom-made insoles), corticosteroid injection (alone, or plus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), extracorporeal shock wave therapy, heel cups, heel pads (alone or with corticosteroid injection), lasers, local anaesthetic injection (alone or with corticosteroid injection), night splints plus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, stretching exercises, surgery, taping, and ultrasound.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroids in the treatment of plantar fasciitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111T4b75]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We identified 24 RCTs comparing PRP and CS injections for the treatment of plantar fasciitis. Our meta-analysis found that, compared to CS injections, local injections of PRP provided better relief from pain and improvement in foot and ankle function at 3 to 6 mos.

Pain significantly affects the quality of life of patients with plantar fasciitis, and the VAS score is widely used to assess pain. Our meta-analysis found no difference in pain relief between PRP and CS at 1 mo. However, at 3 and 6 mos, PRP provided better pain relief than CS, while no difference was observed between them at 12 mos. Corticosteroids, with their strong anti-inflammatory effects, can accelerate pain relief and inhibit fibroblast proliferation and matrix protein expression, suggesting a reparative effect on the plantar fascia, which explains why CSs relieve pain in the early and middle stages of PF. PRP also contains many anti-inflammatory factors that can alleviate inflammation, hence the similar pain scores at 1 mo. However, pain in plantar fasciitis patients, especially in chronic cases, is mainly due to degeneration of the plantar fascia.PRP releases numerous growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factors, to initiate the repair and reconstruction process, which takes time, leading to the better pain relief from PRP at 3 and 6 mos. However, at 12 mos, the VAS scores for PRP and CS treatments converged, with only three studies reporting these outcomes, each showing different results. One study found that both PRP and CS injections continued to reduce VAS scores at 12 mos, indicating sustained effectiveness with no significant differences between the treatments. Another study demonstrated that PRP maintained its therapeutic effect at 12 mos, while the VAS scores in the CS group began to rebound, making PRP more effective at the 1-yr mark. The third study reported that although both PRP and CSs were effective in the first 6 mos, VAS scores increased in both groups at 12 mos, with no significant differences between the treatments. The recurrence of symptoms observed at 12 mos is understandable; CSs, known for their potent anti-inflammatory effects, typically provide relief within the first 4–12 wks, a period considered "short-term". After this period, the benefits of CSs diminish, likely because of reduced inflammation without addressing the underlying degenerative processes. Overuse of the foot following initial pain relief may exacerbate symptoms, as increased activity can worsen the underlying condition. Additionally, anatomical abnormalities inherent in plantar fasciitis, such as flat feet, high arches, and leg-length discrepancies, are not corrected by injections alone, contributing to the recurrence of pain. In contrast, PRP offers both anti-inflammatory properties and growth factors that promote tissue repair, explaining its superior performance over the medium term (3–6 mos). However, because PRP is typically administered as a single injection, the limited release of growth factors may not suffice to sustain long-term effects. The persistence of anatomical risk factors and overuse further contribute to the observed decline in efficacy at 12 mos. Therefore, more high-quality RCTs with standardized protocols and longer follow-up periods are needed to verify the long-term effects of PRP treatment for plantar fasciitis.

### Common painful foot and ankle conditions: a review [^116sXxzw]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Morton neuroma, plantar fasciitis, and Achilles tendinopathy are foot and ankle conditions that are associated with pain and disability, but they can respond to nonoperative treatment.

Observations

Morton neuroma, consisting of interdigital neuronal thickening and fibrosis, is characterized by burning pain in the ball of the foot and numbness or burning pain that may radiate to the affected toes (commonly the third and fourth toes). First-line nonoperative therapy consists of reducing activities that cause pain, orthotics, and interdigital corticosteroid injection; however, approximately 30% of patients may not respond to conservative treatment. Plantar fasciitis accounts for more than 1 million patient visits per year in the US and typically presents with plantar heel pain. Fifteen years after diagnosis, approximately 44% of patients continue to have pain. First-line nonoperative therapy includes stretching of the plantar fascia and foot orthotics, followed by extracorporeal shockwave therapy, corticosteroid injection, or platelet-rich plasma injection. Midportion Achilles tendinopathy presents with pain approximately 2 to 6 cm proximal to the Achilles insertion on the heel. The primary nonoperative treatment involves eccentric strengthening exercises, but extracorporeal shockwave therapy may be used.

Conclusions and Relevance

Morton neuroma, plantar fasciitis, and Achilles tendinopathy are painful foot and ankle conditions. First-line therapies are activity restriction, orthotics, and corticosteroid injection for Morton neuroma; stretching and foot orthotics for plantar fasciitis; and eccentric strengthening exercises for Achilles tendinopathy.

### Does a corticosteroid injection plus exercise or exercise alone add to the effect of patient advice and a heel cup for patients with plantar fasciopathy? A randomised clinical trial [^115bLban]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

Despite the positive preliminary benefits of HSR, the results of this trial do not support this as PAX was not superior to PA. Although more patients in PAX achieved PASS compared with patients in our most recent trial about HSR (8/59 and 4/70, respectively), HSR in PF remains questionable.

The statistically significant difference between PAXI and PA may result from the combined placebo effects of HSR and the injection. Even though the difference between the two groups was statistically significant, the difference did not exceed the minimal important difference of 14.1 points. A less conservative minimally important difference of FHSQ pain was calculated to be 12.5 points. Yet, this was still more than the between-group difference of 9.1 points which we found in our study. One thing to consider is that the minimally important difference was calculated in a different setting and among Australians using GROC that asks participants to rate improvement compared with the start of the treatment coupled with the FHSQ that asks participants about their current symptoms. The use of GROC has been criticised for introducing recall bias. However, there is no consensus on how to best calculate a minimally important difference. Although the difference between PAXI and PA not being clinically important, patients of PAXI were two times as likely to achieve PASS than patients of PA and PAX within 12 weeks with an NNT of 4.7 and 4.1, respectively, and the minimal important difference was within the 95% CI of the between-group difference. Therefore, there might be a benefit of combining an injection with HSR if patients are seeking improvement in the short term. Nevertheless, any differences diminished over time which should be considered in the shared decision-making process with patients.

Limitations

Due to the nature of the interventions, blinding the patients was impossible, and the patients likely perceived that recovery would be better in the groups receiving more. Almost half of the patients had experienced treatments before inclusion, and some were similar to those studied in this study. These participants may be non-responders to the trial interventions, and, thus, the overall change in outcomes observed is likely underestimated. Notwithstanding this, the frequency of these treatments was allocated similarly across groups, so their effect on between-group comparisons was minimised. Furthermore, approximately one-third of the patients did not respond to the questionnaires after 26 and 52 weeks which hampers the power of the long-term results.

### Extra corporeal shock wave therapy versus local corticosteroid injection in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis, a single blinded randomized clinical trial [^116opJZr]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Plantar fasciitis is a self-limiting condition, but can be painful and disabling. Among the different treatments which exist, corticosteroid injections are effective and popular. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is another treatment modality used for resistant conditions. In this study, the authors evaluated the efficacy of radial ESWT versus corticosteroid injections in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis.

Design

Randomized clinical trial.

Setting

Physical medicine and rehabilitation research center in a university hospital.

Subjects

Forty patients with plantar fasciitis who did not respond to conservative treatment.

Methods

Patients were allocated to radial ESWT with 2000 shock waves/session of 0.2mJ/mm² (n = 20) or local methylprednisolone injections (n = 20). Pain in the morning and during the day based on a visual analog scale (VAS), functional abilities using the foot function index (FFI), and satisfaction were evaluated before treatment and at 4 and 8 weeks after treatment.

Results

Patients (average age: 42.1 ± 8.20) received five sessions of ESWT or single steroid injection. Changes in the VAS in morning and during the day and the FFI throughout the study period were significant in both groups (P < 0.001). ESWT group had a higher reduction in VAS in morning and better function in FFI, but these changes were insignificant statistically [FFI decreased to 19.65 ± 21.26 points (67.4% improvement) in ESWT vs 31.50 ± 20.53 points (47.7%) in injection group at week 8, P = 0.072)]. Good or excellent results in the opinions of patients were achieved in 55% of ESWT and 30% of corticosteroid injection groups (P = 0.11).

Conclusion

Both interventions caused improvement in pain and functional ability 2 months after treatment. Although inter-group differences were not significant, the FFI was improved more with ESWT and patients were more satisfied with ESWT, thus shockwave therapy seems a safe alternative for management of chronic plantar fasciitis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of plantar fasciitis [^111QDiRD]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis, a self-limiting condition, is a common cause of heel pain in adults. It affects more than 1 million persons per year, and two-thirds of patients with plantar fasciitis will seek care from their family physician. Plantar fasciitis affects sedentary and athletic populations. Obesity, excessive foot pronation, excessive running, and prolonged standing are risk factors for developing plantar fasciitis. Diagnosis is primarily based on history and physical examination. Patients may present with heel pain with their first steps in the morning or after prolonged sitting, and sharp pain with palpation of the medial plantar calcaneal region. Discomfort in the proximal plantar fascia can be elicited by passive ankle/first toe dorsiflexion. Diagnostic imaging is rarely needed for the initial diagnosis of plantar fasciitis. Use of ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging is reserved for recalcitrant cases or to rule out other heel pathology; findings of increased plantar fascia thickness and abnormal tissue signal the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis. Conservative treatments help with the disabling pain. Initially, patient-directed treatments consisting of rest, activity modification, ice massage, oral analgesics, and stretching techniques can be tried for several weeks. If heel pain persists, then physician-prescribed treatments such as physical therapy modalities, foot orthotics, night splinting, and corticosteroid injections should be considered. Ninety percent of patients will improve with these conservative techniques. Patients with chronic recalcitrant plantar fasciitis lasting six months or longer can consider extracorporeal shock wave therapy or plantar fasciotomy.

### Positive effect of platelet-rich plasma on pain in plantar fasciitis: a double-blind multicenter randomized controlled trial [^112LYGYb]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

When nonoperative treatment for chronic plantar fasciitis fails, often a corticosteroid injection is given. Corticosteroid injection gives temporary pain reduction but no healing. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has proven to be a safe therapeutic option in the treatment of tendon, muscle, bone, and cartilage injuries.

Purpose

To determine the effectiveness of PRP as compared with corticosteroid injections for chronic plantar fasciitis.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

Patients with chronic plantar fasciitis were allocated to have steroid injection or PRP. The primary outcome measure was the Foot Function Index (FFI) Pain score. Secondary outcome measures were function, as scored by the FFI Activity, FFI Disability, and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society, and quality of life, as scored with the short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF). All outcomes were measured at baseline and at 4, 12, and 26 weeks and 1 year after the procedure.

Results

Of the 115 patients, 63 were allocated to the PRP group, of which 46 (73%) completed the study, and 52 were allocated to the control group (corticosteroid injection), of which 36 (69%) completed the study. In the control group, FFI Pain scores decreased quickly and then remained stable during follow-up. In the PRP group, FFI Pain reduction was more modest but reached a lower point after 12 months than the control group. After adjusting for baseline differences, the PRP group showed significantly lower pain scores at the 1-year follow-up than the control group (mean difference, 14.4; 95% CI, 3.2–25.6). The number of patients with at least 25% improvement (FFI Pain score) between baseline and 12-month follow-up differed significantly between the groups. Of the 46 patients in the PRP group, 39 (84.4%) improved at least 25%, while only 20 (55.6%) of the 36 in the control group showed such an improvement (P = 0.003). The PRP group showed significantly lower FFI Disability scores than the control group (mean difference, 12.0; 95% CI, 2.3–21.6).

Conclusion

Treatment of patients with chronic plantar fasciitis with PRP seems to reduce pain and increase function more as compared with the effect of corticosteroid injection.

Registration

### Ultrasound-guided injection of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid versus corticosteroid in management of plantar fasciitis: a 24-week randomized clinical trial [^115xHumj]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Kumai et alevaluated the efficacy of high molecular weight HA (H-HA), low molecular weight HA (L-HA) and a 0.01% HA (control group) injections in the treatment of recalcitrant PF. Patients were evaluated at baseline and 5 weeks after injection. Based on the obtained results, the improvement in the VAS score for pain in patients with PF was significantly greater in the H-HA group than in the control group. More noticeable improvement was achieved in the H-HA group compared with the L-HA group. Other measures such as Roles and Maudsley score, local symptoms, and FAAM, were also improved in each group, with the H-HA group having better results. Outcomes were also improved by an injection of 0.01% HA (control group); therefore, the injection itself may have possible improvement in pain and FAAM.

In summary, it can be stated that HA may be a proper choice for treating PF. These findings, like our study, showed the effectiveness of high molecular weight HA in the improvement of pain and function of patients with chronic PF.

So far, only one other study has been conducted to evaluate a single HA injection in the treatment of chronic PF.

Advantages of this study were using different outcome measures including VAS, FAAM, FFI, and PPT and measuring changes of plantar fascia thickness by US. Also, US-guided injection had the advantage of more precisely localizing the exact site of injection and doing the intervention with more accuracy.

For future studies, we recommend evaluating the efficacy of HA injection in special groups such as athletes with higher risk of plantar fascia rupture due to CS injection. Also, it is recommended enrolling larger number of patients. Although our follow-up was for 24 weeks, longer follow-ups and assessing the recurrence rate of PF would be recommended in upcoming studies.

### Effect of ultrasonography-guided corticosteroid injection vs placebo added to exercise therapy for achilles tendinopathy: a randomized clinical trial [^117KfNzY]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design

This was a 2-group, 2-site trial and a patient-blinded, investigator-blinded, and assessor-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled randomized superiority trial (see study protocol in Supplement 1). It was approved by the Greater Copenhagen Ethical Committee. Patients were included from a university clinic (Institute of Sports Medicine, University of Copenhagen) and from a local private rheumatology clinic between April 2016 and September 2018. The reporting of the study complies with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

Patients

All consecutive patients fulfilling the eligibility criteria were offered participation. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patient-reported insidious onset of pain in the Achilles tendon region that was aggravated by weight-bearing activities and was worse in the morning and/or during the initial phases of weight-bearing activities; (2) pain and swelling located 2 to 6 cm proximal to the Achilles tendon insertion; (3) musculoskeletal ultrasonography imaging of the Achilles tendon showing local thickening (anterior-posterior) of more than 7 mm or more than 20% larger compared with the asymptomatic side; (4) Achilles tendon pain for more than 3 months; (5) and age between 18 and 65 years.

Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) previous Achilles tendon surgery in the symptomatic lower limb; (2) known medical diseases (eg, diabetes or inflammatory rheumatic diseases); (3) previous corticosteroid injection for Achilles tendon pain within the past 6 months; (4) previous Achilles tendon rupture in the symptomatic lower limb; (5) body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) greater than 30; (6) pregnant or planning pregnancy; and (7) injury or abnormality of the foot, knee, hip, and/or back or any condition that may interfere with participation in the study. We examined 317 patients, and 153 did not fulfill the inclusion criteria, mainly because of other diagnoses (involvement of other tendons, heel fat pad, plantar fascia, or neuropathic pain), especially enthesopathy-bursitis (63 patients). An additional 64 patients were excluded for other reasons mainly related to other abnormalities or medical diseases that interfered with the treatment protocol. Details are depicted in Figure 1.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroids in the treatment of plantar fasciitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114rhgMF]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Meta-analysis of Fascia Thickness

A total of seven studies reported on fascia thickness following local injection treatment, involving 202 patients in the PRP group and 201 in the steroid group. The results of these pooled analyses are presented in Figure 6. They demonstrated that there were no significant differences in fascia thickness between the local PRP injection group and the local steroid injection group at the 1–1.5 mo (WMD = 0.34; 95% CI, −0.16 to 0.84; P = 0.18; I² = 84.25%), 3-mo (WMD = −0.20; 95% CI, −1.05 to 0.65; P = 0.64; I² = 94.92%), and 6-mo (WMD = −0.51; 95% CI, −1.02 to 0.01; P = 0.05; I² = 92.87%) follow-ups.

### Ultrasound-guided injection of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid versus corticosteroid in management of plantar fasciitis: a 24-week randomized clinical trial [^111MhgMA]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 94 patients were initially enrolled, of which 75 were included in this study. Using a computer program for random allocation, participants were randomly divided into two parallel groups of CS and HA injection (38 in the HA group and 37 in the CS group). However, within the time to 6-week follow-up, one patient in each group lost to follow-up and four patients in the HA group and six patients in the CS group discontinued the study due to lack of satisfactory efficacy despite the intervention (CS or HA) and continuation of the bothersome PF pain. They were eager to receive another intervention. These last patients' results recorded, and after excluding from the study, they received ESWT, physical therapy or CS injection depends on their first interventions. The endpoint results of these patients included into ITT analysis. As a result, collected data from 60 patients including 29 participants in the CS group and 31 ones in the HA group were finally analyzed at 24-week time (CONSORT flow chart Figure 2). In this study, 40 patients (53.4%) were women and 35 (46.6%) were men with a mean age of 41.04 ± 8.96 years (22–60 years). With respect to the difficulty level of the job, 9 patients were categorized in difficult job group (12.0%), 26 were housewives (34.6%), 5 were unemployed (6.6%) and 35 (46.6%) had jobs that were categorized as non-difficult. The average BMI calculated as weight/(height)² was 27.01 ± 1.97 in HA group and 27.71 ± 1.44 kg/m² in CS group. Mean duration of pain was 7.30 ± 3.50 (in months) in HA group and 6.92 ± 3.64 in CS group.

### Targeting the plantar fascia for corticosteroid injection [^112a8qQG]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is often a difficult condition to treat. It is related to repetitive strain of the fascia at its attachment to the heel bone. This condition quite often appears with the concomitant presence of a plantar calcaneal heel spur. Corticosteroid injection is a popular treatment choice for plantar fasciitis, and accurate localization of the injected medication is essential for successful resolution of symptoms after the injection. In the present brief technical communication, a method for targeting the attachment of the plantar fascia to the medial tubercle of the tuberosity of the calcaneus is described. The targeting method uses the lateral radiograph of the foot to aid in localization of the proximal attachment of the plantar fascia to the calcaneus.

### Terminating corticosteroid injection in tendinopathy? Hasta la vista, baby [^113LjquT]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

SYNOPSIS: Two recent randomized-controlled trials showed promising results of local corticosteroid injections combined with exercise therapy for Achilles tendinopathy and plantar fasciopathy. Should clinicians go back to using corticosteroid injections to treat tendinopathy? Are corticosteroids back (baby)? In this viewpoint we critically appraise the new evidence and humbly share our clinical reasoning when advising athletes about corticosteroid injections in practice. Our goal is to help clinicians decide what to do and what to recommend to patients. We prioritize the risk for higher recurrence rates and tendon rupture when weighing the reasonable treatment options for tendinopathy, and recommend against using corticosteroid injections. The best systematic review evidence shows that local corticosteroid injections are not effective for tendinopathies after the first few weeks, and produce worse long-term outcomes compared to other treatments. For now, we consider corticosteroid injections remain terminated. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2023;53(11):1–4. Epub: 28 July 2023. doi:10.2519/jospt.2023.11875.

### Ultrasound-guided injection of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid versus corticosteroid in management of plantar fasciitis: a 24-week randomized clinical trial [^115KXQ56]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Satisfaction

Patients' satisfaction was assessed at the end of the study based on the Likert scale from 1 to 5 (1 = Not satisfied at all, 5 = Very satisfied).

Data Analysis

The intention‐to‐treat (ITT) patients were defined as all included patients after randomization and before treatment commenced at 24-week follow-up. Statistical analysis of data was performed using SPSS software version 22 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). Chi-square (χ²) method and Fisher's exact test were used to compare qualitative data between groups. Student's t -test and ANOVA were used for comparing quantitative data, within and between groups. Comparison of the pre- and post-treatment data was done using paired t -test and repeated measurement methods. The two-tailed p-values less than 0.05 were considered as significant.

### Plantar heel pain and plantar fasciitis [^116EfPmX]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Plantar heel pain, also known as plantar fasciitis, causes soreness or tenderness of the sole of the foot under the heel, which sometimes extends into the medial arch. Pain associated with the condition may cause substantial disability and poor health-related quality of life. The prevalence and prognosis are unclear, but the symptoms seem to resolve over time in most people.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of conservative treatments for plantar heel pain? What are the effects of non-conservative treatments for plantar heel pain? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to November 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 162 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 84 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 39 studies and the further review of 45 full articles. Of the 45 full articles evaluated, five systematic reviews and nine RCTs were included at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for 30 PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for 12 interventions based on information relating to the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroid injection alone (both short-term and longer-term effects), corticosteroid injections plus local anaesthetic injection (both short-term and longer-term effects), customised foot orthoses, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, heel pads and cups, local anaesthetic injection alone, night splints, stretching exercises, surgery, and taping.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroids in the treatment of plantar fasciitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111emtY3]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of PRP versus CS treatment for plantar fasciitis remains controversial, as various randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have yielded conflicting results. While some studies have found no significant difference in efficacy between PRP and CSs, others have reported superior outcomes with PRP. Therefore, our study aims to compare the effectiveness of PRP and CSs in treating plantar fasciitis across the following three critical aspects: pain, foot function, and plantar fascia thickness — each of which represents a clinically relevant dimension of the condition. Pain is the primary and most debilitating symptom, directly affecting patients' quality of life. Foot function is crucial as it determines patients' ability to perform daily activities, which is often severely impaired in those with plantar fasciitis. Plantar fascia thickness serves as a measurable indicator of structural changes within the fascia, providing insights into the underlying pathophysiology and the treatment's impact on tissue morphology. By thoroughly assessing these dimensions, we aim to provide robust insights into the most suitable treatment method for this widespread and impactful condition.

### Platelet-rich plasma has better long-term results than corticosteroids or placebo for chronic plantar fasciitis: randomized control trial [^116amdAJ]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a supersaturated concentration of autologous platelets that augments the natural healing response of fascia. Previous studies have shown the superiority of PRP over corticosteroids (CS) for chronic plantar fasciitis. The aim of this study was to compare the pain and functional outcomes of PRP with CS and placebo injections for the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis. We conducted a 3-arm randomized controlled trial of 90 patients: PRP (n = 30 patients), CS (n = 30 patients), and placebo (n = 30 patients). The patients were followed at regular intervals until 18 months postinjection using validated instruments. The mean visual analog scale score showed significant improvement in all groups between baseline and 18-month follow-up (PRP: 8.2 vs 2.1; CS: 8.8 vs 3.6; placebo: 8.1 vs 5.4), with CS showing significantly better improvement than PRP in the short term, whereas longer-term PRP was significantly better than CS. The mean Roles and Maudley score showed significant improvement in all groups between baseline and 18-month follow-up (PRP: 1.7 vs 3.7; CS: 1.2 vs 3.1; placebo: 1.2 vs 2.0), with CS showing significantly better improvement than PRP in the short term, whereas longer-term PRP was significantly better than CS. The mean Short Form 12 score showed significant improvement in all groups between baseline and 18-month follow-up (PRP: 55.4 vs 80.2; CS: 56.2 vs 76.2; placebo: 54.1 vs 62.4). We found that all 3 groups showed significant improvement between baseline and end of the follow-up period with regard to pain, function, and general health. The CS arm showed better improvement in the short term, whereas the PRP arm showed better results in the long term. In contrast to previous studies, we found no significant drop-off effect of CS in the long term, which may be owing to background natural healing process of the disease. In summary, both PRP and CS are safe and effective treatment options for chronic plantar fasciitis, showing superior results to placebo treatment. The longer-term results and less reinjection and/or surgery rate of PRP makes it more attractive as an injection treatment option versus CS injection.

### Does a corticosteroid injection plus exercise or exercise alone add to the effect of patient advice and a heel cup for patients with plantar fasciopathy? A randomised clinical trial [^115JCCGv]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, all three groups had clinically meaningful improvements in the primary outcome after 12 weeks. Yet, no clinically relevant differences were found between the three treatment approaches, indicating no additional effect of exercises or injections compared with simple advice and a heel cup.
