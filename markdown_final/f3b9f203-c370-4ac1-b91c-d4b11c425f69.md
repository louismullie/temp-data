## Question

What dose of Norvasc is right for a 45 year old female weighing 250 pounds and 5 feet tall?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what dose of amlodipine (Norvasc) is appropriate for a 45-year-old woman who is 5 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds, with consideration of obesity, sex-specific edema risk, and guideline-based titration strategy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard adult dosing range and whether obesity mandates a different starting dose. Then, I should verify sex-specific considerations, especially peripheral edema risk. Next, I will review pharmacokinetics to see if body weight meaningfully alters exposure. After that, I need to check guideline-concordant titration intervals and blood pressure targets. Finally, I will consider comorbidities, drug interactions, and monitoring, and then synthesize a practical starting dose and titration plan with safety checks.

> Let me first confirm the standard adult dosing framework. The FDA labeling for amlodipine indicates a usual initial antihypertensive dose of 5 mg once daily, with a maximum of 10 mg once daily, and titration typically occurs after 7 to 14 days based on blood pressure response and tolerability, which aligns with contemporary guideline tables summarizing amlodipine 2.5–10 mg daily for hypertension [^117W3ZdE] [^111c5jRo].

> Wait, let me verify whether obesity changes the starting dose. I initially wondered if a higher BMI might necessitate a higher starting dose, but I should double-check the label and guidelines. The FDA labeling does not provide BMI- or weight-based dosing adjustments, and the pharmacokinetic sections emphasize that exposure is not significantly altered by renal impairment and that hepatic impairment — not obesity — is the scenario that warrants a lower starting dose, so there is no evidence-based requirement to start higher in obesity; in fact, starting high may worsen edema without added benefit, so I should not jump to a 10 mg start here [^117W3ZdE] [^113wX8vC] [^111c5jRo].

> I need to ensure I account for sex-specific tolerability. Women have a higher incidence of dose-related peripheral edema with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, so a conservative start is prudent. This supports beginning at 5 mg rather than 10 mg to mitigate edema risk while still achieving meaningful blood pressure lowering in most patients [^111c5jRo] [^114txBia].

> Next, I should review pharmacokinetics to see if body weight meaningfully alters exposure. Amlodipine has high protein binding and a long half-life with steady state in about 7–8 days. Weight-adjusted clearance and volume of distribution are similar to adults across pediatric and adult datasets, and there is no indication that obesity increases clearance or necessitates higher starting doses, reinforcing a standard 5 mg start in this patient [^113wX8vC] [^1124Lyhj].

> Hold on, I should verify the titration cadence and targets. The label advises waiting 7–14 days between dose changes, and contemporary guidelines emphasize initiating therapy and titrating to blood pressure targets, often < 130/80 mmHg depending on risk, with many patients requiring more than one agent. Given her elevated BMI and likely higher baseline blood pressure, I should anticipate potential need for combination therapy if monotherapy at 5–10 mg fails to reach goal [^117W3ZdE] [^116mdaAb].

> I will now examine special populations and comorbidities that could alter dosing. She is 45 years old, so she is not elderly and does not require the 2.5 mg geriatric start. Absent hepatic impairment, renal dysfunction, or heart failure, no dose reduction is indicated, though I should screen for these before finalizing the plan and monitor for edema, flushing, dizziness, and fatigue during titration [^117W3ZdE] [^113wX8vC].

> But wait, what if she has concomitant medications that interact with amlodipine. I should confirm CYP3A modulators and simvastatin status because strong CYP3A inhibitors can raise amlodipine levels and amlodipine can increase simvastatin exposure; if simvastatin is used, it should generally be limited to 20 mg daily when combined with amlodipine to mitigate myopathy risk, which may influence how aggressively I titrate amlodipine if edema or hypotension emerges [^116Vm5n1] [^1168NANS].

> Let me synthesize the dosing recommendation. Start amlodipine 5 mg once daily, reassess blood pressure and edema after 7–14 days, and if blood pressure remains above goal and she tolerates therapy, increase to 10 mg once daily. If peripheral edema limits uptitration, consider switching to or adding an ARB or ACE inhibitor rather than forcing the amlodipine dose higher, as combination therapy can maintain blood pressure control while mitigating edema risk [^117W3ZdE] [^113auBqh].

> I should confirm the monitoring and follow-up plan. Check home or clinic blood pressure within 1–2 weeks of initiation or dose change, screen for lower extremity edema, and review adherence and adverse effects. If blood pressure is ≥ 20/10 mmHg above goal or remains uncontrolled on maximally tolerated amlodipine, initiate guideline-directed combination therapy, commonly an ARB or ACE inhibitor with the calcium channel blocker, to improve attainment of targets [^117W3ZdE] [^116oPjqk].

> Final recommendation: Start amlodipine 5 mg once daily, titrate to 10 mg once daily after 7–14 days if needed and tolerated, and pivot to combination therapy if blood pressure remains above goal or if dose-limiting edema occurs. This approach balances efficacy, safety, and guideline-concordant care for a 45-year-old woman with obesity and no other dose-adjustment indications [^117W3ZdE] [^113auBqh].

The appropriate starting dose of Norvasc (amlodipine) for a 45-year-old female who is 5 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds is **5 mg once daily** [^117W3ZdE]. This dose is standard for adults regardless of weight or height, as amlodipine dosing is not adjusted for body size [^113wX8vC]. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 1–2 weeks, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily, the maximum recommended dose [^117W3ZdE]. Monitor for peripheral edema, dizziness, and fatigue, and adjust therapy as needed [^111c5jRo].

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations

Amlodipine pharmacokinetics are **not significantly influenced by body weight or height** [^1124Lyhj]. The drug is extensively metabolized in the liver, and its clearance is primarily hepatic; therefore, dosing is not adjusted based on body mass index (BMI) or body surface area [^113wX8vC]. The standard adult dosing regimen applies to patients of all body sizes, including those who are overweight or obese [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

According to the FDA and clinical guidelines, the **recommended starting dose** of amlodipine for hypertension in adults is **5 mg once daily** [^113uk1jt]. If blood pressure control is inadequate after 1–2 weeks, the dose may be increased to 10 mg once daily, which is the maximum recommended dose [^117W3ZdE]. This dosing regimen is consistent across patient populations, regardless of weight or height [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting standard dosing

Clinical studies have consistently demonstrated the efficacy and safety of **amlodipine** at **standard doses (5–10 mg daily)** in diverse patient populations, including those with varying body weights and heights [^1153DpPS]. No evidence suggests that overweight or obese patients require **dose adjustments** based on body size [^notfound]. Amlodipine's antihypertensive effect is dose-dependent within the recommended range, and the standard dosing regimen effectively controls blood pressure in most patients [^115Ln5Wj].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

While **amlodipine** is generally well-tolerated, it is associated with dose-related **peripheral edema**, dizziness, and fatigue [^111c5jRo]. These side effects are more common at higher doses (10 mg daily) and may necessitate dose adjustment or alternative antihypertensive therapy. Patients with **hepatic impairment** or elderly individuals may require lower starting doses (2.5 mg daily) due to increased drug exposure and slower clearance [^113C3kkn].

---

## Monitoring and dose adjustment

Regular monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and renal function is essential during **amlodipine therapy** [^notfound]. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 1–2 weeks of therapy, the dose may be increased to **10 mg daily**, provided the patient tolerates the medication well [^117W3ZdE]. If adverse effects occur, consider dose reduction or **alternative antihypertensive therapy** [^115FxvjK].

### Pharmacodynamic (hemodynamic) and pharmacokinetic comparisons of S-amlodipine gentisate and racemate amlodipine besylate in healthy Korean male volunteers: two double-blind, randomized, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence, double-dummy, single-dose crossover studies [^111YG2in]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

S-amlodipine gentisate, consisting entirely of the (S)-enantiomer, was developed to increase the potency and improve the safety profile of amlodipine. Regulatory requirements for marketing of S-amlodipine gentisate in Korea require comparison of this agent versus amlodipine racemate.

Objective

This study was conducted to compare the pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of the S-amlodipine formulation (S-amlodipine gentisate) and amlodipine racemate (amlodipine besylate).

Methods

This study consisted of 2 separate substudies; PD and PK parameters were evaluated separately. Both studies were conducted using a doubleblind, randomized, 2-period, 2-treatment, 2-sequence, double-dummy, single-dose crossover design with S-amlodipine 5 mg and amlodipine racemate 10 mg, separated by a 2-week washout period. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were measured in the sitting position before dosing and at 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 24, 48, and 72 hours after oral administration of S-amlodipine or amlodipine racemate. Impedance cardiography parameters (stroke volume, cardiac index, and systemic vascular resistance) were measured before and at 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12 hours after dosing. For PK assessments, serial blood samples were collected before dosing and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 hours after dosing, and drug concentrations were determined by HPLC-MS/MS. Adverse events (AEs) were collected using self-report or general health-related questions.

Results

The PD study included 24 healthy men (mean [SD] age, 23.1 [3.1] years; weight, 69.2 [6.1] kg), and the PK study included 24 different healthy men (mean age, 25.1 [2.1] years; weight, 65.9 [5.9] kg). There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups in terms of systolic BP, diastolic BP, or heart rate by repeated-measures ANOVA. Likewise, in the analysis of impedance cardiography, the treatment groups did not display any significant differences in stroke volume, cardiac index, or systemic vascular resistance by repeatedmeasures ANOVA. The mean (SD) AUC(0-last) was 129.7 (62.8) ng. h/mL after dosing with S-amlodipine and 129.0 (59.6) ng. h/mL after dosing with amlodipine racemate. The geometric mean ratio (S-amlodipine: amlodipine racemate) of the S-amlodipine AUC(0-last) was 1.01 (90% CI, 0.90–1.13). In the PD study, 4 AEs in 3 volunteers (3/24; 12.5%) and 8 AEs in 5 volunteers (5/24; 20.8%) were reported after dosing with S-amlodipine and amlodipine racemate, respectively. In the PK study, 18 AEs in 11 volunteers (11/24; 45.8%) and 20 AEs in 9 volunteers (9/24; 37.5%) were reported after dosing with S-amlodipine and amlodipine racemate, respectively. Five volunteers reported AEs after dosing with both S-amlodipine and amlodipine racemate. For the PD and PK studies combined, 30 AEs were judged to be possibly related to S-amlodipine (16 cases) or amlodipine racemate (14 cases). Twenty AEs were judged not to be related to S-amlodipine (6 cases) or amlodipine racemate (14 cases). The most common AEs considered at least possibly related to the study drug in both studies were headache (18 cases) and nausea (3 cases).

Conclusions

In these single-dose studies, no significant differences were found in PD (hemodynamic) or PK parameters between S-amlodipine 5 mg and amlodipine racemate 10 mg. S-amlodipine had a safety profile comparable to that of amlodipine racemate in these healthy male volunteers.

### The combination of olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine besylate in controlling high blood pressure: COACH, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week factorial efficacy and safety study [^1147sNPp]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension guidelines recommend the use of 2 agents having complementary mechanisms of action when > 1 agent is needed to achieve blood pressure (BP) goals.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of combinations of olmesartan medoxomil (OM) and amlodipine besylate with those of the component monotherapies in patients with mild to severe hypertension.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, factorial study. Patients who were naive to antihypertensive therapy or who underwent a washout of previous antihypertensive therapy for up to 2 weeks and had a seated diastolic BP (SeDBP) of 95 to 120 mm Hg were randomized to receive 1 of the following for 8 weeks: OM 10, 20, or 40 mg; amlodipine (AML) 5 or 10 mg; each possible combination of OM and AML; or placebo. The primary end point was the change from baseline in SeDBP at week 8, with secondary end points including the change in seated systolic blood pressure (SeSBP), the proportion of patients reaching the BP goal (< 140/90 mm Hg; < 130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes), and the proportions of the intention-to-treat population reaching BP thresholds of < 120/80, < 130/80, < 130/85, and < 140/90 mm Hg. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated, with a particular focus on the incidence and severity of edema.

Results

Of the 1940 randomized patients, 54.3% were male. The mean age of the study population was 54.0 years and 19.8% were aged ≥ 65 years. The mean baseline BP was 164/102 mm Hg, and 79.3% of patients had stage 2 hypertension. Combination therapy with OM and AML was associated with dose-dependent reductions in SeDBP (from -13.8 mm Hg with OM/AML 10/5 mg to -19.0 mm Hg with OM/AML 40/10 mg) and SeSBP (from -23.6 mm Hg with OM/AML 20/5 mg to -30.1 mm Hg with OM/AML 40/10 mg) that were significantly greater than the reductions with the corresponding component monotherapies (P < 0.001). At week 8, the number of patients achieving the BP goal ranged from 57 of 163 (35.0%) to 84 of 158 (53.2%) in the combination-therapy groups, from 32 of 160 (20.0%) to 58 of 160 (36.3%) in the OM monotherapy groups, and from 34 of 161 (21.1%) to 53 of 163 (32.5%) in the AML monotherapy groups (P < 0.005, combination therapies vs component monotherapies), compared with 14 of 160 (8.8%) in the placebo group. Achievement of the BP thresholds was highest in the combination-therapy groups, with 56.3% and 54.0% of patients achieving a BP < 140/90 mm Hg with OM/AML 20/10 and 40/10 mg, respectively. Combination therapy was generally well tolerated, and no unexpected safety concerns emerged in the course of the study. The most common adverse events were edema (ranging from 9.9% [OM 20 mg] to 36.8% [AML 10 mg], compared with 12.3% with placebo) and headache (ranging from 2.5% [OM/AML 10/5 mg] to 8.7% [OM 20 mg], compared with 14.2% with placebo).

Conclusion

The combination of OM and AML was effective and well tolerated in this adult population with hypertension.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

Amlodipine reaches peak plasma concentration (Cmax) within 6.5 hours following oral administration of NORLIQVA. Absolute bioavailability of amlodipine has been estimated to be between 64 and 90%.

Effect of food

Administration with a high- fat, high-calorie meal did not have a significant effect on the Cmaxand AUC of NORLIQVA.

Distribution

Ex vivo studies have shown that approximately 93% of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. Steady-state plasma levels of amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing.

Elimination

Metabolism

Amlodipine is extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine

Excretion

Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with a mean terminal elimination half-life of 52 hours.

Specific Populations

Geriatric Patients

The renal clearance of amlodipine is lower in elderly patients compared to younger adults. This results in increase in AUC of approximately 40–60% [see Dosage & Administration (2.1)].

Pediatric Patients

Sixty-two hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years received doses of amlodipine between 1.25 mg and 20 mg. Weight-adjusted clearance and volume of distribution were similar to values in adults.

13.3 Developmental Toxicity Studies

Studies with A mlodipine

No evidence of teratogenicity or other embryo/fetal toxicity was found when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated orally with amlodipine maleate at doses of up to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (respectively, about 10 and 20 times the MRHD of 10 mg amlodipine on a mg/m2basis) during their respective periods of major organogenesis. (Calculations based on a patient weight of 60 kg.) However, litter size was significantly decreased (by about 50%) and the number of intrauterine deaths was significantly increased (about 5-fold) for rats receiving amlodipine maleate at a dose equivalent to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day for 14 days before mating and throughout mating and gestation. Amlodipine maleate has been shown to prolong both the gestation period and the duration of labor in rats at this dose. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Amlodipine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Studies with V alsartan

No teratogenic effects were observed when valsartan was administered to pregnant mice and rats at oral doses of up to 600 mg/kg/day and to pregnant rabbits at oral doses of up to 10 mg/kg/day. However, significant decreases in fetal weight, pup birth weight, pup survival rate, and slight delays in developmental milestones were observed in studies in which parental rats were treated with valsartan at oral, maternally toxic (reduction in body weight gain and food consumption) doses of 600 mg/kg/day during organogenesis or late gestation and lactation. In rabbits, fetotoxicity (i.e., resorptions, litter loss, abortions, and low body weight) associated with maternal toxicity (mortality) was observed at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg/day. The no observed adverse effect doses of 600, 200, and 2 mg/kg/day in mice, rats and rabbits, respectively, are about 9, 6, and 0.1 times the MRHD of 320 mg/day on a mg/m2basis. (Calculations based on a patient weight of 60 kg.)

### Evaluation of the efficacy and tolerability of fixed-dose combination therapy of azilsartan and amlodipine besylate in Japanese patients with grade I to II essential hypertension [^1124acEU]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for the management of hypertension recommend using drugs with different mechanisms of action in antihypertensive regimens that include simple single-pill fixed-dose combination (FDC) products.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of the FDC of azilsartan (AZI) and amlodipine besylate (AML) with those of AZI monotherapy and AML monotherapy in Japanese patients with grade 1 to 2 essential hypertension.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. After receiving placebo during a 4-week run-in period in a single-blind manner, patients were randomized to receive 1 of the following 5 treatments for 8 weeks: FDC containing AZI 20 mg and AML 5 mg (AZI/AML 20/5 mg), FDC containing AZI 20 mg and AML 2.5 mg (AZI/AML 20/2.5 mg), AZI 20 mg, AML 5 mg, or AML 2.5 mg once daily in a fasting or fed state. The primary end point was the change from baseline (week 0) in the seated trough diastolic blood pressure at week 8 (last observation carried forward [LOCF]), and the secondary end point was the change from baseline in the seated trough systolic blood pressure at week 8 (LOCF). Tolerability was assessed based on adverse events, vital signs, and physical examination findings.

Results

Of the 800 patients who provided informed consent, 603 were randomized to receive AZI/AML 20/5 mg (150 patients), AZI/AML 20/2.5 mg (151 patients), AZI 20 mg (151 patients), AML 5 mg (75 patients), or AML 2.5 mg (76 patients). The mean baseline systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 160.7/100.3 mm Hg. The mean change from baseline in seated blood pressure at week 8 (LOCF) was -35.3/-22.3 mm Hg in the AZI/AML 20/5 mg group and -31.4/-19.2 mm Hg in the AZI/AML 20/2.5 mg group, indicating a reduction significantly greater than that in corresponding monotherapy groups (-21.5/-13.9 mm Hg in the AZI 20 mg group, -26.4/-15.5 mm Hg in the AML 5 mg group, and -19.3/-11.6 mm Hg in the AML 2.5 mg group; p < 0.0001 for all contrast tests). No remarkable difference was found in the incidences of adverse events, vital signs, and physical examination findings among the treatment groups.

Conclusion

This study found that the FDC of AZI/AML 20/5 mg and 20/2.5 mg exhibited greater antihypertensive effects compared with each monotherapy. The FDC of AZI/AML had a similar safety profile to that of each monotherapy and was tolerable to Japanese patients with grade 1 to 2 essential hypertension.

### Randomized, controlled, parallel-group comparison of ambulatory and clinic blood pressure responses to amlodipine or enalapril during and after treatment in adult Chinese patients with hypertension [^112D2eMT]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Few studies have examined the relative efficacy and tolerability of antihypertensive drug classes in Chinese populations.

Objective

This study compared the efficacy, tolerability, and duration of antihypertensive effect of amlodipine besylate and enalapril in Chinese patients with hypertension, including elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension.

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group dose-titration study was conducted at the Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Chinese University of Hong Kong. Chinese patients aged 18 to 80 years with primary hypertension were enrolled. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, patients were randomly assigned to receive active oral, once-daily treatment with amlodipine (5 mg) or with enalapril (5 mg) for 14 weeks. Treatment doses were titrated at weeks 4 and 8 if necessary according to blood pressure (BP) response and if the dose had been tolerated. Patients also underwent 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) at the end of the placebo run-in, after the first and last doses of active treatment, and 48 hours after discontinuation of treatment to determine the duration of drug action and to mimic the effect of 2 missed doses.

Results

Eighty patients were recruited for the study (26 men, 54 women; mean [SD] age, 60.5 [11.6] years) (40 patients per group). Thirty-seven patients in each group completed the active treatment phase. Baseline trough BPs were similar: 167.7 (15.0)/94.6 (9.7) mm Hg in the amlodipine group and 168.6 (11.9)/93.4 (9.5) mm Hg in the enalapril group. After 14 weeks of treatment, amlodipine (mean [SD] final dose, 6.3 [2.3] mg) produced greater reductions than enalapril (mean [SD] final dose, 13.3 [6.6] mg) in trough BP (-20.8 [13.2]/-9.2 [9.0] vs -5.5 [14.9]/-3.2 [10.6] mm Hg, respectively; P ≤ 0.01). Most of the effect of amlodipine persisted for 72 hours after the last dose (-18.9 [14.6]/-11.1 [11.7] mm Hg), but enalapril had no significant antihypertensive effect at 72 hours (-1.3 [12.3]/-1.8 [9.1] mm Hg). Similar observations were found with ABPM recordings. Cough was reported in 5 patients (12.5%) and 13 patients (32.5%) in the amlodipine and enalapril groups, respectively, but was thought to be treatment related in only 6 patients (15.0%), all in the enalapril group. One of the patients in the enalapril group withdrew from the study because of cough, and 1 patient in the amlodipine group withdrew because of ankle edema.

14.1 Effects in Hypertension

Adult Patients

The antihypertensive efficacy of NORVASC has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on NORVASC and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo‑corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24‑hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect. Tolerance was not demonstrated in patients studied for up to 1 year. The 3 parallel, fixed dose, dose response studies showed that the reduction in supine and standing blood pressures was dose‑related within the recommended dosing range. Effects on diastolic pressure were similar in young and older patients. The effect on systolic pressure was greater in older patients, perhaps because of greater baseline systolic pressure. Effects were similar in black patients and in white patients.

Pediatric Patients

Two hundred sixty-eight hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years were randomized first to NORVASC 2.5 or 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then randomized again to the same dose or to placebo for another 4 weeks. Patients receiving 2.5 mg or 5 mg at the end of 8 weeks had significantly lower systolic blood pressure than those secondarily randomized to placebo. The magnitude of the treatment effect is difficult to interpret, but it is probably less than 5 mmHg systolic on the 5 mg dose and 3.3 mmHg systolic on the 2.5 mg dose. Adverse events were similar to those seen in adults.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of amlodipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase of AUC of approximately 40–60%, and a lower initial dose may be required (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

5.1 Fetal Toxicity

Amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil as soon as possible [see Use in S pecific Populations (8.1)].

5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients

Olmesartan medoxomil. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics) symptomatic hypotension may be anticipated after initiation of treatment with olmesartan medoxomil. Initiate treatment with amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil under close medical supervision. If hypotension does occur, place the patient in the supine position and, if necessary, give an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.

Amlodipine. Symptomatic hypotension is possible, particularly in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Because of the gradual onset of action, acute hypotension is unlikely.

5.3 Increased Angina or Myocardial Infarction

Patients, particularly those with severe obstructive coronary artery disease, may develop increased frequency, duration, or severity of angina or acute myocardial infarction on starting calcium channel blocker therapy or at the time of dosage increase. The mechanism of this effect has not been elucidated.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Exforge was studied in 2 placebo-controlled and 4 active-controlled trials in hypertensive patients. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a total of 1012 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension received treatments of 3 combinations of amlodipine and valsartan (5/80, 5/160, 5/320 mg) or amlodipine alone (5 mg), valsartan alone (80, 160, or 320 mg) or placebo. All doses with the exception of the 5/320 mg dose were initiated at the randomized dose. The high dose was titrated to that dose after a week at a dose of 5/160 mg. At week 8, the combination treatments were statistically significantly superior to their monotherapy components in reduction of diastolic and systolic blood pressures.

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a total of 1246 patients with mild to moderate hypertension received treatments of 2 combinations of amlodipine and valsartan (10/160, 10/320 mg), or amlodipine alone (10 mg), valsartan alone (160 or 320 mg) or placebo. With the exception of the 10/320 mg dose, treatment was initiated at the randomized dose. The high dose was initiated at a dose of 5/160 mg and titrated to the randomized dose after 1 week. At week 8, the combination treatments were statistically significantly superior to their monotherapy components in reduction of diastolic and systolic blood pressures.

ACEIs with CCB

In patients with both diabetes and hypertension, ACEIs provide clinical benefits that appear to be independent of BP reduction. In the Fosinopril vs Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events Trial (FACET) in patients with hypertension and diabetes those receiving fosinopril were approximately 50% less likely to experience a major cardiovascular event than those receiving amlodipine when followed for up to 3.5 years. The number of observed vascular events was even lower in those who received combination. Similarly in Effects of Antihypertensive Agents on Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Coronary Disease and Normal Blood Pressure (CAMELOT) 2 years of treatment with amlodipine significantly reduced the incidence of CV adverse events. The ANDI study demonstrated that in hypertensive patients with diabetes whose BP was not controlled with 20 mg quinapril alone, initiation of combination therapy by adding 5 mg amlodipine besylate to quinapril 20 mg was more effective in reducing BP than increasing the dose of quinapril to 40 mg.

### Comparative efficacy and safety profile of amlodipine 5 mg / losartan 50 mg fixed-dose combination and amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy in hypertensive patients who respond poorly to amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy: an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind phase III noninferiority study [^1135h2YB]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The number of hypertensive patients achieving treatment targets is not ideal with therapies that engage a single mechanism of action, and combination therapies using different mechanisms of action can increase drug efficacy in a synergistic way.

Objective

This noninferiority study compared the clinical efficacy and safety profile of fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg and amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy in essential hypertensive patients who respond poorly to amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy.

Methods

This was a double-blind, multicenter, randomized trial of hypertensive patients (N = 185) aged ≥ 18 years taking amlodipine 5 mg during the run-in treatment period but failed to achieve sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 90 mm Hg. After randomization into the amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg fixed-dose combination group (n = 92) and the amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy group (n = 93), treatment was maintained without dose escalation for 8 weeks. The noninferiority margin was prespecified as 4 mm Hg after 8 weeks of treatment for the difference of the average change in DBP between treatments. The primary efficacy evaluation of noninferiority was tested using a confidence interval approach with a 97.5% 1-sided lower confidence limit using the average difference in DBP measured at baseline and 8 weeks.

Results

After 8 weeks, the DBP of both groups decreased from baseline by 8.9 (6.1) and 9.4 (7.5) mm Hg, respectively (difference = -0.5 [6.9] mm Hg, 95% CI: -2.5 to 1.5). Secondary end points of reductions in DBP after 4 weeks (-8.1 [6.7] vs -9.9 [7.3] mm Hg, difference = -1.8 mm Hg, 95% CI: -3.9 to 0.2) and sitting systolic blood pressure after 4 (-10.2 [11.8] vs -12.8 [10.2] mm Hg, difference = -2.6 mm Hg, 95% CI: -5.9 to 0.6) and 8 weeks (-12.2 [11.0] vs -13.4 [11.3] mm Hg, difference = -1.2 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.4 to 2.1) were comparable between the 2 treatment groups. There were 38 adverse events in 20 patients (21.7%) in the amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg fixed-dose combination group and 31 in 24 patients (26.1%) in the amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy group; most were mild. There were 7 adverse events in 6 patients (6.5%) related to treatment in the fixed-dose combination group and 13 in 10 patients (10.9%) in the monotherapy group (P = 0.30).

Conclusions

Fixed-dose combination amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg was not inferior in terms of reductions in DBP after 8 weeks of treatment and had comparable safety profile to amlodipine 10 mg in patients who did not respond to amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00940667.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

General Considerations:

Majority of effect attained within 2 weeks (2.1)
May be administered with other antihypertensive agents (2.1)

Hypertension:

May be used as add-on therapy for patients not controlled on monotherapy (2.2)
Patients who experience dose-limiting adverse reactions on monotherapy may be switched to amlodipine and valsartan tablets containing a lower dose of that component (2.2)
May be substituted for titrated components (2.3)
When used as initial therapy: Initiate with 5/160 mg, then titrate upwards as necessary to a maximum of 10/320 mg once daily (2.4)

2.1 General Considerations

Dose once daily. The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of one 10/320 mg tablet once daily as needed to control blood pressure. The majority of the antihypertensive effect is attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy or a change in dose.

Amlodipine and valsartan tablets may be administered with or without food.

Amlodipine and valsartan tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

2.2 Add-on Therapy

A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with amlodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker) alone or with valsartan (or another angiotensin II receptor blocker) alone may be switched to combination therapy with amlodipine and valsartan tablets.

A patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions on either component alone may be switched to amlodipine and valsartan tablets containing a lower dose of that component in combination with the other to achieve similar blood pressure reductions. The clinical response to amlodipine and valsartan tablets should be subsequently evaluated and if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 3 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a maximum of 10/320 mg.

2.3 Replacement Therapy

For convenience, patients receiving amlodipine and valsartan from separate tablets may instead wish to receive amlodipine and valsartan tablets containing the same component doses.

2.4 Initial Therapy

A patient may be initiated on amlodipine and valsartan tablets if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is amlodipine and valsartan tablets 5/160 mg once daily in patients who are not volume-depleted.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets are indicated in patients for whom treatment with both amlodipine and atorvastatin is appropriate.

Amlodipine

1.1 Hypertension

Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including amlodipine.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Amlodipine may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

### Telmisartan and amlodipine [^114VYmzt]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.4 Initial Therapy

A patient may be initiated on telmisartan and amlodipine tablets if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose of telmisartan and amlodipine tablet is 40/5 mg once daily. Patients requiring larger blood pressure reductions may be started on telmisartan and amlodipine tablet 80/5 mg once daily.

Initial therapy with telmisartan and amlodipine tablet is not recommended in patients ≥ 75 years old or with hepatic impairment [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.5), WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4), and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.5, 8.6)].

Correct imbalances of intravascular volume- or salt-depletion, before initiating therapy with telmisartan and amlodipine tablets [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)].

2.5 Dosing in Specific Populations

Renal Impairment

No initial dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Titrate slowly in patients with severe renal impairment.

Hepatic Impairment

In most patients, initiate amlodipine therapy at 2.5 mg. Titrate slowly in patients with hepatic impairment.

Patients 75 Years of Age and Older

In most patients, initiate amlodipine therapy at 2.5 mg. Titrate slowly in patients 75 years of age and older.

Amlodipine and valsartan tablets may be used in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on either monotherapy.

Amlodipine and valsartan tablets may also be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals.

The choice of amlodipine and valsartan tablets as initial therapy for hypertension should be based on an assessment of potential benefits and risks including whether the patient is likely to tolerate the lowest dose of amlodipine and valsartan tablets.

Special Populations

Geriatric

Studies with Amlodipine: Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in peak plasma levels, elimination half-life and AUC.

Studies with Valsartan: Exposure (measured by AUC) to valsartan is higher by 70% and the half-life is longer by 35% in the elderly than in the young. No dosage adjustment is necessary.

Gender

Studies with Valsartan: Pharmacokinetics of valsartan does not differ significantly between males and females.

Renal Insufficiency

Studies with Amlodipine: The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine is not significantly influenced by renal impairment.

Studies with Valsartan: There is no apparent correlation between renal function (measured by creatinine clearance) and exposure (measured by AUC) to valsartan in patients with different degrees of renal impairment. Consequently, dose adjustment is not required in patients with mild-to-moderate renal dysfunction. No studies have been performed in patients with severe impairment of renal function (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/min). Valsartan is not removed from the plasma by hemodialysis. In the case of severe renal disease, exercise care with dosing of valsartan.

Hepatic Insufficiency

Studies with Amlodipine: Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting increase in AUC of approximately 40% to 60%.

Olmesartan shows linear pharmacokinetics following single oral doses of up to 320 mg and multiple oral doses of up to 80 mg. Steady-state levels of olmesartan are achieved within 3 to 5 days and no accumulation in plasma occurs with once-daily dosing.

Geriatric

The pharmacokinetic properties of amlodipine and olmesartan medoxomil tablets in the elderly are similar to those of the individual components.

Amlodipine. Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in AUC of approximately 40% to 60%, and a lower initial dose may be required.

Olmesartan medoxomil. The pharmacokinetics of olmesartan medoxomil were studied in the elderly (≥ 65 years). Overall, maximum plasma concentrations of olmesartan were similar in young adults and the elderly. Modest accumulation of olmesartan was observed in the elderly with repeated dosing; AUCѕѕ,τwas 33% higher in elderly patients, corresponding to an approximate 30% reduction in CLR.

Pediatric

Amlodipine. Sixty-two hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years received doses of amlodipine between 1.25 mg and 20 mg. Weight-adjusted clearance and volume of distribution were similar to values in adults.

Background

Systolic hypertension is the most common form of hypertension, particularly in people aged > 60 years. Caused by decreased compliance of large arteries, systolic hypertension is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have demonstrated that it is more important to control systolic blood pressure (SBP) than diastolic blood pressure (DBP).

Objective

The objective of this study was to perform a systematic literature review to examine the effectiveness of amlodipine in lowering SBP in a variety of patient subgroups and clinical settings.

Methods

The literature review methodology included identifying, selecting, appraising, extracting, and synthesizing primary research studies. Following an a priori protocol, published literature was searched from 1980 to 2001 using 3 electronic databases. A manual review of the reference lists of recent review articles and all accepted studies was performed. Parallel-group, randomized, controlled trials that included at least 10 adults with baseline hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg, DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, or both), included at least 1 arm randomized to initial treatment with amlodipine monotherapy, had a minimum treatment duration of 8 weeks, and reported baseline and end-point blood pressure were included.

Results

Of 696 citations identified, 85 primary studies met all inclusion criteria. Comparable treatment arms were pooled, and weightd mean SBP was calculated. In the amlodipine monotherapy arms, which included > 5000 patients, SBP decreased by a mean of 17.5 mm Hg from baseline. The effect of amlodipine in reducing SBP was greater in elderly patients (age ≥ 60 years) and patients with author-defined isolated systolic hypertension. The dose was titrated to achieve the target blood pressure in 73 of 89 amlodipine treatment arms, whereas 16 treatment arms reported fixed doses. The median daily dose was 5 mg (range, 1.25–15 mg) in both the fixed-dose and dose-titration groups.

Conclusions

In this review of the published literature, amlodipine monotherapy was effective in reducing SBP. Antihypertensive agents such as amlodipine warrant consideration for the management of patients with inadequately controlled SBP.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Amlodipine. Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing.

With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105 to 114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90 to 104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/-2 mmHg).

In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.

As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when co-administered with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normals or well-compensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects.

Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed.

Olmesartan medoxomil. Olmesartan medoxomil doses of 2.5 mg to 40 mg inhibit the pressor effects of angiotensin I infusion. The duration of the inhibitory effect was related to dose, with doses of olmesartan medoxomil > 40 mg giving > 90% inhibition at 24 hours.

Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II and plasma renin activity (PRA) increase after single and repeated administration of olmesartan medoxomil to healthy subjects and hypertensive patients. Repeated administration of up to 80 mg olmesartan medoxomil had minimal influence on aldosterone levels and no effect on serum potassium.

Olmesartan medoxomil and Hydrochlorothiazide. No teratogenic effects were observed when 1.6:1 combinations of olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide were administered to pregnant mice at oral doses up to 1625 mg/kg/day (122 times the MRHD on a mg/m2basis) or pregnant rats up to 1625 mg/kg/day (243 times the MRHD on a mg/m2basis) or pregnant rabbits at oral doses up to 1 mg/kg/day (0.3 times the MRHD on a mg/m2basis). In rats, however, fetal body weights at 1625 mg/kg/day (a toxic, sometimes lethal dose in the dams) were significantly lower than control. The no observed effect dose for developmental toxicity in rats is 162.5 mg/kg/day, about 24 times, on a mg/m2basis, the MRHD of 40 mg olmesartan medoxomil/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide/day. (Calculations based on a 60 kg patient.)

Amlodipine. No evidence of teratogenicity or other embryo/fetal toxicity was found when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated orally with amlodipine maleate at doses of up to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (respectively about 10 and 20 times the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg amlodipine on a mg/m2basis) during their respective periods of major organogenesis (calculations based on a patient weight of 60 kg). However, litter size was significantly decreased (by about 50%) and the number of intrauterine deaths was significantly increased (about 5-fold) in rats receiving amlodipine maleate at a dose equivalent to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day for 14 days before mating and throughout mating and gestation. Amlodipine maleate has been shown to prolong both the gestational period and the duration of labor in rats at this dose. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Amlodipine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Hydrochlorothiazide. Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. There is a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Amlodipine

Clinical studies of amlodipine besylate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase of AUC of approximately 40% to 60% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The recommended starting dose of amlodipine 2.5 mg is not an available strength with amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide [see Clinical Studies (14)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Safety and effectiveness of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) have not been established. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (CrCl 60 to 90 mL/min) or moderate (CrCl 30 to 60 mL/min) renal impairment.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Amlodipine

Exposure to amlodipine is increased in patients with hepatic insufficiency. The recommended initial dose of amlodipine in patients with hepatic impairment is 2.5 mg, which is not an available strength with amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Amlodipine besylate [^116mdaAb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Amlodipine besylate tablets is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including Amlodipine besylate tablets.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

### Results of a phase III, 8-week, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial to assess the effects of amlodipine camsylate versus amlodipine besylate in Korean adults with mild to moderate hypertension [^113boLa5]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Amlodipine besylate has been used in Korea for the treatment of hypertension for > 17 years, with well-established efficacy and tolerability. Amlodipine camsylate is a newer formulation developed for generic use. It has been assessed in terms of physical stability and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and been found to be effective in lowering blood pressure in preclinical and Phase I and II trials. However, to date, no studies have compared the clinical effectiveness of amlodipine camsylate and amlodipine besylate in treating hypertension.

Objective

This study was designed to determine the effectiveness and tolerability of amlodipine camsylate compared with amlodipine besylate in Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension.

Methods

This Phase III, 8-week, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted in 13 cardiology centers across the Republic of Korea. Male and female Korean patients aged 18 to 75 years having uncomplicated, mild to moderate, essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure [SiDBP] 90- < 110 mm Hg) and receiving no antihypertensives in the 2 weeks before randomization were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral treatment with amlodipine camsylate or amlodipine besylate. For the first 4 weeks, patients received amlodipine 5 mg QD (morning). After 4 weeks, if either blood pressure was ≥ 140/ ≥ 90 mm Hg or SiDBP had not decreased by ≥ 10 mm Hg from baseline, the dose of amlodipine was increased to 10 mg QD for 4 weeks. Trough blood pressure and heart rate were measured in duplicate with the patient in the sitting position at each clinic visit (baseline [week 0] and weeks 4 and 8 of treatment); mean values were calculated and recorded. At weeks 4 and 8, tolerability was assessed using history taking and laboratory analysis, and compliance was assessed using pill counts. The primary end point was change from baseline in SiDBP at week 8. Secondary end points were change from baseline in sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) at week 8 in the total population and in the subgroup of patients who had previously received antihypertensive treatment versus those who had not.

Results

A total of 189 patients were enrolled (mean age, 53 years; 105 women, 84 men; mean body weight, 65.8 kg). One patient in the amlodipine camsylate group dropped out of the study at week 0 of treatment (this patient did not use any study medication) and was excluded from the modified intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Thus, 188 patients were treated and included in the ITT analysis (94 patients per treatment group; ITT analysis); 161 patients were included in the perprotocol (PP) analysis (n = 80 for amlodipine camsylate, n = 81 for amlodipine besylate) (14 patients in the amlodipine camsylate group and 13 patients in the amlodipine besylate group were excluded from the PP analysis due to consistent withdrawal or protocol violation). Mean (SD) SiSBP and SiDBP were significantly decreased from baseline in both groups (amlodipine camsylate, from 146.7 [12.3]/96.6 [5.4] to 127.9 [14.8]/83.4 [7.7] mm Hg [both, P < 0.001]; amlodipine besylate, from 146.8 [12.8]/96.7 [5.1] to 128.0 [10.1]/83.8 [7.5] mm Hg [both, P < 0.001]). The differences in SiSBP/SiDBP between the 2 groups at week 8 were not significant. The SiDBP response rates in the subgroups that had and had not been previously treated with antihypertensives were statistically similar (56/69 [81.2%] and 83/92 [90.2%], respectively). The prevalences of clinical adverse events (AEs) were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups (amlodipine camsylate, 27.3%; amlodipine besylate, 28.7%). The most common AEs were dizziness and dyspnea (both in 3/94 [3.2%] and 1/94 [1.1%] patients who received amlodipine camsylate and amlodipine besylate, respectively).

Conclusion

The effectiveness and tolerability of amlodipine camsylate were not significantly different from those of amlodipine besylate in these Korean adults with mild to moderate hypertension.

5.2 Increased Angina and/or Myocardial Infarction

Rarely, patients, particularly those with severe obstructive coronary artery disease, have developed documented increased frequency, duration or severity of angina or acute myocardial infarction on starting calcium channel blocker therapy or at the time of dosage increase. The mechanism of this effect has not been elucidated.

5.3 Hypotension

Amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting.

In patients with congestive heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria, azotemia, and (rarely) with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, start amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride therapy under close medical supervision; follow closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of the benazepril component is increased or a diuretic is added or its dose increased.

Symptomatic hypotension is also possible in patients with severe aortic stenosis.

If hypotension occurs, place the patient in a supine position, and if necessary, treat with intravenous infusion of physiologic saline. Amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume.

5.4 Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality

Amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.

Drugs that act on the renin angiotensin system can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality when used in pregnancy. In several dozen published cases, ACE inhibitor use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy was associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including hypotension, neonatal skull hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or irreversible renal failure, and death [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Amlodipine besylate (amlodipine) [^113wX8vC]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism

After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine, absorption produces peak plasma concentrations between 6 and 12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 90%. The bioavailability of amlodipine is not altered by the presence of food.

Amlodipine is extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. Ex vivo studies have shown that approximately 93% of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of about 30–50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels of amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing.

The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. Patients with renal failure may therefore receive the usual initial dose.

Elderly patients and patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in AUC of approximately 40–60%, and a lower initial dose may be required. A similar increase in AUC was observed in patients with moderate to severe heart failure.

Pediatric Patients

Sixty-two hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years received doses of amlodipine between 1.25 mg and 20 mg. Weight-adjusted clearance and volume of distribution were similar to values in adults.

### Comparison of efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine orotate versus amlodipine besylate in adult patients with mild to moderate hypertension: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 8-week follow-up, noninferiority trial [^1165ZYGg]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine orotate with those of amlodipine besylate in Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension.

Methods

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was designed as a noninferiority study. To be included in the study, previously untreated patients had to have a sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) of 90 to 109 mm Hg. Previously treated patients had to discontinue their current annhypertensive medications and have a baseline SiDBP between 90 and 109 mm Hg after a 2-week washout period. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to receive 5 mg amlodipine orotate or 5 mg amlodipine besylate for 8 weeks. The medication dose was doubled (10 mg QD for either amlodipine orotate or amlodipine besylate) 4 weeks after enrollment if SiDBP was ≥ 90 mm Hg. The primary efficacy analysis was noninferiority of the difference in mean trough SiDBP changes from baseline for amlodipin eorotate as compared with amlodipine besylate after 8 weeks of treatment. For the secondary efficacy analysis, 2 other measures were analyzed after 8 weeks of treatment. The SiDBP response rate was defined as an SiDBP measurement < 90 mm Hg at the last clinical follow-up visit or an absolute reduction of ≥ 10 mm Hg in SiDBP from baseline until the last clinical follow-up visit. In addition, noninferiority of the difference in mean trough sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) changes from baseline was analyzed for amlodipine orotate as compared with amlodipine besylate. The drug compliance rate was estimated by pillcount.

Results

Eligible patients (n = 109; 43 women and 66 men) were randomly assigned to receive amlodipine orotate (n = 53) or amlodipine besylate (n = 56). No significant differences were found in sex, age, weight, or current smoking between the groups (all, P = NS). The proportion of patients with previous antihypertensive medications was not different between the groups (47.2% [25/53] in the amlodipine orotate group and 50.0% [28/56] in the amlodipine besylate group; P = NS). No significant differences were found in baseline SiDBP (mean [SD], 100 [6] mm Hg [range, 90–109 mm Hg] in the amlodipine orotate group and 100 [6] mm Hg [range, 90–108 mm Hg] in the amlodipine besylate group; P = NS) or in baseline SiSBP (mean [SD], 149 [14] mm Hg [range, 125–179 mm Hg] in the amlodipine orotate group and 146 [10] mm Hg [range, 123–167 mm Hg] in the amlodipine besylate group; p = NS). The mean (SD) changes in SiDBP were -15.6 (6.3) mm Hg for the amlodipine orotate group and -14.5 (5.5) mm Hg for the amlodipine besylate groups was 1.1 (5.9) mm Hg (95% CI, -0.87 to infinity), and because the lower boundary of the 95% CI was greater than -5 mm Hg, amlodipine orotate was considered noninferior to amlodipine besylate. The response rate was 48 of 51 (94.1%) in the amlodipine orotate group compared with 50 (92.6%) of 54 in the amlodipine besylate group after 8 weeks of treatment (P = NS). The mean (SD) compliance rates were 97.6% (3.6%) in the amlodipine orotate group and 96.5% (4.3%) in the amlodipine besylate group (P = NS). The incidence of drug-related adverse events (AEs) was similar between the groups (1/53 [1.9%]) in the amlodipine orotate group vs 4/55 [7.3%] in the amlodipine besylate group; P = NS). The most common drug-related AE overall was peripheral edema (2/55 [3.6%]), and the most common of all the AEs was upper respiratory tract infection (4/55 [7.3%]) in the amlodipine besylate group. The most common drug-related AE was headache (1/53 [1.9%]) in the amlodipine orotate group and peripheral edema (2/55 [3.6%]) in the amlodipine besylate group. No severe AEs were found in either group.

Conclusion

The reduction in SiDBP after 8 weeks of amlodipine orotate treatment was noninferior to that of amlodipine besylate in these Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The SiDBP response rate and the reduction in SISBP after 8 weeks of amlodipine orotate treatment were not significantly different from those of amlodipine besylate treatment. Both agents were wel tolerated.

### Efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine plus olmesartan medoxomil in patients with difficult-to-treat hypertension [^11667zni]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Treating hypertension in patients with diabetes is challenging because of a stringent BP goal (< 130/80 mm Hg) that has been shown to reduce the progression of diabetic nephropathy onto end-stage renal disease and other complications of diabetes. Treatment guidelines from scientific committees recommend the use of two or more antihypertensive agents for control of BP in Blacks or patients with diabetes, and generally recommend the use of two or more antihypertensive agents if BP is ⩾20/10 mm Hg above goal in any patient.

Combinations of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are recognized by the European Society of Hypertension and the European Society of Cardiology as effective and well-tolerated therapeutic options. It has been shown that combination therapy with an ARB or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with a CCB may minimize the adverse effects of the CCB, such as peripheral oedema. ARBs also provide protection against renal and cardiac end-organ failure, which is of particular importance in patients with diabetes and hypertension. A recent long-term clinical outcomes study, ACCOMPLISH (Avoiding Cardiovascular Events in Combination Therapy in Patients Living With Systolic Hypertension), has shown that the combination of renin–angiotensin system blockade (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor — benazepril) with a CCB (amlodipine) was more effective in reducing cardiovascular complications than the combination of renin–angiotensin system blockade (benazepril) with a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide).

The results of the COACH (Combination of Olmesartan Medoxomil and Amlodipine Besylate in Controlling High Blood Pressure) study, a clinical trial that assessed the efficacy and safety of amlodipine besylate (dihydropyridine CCB) in combination with olmesartan medoxomil (ARB) in patients with mild-to-severe hypertension, have been published elsewhere. Here we report a prespecified subgroup analysis of the COACH study in patients with diabetes, Blacks, elderly (⩾65 years) patients and those who are overweight/obese with a BMI⩾30 kg m −2.

### Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium [^113JybV6]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Pediatric

Amlodipine: Sixty-two hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years received doses of amlodipine between 1.25 mg and 20 mg. Weight-adjusted clearance and volume of distribution were similar to values in adults.

Atorvastatin: Apparent oral clearance of atorvastatin in pediatric subjects appeared similar to that of adults when scaled allometrically by body weight as the body weight was the only significant covariate in atorvastatin population pharmacokinetics model with data including pediatric HeFH patients (ages 10 years to 17 years of age, n = 29) in an open-label, 8-week study.

Gender

Atorvastatin: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin in women differ from those in men (approximately 20% higher for Cmaxand 10% lower for AUC); however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDL-C reduction with atorvastatin between men and women.

Renal Impairment

Amlodipine: The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. Patients with renal failure may therefore receive the usual initial amlodipine dose.

Atorvastatin: Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDL-C reduction of atorvastatin; thus, dose adjustment of atorvastatin in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Initial angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor / calcium channel blocker combination therapy achieves superior blood pressure control compared with calcium channel blocker monotherapy in patients with stage 2 hypertension [^116oPjqk]. American Journal of Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC 7) on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends initial combination therapy for patients whose blood pressure (BP) is > 20/10 mm Hg above goal. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of initial combination therapy versus that of monotherapy in patients with stage 2 hypertension, who by definition meet the JNC 7 recommendation for initial combination antihypertensive therapy.

Methods

This multicenter, double-blind, 12-week study randomized 364 patients with stage 2 hypertension to fixed-dose combination therapy with amlodipine besylate/benazepril HCl (5/20 mg/d titrated to 10/20 mg/d) or amlodipine besylate monotherapy (5 mg/d titrated to 10 mg/d).

Results

Significantly more patients randomized to combination therapy (74.2%) compared with those randomized to monotherapy (53.9%; P < .0001) achieved the primary end point (reductions in systolic BP ≥ 25 mm Hg, if baseline systolic BP was < 180 mm Hg, or ≥ 32 mm Hg, if baseline systolic BP was ≥ 180 mm Hg). Significantly more patients randomized to combination therapy compared with monotherapy attained BP goals of < 140/90 mm Hg (61.0% v 43.3%; p = 0.0007) and ≤ 130/85 mm Hg (35.7% v 19.1%; p = 0.0004). Among patients with baseline systolic BP ≥ 180 mm Hg, combination therapy resulted in significantly greater reductions in systolic BP compared with monotherapy (-42.3 v -30.4 mm Hg; p = 0.001). More than 90% of patients in each group were titrated to the higher dose. Both treatments were well tolerated.

Conclusions

Combination therapy was well tolerated and resulted in significantly greater BP reductions and attainment of BP goals compared with monotherapy in patients with stage 2 hypertension. This evidence supports the recommendation of combination therapy as first-line treatment in stage 2 hypertension.

1.1 Hypertension

NORVASC®is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including NORVASC.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

NORVASC may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

### Pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence evaluation of two formulations of 10-mg amlodipine besylate: an open-label, single-dose, randomized, two-way crossover study in healthy Chinese male volunteers [^111ZHMPV]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Amlodipine is a third-generation dihydropyridine calcium antagonist for the treatment of angina and hypertension. The relative bioavailability of a newly developed dispersible tablet as compared with an established branded formulation has not been reported in a Chinese population.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess and compare the pharmacokinetic properties, bioavailability, and bioequivalence of a newly developed dispersible tablet formulation of amlodipine besylate with those of an established branded formulation in healthy Chinese adult male volunteers.

Methods

An open-label, single-dose, randomized, 2-way crossover study was conducted in fasted healthy Chinese male volunteers. Eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 2 tablets (5 mg each) of the test or reference formulation, followed by a 2-week washout period and administration of the alternate formulation. The study drugs were administered after a 10-hour overnight fast. Serum samples were collected over 120 hours. Amlodipine concentrations in the serum were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with positive ion electrospray ionization using the multiple reaction monitoring mode. The visible detection of the method was in the range of 0.2 to 32.0 ng/mL, and the lower limit of quantification for amlodipine was 0.2 ng/mL. The amlodipine serum concentration-time curves were used to obtain pharmacokinetic parameters including AUC(0-t), AUC(0-infinity)), and C(max). The criteria for bioequivalence were 90% CIs of 80% to 125% for AUC and 70% to 143% for C(max), according to guidelines of the State Food and Drug Administration of the People's Republic of China. Tolerability was based on the recording of adverse events (AEs), monitoring vital signs, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory tests at baseline and completion of the study.

Results

A total of 20 healthy Chinese male volunteers (mean [SD] age, 21.4 [2.6] years [range, 1926 years]; weight, 61.3 [5.4] kg [range, 54.0–75.0 kg]; and height, 171.2 [3.6] cm [range, 162.0–177.0 cm) were included in the study. The mean (SD) C(max), T(max), AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity)) values after administration of the test and reference formulations, respectively, were as follows: 5.46 (1.13) versus 5.88 (1.24) ng/mL, 7.70 (2.08) versus 9.20 (4.18) hours, 284.56 (77.59) versus 311.34 (75.97) ng/mL/h, and 331.37 (111.03) versus 358.74 (101.10) ng/mL/h. The mean (SD) t(1/2) was 38.52 (10.51) hours for the test formulation and 38.75 (7.07) hours for the reference formulation. On analysis of variance, no period or sequence effects were observed for any pharmacokinetic property; however, a significant formulation effect was observed for C(max), AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity)). The relative bioavailability of the test formulation was 90.9% by mean AUC(0-t) and 91.2% by mean AUC(0-infinity). The 90% CIs for the ratios of C(max), AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity) were 88.4% to 97.5%, 86.4% to 95.7%, and 85.8% to 97.0%, respectively, meeting the predetermined criteria for bioequivalence. One subject (5%) reported 2 AEs. The AEs were mild, possibly associated with study drug, and resolved spontaneously by the next evaluation. No serious AEs were reported.

Conclusions

In this small study in healthy Chinese adult male volunteers, a single 10-mg dose of the dispersible tablet formulation (test) of amlodipine besylate met the regulatory criteria for bioequivalence to the established tablet formulation (reference) based on the rate and extent of absorption. Both formulations were well tolerated.

### Amlodipine besylate and valsartan (Amlodipine and valsartan) [^1117TcjW]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Category D

Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue amlodipine and valsartan tablets as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus.

In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue amlodipine and valsartan tablets, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to amlodipine and valsartan tablets for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

8.2 Labor and Delivery

The effect of amlodipine and valsartan tablets on labor and delivery has not been studied.

8.3 Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether amlodipine is excreted in human milk. In the absence of this information, it is recommended that nursing be discontinued while amlodipine is administered.

It is not known whether valsartan is excreted in human milk. Valsartan was excreted into the milk of lactating rats; however, animal breast milk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels. Because many drugs are excreted into human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from amlodipine and valsartan tablets, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

### Amlodipine (katerzia) [^111qNoSj]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The exposure (Cmaxand AUC) of KATERZIA oral suspension is similar to that of Norvasc®tablet.

Absorption

After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine, absorption produces peak plasma concentrations between 6 and 12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 90%.

Effect of Food

Compared to fasted state administration, standard high-fat, high-calorie breakfast did not have a significant effect on the absorption of KATERZIA.

Distribution

Ex vivo studies have shown that approximately 93% of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients.

Metabolism

Amlodipine is extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine.

Excretion

Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of about 30–50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels of amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing.

Specific Populations

Pediatric Patients

Sixty-two hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years received doses of amlodipine between 1.25 mg and 20 mg. Weight-adjusted clearance and volume of distribution were similar to values in adults.

Adult Patients

The antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on amlodipine and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect. Tolerance was not demonstrated in patients studied for up to 1 year. The 3 parallel, fixed dose, dose response studies showed that the reduction in supine and standing blood pressures was dose-related within the recommended dosing range. Effects on diastolic pressure were similar in young and older patients. The effect on systolic pressure was greater in older patients, perhaps because of greater baseline systolic pressure. Effects were similar in black patients and in white patients.

Pediatric Patients

Two hundred sixty-eight hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years were randomized first to amlodipine 2.5 or 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then randomized again to the same dose or to placebo for another 4 weeks. Patients receiving 5 mg at the end of 8 weeks had lower blood pressure than those secondarily randomized to placebo. The magnitude of the treatment effect is difficult to interpret, but it is probably less than 5 mmHg systolic on the 5 mg dose. Adverse events were similar to those seen in adults.

Effects in Chronic Stable Angina

The effectiveness of 5 to 10 mg/day of amlodipine in exercise-induced angina has been evaluated in 8 placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of up to 6 weeks duration involving 1038 patients (684 amlodipine, 354 placebo) with chronic stable angina. In 5 of the 8 studies significant increases in exercise time (bicycle or treadmill) were seen with the 10 mg dose. Increases in symptom-limited exercise time averaged 12.8% (63 sec) for amlodipine 10 mg, and averaged 7.9% (38 sec) for amlodipine 5 mg. Amlodipine 10 mg also increased time to 1 mm ST segment deviation in several studies and decreased angina attack rate. The sustained efficacy of amlodipine in angina patients has been demonstrated over long-term dosing. In patients with angina there were no clinically significant reductions in blood pressures (4/1 mmHg) or changes in heart rate (+0.3 bpm).

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Rats and mice treated with amlodipine maleate in the diet for up to two years, at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 amlodipine mg/kg/day showed no evidence of a carcinogenic effect of the drug. For the mouse, the highest dose was, on a mg/m2basis, similar to the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg amlodipine/day*. For the rat, the highest dose was, on a mg/m2basis, about twice the maximum recommended human dose*.

Mutagenicity studies conducted with amlodipine maleate revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome level.

There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated orally with amlodipine maleate (males for 64 days and females for 14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (8 times*the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg/day on a mg/m2basis).

Pregnancy Category C

No evidence of teratogenicity or other embryo/fetal toxicity was found when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated orally with amlodipine maleate at doses up to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (respectively 8 times*and 23 times*the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg on a mg/m2basis) during their respective periods of major organogenesis. However, litter size was significantly decreased (by about 50%) and the number of intrauterine deaths was significantly increased (about 5-fold) in rats receiving amlodipine maleate at a dose equivalent to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day for 14 days before mating and throughout mating and gestation. Amlodipine maleate has been shown to prolong both the gestation period and the duration of labor in rats at this dose. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Amlodipine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

*Based on patient weight of 50 kg.

### Amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride [^111eKJ1S]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Minimal amounts of unchanged benazepril and of benazeprilat are excreted into the breast milk of lactating women treated with benazepril, so that a newborn child ingesting nothing but breast milk would receive less than 0.1% of the maternal doses of benazepril and benazeprilat. Limited available data from a published clinical lactation study reports that amlodipine is present in human milk at an estimated median relative infant dose of 4.2%. No adverse effects of amlodipine on the breastfed infant have been observed. There is no available information on the effects of amlodipine or benazepril on milk production.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In geriatric patients, exposure to amlodipine is increased, thus consider lower initial doses of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Of the total number of patients who received amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride in U.S. clinical studies of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride, over 19% were 65 years or older while about 2% were 75 years or older. Overall differences in effectiveness or safety were not observed between these patients and younger patients. Clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

Exposure to amlodipine is increased in patients with hepatic insufficiency, thus consider using lower doses of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Renal Impairment

In patients with severe renal impairment systemic exposure to benazepril is increased. The recommended dose of benazepril in this subgroup is 5 mg which is not an available strength with amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride. Amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment. No dose adjustment of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride is needed in patients with mild or moderate impairment of renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium [^112WyByu]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium have not been established in pediatric populations.

Amlodipine

Amlodipine (2.5 to 5 mg daily) is effective in lowering blood pressure in patients 6 to 17 years [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The effect of amlodipine on blood pressure in patients less than 6 years of age is not known.

Atorvastatin

Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH)

Safety and effectiveness of atorvastatin have been established in patients 10 years to 17 years of age with HeFH as an adjunct to diet to reduce total cholesterol, LDL-C, and apo B levels when, after an adequate trial of diet therapy, the following are present:

- LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, or

- LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL and

a positive family history of FH, or premature CVD in a first, or second-degree relative, or
two or more other CVD risk factors are present.

Use of atorvastatin for this indication is supported by evidence from [see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.11)]:

- A placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in 187 boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 years to 17 years of age. Patients treated with 10 mg or 20 mg daily atorvastatin had an adverse reaction profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls

- A three year open-label uncontrolled trial that included 163 pediatric patients 10 to 15 years of age with HeFH who were titrated to achieve a target LDL-C < 130 mg/dL. The safety and efficacy of atorvastatin in lowering LDL-C appeared generally consistent with that observed for adult patients, despite limitations of the uncontrolled study design.

Advise postmenarchal girls of contraception recommendations, if appropriate for the patient [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

The long-term efficacy of atorvastatin therapy initiated in childhood to reduce morbidity and mortality in adulthood has not been established.

The safety and efficacy of atorvastatin have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 10 years of age with HeFH.

Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)

Clinical efficacy of atorvastatin with dosages up to 80 mg/day for 1 year was evaluated in an uncontrolled study of patients with HoFH including 8 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.10)].

### Efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy versus monotherapy with candesartan and / or amlodipine for dose finding in essential hypertension: a phase II multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial [^112CpRLE]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering is important for the treatment of hypertension; however, it has been a challenge to achieve target BP in many patients. The purpose of this study was to explore the optimal dosage of a fixed-dose combination of candesartan cilexetil (CAN) and amlodipine besylate (AML), by examining the tolerability and efficacy of CAN/AML combination therapy compared with those of monotherapy with either drug in patients with essential hypertension.

Methods

This Phase II multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial enrolled patients aged 19 years or older with essential hypertension, defined as a mean sitting diastolic BP (msDBP) between 95 and 115 mm Hg, and a mean sitting systolic BP (msSBP) of < 200 mm Hg after a 2-week placebo run-in period. A total of 635 patients were screened, of whom 439 were randomized to receive treatment; 425 patients were included in the full analysis set (combination therapy, 212; monotherapy, 213). Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 8 treatments: CAN (8 or 16 mg), AML (5 or 10 mg), CAN/AML (8 mg/5 mg, 8 mg/10 mg, 16 mg/5 mg, or 16 mg/10 mg), once daily for 8 weeks.

Findings

After 8 weeks of treatment, changes in msDBP were significantly greater in the groups receiving CAN/AML combination therapies compared with monotherapies at matched doses, with the exception of CAN 8 mg/AML 10 mg versus AML 10 mg. The response to treatment and the achievement of target BP (both msSBP and msDBP) at week 8 were significantly greater overall in the groups that received combination therapy versus monotherapy. All medications were relatively well tolerated in each group.

Implications

Eight-week administration of CAN/AML (8 mg/5 mg, 16 mg/5 mg, and 16 mg/10 mg) resulted in a significantly greater BP reduction than that with CAN or AML monotherapy, and was determined to be well tolerated. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02944734.

### Amlodipine besylate and valsartan (Exforge) [^117KQbGW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In controlled clinical trials, 323 (22.5%) hypertensive patients treated with Exforge were ≥ 65 years and 79 (5.5%) were ≥ 75 years. No overall differences in the efficacy or safety of Exforge was observed in this patient population, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Amlodipine: The recommended starting dose of amlodipine 2.5 mg is not an available strength with Exforge.

Clinical studies of amlodipine besylate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase of area under the curve (AUC) of approximately 40% to 60%.

Valsartan: In the controlled clinical trials of valsartan, 1214 (36.2%) of hypertensive patients treated with valsartan were ≥ 65 years and 265 (7.9%) were ≥ 75 years. No overall difference in the efficacy or safety of valsartan was observed in this patient population, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Safety and effectiveness of Exforge in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) have not been established. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (CrCl 60 to 90 mL/min) or moderate (CrCl 30 to 60 mL/min) renal impairment.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Amlodipine

Exposure to amlodipine is increased in patients with hepatic insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The recommended initial dose of amlodipine in patients with hepatic impairment is 2.5 mg, which is not an available strength with Exforge.

Valsartan

No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild-to-moderate disease. No dosing recommendations can be provided for patients with severe liver disease.

### Treatment of hypertension in patients ≥ 65 years of age: experience with amlodipine [^112okgyU]. Clinical Therapeutics (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a common finding in patients ≥ 65 years of age that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but many patients are untreated or their hypertension inadequately controlled. Recent randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the benefits of treating hypertension in the elderly.

Objective

This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, in elderly (≥ 65 years of age) patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 114 mm Hg).

Methods

This was an open-label, multicenter, 10-week, general-practice study involving patients > 18 years of age. Patients with malignant or secondary hypertension or unstable angina were excluded, as were those who had experienced an acute myocardial infarction or stroke in the preceding 3 months or had been treated with an alpha-blocker in the preceding 6 months. Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment schedules: amlodipine monotherapy or combination therapy and amlodipine given once daily in the morning or in the evening. Approximately 50% of patients would receive a morning dose, and approximately 80% would receive amlodipine as monotherapy. The paired t test was used to assess the significance of differences from baseline values, with significance set at P < 0.05.

Results

A total of 5135 patients received amlodipine and were included in the tolerability analysis. Of these, 3511 of 3628 patients (96.8%) < 65 years and 1471 of 1507 patients (97.6%) ≥ 65 years (including 336 of 349 [96.3%] ≥ 75 years) were included in the efficacy analysis. Significant reductions (P < 0.05) in blood pressure were noted in all groups after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. The equivalence of efficacy in all age groups was seen in terms of reduction in blood pressure (reduction of 21/15 mm Hg in patients < 65 years of age, 25/16 mm Hg in those ≥ 65 years of age, and 26/17 mm Hg in those ≥ 75 years of age) compared with baseline. Therapy was successful in 2878 patients (82.0%) < 65 years of age, in 1238 patients (84.2%) ≥ 65 years of age, and in 284 patients (84.5%) ≥ 75 years of age. The incidence of adverse events was similar in all age groups (18.0%, < 65 years; 22.3%, ≥ 65 years; and 24.1%, ≥ 75 years), with no statistically significant differences between groups. Tolerability was rated as good or excellent in all patients, with no significant differences between groups.

Conclusions

Once-daily amlodipine was effective in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in this patient population and demonstrated a low frequency of adverse events, a high degree of tolerability, and improved well-being. Morning rather than evening dosing appeared to confer a slight advantage.

Drug Interactions

Amlodipine:

In vitro data in human plasma indicate that amlodipine has no effect on the protein binding of digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, and indomethacin.

Impact of Other Drugs on Amlodipine

Coadministered cimetidine, magnesium-and aluminum hydroxide antacids, sildenafil, and grapefruit juice have no impact on the exposure to amlodipine.

CYP3A Inhibitors: Coadministration of a 180 mg daily dose of diltiazem with 5 mg amlodipine in elderly hypertensive patients resulted in a 60% increase in amlodipine systemic exposure. Erythromycin coadministration in healthy volunteers did not significantly change amlodipine systemic exposure. However, strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) may increase the plasma concentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Impact of Amlodipine on Other Drugs

Coadministered amlodipine does not affect the exposure to atorvastatin, digoxin, ethanol and the warfarin prothrombin response time.

Simvastatin: Coadministration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Cyclosporine: A prospective study in renal transplant patients (N = 11) showed on an average of 40% increase in trough cyclosporine levels when concomitantly treated with amlodipine [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Clinic blood pressure responses to two amlodipine salt formulations, adipate and besylate, in adult Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 8-week comparison [^116MzJUw]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The commercially available formulation of amlodipine is conjugated with besylate salt to increase water solubility. Recently, a new amlodipine salt formulation has been developed in which the free base of amlodipine is conjugated with a chemically different salt, adipate.

Objective

The goal of this study was to compare the antihypertensive effect and tolerability of amlodipine adipate with those of amlodipine besylate in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized, doubleblind, parallel-group study in which patients received 8 weeks of treatment with either amlodipine adipate or amlodipine besylate. The primary efficacy variable was noninferiority of the difference in mean changes from baseline in trough diastolic blood pressure (DBP) after 8 weeks of treatment. Secondary efficacy variables included mean changes in DBP, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and response rate (defined as the proportion of patients whose DBP was < 90 mm Hg or whose DBP had decreased from baseline by ≥ 10 mm Hg). The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was also assessed.

Results

Two hundred eleven patients were randomly assigned to receive amlodipine adipate (n = 106) or amlodipine besylate (n = 105). Study patients were primarily female (54.5%), with a mean (SD) age of 52.2 (9.6) years and a mean body weight of 67.1 (10.2) kg; there were no between-group differences in demographic profiles. After 4 weeks of randomized treatment, 58 (27.5%) patients (29 [27.4%] amlodipine adipate, 29 [27.6%] amlodipine besylate) had not achieved a mean DBP < 90 mm Hg, and their dose was doubled. Mean DBP changes at 8 weeks were -15.2 (7.3) mm Hg in the amlodipine adipate group and -14.2 (7.4) mm Hg in the amlodipine besylate group (P = NS). Because the 95% CI for the difference in mean DBP changes between groups (-0.53 to 2.55) was within the prespecified lower limit (-4 mm Hg), amlodipine adipate was considered noninferior to amlodipine besylate. Mean SBP changes were -24.9 (12.1) mm Hg in the amlodipine adipate group and -22.0 (14.7) mm Hg in the amlodipine besylate group (P = NS). The response rates were 92.0% for amlodipine adipate and 95.4% for amlodipine besylate (P = NS). The overall incidence of clinical AEs was 20.8% in the amlodipine adipate group and 25.7% in the amlodipine besylate group (P = NS). Drug-related clinical AEs occurred in 5.7% and 12.4% of patients in the respective treatment groups (P = NS). Serum uric acid levels decreased significantly from base-line in both groups (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Eight weeks of treatment with amlodipine adipate produced significant reductions from baseline in blood pressure in these patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The efficacy of amlodipine adipate was not inferior to that of amlodipine besylate. Tolerability was comparable between the 2 treatment groups.

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents (NSAIDS) Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDS, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including perindopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving perindopril and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors, including perindopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDS, including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on PRESTALIA and other agents that affect the RAS.

Do not co-administer aliskiren with PRESTALIA in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with PRESTALIA in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min).

Amlodipine

Simvastatin: Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin administered alone. Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on amlodipine to 20 mg daily.

Cyclosporine: A prospective study in renal transplant patients showed an average 40% increase in trough levels during concomitant treatment with amlodipine. Frequent monitoring of trough blood levels of cyclosporine is recommended.

CYP3A Inhibitors: Co-administration of the moderate CYP3A inhibitor diltiazem increases the exposure to amlodipine by 60%. Co-administered erythromycin, also a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, does not impact the exposure to amlodipine. Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole) may increase the plasma concentrations of the CYP3A substrate amlodipine to a greater extent. Monitor for symptoms of hypotension and edema when amlodipine is co-administered with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors to determine the need for dose adjustment.

CYP3A Inducers: No information is available on the quantitative effects of CYP3A inducers on amlodipine. Blood pressure should be monitored when amlodipine is co-administered with CYP3A inducers.

### Incremental effectiveness of amlodipine besylate in the treatment of hypertension with single and multiple medication regimens [^116wAGEt]. American Journal of Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this retrospective observational analysis is to examine the clinical effectiveness of amlodipine besylate as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs (AHDs) in systolic blood pressure (BP) control and BP goal attainment, according to the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) 6, JNC 7, and American Diabetes Association (ADA)recommendations, within a multicenter ambulatory care setting.

Methods

Hypertensive adults (n = 1175) were identified during a 4-year period (1998 to 2001) from a large commercially available electronic medical record (EMR) database. Patients were required to have initiated therapy with amlodipine and have at least one BP measurement within 6 months before, and 12 months after, the medication start date. Patients were divided into cohorts based on the number of AHDs used before, and continued through, the initiation of amlodipine. Mean change in systolic BP was compared from pre- to post-amlodipine, and adjusted change in systolic BP was calculated using multivariate regression. The percentage of patients attaining BP goal was also calculated.

Results

In the order of increasing number of AHDs before initiation of amlodipine (0, 1, 2, ≥ 3 previous AHDs): adjusted systolic BP change in mm Hg was -16.1 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -17.9, -14.3), -17.6 (95% CI: -19.6, -15.5), -16.7 (95% CI: -19.0, -14.5), and -15.7 (95% CI: -18.7, -12.8), respectively; BP goal attainment was 39%, 45%, 41%, and 45%, respectively. Amlodipine initiation in all regimens showed statistically significant incremental systolic BP reduction and BP goal attainment from baseline (P < .001).

Conclusions

This study suggests that amlodipine besylate is effective alone or as an add-on therapy to diverse classes of agents.

### Perindopril arginine and amlodipine besylate (Prestalia) [^113auBqh]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Initiate treatment at 3.5/2.5 mg, once daily. Adjust dose according to blood pressure goals waiting 1 to 2 weeks between titration steps (2.1).

2.1 General Considerations

The recommended starting dose of PRESTALIA is 3.5/2.5 mg once daily.

Adjust dosage according to blood pressure goals. In general, wait 7 to 14 days between titration steps. The maximum recommended dose is 14/10 mg once daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

PRESTALIA may be used as initial therapy if a patient is likely to need multiple drugs to achieve blood pressure goals. Consider use in patients unable to achieve adequate antihypertensive effect with amlodipine monotherapy because of dose-limiting peripheral edema caused by amlodipine [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Administered as monotherapy, perindopril erbumine is an effective treatment for hypertension in once-daily doses ranging from 4 mg to 16 mg daily. Amlodipine is effective in once-daily doses of 5 mg and 10 mg. Adverse reactions related to perindopril are generally uncommon and independent of dose, while those related to amlodipine are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily peripheral edema) and dose-independent phenomena, the former much more common than the latter [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

2.2 Dosage Adjustment in Renal Impairment

PRESTALIA is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearances < 30 mL/min. For patients with creatinine clearance between 30 and 80 mL/min (mild or moderate renal impairment), do not exceed 7/5 mg [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

2.3 Monitoring in Elderly Patients (Over 65 Years of Age)

Monitor blood pressure for up to two weeks following titrations at dosages above 7/5 mg in patients over 65 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium

Dosage of amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance for each individual component in the treatment of hypertension/angina and hyperlipidemia. Select doses of amlodipine and atorvastatin independently.

Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium may be substituted for its individually titrated components. Patients may be given the equivalent dose of amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium or a dose of amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium with increased amounts of amlodipine, atorvastatin, or both for additional antianginal effects, blood pressure lowering, or lipid-lowering effect.

Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium may be used to provide additional therapy for patients already on one of its components. Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium may be used to initiate treatment in patients with hyperlipidemia and either hypertension or angina.

Amlodipine

The usual initial antihypertensive oral dose of amlodipine is 5 mg once daily, and the maximum dose is 10 mg once daily.

Pediatric (age > 6 years), small adult, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily and this dose may be used when adding amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy.

### Results of a multicenter, 8-week, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, phase III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine maleate versus amlodipine besylate in Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension [^116tJzMj]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, amlodipine maleate was developed and tested in preclinical and Phase I clinical trials in Korea. The studies found pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics similar to those of amlodipine besylate.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine maleate with those of amlodipine besylate in Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension.

Methods

This was a multicenter, 8-week, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, Phase III clinical trial. Eligible patients were Korean, aged 18 to 75 years, had hypertension, and were either taking antihypertensive medications or had a documented sitting diastolic blood pressure of 90 to 109 mm Hg. After a washout period of 2 weeks, patients were randomized to amlodipine maleate or amlodipine besylate for 8 weeks. In both groups, the medications were initiated at 5 mg QD. At day 29, the medication dose was increased to 10 mg QD if sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) was ≥ 90 mm Hg.

Results

One hundred eighteen patients were enrolled. Fifty-seven patients received amlodipine maleate (29 men, 28 women; mean [SD] age, 49.0 [11.4] years) and 61 received amlodipine besylate (35 men, 26 women; mean [SD] age, 51.6 [9.4] years). Baseline mean (SD) values for sitting systolic blood pressure and SiDBP were 152.0 (12.2) mm Hg and 98.1 (5.6) mm Hg, respectively, for the amlodipine maleate group and 153.4 (14.0) mm Hg and 98.1 (5.5) mm Hg, respectively, for the amlodipine besylate group. In this population, amlodipine maleate was not inferior to amlodipine besylate: the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the treatment difference in SiDBP was greater than -4 mm Hg. The between-group difference in SiDBP response rate (the proportion of patients who experienced adequate SiDBP reductions) did not reach statistical significance: 85.7% (42/49) for the amlodipine maleate group and 91.8% (45/49) for the amlodipine besylate group. Compliance rates were similar between groups, with mean (SD) compliance rates of 97.4% (2.8%) and 97.1% (3.6%) in the amlodipine maleate and amlodipine besylate groups, respectively. Also, there were no significant differences in the incidences of drug-related clinical and laboratory adverse events; the most common were headache, flushing, facial edema, and paresthesia.

Conclusion

In this population, the efficacy and tolerability observed with amlodipine maleate were similar to those seen with amlodipine besylate.

### Telmisartan and amlodipine [^116jeHw9]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to telmisartan and amlodipine tablets for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. If oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.4)].

Data

Animal Data:

No reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted with the combination of telmisartan and amlodipine besylate. However, these studies have been conducted for telmisartan and amlodipine besylate alone.

Telmisartan:

No teratogenic effects were observed when telmisartan was administered to pregnant rats at oral doses of up to 50 mg/kg/day and to pregnant rabbits at oral doses up to 45 mg/kg/day. In rabbits, embryolethality associated with maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain and food consumption) was observed at 45 mg/kg/day [about 12 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 80 mg on a mg/m2basis]. In rats, maternally toxic (reduction in body weight gain and food consumption) telmisartan doses of 15 mg/kg/day (about 1.9 times the MRHD on a mg/m2basis), administered during late gestation and lactation, were observed to produce adverse effects in neonates, including reduced viability, low birth weight, delayed maturation, and decreased weight gain. The no observed effect doses for developmental toxicity in rats and rabbits, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively, are about 0.64 and 3.7 times, on a mg/m2basis, the maximum recommended human dose of telmisartan (80 mg/day).

Amlodipine:

No evidence of teratogenicity or embryo/fetal toxicity was found when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated orally with amlodipine maleate at doses up to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (approximately 10 and 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area, respectively) during their respective periods of major organogenesis. However, for rats, litter size was significantly decreased (by about 50%) and the number of intrauterine deaths was significantly increased (about 5-fold). Amlodipine has been shown to prolong both the gestation period and the duration of labor in rats at this dose.

### Evaluation of the efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy with candesartan cilexetil and amlodipine besilate compared with candesartan cilexetil monotherapy and amlodipine besilate monotherapy in Japanese patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension: a multicenter, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study [^112LBqpK]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Blood pressure is reported to be insufficiently controlled in > 50% of patients with hypertension. Guidelines for the management of hypertension recommend using drugs with different mechanisms of action when > 1 agent is needed to achieve the blood pressure target. The combination of an angiotensin II receptor blocker and a calcium channel blocker is recommended as the preferred antihypertensive medication combination, and candesartan cilexetil (CC) and amlodipine besilate (AML) are commonly used in Japan.

Objective

The objective of our study was to determine if the combination of CC 8 mg and AML 5 mg has a greater blood pressure-lowering effect than monotherapy with either component, and if the combination of CC 4 mg and AML 2.5 mg has a greater blood pressure-lowering effect than placebo.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in Japanese patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. After receiving placebo during a 4-week run-in period in a single-blind manner, patients were randomized to receive the combination of CC 4 or 8 mg with AML 2.5 or 5 mg, CC 8 mg monotherapy, AML 5 mg monotherapy, or placebo once daily in the fasting or fed state for 12 weeks. The primary end point was change from baseline in trough diastolic blood pressure, and the secondary end point was change from baseline in trough systolic blood pressure at the end of treatment. Tolerability was assessed based on adverse events, vital signs, and physical findings.

Results

Of 548 patients who received placebo during the run-in period, 444 were randomized to receive CC 8 mg/AML 5 mg (CC/AML 8/5 mg) (n = 101), 8/2.5 mg (n = 36), 4/5 mg (n = 36), 4/2.5 mg (n = 35), CC 8 mg (n = 100), AML 5 mg (n = 100), or placebo (n = 36). These 444 patients included 272 men and 172 women. The mean (SD) age was 56.9 (10.7) years and the mean baseline BP was 153.4/95.7 mm Hg. The antihypertensive effect in the CC/AML 8/5 mg group (-27.4/-16.3 mm Hg) was significantly higher than in the CC 8 mg group (-13.9/-7.8 mm Hg) or the AML 5 mg group (-19.9/-11.2 mm Hg) in terms of reduction in the seated trough diastolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressure (both P < 0.0001). The incidence and severity of adverse events in the CC/AML combination groups did not differ significantly from those in the monotherapy and placebo groups.

Conclusions

In Japanese adult patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension, CC/AML 8/5 mg combination therapy was more effective in lowering blood pressure than CC 8 mg or AML 5 mg monotherapy. These combinations were also well tolerated. Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center registration number: Japic CTI-101054.

### Acute amlodipine overdose treated by high dose intravenous calcium in a patient with severe renal insufficiency [^112gZhcW]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

Calcium salts are frequently used in the treatment of calcium antagonist poisoning. Different dosing regimens have been employed. The major risk of high dose calcium therapy is iatrogenic hypercalcemia, especially in patients with diminished renal function. Repeated doses of calcium are therefore often avoided; however, inadequate use of intravenous calcium may cause treatment failure in severe calcium antagonist overdose. We report our experience of using high dose intravenous calcium chloride effectively and safely to treat severe amlodipine overdose in a patient with severe renal insufficiency.

### Efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine plus olmesartan medoxomil in patients with difficult-to-treat hypertension [^112Y7ALv]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

It is well established that effective blood pressure (BP) control reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke in patients with hypertension. For every 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic BP (SBP), there are 30 and 40% reductions in ischaemic heart disease and stroke mortality, respectively.

However, only a small proportion of patients achieve BP goal (< 140/90 mm Hg or < 130/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes) with antihypertensive monotherapy. The Seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) and the European Societies of Hypertension and Cardiology guidelines recognize that in the majority of patients, combination therapy will be required.

The prevalence of hypertension (BP ⩾140/90 mm Hg or ⩾130/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes) is approximately 33% in the general population and even higher in certain patient populations. In the elderly, 63.6% of women and 73.9% of men have hypertension. Hypertension prevalence is also higher in Blacks (41.4%), patients with diabetes (76.8%) and those who are obese (body mass index (BMI) ⩾30 kg m −2; 40.8%). In the case of elderly or patients with diabetes, this is due, in part, to arterial stiffness as a consequence of the pathobiology of ageing or diabetes. Causes of the increased prevalence of hypertension in Blacks have not been fully elucidated, though it appears that physiological factors may have a part. In addition, Black children have significantly higher BP than age-matched Caucasian children of < 10 years of age, and Blacks with hypertension generally present with more severe disease. In obese patients, the renin–angiotensin system may be dysregulated contributing to the development of hypertension.

### Amlodipine besylate and valsartan (Exforge) [^117HMiZz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Valsartan: On average, patients with mild-to-moderate chronic liver disease have twice the exposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan of healthy volunteers (matched by age, sex and weight). In general, no dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild-to-moderate liver disease. Care should be exercised in patients with liver disease.

Drug Interactions

Amlodipine

In vitro data in human plasma indicate that amlodipine has no effect on the protein binding of digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin and indomethacin.

Impact of Other Drugs on Amlodipine

Coadministered cimetidine, magnesium-and aluminum hydroxide antacids, sildenafil, and grapefruit juice have no impact on the exposure to amlodipine.

CYP3A Inhibitors: Co-administration of a 180 mg daily dose of diltiazem with 5 mg amlodipine in elderly hypertensive patients resulted in a 60% increase in amlodipine systemic exposure. Erythromycin co-administration in healthy volunteers did not significantly change amlodipine systemic exposure. However, strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) may increase the plasma concentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Impact of Amlodipine on Other Drugs

Coadministered amlodipine does not affect the exposure to atorvastatin, digoxin, ethanol and the warfarin prothrombin response time.

Steady-state levels of olmesartan are achieved within 3 to 5 days and no accumulation in plasma occurs with once-daily dosing.

Specific Populations

Geriatric Patients

The pharmacokinetic properties of amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil in the elderly are similar to those of the individual components.

Amlodipine. Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in AUC of approximately 40% to 60%, and a lower initial dose may be required.

Olmesartan medoxomil. The pharmacokinetics of olmesartan medoxomil were studied in the elderly (≥ 65 years). Overall, maximum plasma concentrations of olmesartan were similar in young adults and the elderly. Modest accumulation of olmesartan was observed in the elderly with repeated dosing; AUCѕѕ,τwas 33% higher in elderly patients, corresponding to an approximate 30% reduction in CLR.

Pediatric Patients

Amlodipine. Sixty-two hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years received doses of amlodipine between 1.25 mg and 20 mg. Weight-adjusted clearance and volume of distribution were similar to values in adults.

Olmesartan medoxomil. The pharmacokinetics of olmesartan medoxomil have not been investigated in patients < 18 years of age.

Male and Female Patients

Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that female patients had approximately 15% smaller clearances of olmesartan than male patients. Gender had no effect on the clearance of amlodipine.

Olmesartan medoxomil. Minor differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of olmesartan medoxomil in women compared to men. AUC and Cmaxwere 10% to 15% higher in women than in men.

Study intervention

Patients were randomized to a combination therapy with amlodipine 2.5 mg per day and half a tablet of amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide 1.25/12.5 mg (group A) or amlodipine 2.5 mg per day and telmisartan 40 mg per day (group T). The target BP during the treatment period was set at < 140 mm Hg systolic and < 90 mm Hg diastolic, and < 130 mm Hg systolic and < 80 mm Hg diastolic for diabetes or chronic kidney disease patients. If the target BP was not reached at the end of the second week after randomization, the dose of compound amiloride was titrated to one tablet per day (amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide 2.5/25 mg) in group A, and telmisartan was titrated to 80 mg per day in group T. If the target BP was not reached after 4 weeks of treatment, the dosage of amlodipine in both groups was increased to 5 mg/day (Figure 1). If the BP remained uncontrolled 2–3 months after randomization, other antihypertensive agents including ACE inhibitor, β-blockers and α-blockers were added at the discretion of the investigator's opinion.

Patients with serum TC levels of 4.0–6.1 mmol l −1 were randomized to statin intervention or standard treatment. Those in the statin treatment group receive oral simvastatin 10 mg per day, whereas patients receiving standard treatment are managed at the discretion of their investigator's opinion. Adverse effects (for example, myalgia) are recorded and extra biochemical tests, such as ALT and creatinine kinase, should be carried out if necessary.

Communities matched by similar socioeconomic conditions were randomly designated as an active group and a conventional group with regard to the strength of the lifestyle intervention. As required by the 2005 Chinese Hypertension Guidelines, patients receiving aggressive treatment were educated on a healthy lifestyle, quarterly in the first year of the study and biannually in the second year. Lifestyle changes included a reduction in body weight of ≤ 5 kg for obese patients, decreasing salt intake, 30 min of moderate physical activity ⩾3 times per week, reduction in cigarette smoking or smoking cessation, limiting alcohol intake or abstinence from alcohol.

### A randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group comparison of valsartan and amlodipine in the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension in elderly patients: the val-syst study [^115HL7HV]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Some antihypertensive therapies are limited by dose-dependent adverse effects (AEs). The angiotensin II receptor blocker valsartan has been shown to reduce blood pressure (BP) in a dose-related manner with minimal dose-limiting AEs. Amlodipine besylate is a potent dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker also with dose-related antihypertensive efficacy, but with possible dose-limiting AEs, particularly peripheral edema.

Objectives

This study compared the risk/benefit profiles of valsartan and amlodipine in elderly patients who have isolated systolic hypertension (ISH).

Methods

This 24-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, titration-to-effect, parallel-group study was conducted at 35 outpatient centers in Italy. Elderly (aged 60–80 years) patients with ISH received oral treatment with valsartan 80-mg capsules or amlodipine 5-mg capsules once daily. After 8 weeks of treatment, the dose of the patients with poorly controlled systolic BP (SBP) was titrated to 160 mg (valsartan) or 10 mg (amlodipine) once daily. At week 16, if trough SBP was still not adequately controlled, a low-dose diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide [HCTZ] 12.5 mg) was added to the treatment regimen for an additional 8 weeks. Tolerability was assessed at all study visits using physical examination and patient interview.

Results

Of 421 randomized patients (231 women, 190 men; mean [SD] age, 69 [6] years), 208 were included in the valsartan group, and 213 in the amlodipine group. The efficacy of valsartan-based treatment. in reducing SBP was similar to that of amlodipine-based treatment. With doubled doses, efficacy (change in SBP) increased significantly from baseline (both P < 0.01). The frequency of AEs doubled with amlodipine 10 mg but was not clinically relevant with valsartan 160 mg. Overall, AEs were observed in 31.9% of those receiving amlodipine versus 20.2% of the patients receiving valsartan (P < 0.003), with peripheral edema rates of 26.8% and 4.8%, respectively (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In this study population of elderly patients with ISH, valsartan-given alone or in combination with HCTZ 12.5 mg-showed similar efficacy but better tolerability than amlodipine-based treatment.

### Olmesartan medoxomil / amlodipine besylate / hydrochlorothiazide [^117SMDmu]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Olmesartan medoxomil and Hydrochlorothiazide.

No teratogenic effects were observed when 1.6:1 combinations of olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide were administered to pregnant mice at oral doses up to 1625 mg/kg/day (122 times the MRHD on a mg/m2basis) or pregnant rats up to 1625 mg/kg/day (243 times the MRHD on a mg/m2basis) or pregnant rabbits at oral doses up to 1 mg/kg/day (0.3 times the MRHD on a mg/m2basis). In rats, however, fetal body weights at 1625 mg/kg/day (a toxic, sometimes lethal dose in the dams) were significantly lower than control. The no observed effect dose for developmental toxicity in rats is 162.5 mg/kg/day, about 24 times, on a mg/m2basis, the MRHD of 40 mg olmesartan medoxomil/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide/day. (Calculations based on a 60 kg patient.)

Amlodipine.

No evidence of teratogenicity or other embryo/fetal toxicity was found when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated orally with amlodipine maleate at doses of up to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (respectively about 10 and 20 times the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg amlodipine on a mg/m2basis) during their respective periods of major organogenesis (calculations based on a patient weight of 60 kg). However, litter size was significantly decreased (by about 50%), and the number of intrauterine deaths was significantly increased (about 5-fold) in rats receiving amlodipine maleate at a dose equivalent to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day for 14 days before mating and throughout mating and gestation. Amlodipine maleate has been shown to prolong both the gestational period and the duration of labor in rats at this dose.

Hydrochlorothiazide.

No teratogenic effects were observed when hydrochlorothiazide was administered to mice and rats via gavage at doses up to 3000 and 1000 mg/kg/day, respectively (about 600 and 400 times the MRHD), on gestation days 6 through 15.

### Efficacy and safety profiles of a new S (-)-amlodipine nicotinate formulation versus racemic amlodipine besylate in adult Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension: an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, phase III, noninferiority clinical trial [^1137a7FM]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

"Chiral switching" from an existing racemate to a pure enantiomeric compound is a popular theme in drug development, especially when the enantiomer is found to have better efficacy and safety profiles. Amlodipine is a racemic mixture, composed of the S(-)-enantiomer, which is the pharmacologically active isomer, and the R(+)-enantiomer, which is 1000-fold less active. S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate, a chirally switched form of amlodipine nicotinate, has been developed and found to be bioequivalent to amlodipine besylate in Phase I clinical trials in Korea.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profiles of S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate with those of amlodipine besylate in adult Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 90 mm Hg and ≤ 109 mm Hg).

Methods

This was an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, Phase III, noninferiority clinical trial. After an initial 2-week placebo run-in period, patients aged 18 to 75 years with sitting DBP (SiDBP) ≥ 90 and ≤ 109 mm Hg at day 0 (baseline) were randomly allocated to receive S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate 2.5 mg QD or amlodipine besylate 5 mg QD for 8 weeks. The dose of study medication was doubled after 4 weeks in patients who had not responded to treatment (SiDBP ≥ 90 mm Hg). The primary end point was noninferiority of the difference in mean SiDBP from baseline to week 8 for S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate compared with amlodipine besylate. Secondary end points were as follows: (1) noninferiority of the difference in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) from baseline to week 8 between the study groups; and (2) SiDBP response rate (defined as the proportion of patients whose SiDBP was < 90 mm Hg or whose SiDBP reduction was ≥ 10 mm Hg from baseline) after the 8-week treatment. Also, the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported. Severe AEs/ADRs were defined as those associated with any of the following: death; an event associated with a high risk of mortality; an event requiring hospitalization; or development of a permanent disability or congenital malformation.

Results

One hundred fifty-seven patients were assessed for inclusion in the study. Of these, 124 patients were randomly allocated to receive S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate (42 men, 21 women; mean [SD] age, 52.4 [10.3] years [range, 23–70 years]; weight, 67.7 [10.8] kg [range, 44–92 kg]) or amlodipine besylate (45 men, 16 women; mean [SD] age, 54.5 [10.0] years [range, 30–73]; weight, 68.9 [9.8] kg [range, 49–95 kg]). One hundred sixteen patients completed the study, but 11 patients (8.9%) were dropped from the per-protocol analysis due to violations; therefore, 105 patients were included in the modified intent-to-treat population analysis (S[-]-amlodipine nicotinate, 55 patients; amlodipine besylate, 50 patients). There were no significant between-group differences in the baseline characteristics. Baseline mean (SD) SiSBP and SiDBP were 142.6 (11.3) and 94.9 (4.8) mm Hg in the S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate group, and 141.8 (8.3) and 96.1 (4.9) mm Hg in the amlodipine besylate group. Mean (SD) changes in SiSBP were 17.6 (11.2) mm Hg in the S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate group and 18.6 (12.3) mm Hg in the amlodipine besylate group. The SiDBP response rates were 92.7% in the S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate group and 88.0% in the amlodipine besylate group. There were no significant between-group differences in the prevalence of AEs and ADRs. In the S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate group, 15 patients (23.8%) reported a total of 28 AEs, and 19 patients (31.1%) reported a total of 27 AEs in the amlodipine besylate group. Six patients (9.5%) in the S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate group and 7 patients (11.4%) in the amlodipine besylate group experienced a total of 19 ADRs (11 and 8, respectively). The most common ADRs were liver enzyme elevation (3/63 [4.8%]) in the S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate group and facial flushing (3/61 [4.9%]) in the amlodipine besylate group. No cases of severe AEs or ADRs were reported in either group.

Conclusions

The reduction of SiDBP after 8 weeks of treatment with S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate was noninferior compared with that of racemic amlodipine besylate in these adult Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The SiDBP response rate and the reduction of SiSBP after 8 weeks of treatment with S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate were not significantly different from those with racemic amlodipine besylate. Both treatments were generally well tolerated.

Discussion

CHIEF randomized in excess of 13 000 patients between October 2007 and October 2008, of whom 73% were recruited into the lipid-lowering limb.

If CHIEF runs its full course, it should report at the end of 2011. CHIEF will help to define the place of the two different treatment strategies for the lowering of BP, both alone and in combination with lipid-lowering therapy and lifestyle intervention, in the prevention of cardiovascular outcomes.

The recent guidelines on hypertension, and on cardiovascular preventionemphasized that rather than focus on single-risk factors, focus should be on the global cardiovascular risk of an individual patient. The CHIEF study was designed to manage the hypertensive patients on the basis of an extensive intervention of the overall risk, including an initial low dose of combined antihypertensive therapy, low-dose statin-based lipid-lowering treatment and lifestyle intervention. Extensive intervention of overall risks has great potential to control hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors, to enable more patients to reach their target BP, and further reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.
