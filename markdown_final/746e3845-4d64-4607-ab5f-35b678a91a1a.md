## Question

What goes first RNU or adjuvant chemotherapy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which should come first — radical nephroureterectomy or systemic chemotherapy — in upper tract urothelial carcinoma, and what the evidence-based sequence and rationale are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest level evidence and current guideline positions. Then, I should verify disease-specific considerations that differ from bladder cancer, especially preoperative staging reliability and postoperative renal function. Next, I will examine the strengths and limitations of adjuvant versus neoadjuvant strategies. After that, I should outline a practical clinical algorithm including eligibility, timing, and alternatives if cisplatin is not feasible. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation while noting caveats and ongoing debates.

> Let me first confirm the evidence base. The POUT phase 3 randomized trial demonstrated that platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy after radical nephroureterectomy improved disease-free survival compared with surveillance in patients with pT2–T4 and/or node-positive UTUC, providing level 1 support for an adjuvant approach following surgery [^114jo8gX] [^111YCZjP]. I should also double-check guideline alignment: the 2025 EAU UTUC guidelines explicitly recommend offering adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy after radical nephroureterectomy in eligible patients with pT2–T4 and/or pN+ disease, which is consistent with POUT and reflects the best available prospective evidence [^114DKcpi] [^114jo8gX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about simply mirroring bladder cancer practices. Unlike bladder cancer, UTUC preoperative staging is notoriously unreliable because ureteroscopic biopsies often cannot assess depth of invasion and imaging has limited accuracy, so definitive pathologic staging from the nephroureterectomy specimen is typically required to identify who truly benefits from systemic therapy, which supports the sequence of surgery first then adjuvant chemotherapy for risk-adapted selection [^114jo8gX] [^1175q4eL].

> I need to check the drawbacks of adjuvant-first strategies. Postoperative loss of renal mass predictably decreases eGFR and can reduce cisplatin eligibility, and some patients may not recover quickly enough from surgery to start adjuvant therapy on time; these feasibility concerns were acknowledged in POUT and have been highlighted in perioperative UTUC reviews, although the randomized evidence still favors adjuvant therapy when deliverable [^114jo8gX] [^116RKBqD]. Wait, let me verify the exact proportions of cisplatin ineligibility — these vary across series, but the consistent theme is a meaningful decline in renal function after nephroureterectomy that can preclude cisplatin in a subset, reinforcing the need for early postoperative reassessment and timely initiation when possible [^116RKBqD] [^114jo8gX].

> Next, I should review the theoretical and empirical case for neoadjuvant therapy. Giving cisplatin before nephroureterectomy leverages two functioning kidneys, may increase chemotherapy completion, and could downstage disease, but despite promising pathologic response rates and survival signals in meta-analyses of retrospective cohorts, there is no completed randomized UTUC trial validating neoadjuvant chemotherapy as standard, and major guidelines do not recommend routine neoadjuvant use outside clinical trials at this time [^1141sVys] [^114Gipj3]. Hmm, wait a minute — I almost concluded neoadjuvant therapy is contraindicated; that's not correct, it's investigational with encouraging data in select high-risk presentations, but absent level 1 confirmation for UTUC it should be confined to trials or carefully selected cases where the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks of delaying surgery [^1141sVys] [^114Gipj3].

> I will now examine the guideline-concordant practical algorithm. Preoperative workup with ureteroscopy and cross-sectional imaging should be undertaken while recognizing T-staging limitations, and patients with high-risk features should proceed to radical nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff excision and an anatomically appropriate lymph node dissection as the definitive first step for local control and accurate staging [^114DKcpi] [^1175q4eL]. After final pathology, I need to ensure timely consideration of adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy within the postoperative window for those with ≥ pT2 and/or pN+ disease and adequate renal function, consistent with POUT and EAU recommendations, using cisplatin when feasible and carboplatin when cisplatin is contraindicated per the trial framework and guideline allowances [^114jo8gX] [^114DKcpi]. Let me verify immunotherapy options if platinum is not suitable: adjuvant nivolumab has regulatory support across urothelial carcinoma including UTUC in high-risk post-resection settings, and EAU UTUC guidance supports discussing adjuvant nivolumab in PD-L1–positive, cisplatin-ineligible or declining patients; discussion of pembrolizumab as an adjuvant option may also be appropriate in selected high-risk, platinum-ineligible cases per EAU UTUC recommendations, although long-term overall survival data remain limited in this context [^112n96uA] [^114Gipj3] [^116pTxZ4].

> But wait, what if I am concerned a patient will lose cisplatin eligibility postoperatively or presents with clearly locally advanced disease on imaging. In such scenarios, I should reconsider and discuss neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy within a clinical trial or in highly selected patients after multidisciplinary review, balancing the potential for improved systemic therapy delivery and downstaging against the risk of delaying potentially curative surgery and the uncertainty from the absence of level 1 UTUC data to date [^1141sVys] [^114jo8gX]. I should confirm that patients are closely monitored, with predefined criteria to proceed expeditiously to surgery if there is nonresponse or intolerance, to avoid compromising cure rates by undue delay in definitive resection [^114Gipj3] [^114jo8gX].

> Synthesis time: the evidence-based sequence for most high-risk, nonmetastatic UTUC is radical nephroureterectomy first, followed by risk-adapted adjuvant systemic therapy, with platinum-based chemotherapy preferred in eligible patients, as established by POUT and endorsed by contemporary EAU UTUC guidelines, because it ensures accurate pathological staging and targets therapy to those most likely to benefit with proven gains in disease-free outcomes [^114jo8gX] [^114DKcpi] [^114Gipj3]. I need to emphasize the caveat that postoperative renal function decline can limit cisplatin delivery; thus, early postoperative assessment and optimization are crucial, and adjuvant immunotherapy can be considered for selected platinum-ineligible patients per regulatory labeling and guideline discussion, while neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains investigational and should be reserved for trials or carefully selected cases after multidisciplinary deliberation [^116RKBqD] [^112n96uA] [^116pTxZ4].

Radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) should be performed **first** in upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) [^114DKcpi], with adjuvant chemotherapy given postoperatively to eligible patients with high-risk pathology (pT2–T4 and/or pN+) [^111YCZjP]. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is **not standard** due to unreliable preoperative staging [^114jo8gX] and risk of overtreatment [^1141sVys]. Adjuvant chemotherapy is typically initiated **within 90 days** after RNU [^111YCZjP], and adjuvant nivolumab [^112n96uA] is an option for cisplatin-ineligible or declining patients [^114Gipj3].

---

## Current standard of care

Standard treatment for high-risk UTUC is radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) with bladder cuff excision [^114DKcpi] [^113WWtKF], and **adjuvant chemotherapy** with platinum-based regimens is recommended postoperatively [^114WTBce] for eligible patients with high-risk pathology (pT2–T4 and/or pN+) [^111YCZjP].

---

## Evidence supporting RNU first

- **Pathologic staging**: RNU provides definitive staging [^113WWtKF] to guide adjuvant therapy selection.

- **Intravesical recurrence**: Single-dose postoperative intravesical chemotherapy [^113WWtKF] after RNU reduces bladder recurrence [^11146iBe].

- **Adjuvant chemotherapy**: Adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy after RNU improves survival [^111YCZjP] in high-risk patients [^114DKcpi].

---

## Limitations of neoadjuvant chemotherapy

- **Staging accuracy**: Preoperative staging is unreliable [^114jo8gX], risking overtreatment or undertreatment [^1175q4eL].

- **Renal function**: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can impair renal function, complicating subsequent surgery.

- **Evidence gap**: No prospective randomized trials have established neoadjuvant chemotherapy as standard in UTUC [^114jo8gX] [^1141sVys].

---

## Timing of adjuvant chemotherapy

Adjuvant chemotherapy is typically initiated **within 90 days** after RNU [^111YCZjP], using a **platinum-based** regimen (e.g. gemcitabine–cisplatin) [^114DKcpi] [^114WTBce].

---

## Role of adjuvant immunotherapy

Nivolumab is recommended for **PD-L1–positive** patients who are unfit for, or decline platinum-based chemotherapy [^112n96uA] [^114Gipj3], and **Pembrolizumab** can be considered for patients with high-risk pathology who are unfit for, or decline platinum-based chemotherapy [^116pTxZ4].

---

## Clinical scenarios influencing sequence

- **High-risk pathology**: RNU first, then adjuvant chemotherapy for pT2–T4 and/or pN+ disease [^114DKcpi] [^111YCZjP].

- **Cisplatin-ineligible**: RNU first, then adjuvant immunotherapy (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) [^114Gipj3] [^116pTxZ4] [^112n96uA].

- **Low-risk disease**: RNU alone may suffice; adjuvant therapy typically not indicated [^114DKcpi].

---

## Summary table: sequence of RNU and adjuvant chemotherapy

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended sequence** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| High-risk UTUC (pT2–T4 and/or pN+) | - RNU first <br/> - Then adjuvant chemotherapy | - Definitive staging <br/> - Improved survival [^114DKcpi] [^111YCZjP] |
| Cisplatin-ineligible or declining chemotherapy | - RNU first <br/> - Then adjuvant immunotherapy | Alternative systemic therapy [^114Gipj3] [^112n96uA] |
| Low-risk UTUC | RNU alone | Adjuvant therapy not typically indicated [^114DKcpi] |

---

RNU should be performed **first**, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy or immunotherapy based on postoperative pathology and patient eligibility. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not standard due to staging limitations and potential overtreatment.

Whether perioperative systemic therapy would be most effective for UTUC in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting remains contentious. Meaningful pathological complete response rates and, in retrospective case series, survival benefits suggest similar potential advantages with neoadjuvant therapy in UTUC to those seen in bladder cancer. Furthermore, potentially nephrotoxic cisplatin-based chemotherapy might be safer and more feasible for UTUC if given before nephroureterectomy, when patients retain maximum renal function.

Some patients were probably excluded from the POUT trial (and might be similarly excluded from adjuvant chemotherapy in real-life practice) because of insufficient recovery after surgery. These patients might be better served with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, albeit with the risk that the toxic effects of chemotherapy could prevent some individuals from proceeding with curative surgery.

We had considered a trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy when developing the POUT trial concept; however, we had concerns about the reliability of preoperative staging and histology in muscle-invasive UTUC. Before starting the POUT trial, we conducted a feasibility survey across all potential UK investigators, which strongly supported an adjuvant rather than a neoadjuvant study for the reasons we have outlined. Two patient focus groups undertaken during study development explored the different approaches, and their feedback favored an adjuvant trial. Investigation of the relative feasibility of adjuvant and neoadjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy in UTUC is underway.

Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer and ranks eighth as a cause of death from cancer among men in the United States. Although guidelines assist in treatment, the art of managing bladder cancer, such as the decision to use neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the timing of cystectomy, is still variable. Bladder cancer has a propensity to recur, and with recurrence, a significant number of cases progress, which makes the early detection of high-risk patients imperative. Advances in detection, surveillance, and treatment of bladder cancer are reviewed in this article.

Regarding medical management for bladder cancer, specifically the management of muscle-invasive cancer, the ASCO/AUA/SUO 2024 guidelines recommend not offering carboplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy to patients with clinically resectable stage cT2-T4aN0 bladder cancer. Instead, definitive locoregional therapy should be pursued in patients who are ineligible for cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

### Decreased overall and bladder cancer-specific mortality with adjuvant chemotherapy after radical cystectomy: Multivariable competing risk analysis [^111MwGF5]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Adding chemotherapy to radical cystectomy (RC) may improve outcomes. Neoadjuvant treatment is advocated by guidelines based on meta-analysis data, but it is severely underused in clinical practice. Adjuvant treatment of patients at risk could be an alternative. We analyzed a sample of 798 patients who underwent RC between 1993 and 2011 for high-risk superficial or muscle-invasive urothelial or undifferentiated bladder cancer. Of these, 23% received adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy and 5% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Use of adjuvant chemotherapy was an independent predictor of decreased overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.38–0.66; p < 0.0001) and bladder cancer-specific mortality (HR: 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52–0.97; p = 0.0321), though it was not associated with competing mortality. Similar figures were obtained when analyzing the number of cisplatin-containing cycles administered or when restricting the analysis to patients with lymph node-positive or extravesical but lymph node-negative disease. This suggests a mortality-reducing treatment effect after adjusting for several patient- and tumor-related confounders. Future trials should directly compare the concepts of neoadjuvant and adjuvant application of chemotherapy in candidates for RC.

- **Patient summary**: Adjuvant chemotherapy may decrease overall and bladder cancer-specific mortality after radical cystectomy (RC). Future trials should directly compare the concepts of neoadjuvant and adjuvant application of chemotherapy in candidates for RC.

### Perioperative chemotherapy for upper tract urothelial cancer [^116RKBqD]. Nature Reviews Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Upper tract urothelial cancer (UTUC) is an aggressive disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) with bladder cuff removal is considered the standard of care for most invasive UTUCs, but distant relapses after surgery for locally advanced, high-grade disease are common. Although multimodality treatment with perioperative chemotherapy has been thoroughly investigated in recent years, adjuvant chemotherapy has primarily been analyzed in small retrospective uncontrolled studies, and a clear benefit for this treatment modality is yet to be established. It is likely that the high incidence of renal insufficiency after surgery substantially limits the applicability of adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin-based regimens.

Neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy has several practical advantages over adjuvant therapy, including better patient tolerance in the preoperative setting when a patient has two kidneys rather than one, and the obtainment of prognostic information from pathological downstaging. Although some academic centers have adopted neoadjuvant chemotherapy as a de facto treatment standard for patients with high-grade locally advanced UTUC, this treatment approach has not been prospectively validated or adopted in general urologic practice. A multicenter trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced high-grade UTUC could further define the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in treating UTUC.

### Guideline on muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer (European Association of Urology guideline): American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline endorsement [^111U5H8A]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

To endorse the European Association of Urology guideline on muscle-invasive (MIBC) and metastatic bladder cancer, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has implemented a policy and set of procedures for endorsing clinical practice guidelines that have been developed by other professional organizations.

- **Methods**: The guideline on MIBC and metastatic bladder cancer was reviewed for developmental rigor by methodologists. Subsequently, the ASCO Endorsement Panel reviewed the content and recommendations.

- **Results**: The ASCO Endorsement Panel determined that the recommendations from the European Association of Urology guideline on MIBC and metastatic bladder cancer, published online in March 2015, are clear, thorough, and based on the most relevant scientific evidence. ASCO endorses the guideline and has added qualifying statements, including highlighting the use of chemoradiotherapy for select patients with MIBC and recommending a preference for clinical trials in the treatment of metastatic disease in the second-line setting.

- **Recommendations**: Multidisciplinary care for patients with MIBC and metastatic bladder cancer is critical. The standard treatment for MIBC (cT2-T4a N0M0) is neoadjuvant cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy. In cisplatin-ineligible patients, radical cystectomy alone is recommended. Adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy may be offered to high-risk patients who have not received neoadjuvant therapy. Chemoradiotherapy may be offered as an alternative to cystectomy in appropriately selected patients.

### Integrating perioperative chemotherapy into the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer: Strategy versus reality [^111yzkUA]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2009). Low credibility.

Since the initial report in 2003 of the Intergroup-0080 trial confirmed the benefit of combined neoadjuvant M-VAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, adriablastine, and cisplatin) chemotherapy and cystectomy in the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer, debate has continued in the literature regarding the relative risks and benefits of integrating perioperative chemotherapy into patient care. This is especially debated for patients with organ-confined, muscle-invasive, node-negative disease, where the benefit may be less evident. Due to the inaccuracies of clinical staging, the potential morbidity linked to M-VAC chemotherapy, a 70% cure rate in pT2No disease with surgery alone, and only a modest (5%) improvement in absolute overall survival with combined therapy, many professionals favor limiting chemotherapy to patients with a pathologic stage of pT3 or greater or node-positive disease.

This philosophy is also reflected in the 2008 National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: Bladder Cancer, where neoadjuvant chemotherapy for clinical T2 disease versus adjuvant therapy based on pathologic risks is merely "considered". A recent study examining the perioperative integration of chemotherapy for stage III bladder cancer in the United States using the National Cancer Data Base demonstrated that only 11.6% of patients underwent any perioperative chemotherapy, predominantly in the adjuvant setting. These findings suggest that despite randomized trial data indicating survival benefit from perioperative chemotherapy and Guidelines supporting those findings, the integration of such treatment in practice remains limited.

### Quality indicators for the management of high-risk upper tract urothelial carcinoma requiring radical nephroureterectomy [^113WWtKF]. Current Opinion in Urology (2021). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article was to identify quality indicators for optimized management of high-risk upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) requiring radical nephroureterectomy (RNU).

RNU with bladder cuff resection is the standard treatment for high-risk UTUC. For the bladder cuff resection, two main approaches are accepted: transvesical and extravesical. Lymph node dissection, following a dedicated template, should be performed in all high-risk patients undergoing RNU as it improves tumor staging and possibly survival. Postoperative bladder instillation of single-dose chemotherapy should be administered after RNU to decrease the risk of intravesical tumor recurrence. Perioperative systemic chemotherapy should always be considered for advanced cancers. Although level-1 evidence is available for adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy, neoadjuvant regimens are still being evaluated.

Optimal management of high-risk UTUC requires evidence-based, reproducible quality indicators to provide guidance and frameworks for clinical practices. Adherence to quality indicators allows for the measurement and comparison of outcomes that are likely to improve prognosis. Based on the literature, we found four evidence-based accepted quality indicators that are easily implementable to improve the management of high-risk UTUC patients treated with RNU: adequate management of the distal ureter/bladder cuff, template-based lymph node dissection, single-shot postoperative intravesical chemotherapy, and perioperative systemic treatment.

### Management of isolated renal fossa recurrence following radical nephrectomy [^115DAtnb]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Local recurrence of renal cell carcinoma in the renal fossa without distant metastatic disease is an infrequent occurrence, presenting challenges in management due to the limited number of studies available. We describe our use of surgical extirpation with adjuvant intraoperative radiation.

The study utilized data from the University of California, San Francisco Urologic Oncology and Radiation Oncology databases, focusing exclusively on patients with renal fossa recurrence of renal cell carcinoma. Variables such as survival, complications, and the use of adjuvant intraoperative radiation therapy were recorded.

A total of 14 patients were treated for this lesion between 1990 and 2003. The mean time to recurrence was 40 months, with a range of 5 to 180 months. Only one patient was symptomatic preoperatively, while 13 cases were detected via routine computerized tomography follow-up. The mean tumor size was 6.35 cm, ranging from 2 to 17 cm. Nine patients died of progressive metastatic disease following a mean of 17 months (range 1 to 56), while five patients are alive with a mean survival of 66 months (range 14 to 86). The time to recurrence after nephrectomy approached statistical significance (p = 0.06) when comparing patients who survived versus those who succumbed to the disease. Additionally, there was no statistical difference in the size of mass recurrence between these two groups, nor was there a survival benefit due to adjuvant intraoperative radiation therapy.

### Outcome of surgical treatment of isolated local recurrence after radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma [^11254KXk]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Isolated local recurrences after radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma occur in 2% to 3% of cases. Today, local recurrences can be detected at an early stage due to modern imaging techniques, though it remains controversial whether an aggressive surgical approach can prolong survival.

- **Materials and methods**: We retrospectively analyzed 16 patients who were treated surgically at our institution for suspected isolated local renal cell carcinoma recurrence during the last 10 years. All patients underwent extensive staging and showed no evidence of distant metastases with the local recurrence. Surgical exploration confirmed carcinoma recurrence in 13 of the 16 cases, and all 13 patients underwent complete resection of the local recurrence. Three patients were found to have had false-positive computerized tomography findings upon surgical exploration.

- **Results**: The mean time to recurrence was 45.5 months (range 7 to 224). Only 2 patients were symptomatic, while in 11, the disease had been detected at routine follow-up. Mean size of the tumor was 5.92 cm (range 2 to 10). All patients survived surgery without major complications. Of the patients, 7 died of metastatic disease following a mean survival of 23.1 months (range 4 to 68) following recurrence removal, and 6 are alive with a mean survival of 53.0 months (range 18 to 101) (p = 0.09). Time to recurrence after nephrectomy was significantly longer (p < 0.05), and the size of recurrence was significantly smaller (p < 0.04) in the patients still alive. In 1 surviving patient, evidence of metastatic disease developed 9 months after the procedure.

### Metastatic behavior of upper tract urothelial carcinoma after radical nephroureterectomy: Association with primary tumor location [^113cB5wa]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the site-specific pattern of disease recurrence and/or metastasis and the associated patient outcomes after radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) in upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).

A total of 733 patients with UTUC from a retrospective multi-institutional cohort were included, with a median follow-up of 34 months. Associated patient outcomes were analyzed by multivariate analysis. To evaluate the influence of primary tumor location, it was divided into four areas: renal pelvis, and upper, middle, and lower ureter.

A total of 218 patients experienced disease recurrence, with the majority of relapses occurring within the first 3 years. Cumulative incidence rates of first disease recurrence at 1 and 3 years were 18.9% and 29.8%, respectively. Of these patients, 38.5% developed distant recurrence; 17.4% experienced both local and distant recurrences; and 44.0% developed isolated local recurrence. The predominant sites of distant metastasis were lung, liver, and bone. Multivariate analysis revealed that the prevalence of local recurrence and lung metastasis was significantly associated, with primary tumor location being independent of other clinicopathological variables. Lower/middle ureter tumors had a higher rate of local recurrence in the pelvic cavity, and renal pelvic tumors had a higher prevalence of distant relapse in the lungs. Similar results were obtained when rerunning the data set by excluding patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 131).

This multi-institutional study provided a detailed picture of the metastatic behavior of UTUC following radical nephroureterectomy.

### Adjuvant chemotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised controlled trials [^111ngZPL]. European Urology (2022). High credibility.

- **Limitations**: Almost one-third of the participants in these trials did not receive all the planned chemotherapy cycles. Some trials administered fewer chemotherapy cycles and lower total doses of cisplatin than others. This variability is expected in clinical practice, but it may dilute the estimated overall effect of adjuvant chemotherapy, making it difficult to recommend an optimum number of chemotherapy cycles. Trials that terminate early due to observed benefits or harms are more prone to bias. Two included trials stopped accrual early due to an observed treatment benefit. This was discussed in the original meta-analysis, and updated follow-up was obtained for both trials to mitigate potential bias. Three trials stopped early due to smaller than expected differences between treatments or futility analyses, and two stopped due to slower than expected accrual, which is unlikely to introduce bias.

- **Data availability issues**: Data were not available for two eligible trials in the original IPD meta-analysis (Omura et al, unpublished), and data for another trial were not available for this update despite repeated requests to the investigator. One trial was never published (Omura et al, unpublished), and another did not publish survival data. Including the hazard ratio (HR) for the other trial (presented in 2010) with our IPD results in a sensitivity analysis gives an overall HR of 0.77 (0.67, 0.90; p = 0.003, Het p = 0.4), which aligns with the IPD results.

### Adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival of patients with high-risk upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma: a propensity score-matched analysis [^116NpVBm]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

UTUC is a rare disease with a poor prognosis. More than 40% of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, resulting in poor outcomes. To improve survival, perioperative chemotherapy is performed. The efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for urinary bladder cancer has been confirmed by randomized study. Immediate adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) for patients with advanced urinary bladder cancer did not improve overall survival compared to deferred chemotherapy. However, it might benefit a subgroup of urinary bladder cancer patients, particularly those who are pN-positive.

After radical nephroureterectomy (RNU), many patients lose nearly 50% of their renal function, making them ineligible for chemotherapy. From this perspective, NAC might be preferred for patients with advanced UTUC. However, precise preoperative diagnosis of the tumor stage or lymphovascular invasion (LVI) status is challenging. Although one study showed that magnetic resonance imaging could predict tumor stage, accurate staging of UTUC is difficult. Unlike urinary bladder cancer, where the pathological stage can be accurately diagnosed by transurethral resection of the bladder tumor before radical cystectomy, staging UTUC accurately remains challenging even with ureteroscopic biopsy.

### Perioperative management of upper tract urothelial carcinoma in the Nordic countries [^1175q4eL]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is a relatively rare disease, accounting for 5–10% of all urothelial cancers, with an estimated annual incidence of 1–2 cases per 100,000. The rate of metastatic disease at presentation is 7–9%.

Studies on temporal trends reveal a high proportion of locally advanced or metastatic disease (60%) and high-grade (70%) tumors, with a shift towards more aggressive disease over the last two decades.

The gold standard treatment for non-metastatic high-risk UTUC is radical nephroureterectomy (NU) with bladder cuff excision. For patients with low-risk tumors, kidney-sparing endoscopic treatment, or segmental ureterectomy, is recommended. However, it is impossible to determine T-stage before histology after NU is available. The imaging modalities are suboptimal, and pathological evaluation of a biopsy often only allows evaluation of the grade of the tumor, not the stage. Therefore, deciding on the type of surgical treatment, whether to perform lymphadenectomy (LND), and the selection of patients for systemic chemotherapy preoperatively is difficult. To assist in this process, guidelines recommend predictive tools based on preoperative patient and tumor characteristics when selecting the treatment modality. However, it is known from prior studies that there are discrepancies between guideline recommendations and daily practice in the management of urothelial cancer of the bladder. To the best of our knowledge, adherence to the EAU guidelines on UTUC in the Nordic countries is unknown.

**Effects by participant characteristics**: We found no clear evidence that the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on overall survival differed by age (continuous; interaction HR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.78–1.16, p = 0.6, I² = 2%, Het p = 0.4), age (categorical; interaction HR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.81–1.25, p = 1.0, I² = 0%, Het p = 0.8), pT category (interaction HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.59–1.06, p = 0.1, I² = 0%, Het p = 0.9), or pN category (interaction HR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.88–1.35, p = 0.5, I² = 23%, Het p = 0.3). Applying the overall HR of 0.82 translates to 5-year survival benefits of 5% for pT2, 7% for pT3, 7% for pT4a, and of 6% for N0, 7% for N1, and 7% for N2 at 5 years. Prespecified analyses by sex, grade, or performance status were not carried out due to the majority of participants being in one category and/or insufficient data being available. As grade was measured on different scales, it was not reasonable to combine these in a consistent or reliable way for analysis.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on upper urinary tract urothelial cell carcinoma: 2015 update [^114u9kT5]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

The European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines panel on upper urinary tract urothelial cell carcinoma (UTUC) has prepared updated guidelines to aid clinicians in the evidence-based management of UTUC and to incorporate recommendations into clinical practice.

- **Objective**: To provide a brief overview of the EAU guidelines on UTUC as an aid to clinicians.

- **Evidence acquisition**: The recommendations provided in the guidelines are based on a thorough review of available UTUC guidelines and articles identified following a systematic search of Medline. Data on urothelial malignancies and UTUC were searched using these keywords: urinary tract cancer; urothelial carcinomas; upper urinary tract, carcinoma; renal pelvis; ureter; bladder cancer; chemotherapy; nephroureterectomy; adjuvant treatment; instillation; neoadjuvant treatment; recurrence; risk factors; and survival. References were weighted by a panel of experts.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Due to the rarity of UTUC, there are insufficient data to provide strong recommendations (i.e.g.rade A). However, the results of recent multicentre studies are now available, and there is a growing interest in UTUC. The 2009 TNM classification is recommended. Recommendations are given for diagnosis and risk stratification as well as radical and conservative treatment, and prognostic factors are discussed. A single postoperative dose of intravesical mitomycin after nephroureterectomy reduces the risk of bladder tumor recurrence. Recommendations are also provided for patient follow-up after different therapeutic strategies.

### Neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy for upper tract urothelial carcinoma: A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis, and future perspectives on systemic therapy [^1141sVys]. European Urology (2021). Low credibility.

To improve the prognosis of upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC), clinicians have used neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) or adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) before or after radical nephroureterectomy (RNU). Despite some new data, the evidence remains mixed on their efficacy.

- **Objective**: To update the evidence on the role of NAC and AC for UTUC.

- **Evidence acquisition**: We searched for all studies investigating NAC or AC for UTUC in Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and abstracts from the American Society of Clinical Oncology meetings up to February 2020. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed.

- **Evidence synthesis**: For NAC, the pooled pathologic complete response rate (≤ ypT0N0M0) was 11% (n = 811) and pathologic partial response rate (≤ ypT1N0M0) was 43% (n = 869), both across 14 studies. Across six studies, the pooled hazard ratios (HRs) were 0.44 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.32–0.59, p < 0.001) for overall survival (OS) and 0.38 (95% CI: 0.24–0.61, p < 0.001) for cancer-specific survival (CSS) in favor of NAC. The evidence for NAC is at best level 2. As for AC, there was a benefit in OS (pooled HR 0.77; 95% CI: 0.64–0.92, p = 0.004 across 14 studies and 7983 patients), CSS (pooled HR 0.79; 95% CI: 0.69–0.91, p = 0.001 across 18 studies and 5659 patients), and disease-free survival (DFS; pooled HR 0.52; 95% CI: 0.38–0.70 across four studies and 602 patients). While most studies were retrospective (level 2 evidence), there were two prospective randomized trials providing level 1 evidence. There are currently four phase 2 trials in progress.

### Opdivo [^112n96uA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Adjuvant treatment of UC at high risk of recurrence - CHECKMATE-274 (NCT02632409) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigating adjuvant Opdivo in patients who were within 120 days of radical resection (R0) of UC of the bladder or upper urinary tract (renal pelvis or ureter) at high risk of recurrence. High risk of recurrence was defined as either 1) ypT2-ypT4a or ypN+ for patients who received neoadjuvant cisplatin or 2) pT3-pT4a or pN+ for patients who did not receive neoadjuvant cisplatin and who either were ineligible for, or refused adjuvant cisplatin. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive Opdivo 240 mg or placebo by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks until recurrence or until unacceptable toxicity for a maximum treatment duration of 1 year.

Patients were stratified by pathologic nodal status (N+ vs. N0/x with < 10 nodes removed vs. N0 with ≥ 10 nodes removed), tumor cells expressing PD-L1 (≥ 1% vs. < 1%/indeterminate as determined by the central lab using the PD-L1 IHC 28–8 pharmDx assay), and use of neoadjuvant cisplatin (yes vs. no).

The trial population characteristics were: median age of 67 years (range: 30 to 92); 76% male; 76% White, 22% Asian, 0.7% Black, and 0.1% American Indian or Alaska Native. Of the 335 (47%) patients with node-positive UC, 44 (6%) had non–muscle-invasive (< pT2) primary tumors. ECOG performance status was 0 (63%), 1 (35%), or 2 (2%). Prior neoadjuvant cisplatin had been given to 43% of patients; of the 57% who did not receive prior neoadjuvant cisplatin, reasons listed were ineligibility (22%), patient preference (33%).

### A prospective randomized EORTC intergroup phase 3 study comparing the complications of elective nephron-sparing surgery and radical nephrectomy for low-stage renal cell carcinoma [^111ALhUJ]. European Urology (2007). High credibility.

This study compared the complications and cancer control of elective nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) and radical nephrectomy (RN) in patients with a small (≤ 5 cm), solitary, low-stage N0 M0 tumor suspicious for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and a normal contralateral kidney.

- **Methods**: 541 patients were randomized in a prospective, multicenter, phase 3 trial to undergo NSS (n = 268) or RN (n = 273) together with a limited lymph node dissection.

- **Results**: This publication reports only on the complications reported for both surgical methods. The rate of perioperative blood loss < 0.5 l was slightly higher after RN (96.0% vs. 87.2%) and the rate of severe hemorrhage was slightly higher after NSS (3.1% vs. 1.2%). Ten patients (4.4%), all of whom were treated with NSS, developed urinary fistulas. Pleural damage (11.5% for NSS vs. 9.3% for RN) and spleen damage (0.4% for NSS and 0.4% for RN) were observed with similar rates in both groups. Postoperative computed tomography scanning abnormalities were seen in 5.8% of NSS and 2.0% of RN patients. Reoperation for complications was necessary in 4.4% of NSS and 2.4% of RN patients.

- **Conclusions**: NSS for small, easily resectable, incidentally discovered RCC in the presence of a normal contralateral kidney can be performed safely with slightly higher complication rates than after RN. The oncologic results are eagerly awaited to confirm that NSS is an acceptable approach for small asymptomatic RCC.

### Evaluating the safety of intraoperative instillation of intravesical chemotherapy at the time of nephroureterectomy [^112w1aga]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is a common cancer affecting many patients in the United States. Nephroureterectomy remains the gold standard for the treatment of high-grade upper tract disease or low-grade tumors that are not amenable to endoscopic management. Recent reports have shown a decrease in UC recurrence in patients who underwent nephroureterectomy and had Mitomycin C (MMC) instilled into the bladder at the time of catheter removal. At our institution, instillation of intravesical MMC at the time of nephroureterectomy has been common for more than 10 years. Given the recent data, we sought to formally describe our experience with and evaluate the safety of intravesical instillation of cytotoxic chemotherapy at the time of nephroureterectomy.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed 51 patients who underwent intraoperative intravesical instillation of cytotoxic chemotherapy (MMC (n = 48) or adriamycin (n = 3)) at the time of nephroureterectomy (2000–2012). The procedure was performed in a similar fashion by eight different surgeons from the same institution, with drainage of the bladder prior to management of the bladder cuff. Patient characteristics and perioperative data, including complications up to 90 days after surgery, were collected. Perioperative complications for all patients were graded using the modified Clavien-Dindo classification.

- **Results**: Twenty-four men and 27 women underwent intraoperative intravesical instillation of cytotoxic chemotherapy at the time of nephroureterectomy. The median age at the time of operation was 74 years (range 48–88). Median

### EAU guidelines on non-muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder [^112YvsmL]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

To present the updated version of the 2008 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, a systematic review of recent literature on diagnosis and treatment was conducted. The guidelines were updated, and the level of evidence and grade of recommendation were assigned.

- **Evidence synthesis**: The diagnosis of bladder cancer relies on cystoscopy and histologic evaluation of the resected tissue. A complete and correct transurethral resection (TUR) is essential for prognosis. If the initial resection is incomplete or if a high-grade or T1 tumor is detected, a second TUR should be performed within 2–6 weeks.

	- The short- and long-term risks of both recurrence and progression can be estimated for individual patients using a scoring system and risk tables. Stratification into low, intermediate, and high-risk groups — separately for recurrence and progression — is crucial for determining adjuvant treatment.

- **Adjuvant treatment recommendations**:
	- For patients at low risk of tumor recurrence and progression, one immediate instillation of chemotherapy is strongly recommended.
	- For those at intermediate or high risk of recurrence and intermediate risk of progression, one immediate instillation of chemotherapy should be followed by further instillations or at least 1 year of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy.
	- For patients at high risk of tumor progression, after an immediate instillation of chemotherapy, intravesical BCG for at least 1 year is recommended.

### Adjuvant chemotherapy for bladder cancer-why does level 1 evidence not support it [^117GptDo]. Annals of Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Neoadjuvant cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy provides a 5% increase in cure rate, an increase in median survival of about 3 years, and statistically significant and clinically relevant increments in overall survival for patients with invasive bladder cancer. Despite compelling level 1 data, it has become quite clear that facts similar to those that changed the paradigm of breast cancer treatment in the 1970s have not had a similar influence on the patterns of practice in bladder cancer care. Instead of using this proven approach, cystectomy alone or surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy is often used as a functional alternative for patients with deeply invasive and/or node-metastatic disease discovered at radical cystectomy. However, there is no well-powered level 1 evidence to support routine adjuvant chemotherapy for invasive bladder cancer, and some randomized trials have shown inferior outcomes. There is a clear need for a well-designed, randomized trial that tests the utility of adjuvant chemotherapy for invasive bladder cancer, but until that has been completed, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by definitive local treatment should be the standard of care for invasive bladder cancer.

### Bladder cancer, version 3.2020, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116NtBkH]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2020). High credibility.

This selection from the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for bladder cancer focuses on the clinical presentation and workup of suspected bladder cancer, treatment of non-muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer, and treatment of metastatic urothelial bladder cancer because important updates have recently been made to these sections. Some important updates include recommendations for optimal treatment of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer in the event of a bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) shortage and details about biomarker testing for advanced or metastatic disease. The systemic therapy recommendations for second-line or subsequent therapies have also been revised. Treatment and management of muscle-invasive, nonmetastatic disease is covered in the complete version of the NCCN Guidelines for bladder cancer available at NCCN.org. Additional topics covered in the complete version include treatment of non-urothelial histologies and recommendations for non-bladder urinary tract cancers such as upper tract urothelial carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma of the prostate, and primary carcinoma of the urethra.

### Bladder cancer. Clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112jM3ve]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2005). Low credibility.

Urothelial tumors represent a spectrum of diseases with a range of prognosis. After a diagnosis is established at any point within the urothelial tract, the patient remains at risk for developing a new lesion at a different or the same location, and at a similar or more advanced stage. Continued monitoring for recurrence is an essential part of management, because most recurrences are superficial and can be managed endoscopically. Within each category of disease, more refined methods to determine prognosis and guide management, based on molecular staging, are under development with the goal of optimizing the individual patient's likelihood of cure and chance for organ preservation.

For patients with more extensive disease, newer treatments typically involve combined-modality approaches, using recently developed surgical procedures, or three-dimensional treatment planning for more precise delivery of radiation therapy. Although these are not appropriate in all cases, they do offer the promise of an improved quality of life and prolonged survival. Finally, within the category of metastatic disease, a number of new agents have been identified that appear to be superior to those currently considered to be standard therapies. Experts believe, therefore, that the treatment of urothelial tumors will evolve rapidly over the next few years, with improved outcomes for patients at all stages of disease.

### Neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy in upper tract urothelial carcinoma: A nationwide cohort study [^1166NQz6]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

In 2018, in South Korea, renal pelvis cancer was diagnosed in 689 patients (0.3% of all cancers), while ureter cancer was diagnosed in 686 patients (0.3% of all cancers). The incidence of UTUC was relatively low compared to that of bladder cancer, which affected 4,577 patients (1.9% of all cancers in 2018). However, the incidence rate of UTUC, approximately 30% of that of bladder cancer, was higher than previously reported rates of approximately 10% in other references. Therefore, effective treatment of UTUC could be important in the treatment setting of urothelial cancer in South Korea.

In this study, we evaluated the trend of AC and NAC in patients with NUx and compared the perioperative outcomes and overall survival (OS) between the AC and NAC groups using nationwide population-based data.

### Comparative effectiveness of radiation versus radical cystectomy for localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer [^116Yp2xK]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Currently, radical cystectomy (RC) with neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the most commonly recommended treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) or bladder cancer (BC) without metastases that is refractory to any treatment. Recently, the popularization of laparoscopic RC and robot-assisted RC (RARC) has been progressing worldwide. Yet, RC — including open, laparoscopic, and RARC — remains an invasive treatment and carries a high possibility of complications.

In the US and European guidelines, trimodality therapy (TMT) with concurrent chemoradiation is recommended, especially for well-selected patients with MIBC or those unfit for RC. In the Asia consensus statements of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, radiation therapy (RT) could be considered as a therapeutic option for MIBC with cT2, similar to Europe and the United States. However, perioperative treatments for bladder preservation vary considerably among Asian countries.

Overall, no successfully completed randomized controlled trials have compared the outcome of chemoradiation with RC. Thus, we evaluated the relative merits of RT compared with RC in a real-world setting.

### Long-term outcome of radiation therapy for locoregional recurrence of upper tract urothelial carcinoma after nephroureterectomy [^112WQjco]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Postoperative radiation therapy (RT) for risky upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) patients after radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) is another issue for debate. In the European Association of Urology guidelines, the role of postoperative RT after RNU remains controversial due to unclear evidence. A retrospective study suggested that postoperative RT is beneficial for patients who have a high likelihood of tumor recurrence, remaining tumor tissue, T4-stage tumors, or high-grade tumors. In addition, Chen et al. disclosed that postoperative RT significantly improved overall survival (OS) in patients with pathological T3–4 UTUC. On the contrary, one retrospective study declared that adjuvant RT after RNU did not improve survival outcomes in patients with pT3N0M0 UTUC.

There could be several reasons for the discrepancies in the findings among the studies. First, minimizing the heterogeneity among studies is difficult due to the improvements in RT techniques such as 3D conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), which contribute to fewer major adverse effects while still maintaining efficacy. Second, evidence regarding the most appropriate radiation dose is lacking.

As for the role of chemotherapy, drawing from the bladder urothelial carcinoma (UC) and small UTUC studies, platinum-based chemotherapy is effective as a first-line treatment for metastatic UTUC. One Japanese retrospective study found that patients with high-risk UTUC in the salvage chemotherapy group had a higher probability of cancer-specific survival following recurrence or metastasis compared with those in the non-salvage chemotherapy group. Compared with our study, consolidation RT after the response to chemotherapy led to better OS and locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS).

### Contemporary update on neoadjuvant therapy for bladder cancer [^115hxeuc]. Nature Reviews Urology (2017). Low credibility.

The administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy preceding radical cystectomy in patients with bladder cancer remains a matter of debate. Results of prospective, randomized studies have demonstrated an overall absolute survival benefit of 5% at five years, provided cisplatin-based combination regimens are used. Owing to the perception of a modest survival benefit, the medical community has been slow to adopt the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Other reasons for the underuse of neoadjuvant chemotherapy range from patient ineligibility to fear of delaying potentially curative surgery in nonresponders.

Several institutions have adopted an individualized, risk-adapted approach, where the decision to administer chemotherapy is based on clinical stage and patient comorbidity profile. The development of new cytotoxic and targeted therapies, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors, warrants well-designed prospective studies to test their efficacy alone or in combination in the neoadjuvant setting. Genomic characterization of muscle-invasive bladder cancer could offer information that aids clinicians in selecting the appropriate chemotherapy regimen.

Following neoadjuvant therapy, every effort should be made to ensure optimal surgery. Surgical margins and the number of removed lymph nodes are prognostic factors, thus, radical cystectomy and a meticulous extended pelvic lymph node dissection should be performed by expert surgeons.

### Effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced bladder cancer [^113VL56c]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Given that randomized trials exploring adjuvant chemotherapy for bladder cancer have been underpowered and/or terminated prematurely, yielding inconsistent results and creating an evidence gap, we sought to compare the effectiveness of cystectomy versus cystectomy plus adjuvant chemotherapy in real-world patients.

We conducted an observational study to compare the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation postcystectomy in patients with pathologic T3–4 and/or pathologic node-positive bladder cancer using the National Cancer Data Base. We compared overall survival using propensity score-adjusted, stratified, weighted, and matched analyses based on patient-, facility-, and tumor-level characteristics. A sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the impact of performance status.

A total of 5,653 patients met study inclusion criteria; 23% received adjuvant chemotherapy postcystectomy. Chemotherapy-treated patients were younger and more likely to have private insurance, live in areas with a higher median income and higher percentage of high school-educated residents, and have lymph node involvement and positive surgical margins (P < .05 for all comparisons). Stratified analyses adjusted for propensity score demonstrated an improvement in overall survival with adjuvant chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.76), and similar results were achieved with propensity score matching and weighting. The association between adjuvant chemotherapy and improved survival was consistent in subset analyses.

### Treatment approaches for melanomas that relapse after adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy [^112ULDJW]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Low credibility.

There is therefore an urgent need for widespread, uniform, and robust data to be collected on patients who develop disease relapse. These data need to include not only the pattern of relapse with respect to timing and location, but also management strategies, treatment modalities, and importantly, following outcomes through to subsequent relapse or sustained disease control. Incorporating this into the design of future prospective adjuvant trials can be one strategy to build this body of data.

Future first-line systemic therapy trials also need to consider this patient population, as existing studies only include those who have been off therapy for over six months. This could come in the form of dedicated studies for those who relapse on or soon after adjuvant systemic therapy or allowance for this cohort to be a capped proportion within proposed studies, which would be of vital importance for oncologists in selecting the most appropriate treatment options for their patients.

### Adjuvant chemotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised controlled trials [^111kpTin]. European Urology (2022). High credibility.

- **Characteristics of included trials**: Included trials were conducted between 1980 and 2014 and accrued between 49 and 284 participants (Table 1). The median follow-up across all trials was 6.0 years (range: 3.9–14.8 years), and all trials planned cystectomy as local treatment. Six trials (47% of participants) randomized participants to local treatment plus adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy versus local treatment alone. Four trials (53% of participants) randomized participants to local treatment plus adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy versus local treatment plus deferred adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy upon recurrence.

One of these trials had a second randomization concerning the timing of cisplatin administration (day 2 or day 15). One trial used single-agent cisplatin, and four trials used cisplatin in combination with methotrexate, vinblastine, and either doxorubicin or epirubicin. One trial used cisplatin in combination with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin, one trial used it with methotrexate, one trial combined it with methotrexate and vinblastine, and three trials used it with gemcitabine.

One trial planned two cycles of chemotherapy, four trials planned three cycles, and five trials planned four cycles; the planned cisplatin dose ranged from 70 to 100 mg/m², providing a total cisplatin dose of between 150 and 400 mg/m² (Table 1). Although data on subsequent therapies were requested, very little were received. Only two of the six trials, which did not specify treatment on recurrence in the protocol, provided these data. This amounted to 36 patients in total.

### Paediatric renal tumors: A state-of-the-art review [^1127RB2g]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Stage II**: Treatment of stage II WT involves several standardized options depending on the histology of the tumor. For patients with favourable histology, the standard treatment consists of a nephrectomy accompanied by lymph node sampling, followed by a chemotherapy regimen with vincristine and dactinomycin for 18 weeks after nephrectomy. In the case of patients with loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 1p and 16q, the chemotherapy regimen includes vincristine, dactinomycin, and doxorubicin for 24 weeks. For tumors with focal anaplastic histology, treatment involves nephrectomy and lymph node sampling, followed by abdominal radiotherapy and a chemotherapy regimen of vincristine, dactinomycin, and doxorubicin for 24 weeks. Patients with diffuse anaplastic histology receive nephrectomy and lymph node sampling, followed by abdominal radiotherapy and a chemotherapy regimen with vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, and etoposide for 30 weeks. This includes the addition of radiotherapy.

- **Stage III**: Treatment of stage III WT involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, with different options based on the histological type of the tumor and the presence or absence of particular genetic abnormalities, such as loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 1p or 16q. In all patients with favourable histology, the standard treatment involves nephrectomy with lymph node sampling, followed by abdominal radiotherapy and a chemotherapy regimen with vincristine, dactinomycin, and doxorubicin for 24 weeks.

### Omission of doxorubicin from the treatment of stage II-III, intermediate-risk Wilms' tumour (SIOP WT 2001): an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^116Ht8ZV]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

Before this study started, the standard postoperative chemotherapy regimen for stage II-III Wilms' tumour pretreated with chemotherapy was to include doxorubicin. However, avoidance of doxorubicin-related cardiotoxicity effects is important to improve long-term outcomes for childhood cancers that have an excellent prognosis. We aimed to assess whether doxorubicin can be omitted safely from chemotherapy for stage II-III, histological intermediate-risk Wilms' tumour when a newly defined high-risk blastemal subtype was excluded from randomisation.

- **Methods**: For this international, multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3, randomised SIOP WT 2001 trial, we recruited children aged 6 months to 18 years at the time of diagnosis of a primary renal tumour from 251 hospitals in 26 countries who had received 4 weeks of preoperative chemotherapy with vincristine and actinomycin D. Children with stage II-III intermediate-risk Wilms' tumours, assessed after delayed nephrectomy, were randomly assigned (1:1) by a minimisation technique to receive vincristine 1.5 mg/m² at weeks 1–8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, and 27, plus actinomycin D 45 μg/kg every 3 weeks from week 2, either with five doses of doxorubicin 50 mg/m² given every 6 weeks from week 2 (standard treatment) or without doxorubicin (experimental treatment). The primary endpoint was non-inferiority of event-free survival at 2 years, analysed by intention to treat and a margin of 10%. Assessment of safety and adverse events included systematic monitoring of hepatic toxicity and cardiotoxicity.

### Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for primary adenocarcinomas of the urinary bladder: a single-site experience [^116PFKrR]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Adenocarcinoma of the urinary bladder is a rare malignancy. Radical surgery is suggested as the best available treatment for early-stage disease, but there is currently no consensus on the standard chemotherapy regimen for advanced stages. We assessed the feasibility and effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) plus S-1 for patients with locally advanced primary adenocarcinomas of the urinary bladder.

- **Methods**: Six patients with locally advanced urachal or non-urachal (n = 3, each) primary adenocarcinoma of the bladder were treated from October 2010 to October 2013 at a single center. All the patients underwent 3 cycles (21 days each) of GC plus S-1 (gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m², days 1 and 8; cisplatin, 70 mg/m², day 2; and S-1, 50 mg bid, days 1–14). After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients with urachal cancer were treated with en bloc radical cystectomy and umbilectomy; the remaining 3 patients were treated with cystectomy.

- **Results**: All patients successfully completed the neoadjuvant chemotherapy without serious side effects. Two patients were assessed as complete response, 2 as partial response, 1 as stable disease, and 1 as progressive disease.

- **Conclusions**: Despite the limitations of a small study population, the GC plus S-1 regimen for locally advanced primary adenocarcinoma of the urinary bladder was effective and facilitated the success of surgery to a certain extent. Short follow-up time was also a limitation of our study. More studies are needed to evaluate the results.

### Adjuvant chemotherapy in upper tract urothelial carcinoma (the POUT trial): A phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^111YCZjP]. Lancet (2020). High credibility.

UTUC shares several clinicopathological features with muscle-invasive urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma of the bladder. Robust survival improvements are seen with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with urothelial bladder cancer, in both the neoadjuvant and metastatic settings. Similar benefits of platinum-based palliative chemotherapy have been seen for UTUC and urothelial bladder cancer at advanced stages. Thus, a clear rationale exists for investigating perioperative, platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with UTUC.

- **Research in context**: Evidence before this study

	- Before this study, findings of a literature review available online in 2010 (Audenet et al, 2013) showed that no level 1 randomised trial evidence was available assessing the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy for locally advanced upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). The paucity of research is partly because of the rarity of the disease. Undersized or retrospective studies had not shown a convincing survival benefit for chemotherapy. Guidelines from the European Association of Urology, therefore, recommended nephroureterectomy followed by surveillance as the standard of care. Most urothelial carcinomas (in both UTUC and bladder cancer) originate in the transitional epithelium (transitional cell carcinoma). It is logical, therefore, to consider data from trials of systemic bladder cancer treatment for signals to indicate whether chemotherapy could be efficacious in UTUC. Studies of perioperative chemotherapy for primary urothelial carcinoma of the bladder suggested localized urothelial carcinoma.

### Adjuvant chemotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised controlled trials [^115b3SQS]. European Urology (2022). High credibility.

We aimed to investigate the role of adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy in the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer, including whether any predefined participant subgroups benefit more or less from this treatment. Unless otherwise stated, all methods were prespecified in a protocol registered in PROSPERO in November 2017 (RecordID = 79637).

- **Trial eligibility**: Trials were eligible if they were randomized properly, initiated after January 1, 1965, and closed to accrual.

- **Treatment comparisons**: RCTs were eligible if they aimed to compare adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy plus local treatment versus (1) the same local treatment alone or (2) the same local treatment followed by adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy on recurrence. Local treatment could include radical cystectomy, preoperative radiotherapy plus cystectomy, or radical radiotherapy with or without post-radiotherapy salvage cystectomy for local failure, and must have been the same in both arms. Trials should be unconfounded by the use of additional treatments.

- **Participants**: Trials should have aimed to include participants with biopsy-proven transitional cell carcinoma with muscle-invasive bladder cancer who had not received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

- **Trial identification**: Published and unpublished trials were sought without language restrictions, using RCT search filters for Medline and Embase with additional MeSH and free-text terms for bladder cancer and chemotherapy. These were supplemented by searching trial registers.

### European guidelines on upper tract urothelial carcinomas: 2013 update [^113ULxaE]. European Urology (2013). Low credibility.

The European Association of Urology (EAU) guideline group for upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) has prepared updated guidelines to aid clinicians in assessing the evidence-based management of UTUC and to incorporate present recommendations into daily clinical practice.

- **Objective**: To provide a brief overview of the EAU guidelines on UTUC as an aid to clinicians in their daily clinical practice.

- **Evidence acquisition**: The recommendations provided in the guidelines are based on a thorough review of available UTUC guidelines and articles identified using a systematic search of Medline. Data on urothelial malignancies and UTUCs in the literature were searched using Medline with the following keywords: urinary tract cancer; urothelial carcinomas; upper urinary tract, carcinoma; renal pelvis; ureter; bladder cancer; chemotherapy; nephroureterectomy; adjuvant treatment; instillation; neoadjuvant treatment; recurrence; risk factors; nomogram; and survival. References were weighted by a panel of experts.

- **Evidence synthesis**: There is a lack of data in the literature to provide strong recommendations (i.e.g.rade A) due to the rarity of the disease. A number of recent multicentre studies are now available, and there is a growing interest in UTUC in the recent literature. Overall, 135 references have been included here, but most of these studies are still retrospective analyses. The TNM 2009 classification is recommended. Recommendations are given for diagnosis as well as radical and conservative treatment (i.e. imperative and elective cases).

### Segmental ureterectomy for high-risk ureteral carcinoma: a preliminary report [^117FiWB8]. BMC Urology (2023). Low credibility.

The treatment of UTUC was systematic. Surgery was only one important step in the overall treatment protocol, while adjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy were equally important for the patients. The POUT trial corroborated that adjuvant chemotherapy for the UTUC patients after receiving RNU significantly improved disease-free survival (hazard ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.30–0.68; P = 0.001) at a median follow-up of 30.3 months.

As for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, there was a study confirming that among all the people who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the patients who achieved pathologic complete and partial responses could get improved PFS and OS compared with non-responders (≥ ypT2N any; 2-year PFS 100% and 95% vs. 76%, P < 0.001; 2-year OS 100% and 100% vs. 80%, P < 0.001). Nevertheless, owing to the loss of the renal unit, some patients could not tolerate the chemotherapy after receiving the RNU.

Xylinas et al. found that the median eGFR decreased by 18% after RNU. The percentage of patients with preoperative eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² ranged from 37% to 16% after RNU (P < 0.001). Correspondingly, SU has less impact on kidney function. A meta-analysis showed that the risk of renal function impairment was significantly reduced after SU compared with RNU (mean eGFR difference = 9.32 ml/1.73 m², P = 0.007).

### Bladder cancer, version 5.2017, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112dNmWz]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2017). Low credibility.

This selection from the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for bladder cancer focuses on systemic therapy for muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer, as substantial revisions were made in the 2017 updates, such as new recommendations for nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab. The complete version of the NCCN Guidelines for bladder cancer addresses additional aspects of the management of bladder cancer, including non-muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer and nonurothelial histologies, as well as staging, evaluation, and follow-up.

### Application of genomic sequencing to refine patient stratification for adjuvant therapy in renal cell carcinoma [^114xwszF]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). High credibility.

Patients eligible for adjuvant therapy were stratified by the genomic classifier:

- **Disease-free survival (DFS) analysis**: Amongst patients considered eligible [pT2 grade 3–4; pT3 or pT4 (any grade); any pT, any grade, N+] versus ineligible [pT1 (any grade); pT2 grade 1–2] for adjuvant therapy.
- **VHL group analysis**: DFS by VHL +0, VHL +1, VHL +2, and VHL + ≥ 3 groups amongst patients considered eligible for adjuvant therapy.

Application of the genomic classifier to patients typically considered eligible for adjuvant therapy allows sub-stratification into groups with highly divergent risk of relapse. This information could usefully inform individual patient discussions around the benefit versus risks of adjuvant therapy.

Notably, the VHL +2 and VHL + ≥ 3 groups had significantly poorer survival compared with the VHL +0 group (P = 0.00055 and P < 0.0001, respectively). The potential clinical application of these findings, to inform individual patient counseling and decision making, can identify groups of patients who may be both spared (VHL +0) versus prioritized (VHL +2 and VHL + ≥ 3) for adjuvant treatment, based on risk of recurrence.

We also explored the added utility of our genomic classifier when first considering the Leibovich score, a validated prognostic nomogram that incorporates tumor stage, grade, size, necrosis, and lymph node status, available in 181/196 (92%) patients. As expected, patients with high-risk disease had significantly poorer DFS rates in comparison with those with intermediate-risk disease (P < 0.05).

### ICUD-EAU international consultation on bladder cancer 2012: Chemotherapy for urothelial carcinoma-neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings [^114wTedz]. European Urology (2013). Low credibility.

We present a summary of the Second International Consultation on Bladder Cancer recommendations on chemotherapy for the treatment of bladder cancer using an evidence-based strategy.

- **Objective**: To review the data regarding chemotherapy in patients with clinically localized and metastatic bladder cancer, focusing on its use for patients in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Medline databases were searched for original articles published prior to April 1, 2012, using the following search terms: bladder cancer, urothelial cancer, metastatic, advanced, neoadjuvant, and adjuvant therapy. Proceedings of major conferences from the last 5 years were also searched. Novel and promising drugs currently in clinical trials were included.

- **Evidence synthesis**: The major findings are addressed in an evidence-based manner. Prospective trials and important cohort data were analyzed.

- **Conclusions**: Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy for advanced and metastatic bladder cancer is an established standard, improving overall survival. In the advanced setting, cisplatin-ineligible patients may benefit from gemcitabine and carboplatin. Meta-analyses undertaken for neoadjuvant cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy show a 5% benefit in overall survival. Pathologic complete remission may be an intermediate surrogate for survival, but requires further validation. Use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is low, attributable to patient and physician choice because of limited benefit, advanced age, and comorbidities, including renal and/or cardiac dysfunction.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer: Summary of the 2020 guidelines [^113ERhVC]. European Urology (2021). High credibility.

This overview presents the updated European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer (MMIBC).

- **Objective**: To provide practical evidence-based recommendations and consensus statements on the clinical management of MMIBC with a focus on diagnosis and treatment.

- **Evidence acquisition**: A broad and comprehensive scoping exercise covering all areas of the MMIBC guideline has been performed annually since its 2017 publication (based on the 2016 guideline). Databases covered by the search included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries, resulting in yearly guideline updates. A level of evidence and a grade of recommendation were assigned. Additionally, the results of a collaborative multistakeholder consensus project on advanced bladder cancer (BC) have been incorporated in the 2020 guidelines, addressing those areas where it is unlikely that prospective comparative studies will be conducted.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Variant histologies are increasingly reported in invasive BC and are relevant for treatment and prognosis. Staging is preferably done with (enhanced) computerized tomography scanning. Treatment decisions are still largely based on clinical factors. Radical cystectomy (RC) with lymph node dissection remains the recommended treatment in highest-risk non-muscle-invasive and muscle-invasive nonmetastatic BC, preceded by cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for invasive tumors in "fit" patients. Selected men and women benefit from sexuality-sparing RC, although this is not recommended as standard therapy.

### Adjuvant chemotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised controlled trials [^112ZzrZy]. European Urology (2022). High credibility.

- **Analyses by trial characteristics**: To explore the potential impact of trial-level characteristics on the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy, analyses were prespecified by the planned chemotherapy regimen (single agent cisplatin or cisplatin combination) and planned (control arm) treatment on relapse (no further treatment or cisplatin chemotherapy). Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for each prespecified trial subgroup, with differences in treatment effect across trial subgroups assessed using chi-square tests.

- **Analyses by participant characteristics**: To explore any impact of participant characteristics on the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy, analyses were prespecified by age, sex, performance status, pT category, pN category, and grade. The relevant treatment-by-covariate interaction term was included in a Cox regression model for each trial. The resulting within-trial interactions (HRs) were then pooled across trials using the stratified-by-trial, fixed-effect model. These analyses were carried out for each covariate in turn and were focused on the primary outcome of overall survival. If insufficient data were available, categories were combined or analyses were not conducted. Absolute differences in outcome at 5 years were calculated from the relevant HR and the control group baseline event rate. All p-values are two-sided.

- **Exploratory analyses**: In addition to the planned analyses described, we conducted exploratory analyses to assess whether the modest imbalances in participant characteristics by treatment arm observed for some included trials might impact the result.

### Effect of subsequent bladder cancer on survival in upper tract urothelial carcinoma patients post-radical nephroureterectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113LGazw]. BMC Urology (2023). High credibility.

According to the European Association of Urology (EUA) guidelines, cystoscopy should be performed every 3 months for 1 year after surgery and then at increasingly extended intervals in patients with epithelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract. Hence, regular bladder examinations should be conducted during the treatment of patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). Although regular cystoscopic review plays a crucial role in the management of patients with UTUC, the associated bleeding, injury, and cost, being aspects of an invasive procedure, cannot be ignored.

To customize postoperative management for UTUC patients, one direction of focus is the stratification of patients' risk of intravesical recurrence. Numerous studies have been designed to identify potential subsequent bladder cancer (SBCa) predictors after radical nephroureterectomy (RNU). However, little is known about how SBCa affects prognosis, and the evidence is sparse and remains controversial.

For example:

- **Lee et al.'s study**: Suggested that SBCa is not correlated with long-term oncological outcomes.
- **Elalouf et al.'s findings**: Indicated that overall SBCa does not affect prognosis. However, muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), as opposed to superficial bladder cancer, was associated with worse cancer-specific survival.
- **Jiang et al.'s research**: Found that organ-confined UTUC patients who developed SBCa after RNU had significantly higher cancer-specific mortality rates.

We believe that while identifying which patients with UTUC are more likely to relapse, attention should also be paid to the specific impact of SBCa on survival. Identifying which patients with SBCa are more likely to affect survival is essential.

### Adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival of patients with high-risk upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma: A propensity score-matched analysis [^112oPSzh]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis was conducted using several methods. Clinical characteristics were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test. The association between adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) and patient cancer-specific survival (CSS) was tested by Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis and log-rank tests. Propensity score matching was employed to adjust for confounding factors in selecting patients for AC. A logistic regression model, which included age, sex, ECOG PS, and pathological findings such as pT stage, LVI status, and tumor grade, was used to estimate each patient's probability of receiving AC.

Patients with radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) only were matched on a one-to-one basis with patients receiving RNU plus AC using nearest-neighbor matching. To assess factors affecting CSS, a Cox proportional hazard model was utilized. Variables included age, pT category, LVI, tumor grade, ECOG PS, and low sodium or hemoglobin score, which we previously reported to be prognostic factors for upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). All statistical tests were performed using SPSS version 11.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Probability values (P) were two-sided, and statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.

### Is adrenalectomy necessary during unilateral nephrectomy for Wilms tumor? A report from the Children's Oncology Group [^115VfjUN]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTSG) conducted a series of multi-institutional clinical trials, beginning in 1969, which have identified prognostic factors and optimized treatment regimens for patients with Wilms tumor. Based on this experience, the standard of care for patients with localized Wilms tumor in North America is upfront unilateral nephrectomy with lymph node sampling. Histopathologic subtype and pathologic stage of the tumor determine the need for, and duration and intensity of, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

While it is generally accepted that the primary surgical objective in patients with localized Wilms tumor is complete resection of the neoplasm without spill, extensive resection of adjacent viscera to achieve a complete resection is discouraged because of the sensitivity of Wilms tumor to adjuvant therapy. However, although a classic radical nephrectomy includes resection of the ipsilateral adrenal gland, there are currently no specific recommendations regarding adrenalectomy in patients with clinically localized Wilms tumor; the management of the adrenal gland has typically been left to the discretion of the operating surgeon. There is also a dearth of literature on the incidence of adrenal involvement in patients with Wilms tumor; two published series report adrenal involvement in fewer than 2% of patients. In addition, no studies have specifically addressed differential spill and recurrence rates based on whether or not the adrenal gland was removed as part of a radical nephrectomy in patients with unilateral Wilms tumor.

The European Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines Panel on Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinoma (UTUC) has prepared updated guidelines to aid clinicians in the evidence-based management of UTUC and to incorporate recommendations into clinical practice.

- **Objective**: To provide an overview of the EAU guidelines on UTUC as an aid to clinicians.

- **Evidence acquisition**: The recommendations provided in the guidelines are based on a thorough review of available UTUC guidelines and articles identified following a systematic search of Medline. Data on urothelial malignancies and UTUC were searched using the following keywords: urinary tract cancer; urothelial carcinomas; upper urinary tract, carcinoma; renal pelvis; ureter; bladder cancer; chemotherapy; ureteroscopy; nephroureterectomy; adjuvant treatment; instillation; recurrence; risk factors; and survival. References were weighted by a panel of experts.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Owing to the rarity of UTUC, there are insufficient data to provide strong recommendations (i.e.g.rade A). However, the results of recent multicentre studies are now available, and there is a growing number of retrospective articles on UTUC. The 2017 tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) classification is recommended. Recommendations are given for diagnosis and risk stratification, as well as for radical and conservative treatment; prognostic factors are also discussed. A single postoperative dose of intravesical mitomycin after radical nephroureterectomy reduces the risk of bladder tumour recurrence. Kidney-sparing management should be considered where appropriate.

### EAU guidelines on upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma [^116pTxZ4]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma, and more specifically adjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend considering a discussion with patients about the option of adjuvant pembrolizumab. This is particularly relevant for those who are unfit for, or have declined, platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy, for cases of ≥ pT3 and/or pN+ and/or positive margin disease following a previous radical nephroureterectomy alone, or for ≥ ypT2 and/or ypN+ and/or positive margin disease after previous neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical nephroureterectomy.
