## Question

What is the optimal first-line daily medication for asthma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the optimal first-line daily medication for asthma is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational controller class recommended across high-credibility guidelines. Then, I should distinguish strategies by asthma severity, particularly mild versus moderate-to-severe disease. Next, I will stratify recommendations by age group because pediatric guidance differs from adult/adolescent guidance. After that, I should consider validated alternatives and add-ons when ICS alone is insufficient or not tolerated. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, guideline-aligned answer and outline practical implementation with monitoring and step-down principles.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle, because if I get this wrong everything downstream will be off. Across contemporary guidelines and reviews, inhaled corticosteroids remain the preferred first-line controller for persistent asthma, consistently outperforming other single long-term controllers when used correctly and consistently, so any "optimal" regimen should ensure adequate ICS exposure and adherence [^113azxef] [^111QJSJM].

> Now, for mild persistent asthma, I need to check the two evidence-based strategies. One is traditional daily low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA, and the other is as-needed low-dose ICS–formoterol as a single inhaler for both symptom relief and risk reduction in adolescents and adults; the latter has become a modern preferred approach in many guidelines because it couples anti-inflammatory therapy with each symptom-driven dose and reduces severe exacerbations, with ERS 2023 and AAFP 2024 endorsing this option for patients 12 years and older on Steps 1–2 tracks [^114GUSFD] [^113AGVuf]. Wait, let me verify the quantitative claim often cited here; a 33% reduction in exacerbations comes from trials of intermittent ICS taken with SABA compared to SABA alone, not directly from as-needed ICS–formoterol trials, so I should avoid over-precision and simply state that as-needed ICS–formoterol reduces exacerbation risk and medication burden while maintaining control in appropriate patients; also, I should note that although the question says "daily", this as-needed regimen is a controller strategy that may not be literally daily in mild disease but is still first-line in current stepwise care for ≥ 12 years [^111gzNiu] [^111RDuHV].

> For moderate-to-severe persistent asthma, I should confirm whether Single Maintenance and Reliever Therapy (SMART, also called MART) with ICS–formoterol is preferred over higher-dose ICS or fixed-dose ICS–LABA plus SABA; the NHLBI 2020 Expert Panel gives a strong recommendation for SMART in individuals aged ≥ 12 years with high certainty of evidence, and AAFP 2024 concurs, with the mechanism relying on formoterol's rapid onset allowing the same inhaler for maintenance and relief so each rescue use delivers ICS too, which reduces exacerbations compared with alternatives [^116BCAjj] [^116ULioj]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric data; certainty is lower in children 4–11 years, but SMART showed meaningful reductions in a composite exacerbation outcome and lower cumulative ICS exposure in post hoc analyses, supporting selective pediatric use with caution and attention to licensing status [^111nz5nf].

> Next, I will stratify by age because first-line nuances differ. In adults and adolescents ≥ 12 years, preferred options are as-needed low-dose ICS–formoterol for mild disease and SMART with ICS–formoterol for moderate-to-severe disease, keeping in mind that non-formoterol ICS–LABA combinations are not suitable as relievers and should not be substituted without consultation; I need to ensure I emphasize this to avoid unsafe switching [^111RDuHV] [^116BCAjj]. In children 5–11 years, I should confirm that guidelines still recommend initiating twice-daily pediatric low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA, with consideration of MART as an off-label alternative if not controlled and if the child can manage the regimen; the licensing caveat and device-specific evidence matter here, so I must state them explicitly [^116cTeuf]. For preschool children ≤ 4–5 years, low-dose ICS remains the usual first-line controller within age-appropriate step diagrams, recognizing limited evidence and the need for careful reassessment of diagnosis and control over time [^1143Ayc3].

> I need to evaluate alternatives and add-ons for scenarios where ICS alone is insufficient or not tolerated. If ICS cannot be used or adherence is problematic, leukotriene receptor antagonists are reasonable second-line options, particularly in children, but generally provide less benefit than ICS and should be framed as alternatives or adjuncts rather than equals to ICS in efficacy conversations [^111QJSJM] [^113azxef]. When asthma remains uncontrolled on ICS–LABA, adding a long-acting muscarinic antagonist in patients aged ≥ 12 years provides small improvements in control and quality of life, though benefits on exacerbations are limited; I should also screen for contraindications like glaucoma or urinary retention before adding LAMA and explain the need for an additional inhaler type [^116xQdZx]. But wait, I must reiterate that LABA monotherapy without ICS is contraindicated in asthma because it increases risk of severe events, especially in patients with overlapping COPD features, so ICS-containing therapy is non-negotiable in such phenotypes [^115fx3bF].

> Implementation details can make or break outcomes, so I will now examine the practical steps. Let me confirm that initial assessment should document diagnosis, symptom control, lung function when feasible, modifiable risk factors and comorbidities, inhaler technique, and adherence, followed by shared decision-making to select the regimen and a written action plan; reassessment should occur within 2–3 months to adjust therapy up or down based on control and risk [^112WXZFZ] [^113azxef]. I should double-check step-down guidance; after sustained good control for 2–3 months, reduce to the lowest effective step but do not withdraw ICS entirely except during diagnostic reevaluation, and consider structured step-down pathways such as lowering ICS dose or transitioning to lower-dose MART while monitoring closely for loss of control [^111RDuHV] [^116RJgLJ].

> Bringing this together, I should state the optimal first-line answer clearly while acknowledging real-world nuances. Inhaled corticosteroids are the indispensable foundation of first-line controller therapy for persistent asthma, with the optimal contemporary implementation in patients aged ≥ 12 years being low-dose ICS–formoterol used as-needed for mild disease and ICS–formoterol SMART for moderate-to-severe disease because these strategies reduce exacerbations, lower cumulative ICS exposure, and simplify treatment with a single inhaler, all in alignment with high-quality guideline recommendations; for children 5–11 years, start with twice-daily low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA, consider MART off-label if control is suboptimal and feasible, and apply careful monitoring and age-appropriate stepwise adjustments over time [^113azxef] [^114GUSFD] [^113AGVuf] [^116BCAjj] [^116cTeuf].

The best first daily asthma medication is a **low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)** [^113azxef] for most patients with persistent asthma, as it is the cornerstone of controller therapy and effectively reduces symptoms and exacerbations [^111QJSJM] [^113azxef]. For adults and adolescents with mild asthma, **as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol** [^114GUSFD] is an alternative that reduces severe exacerbations and SABA overuse [^113AGVuf]. In children aged 5–11 years, start with **daily low-dose ICS** plus as-needed SABA [^116cTeuf] [^1143Ayc3]. ICS-LABA combinations are reserved for patients not controlled on ICS alone, and leukotriene receptor antagonists are alternatives when ICS is not tolerated or adherence is a concern [^115K2F7R] [^111QJSJM] [^113azxef].

---

## Recommended first daily asthma medication

### Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)

- **First-line therapy**: ICS are the preferred initial controller medication [^1177LqWS] for persistent asthma in adults and children [^113azxef], providing superior control compared to other single long-term control medications [^111QJSJM].

- **Mechanism**: ICS reduce airway inflammation [^1177LqWS], improve lung function, and decrease exacerbations.

- **Dosing**: Start with low-dose ICS [^1143Ayc3] and titrate based on control and exacerbation risk.

---

### ICS-formoterol combination therapy

For adults and adolescents with mild asthma, **as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol** [^114GUSFD] is recommended because it reduces severe exacerbations and SABA overuse [^113AGVuf]. SMART (single maintenance and reliever therapy) with **ICS-formoterol** [^111NPNLz] is preferred for moderate-to-severe asthma, as it reduces exacerbations and simplifies regimens [^116BCAjj] [^113azxef].

---

### Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA)

LTRAs (e.g. montelukast) are **second-line options** [^111oebUu] for mild persistent asthma, particularly when ICS are not tolerated or adherence is an issue [^111QJSJM] [^113azxef].

---

## Age-specific recommendations

| **Age group** | **Recommended first daily medication** | **Alternative options** |
|-|-|-|
| Adults and adolescents (≥ 12 years) | - Low-dose ICS [^1177LqWS] <br/> - As-needed ICS-formoterol [^114GUSFD] | - LTRA [^111oebUu] <br/> - ICS-LABA (if uncontrolled on ICS alone) [^115K2F7R] |
| Children (5–11 years) | - Daily low-dose ICS [^116cTeuf] <br/> - As-needed SABA [^1143Ayc3] | - LTRA [^116cTeuf] <br/> - ICS-LABA (if uncontrolled on ICS alone) [^1143Ayc3] |
| Children (< 5 years) | - Daily low-dose ICS [^1143Ayc3] <br/> - As-needed SABA [^1162D93p] | - LTRA (if ICS not tolerated) [^111oebUu] |

---

## Factors influencing medication choice

- **Severity and control**: Tailor therapy to symptom frequency, exacerbation risk, and lung function [^112WXZFZ] [^114uR6NB].

- **Adherence**: Consider patient preferences, inhaler technique [^1177LqWS], and adherence barriers.

- **Comorbidities**: Account for allergic rhinitis, obesity, and other conditions affecting control [^114uR6NB] [^113U3MXE].

- **Patient preferences**: Engage in shared decision-making to improve adherence and outcomes [^1167KLGk].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

- **Regular follow-up**: Assess control, adherence, and inhaler technique at each visit [^111kNbTU].

- **Stepwise approach**: Adjust therapy up or down based on control and exacerbation risk [^1143Ayc3].

- **Action plan**: Provide a written asthma action plan for self-management [^111kNbTU].

---

## Conclusion

The preferred first-line daily controller is a **low-dose ICS**, with as-needed ICS-formoterol as an alternative for mild asthma [^1177LqWS]. Therapy should be individualized based on severity, adherence, comorbidities, and patient preferences, with regular monitoring and adjustment to maintain control and minimize exacerbations [^11416gE4].

### Medical therapy for asthma: Updates from the NAEPP guidelines [^111QJSJM]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Proper care of patients with asthma involves the triad of systematic chronic care plans, self-management support, and appropriate medical therapy. Controller medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonists, and leukotriene receptor antagonists, are the foundation of care for persistent asthma and should be taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred controller medication; studies have demonstrated that when used consistently, they improve asthma control more effectively than any other single long-term control medication.

Combining long-acting beta2 agonists and inhaled corticosteroids is effective and safe when inhaled corticosteroids alone are insufficient. Such combinations are an alternative to increasing the dosage of inhaled corticosteroids. For patients with mild persistent asthma, leukotriene receptor antagonists are an alternative, second-line treatment option. They are easy to use, have high rates of compliance, and can provide good symptom control in many patients. Leukotriene receptor antagonists can also be used as an adjunctive therapy with inhaled corticosteroids, but for persons 12 years and older, the addition of long-acting beta2 agonists is preferred.

Inhaled short-acting beta2 agonists are the most effective therapy for rapid reversal of airflow obstruction and prompt relief of asthmatic symptoms. Increasing the use of short-acting beta2 agonists or using them more than two days per week or more than two nights per month generally indicates a need to adjust the patient's asthma management plan.

- **Pharmacological management in children aged 5 to 11**: For guidance on doses of inhaled corticosteroids, see the full guideline. Initial management involves offering a twice-daily pediatric low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) as needed. This is recommended as initial treatment for children aged 5 to 11 years with newly diagnosed asthma. A brief explanation of the committee's rationale and impact on practice is available in the full documentation.

- **Medicine combination and sequencing in children aged 5 to 11**:
	- **MART pathway**: Consider a pediatric low-dose MART regimen for children whose asthma is not controlled on pediatric low-dose ICS plus SABA as needed, provided they can manage a MART regimen. In November 2024, asthma inhalers were not licensed for MART use in children under 12; thus, this would be an off-label use. Evidence supporting MART use in children aged 5 to 11 is derived from studies using a dry powder inhaler.
	- Consider increasing to a pediatric moderate-dose MART if asthma remains uncontrolled on a pediatric low-dose MART.

	- **Conventional pathway**: When a child is unable to manage a MART regimen, consider adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) to the twice-daily pediatric low-dose ICS plus SABA as needed. Administer LTRA for an 8 to 12-week trial period (unless side effects occur), then discontinue if ineffective.

### Chronic asthma treatment: Common questions and answers [^113azxef]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Asthma affects more than 25 million people in the United States, and 62% of adults with asthma do not have adequately controlled symptoms. Asthma severity and level of control should be assessed at diagnosis and evaluated at subsequent visits using validated tools such as the Asthma Control Test or the asthma APGAR (activities, persistent, triggers, asthma medications, response to therapy) tools. Short-acting beta2 agonists are preferred asthma reliever medications. Controller medications consist of inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonists, long-acting muscarinic antagonists, and leukotriene receptor antagonists.

Treatment typically begins with inhaled corticosteroids, and additional medications or dosage increases should be added in a stepwise fashion according to guideline-directed therapy recommendations from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program or the Global Initiative for Asthma when symptoms are inadequately controlled. Single maintenance and reliever therapy combines an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2 agonist for controller and reliever treatments. This therapy is preferred for adults and adolescents because of its effectiveness in reducing severe exacerbations.

Subcutaneous immunotherapy may be considered for those five years and older with mild to moderate allergic asthma; however, sublingual immunotherapy is not recommended. Patients with severe uncontrolled asthma despite appropriate treatment should be reassessed and considered for specialty referral. Biologic agents may be considered for patients with severe allergic and…

### Medication regimens for managing stable asthma [^116Q5po1]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Guideline-based management of asthma was developed as a means of standardizing asthma therapies and improving outcomes. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program and the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines provide recommendations to care providers about the routine management of asthma. There has been rapid development of new therapies for asthma, specifically with the advent of new drug delivery devices and biologic therapies for severe asthma.

We are increasingly recognizing that asthma is a heterogeneous disease with a diverse underlying pathophysiology. Therefore, it is imperative for care providers to begin to understand asthma phenotypes and endotypes, and the implications of these classifications on management, especially of severe refractory asthma. This article serves as a review of guideline-based therapy for asthma and includes updates on alternative therapies, new approaches using previously recognized therapies, and special populations with asthma.

### Post hoc analysis of initial treatments and control status in the INITIAL study: an observational study of newly diagnosed patients with asthma [^111oebUu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Two pivotal long-term goals of asthma management are symptom control and risk reduction. Evaluation of symptom control constitutes the basis of treatment decisions in a continuous asthma management cycle composed of assessment, treatment adjustment, and response review recommended by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). Criteria used to assess clinical control have evolved from a combination of symptoms and lung function (peak expiratory flow [PEF] or forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1]) endorsed by GINA 2012 to symptoms alone in GINA 2014 and subsequent GINA updates. The removal of lung function from assessment of asthma control is based on the rationale that although still important in predicting risk of exacerbations, lung function testing results, i.e. spirometry, sometimes provide equivocal or even little utility for determining the level of clinical control. Valid tools that can be used to assess symptom control include simple screening tools (e.g. the 4-item questionnaires endorsed by GINA), categorical symptom control tools (e.g. Royal College of Physicians Three Questions' Tool), and numerical tools (e.g. Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ]).

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with or without long-acting β2 agonist (LABA) have been recommended by GINA as the mainstay initial controller treatment, and leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) may be considered as an alternative option or add-on medication at step 2 to 4. LTRA belongs to anti-leukotrienes and renders anti-inflammatory as well as bronchodilating effects via inhibiting leukotriene.

Systematic reviews of the literature

The protocols that the EPCs used in their systematic reviews describe the prespecified key questions they addressed (listed in Table IA), the methods they used, and the overall analytic framework.

When conducting the systematic reviews, the EPCs sought studies that included the prespecified target populations and settings and that used the prespecified interventions, comparators, and outcomes. The EPCs excluded articles about studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria listed in the protocols for each systematic review. These inclusion criteria were summarized in the published systematic review reports. Appendices to the systematic review reports documented the rationales for excluding published articles identified by a broad search of the literature. The systematic review reports also included the EPCs' assessments of the risk of bias of each included article and of the strength of evidence for each key question using methods described in the protocols and systematic review reports. The EPCs were not required to use the GRADE methodology to conduct the systematic reviews but used a similar framework. After peer review and posting for public comment, the systematic review reports were finalized and published between late 2017 and early 2018.

Updated reviews of the literature

Westat (contract #HHSN268201700020B) conducted a literature search to identify any new articles published between the completion of the EPC's systematic review literature searches and October 2018, when the Expert Panel began its work.

### GINA guidelines on asthma and beyond [^117Kb3cg]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines are systematically developed statements designed to help practitioners and patients make decisions regarding appropriate health care for specific circumstances. Guidelines are based on scientific evidence regarding therapeutic interventions. The first asthma guidelines were published in the mid-1980s when asthma became a recognized public health problem in many countries. The Global Initiative on Asthma (GINA) was launched in 1995 as a collaborative effort between the NHLBI and the World Health Organization (WHO). The first edition was opinion-based, but subsequent updates have been evidence-based. A new update of the GINA guidelines has recently become available, focusing on the control of the disease. Asthma guidelines are designed to stimulate the implementation of practical measures to reduce the global burden of asthma. Although asthma guidelines may not be perfect, they represent the best available tool to assist primary care physicians and patients in achieving optimal asthma care.

Ultimately, broad change in clinical practice depends on the uptake, adoption, and implementation of clinical practice recommendations by primary care providers. This should be done with input from people who have asthma and their families, as well as support from health care systems. This update can serve as a basis to disseminate and facilitate the adoption of the asthma recommendations at all levels to ensure optimal care and equitable outcomes for all individuals with asthma. We ask for the assistance of every stakeholder in reaching our goal: improving asthma care and the quality of life of every person with asthma.

### Acute asthma exacerbations: Management strategies [^111fyQ1M]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of asthma, particularly in the context of managing exacerbations in a primary care setting, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend administering inhaled short-acting β-agonists (SABAs) at a dose of 4–10 puffs every 20 minutes for 1 hour in patients experiencing mild-to-moderate exacerbations.

### Asthma maintenance and reliever therapy: Should this be the standard of care [^111a3w1W]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

The goal of asthma management is to achieve optimal asthma control, defined by the absence of daytime symptoms, nighttime waking, reliever use, functional limitation, and lung function stability, and to also reduce the future risks of asthma exacerbations, deterioration in lung function, and the medication's adverse effects. The most widely used maintenance therapy is inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). This review considered the evidence in which the combination of the ICS budesonide and the rapid-onset long-acting β-agonist (LABA) formoterol can be used as a standard of care for maintenance and reliever therapy in moderate to severe asthma.

- **Data sources**: The archival literature of peer-reviewed studies on the efficacy and safety of budesonide-formoterol as maintenance and reliever therapy in moderate to severe asthma.

- **Results**: The ICS-LABA combination containing budesonide-formoterol reduces future risk of severe asthma exacerbations and provides similar levels of day-to-day asthma control when compared with using high-dose ICS alone or combination ICS-LABA therapy and short-acting β2-agonist as a reliever.

- **Conclusion**: Budesonide-formoterol as a single combination maintenance and reliever inhaler is effective in reducing asthma exacerbation risk, requires a lower maintenance dose of ICS, and results in a simplified approach to asthma management.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^111gzNiu]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

The Expert Panel specified three critical outcomes: exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life, along with one important outcome: rescue medication use. These were explored in detail for Recommendation 9, with evidence summarized in EtD Table XIII in Appendix B.

Three RCTs with high certainty of evidence compared SABA alone to intermittent ICS with SABA for quick relief. This treatment resulted in a 33% relative risk reduction in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. Two of these three trials assessed growth but found different effects. Ducharme et al. found a 5% lower gain in height and weight in participants receiving intermittent fluticasone (750 μg twice daily at onset of a respiratory tract infection for up to 10 days) compared to those receiving a placebo. There was a significant correlation between the cumulative dose of fluticasone and changes in height. In contrast, Bacharier et al. did not find an effect on the linear growth of children using budesonide inhalation suspension (1 mg twice daily for 7 days) compared to a placebo for an "identified respiratory tract illness". The reasons for differences in growth effects remain unclear, whether due to variations in drugs, doses, treatment duration, or other factors.

- **Rationale and discussion**: The main comparator with available data is SABA-only therapy. The demonstrated efficacy but conflicting data regarding the effect of a short course of a daily ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy on growth led the Expert Panel to develop a conditional recommendation.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113TEkak]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, particularly in managing exacerbations in a primary care setting, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend administering inhaled short-acting β-agonists (SABAs) up to 4–10 puffs every 20 minutes, for a total of 3 doses. This approach is suggested for achieving rapid reversal of airflow limitation in patients with mild-to-moderate exacerbations.

It is advised not to administer additional short-acting β-agonists if there is a good response to the initial treatment, such as a peak expiratory flow greater than 60–80% of the predicted or personal best for 3–4 hours.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for asthma, particularly in clinical follow-up, the BTS/SIGN 2019 guidelines recommend asking specific questions about medication use. It is important to assess prescribing and any other data available to determine adherence. Additionally, exploring attitudes toward medication, as well as practical barriers to adherence, should be conducted in a nonjudgmental manner.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee expert panel working group [^1143Ayc3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Stepwise approach for managing asthma: In preparing the step diagrams (Figs 2–4), the expert panel used some of the definitions and assumptions from EPR-3. The step diagrams that follow this section retain the EPR-3 recommendations that the expert panel did not address in the report. The expert panel encourages readers to review the footnotes in the step diagrams because they offer important information about the use of these diagrams.

- **Application of figures**: The following conventions apply to Figs 2 to 4: Each figure applies to the care of individuals with asthma in one age group. Fig 2 applies only to ages 0 to 4 years. Fig 3 applies only to ages 5 to 11 years. Fig 4 applies only to ages 12 years and older.

- **Clinical decision-making**: Clinicians decide which step of care is appropriate depending on whether the individual is newly diagnosed (i.e. is treatment naive) or whether the clinician is adjusting the individual's therapy to achieve asthma control. For newly diagnosed or treatment-naive individuals, clinicians should first choose the appropriate step diagram for the person's age and then consider both the individual's level of asthma impairment and risk when selecting the initial step and treatment. Within a given step, the preferred options are the best management choices supported by the evidence that the expert panel reviewed. When the available evidence is insufficient or does not change a previous recommendation, the step diagrams list preferred options from the EPR-3 step diagrams.

- **Management strategies**: Within a given step, alternative options are management strategies that are less effective or have more limited evidence.

### Balancing the needs of the many and the few: Where next for adult asthma guidelines [^114uR6NB]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Asthma differs from many other chronic conditions in that most key management decisions are made in non-specialist settings, such as general practitioner surgeries and accident and emergency departments. Diagnosis in primary care relies on recognition of a characteristic pattern of symptoms and the occurrence of asthma attacks, sometimes supplemented by basic lung function tests. Ongoing management is guided by the assessment of symptoms and simple lung function measures of airflow obstruction, with little attempt made to personalize management.

This approach is flawed because the inadequate specificity of symptoms, as well as the low sensitivity of variable airflow obstruction, means that a diagnosis of asthma is often difficult to exclude with confidence. Moreover, even if diagnosed correctly, dissociation between inflammation, airflow obstruction, and symptoms means that a generalized stepwise approach to managing asthma on the basis of symptoms is unlikely to be successful in a substantial proportion of patients. As a result, effective treatments are used inefficiently, and outcomes are often worse than they could be.

Rather than use either a population-based or personalized approach for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we recommend a new combined approach, in which treatment decisions are driven by objective assessment of key treatable mechanistic traits.

### Identification and management of adults with asthma prone to exacerbations: Can we do better [^113kycV4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

A major goal of international guidelines on the management of asthma is to achieve control of symptoms, lung function, and reliever inhaler use, and to prevent future risks of exacerbations and decline in lung function. Despite the widespread dissemination of asthma guidelines, many patients experience inadequately controlled disease and frequent exacerbations of asthma. Exacerbations are associated with an accelerated decline in lung function, generate high health costs, and are the main cause of mortality in asthma. The identification and appropriate management of adults with asthma who are prone to exacerbations is of considerable importance, as by this means it should be possible to reduce the large number of patients who currently experience uncontrolled disease.

### Acute asthma exacerbations: Management strategies [^111pT1nV]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, specifically with respect to treatment adjustment, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend considering the addition of a LAMA to ICS/LABA therapy for moderate-to-severe asthma that is not well-controlled with dual therapy. This adjustment aims to reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations in patients aged 6 years and older. It is important to recognize that triple therapy is more effective than dual therapy.

### Post hoc analysis of initial treatments and control status in the INITIAL study: An observational study of newly diagnosed patients with asthma [^1129xzoe]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

This was a post hoc analysis of a 12-week, multicentre, prospective, observational study performed in patients with asthma from 45 centres across Northern and Southern China between June 2014 and September 2016 (INITIAL, NCT02143739). The protocol, full details of the study population, and overall results have previously been reported. Methods specific to this post hoc analysis are briefly described below.

Eligible patients were aged ≥ 18 years, had newly diagnosed asthma without exacerbations within 2 weeks, and had not used inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in the 3 months prior to enrolment. Diagnosis of asthma was made based on lung function tests — performed for all patients, airflow limitation, reversibility, and variability based on FEV1 or PEF help confirm the diagnosis — considered the gold standard for asthma diagnosis, and based on symptoms typical of asthma (i.e. breathlessness, wheezing, cough, and chest tightness, often triggered by allergens, cold, physical or chemical irritations, viral infection, or exercise; wheezing sound and prolonged respiratory phases during flare-ups; alleviation of symptoms spontaneously or upon treatment; exclusion of other possible diseases with similar symptoms), in accord with criteria recommended by Chinese guidelines for the prevention and management of bronchial asthma (2008). Key exclusion criteria were being diagnosed with COPD and having asthma exacerbations within 2 weeks of study inclusion.

Any medications were prescribed as per routine clinical practice at baseline, Week 4, and Week 8.

### Global initiative for asthma strategy 2021: Executive summary and rationale for key changes [^111RDuHV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

When choosing the track and starting step for initial asthma treatment, consider not only the patient's symptoms and risk of exacerbations but also practical issues, including medication access (availability and cost), inhaler technique, likely adherence, and patient preferences. Before starting, record evidence for the diagnosis of asthma, the patient's symptom control and risk factors, including lung function, and check that they can use the inhaler correctly. Provide education and skills training, and schedule a follow-up visit to assess the response.

During ongoing treatment, medication may be adjusted up or down within the same track (i.e. with the same reliever) or may be switched between tracks, depending on patient needs. However, for patients prescribed as-needed-only ICS–formoterol (Steps 1–2) or MART (Steps 3–5), beware of risks to the patient if their ICS–formoterol is switched without consultation (e.g. in health systems where medication substitution by pharmacists or nurses is permitted) to a combination nonformoterol ICS–LABA, as these are not suitable for as-needed use.

When good asthma control has been achieved and maintained for 2–3 months, consider stepping down to find the lowest effective step. Do not completely withdraw ICS, except if needed temporarily while confirming the diagnosis of asthma. Adults and adolescents with well-controlled asthma while on daily low-dose controller therapy can step down to either as-needed ICS–.

### Generating evidence to inform an update of asthma clinical practice guidelines: Perspectives from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [^111yCWSZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). High credibility.

Asthma is the most prevalent chronic respiratory disease worldwide. Its increasing prevalence and evidence of suboptimal control require renewed efforts in the development and widespread implementation of clinical practice guidelines for prevention, treatment, and control. Given the rapidly changing landscape and evolving best practices for guideline development, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute made a commitment to support rigorous systematic evidence reviews that frontline health care providers and stakeholders could use to create new or update existing guidelines.

This article describes the protocols, key questions, methodology, and analytic framework to support the update of the 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR-3) on the diagnosis and management of asthma in adults and children. It also describes the expert panel's practical experience in managing asthmatic patients across the age and severity spectrum. The article explains the process for ensuring that the expert panel's deliberations are conducted in accordance with the Institute of Medicine's standards and recommendations for guideline development.

The outcome of this ambitious effort will be an update of the EPR-3 asthma guidelines and publication of the key recommendations in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Importantly, several novel approaches will be explored and incorporated as appropriate to accelerate adoption and sustained implementation of the guidelines.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^115mUwa7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

People with asthma may experience exacerbations, or "attacks", during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans sometimes advocate a short-term increase in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at the first sign of an exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

- **Objectives**: To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of ICS as part of a patient-initiated action plan for the home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and hand-searched abstracts up to 20 December 2021. We also searched major trial registries for ongoing trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included parallel and cross-over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that allocated people with persistent asthma to take a blinded inhaler in the event of an exacerbation, which either increased their daily dose of ICS or kept it stable (placebo).

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. We reassessed the risk of bias for all studies at the result level using the revised risk of bias tool for RCTs (Risk of Bias 2), and employed the GRADE approach to assess our confidence in the synthesised effect estimates.

### Patterns of inhaled corticosteroid use and asthma control in the Childhood Asthma Management Program Continuation Study [^114gXbTT]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Daily controller medication use is recommended for children with persistent asthma to achieve asthma control.

- **Objective**: To examine patterns of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use and asthma control in an observational study of children and adolescents with mild-to-moderate asthma (the Childhood Asthma Management Program Continuation Study).

- **Methods**: We assessed patterns of ICS use during a 12-month period (consistent, intermittent, and none) and asthma control (well-controlled vs. poorly controlled). Multivariate logistic regression examined the association between the pattern of ICS use and asthma control.

- **Results**: Of 914 patients enrolled, 425 were recommended to continue receiving ICS therapy in the Childhood Asthma Management Program Continuation Study. Of these patients, 46% reported consistent ICS use, and 20% reported no ICS use during year 1. By year 4, consistent ICS use decreased to 20%, whereas no ICS use increased to 57%; poorly controlled asthma was reported in 18% of encounters. In multivariate models controlling for age, sex, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and asthma severity assessment, patients reporting consistent ICS use during a 12-month period were more likely to report poor asthma control (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–2.1) compared with those reporting no ICS use.

- **Conclusions**: In this observational study of children and adolescents with mild-to-moderate asthma, most did not report continued use of ICS. Patients recommended to continue receiving ICS therapy and reporting consistent ICS use were less likely to report well-controlled asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111vyWEz]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, specifically in the context of managing exacerbations, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend considering a short course of oral corticosteroids. Adults and adolescents should take 40–50 mg/day for 5–7 days, while children should take 0.5 mg/kg/day with a maximum of 40 mg/day for 3–5 days. This is advised for severe exacerbations, such as when peak expiratory flow or FEV1 is less than 60% of personal best or predicted, or if the patient is not responding to the above treatment within 2–3 days. It is preferable to administer the medication in the morning after the first dose to minimize insomnia. Patients should be advised about potential adverse effects. Do not offer tapering if oral corticosteroids are taken for less than 2 weeks.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^1176KhHc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

The outcomes did not differ in the groups treated with the two alternate regimens in the three studies, in individuals aged 12 years and older. However, because none of these studies was powered as an equivalence study, the Expert Panel made a conditional recommendation. Although the studies had high certainty of evidence for asthma control and quality of life, they had low certainty of evidence for exacerbations, and taken together, resulted in overall low certainty for the recommendation statement. The Expert Panel made no recommendation based on this comparison for children aged 4 to 11 years because the only small included study in this population had low certainty of evidence and one additional study had a study design that precluded evaluation for this key question.

- **Recommendation 11**: In individuals aged 4 years and older with mild to moderate persistent asthma who are likely to be adherent to daily ICS treatment, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends against a short-term increase in the ICS dose for increased symptoms or decreased peak flow.

- **Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence**

- **Implementation guidance**:

	- **Clinician's summary**: This recommendation addresses temporary increases in the dose of an ICS that is otherwise taken as controller therapy in response to worsening asthma. For this recommendation, a short-term increase in ICS dose refers to a doubling, quadrupling, or quintupling of the regular daily dose for individuals aged 4 years and older with mild to moderate persistent asthma who are likely to adhere to their daily treatment.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^114N84ew]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

The methodology framework used for this update, GRADE, is the internationally recommended approach for developing recommendations that clinicians can trust. This framework endorses a systematic and transparent approach to decision-making, uses established criteria to rate the certainty of evidence, and determines the strength of the recommendations. Recommendations developed using GRADE combine the certainty of evidence with patient values and preferences and weigh the benefits and harms of making treatment recommendations. Importantly, the recommendations are based on the key questions that clinicians, both generalists and specialists, wanted to be answered.

Users of these recommendations may be disappointed by the absence of many strong recommendations — that is, recommendations that clinicians should adhere to for almost all individuals with asthma as the standard of care. This is not, however, surprising given the variations in asthma phenotypes and endotypes and in the outcomes used in the studies reviewed to develop the recommendations. When the GRADE framework is used, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are initially rated as offering a high certainty of evidence, but issues with study designs (e.g. lack of blinding or a placebo control), heterogeneity of study results, or small numbers of events may result in downgrading the certainty of evidence. For most of the asthma recommendations, the overall certainty of the evidence was downgraded because of inconsistencies in study results, risk of bias, or absence of critical standardized outcome measures.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^114t8MyU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

The Expert Panel specified three critical outcomes: exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life. Additionally, three important outcomes were identified: quick-relief medication, adverse events (harms), and long-term medication use. The summary of evidence for Recommendation 18 can be found in EtD Table XXVII in Appendix B.

The evidence indicates that SLIT provides only a trivial benefit for the critical outcomes of exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life (moderate certainty of evidence). No studies assessed the impact of SLIT on emergency department visits, clinic visits, or hospitalizations. Three studies evaluated exacerbations using different endpoints. One study did not report the number of exacerbations but did report on the time to first exacerbation. Although SLIT decreased the severity of the first moderate exacerbation, it did not increase the time to first severe exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids. Another study did not provide any raw data or rates of the critical outcomes, noting only that the results showed no statistically significant improvement in asthma exacerbations. The third study, which enrolled only 60 participants, found a significantly lower number of exacerbations in the treatment group. Four studies (N = 1193) evaluated asthma control using validated outcome tools (three used the ACQ, and one used the ACT) and found no consistent improvement after treatment. Finally, multiple studies showed no difference in the quality of life between those treated with SLIT and those receiving placebo (high certainty of evidence).

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^111zDWFP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

In the reviewed studies, the indication for increasing the ICS dose was decreased peak flow and/or increased symptoms. When increased, the ICS dose was doubled, quadrupled, or quintupled.

- **Rationale and discussion**: In children aged 4 to 11 years, the intervention did not significantly reduce exacerbations or improve asthma quality of life in one study in the systematic review report. The intervention's potential to suppress growth in a more recent study and the lack of demonstrated efficacy of the intervention in either of the reviewed articles led to the Expert Panel's recommendation against this intervention in this age group.

In individuals aged 12 years and older, the intervention as implemented also did not significantly reduce exacerbations in three studies in the evidence summary, but the certainty of evidence is low. The more recent study by McKeever et al. showed modest but significant reductions in time to severe exacerbation and rate of ICS use in individuals whose action plan included a quadrupling of the ICS dose. However, unlike the studies in the AHRQ systematic review report, this study did not include a placebo group or use blinding, and the baseline adherence rate was low (42%−50%). The adherence rate in the McKeever et al study might be more similar to the adherence rates in routine clinical practice, whereas adherence rates in the RCTs were probably higher than in most real-world settings.

Thus, the Expert Panel believes that this recommendation applies most specifically to individuals who are likely to adhere to their daily ICS regimen.

### Guidelines for asthma management: A review and comparison of 5 current guidelines [^115vixQ2]. Respiratory Care (2008). Low credibility.

The first clinical practice guidelines for the assessment and management of asthma were published over 20 years ago in New Zealand and Australia. During the same period, British and Scottish groups collaborated on a United Kingdom version of asthma guidelines. Shortly after the introduction of the New Zealand and Canadian guidelines, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the United States National Institutes of Health participated in two additional asthma guideline endeavors, which were published in the early 1990s.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute formed the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program to develop asthma guidelines for the United States and participated with an international task force to develop guidelines for the treatment of asthma in all countries. This effort resulted in the formation of the Global Initiative for Asthma in the mid-1990s. The asthma guidelines issued by professional societies and other groups prior to the late 1990s were primarily based on consensus or expert opinion in each guideline committee, though those opinions were grounded in the available studies.

The early guidelines played a vital role in bridging the gap between various treatment options and recent discoveries in basic science, serving as the vehicle for implementation into daily clinical practice. Asthma guidelines have been published and revised in dozens of countries around the world and have become reputable directives or "road maps" in asthma diagnosis, treatment, and management for patients of all ages. The guidelines have similar formats.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111ocp5s]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for asthma, specifically in relation to the avoidance of exacerbating medications, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend that the decision to prescribe oral or ophthalmic β-blockers be made on a case-by-case basis. Treatment should be initiated under the close supervision of a specialist.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^116xQdZx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

What is the comparative effectiveness of LAMA as add-on therapy to ICS plus LABA compared with ICS plus LABA as controller therapy in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma?

- **Recommendation 16**: In individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends adding LAMA to ICS-LABA compared to continuing the same dose of ICS-LABA. This is a conditional recommendation with moderate certainty of evidence.

- **Implementation guidance**:

	- **Clinician's summary**: For individuals whose asthma is not controlled with ICS-LABA, the Expert Panel recommends the addition of a LAMA for many individuals. Based on the available studies, the addition of a LAMA to ICS-LABA in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma offers a small benefit. This therapy is recommended for individuals aged 12 years and older whose asthma is uncontrolled even though they are using ICS-LABA therapy.

	- **Important considerations**: LAMA therapy should not be used in individuals with glaucoma or urinary retention. Adding a LAMA to ICS-LABA for individuals with uncontrolled asthma who are already taking ICS-LABA improves asthma control and quality of life but has no effect on asthma exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroids or rescue medication.

	- **Patient discussions**: Clinicians should discuss with their patients that adding LAMA therapy to ICS-LABA requires the use of an additional and different type of inhaler. The addition of a LAMA may improve asthma control and quality of life but may not decrease the frequency of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112WXZFZ]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for asthma, particularly in the context of initial assessment, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend assessing symptom control, future risks of adverse outcomes, and treatment issues in adult, adolescent, and pediatric (aged 6–11 years) patients presenting with asthma:

- **Assess symptom control**: Over the last 4 weeks or longer.

- **Identify risk factors**: Examine any other risk factors for exacerbations, persistent airflow limitation, or side effects.

- **Measure lung function**: At diagnosis/initial treatment, 3–6 months after starting ICS-containing treatment, then periodically (at least once every 1–2 years), but more frequently in at-risk patients and those with severe asthma.

- **Document treatment step**: Record the patient's treatment step.

- **Monitor inhaler technique**: Assess adherence and side effects.

- **Check asthma action plan**: Ensure the patient has a written asthma action plan.

- **Discuss attitudes and goals**: Engage with the patient about their attitudes and goals regarding asthma and medications.

- **Assess multimorbidity**: Identify comorbidities that contribute to symptoms and poor quality of life, and sometimes to poor asthma control, such as rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, GERD, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, and anxiety.

### Why and how to step down chronic asthma drugs [^11416gE4]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic airways disease. The goal of asthma management is to control symptoms while minimizing the side effects of treatment. Following a period of stable asthma, clinicians should consider stepping down treatment as recommended by guidelines.

Step-down has been studied for several types of asthma drug regimens, and certain approaches may have a lower risk than others. Systematic reviews of multiple trials support the following specific step-down approaches: optimizing inhaled corticosteroid dosing when stepping down oral corticosteroid; reducing inhaled corticosteroid from a higher dose; lowering inhaled corticosteroid-long acting bronchodilator (ICS-LABA) dose while adding ICS-LABA on-demand; adding leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) while lowering inhaled corticosteroid dose; and using allergen immunotherapy when reducing inhaled corticosteroid from a higher dose.

Systematic reviews of multiple trials also support an increased risk of asthma exacerbation for patients who completely stop taking inhaled corticosteroid or long acting bronchodilator. Strategies to implement step-down in practice include the use of risk prediction, as well as tools to support shared decision making and communication about risk between clinicians and patients.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^112YJn8f]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

The Expert Panel offers the following suggestions for future research:

- **Comparative effectiveness studies**: The efficacy of LAMA therapy for asthma has been studied extensively, but the clinical impact of LAMA treatment in real-world settings remains unclear.
- **Comparative effectiveness and safety**: Studies comparing ICS plus LAMA versus ICS-LABA in ethnically diverse populations should be adequately powered to examine the harms and benefits of these two treatment options.
- **Systematic reviews in children**: Focus on children with asthma aged 6 to 11 years to inform future guidelines.
- **Comparisons of add-on therapies**: Examine the effectiveness of a LAMA versus a leukotriene inhibitor as an add-on to ICS-LABA in individuals with uncontrolled persistent asthma.
- **Role of LAMAs other than tiotropium**: Explore their use as add-on therapy to ICS in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma.

### Global initiative for asthma strategy 2021: Executive summary and rationale for key changes [^115fx3bF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Diagnosis and initial treatment of patients with features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are umbrella labels for overlapping heterogeneous conditions. Symptoms may be similar, and the diagnostic criteria overlap. Some patients have features of both asthma and COPD (asthma + COPD), particularly smokers and older adults. This is not a single disease entity; it includes several clinical phenotypes likely caused by a range of underlying mechanisms.

There are important differences in evidence-based treatment recommendations for asthma versus COPD, with treatment using long-acting bronchodilators alone (i.e. without ICS) recommended as initial treatment in COPD, but contraindicated in asthma due to the risk of severe exacerbations and death. Until more discriminatory risk factors are identified, patients with diagnoses of both asthma and COPD should receive ICS. COPD should be managed according to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease recommendations. For all patients, provide education on inhaler technique and adherence, as well as advice about smoking cessation, immunizations, physical activity, and management of comorbidities. Refer for specialist investigations and multidisciplinary care, where possible.

- **Rationale**: The descriptive term "asthma + COPD" is preferred because "asthma–COPD overlap" was often assumed to represent a single disease. Patients with asthma + COPD have a greater burden of symptoms and exacerbations, more impaired quality of life, and a more rapid decline in health status.

### Global initiative for asthma strategy 2021: Executive summary and rationale for key changes [^111kNbTU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Arrange early follow-up after any exacerbation, regardless of where it was managed:

- **Review the patient's symptom control and risk factors for further exacerbations**: Prescribe or continue ICS-containing controller therapy (preferably MART with ICS–formoterol) to reduce the risk of further exacerbations. If already taking controller therapy, continue increased doses for 2–4 weeks. Provide a written asthma action plan and, where relevant, advice about avoiding exacerbation triggers. Check inhaler technique and adherence.

Asthma outcomes after an ED presentation for acute asthma are significantly improved by comprehensive intervention programs that include optimal controller management, inhaler technique, and elements of self-management education (self-monitoring, written action plan, and regular review).

Referral for expert advice should be considered for patients who have been hospitalized for asthma or who have repeat presentations to acute care settings. Follow-up by a specialist is associated with fewer subsequent ED visits or hospitalizations and better asthma control.

### The risks, benefits, and uncertainties of stepping down asthma medications [^11381pRD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Stepwise adjustments have been suggested as a framework to manage chronic asthma over time. In this framework, individuals with good asthma control and a low risk for future asthma exacerbations may be considered for a reduction or "step down" of their chronic asthma medications. In this article, we discuss how patients may benefit or be harmed by stepping down asthma medications. Based on the literature presented in this article, we recommend that clinicians discuss the option of stepping down with patients when symptoms are stable, lung function is near normal, and biomarkers (if measured) are near normal. Other factors that should be considered in the decision to step down include the length of asthma stability, age of the patient, time of year, and patient preferences. Reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid by 25% to 50% appears to be the safest method of stepping down. A clear plan of care and follow-up is needed when stepping down asthma medications because many patients are likely to have re-exacerbations.

### Expert panel report 3 (EPR-3): Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma-summary report 2007 [^1162D93p]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Highlights of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program's Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR-3): Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma-Full Report 2007 are presented in this EPR-3 summary report. The updated guidelines emphasize the importance of asthma control. Asthma control is the degree to which the manifestations of asthma are minimized by therapeutic intervention and the goals of therapy are met. Because asthma is highly variable, the level of control must be monitored on a periodic basis to determine whether therapy should be maintained or adjusted (stepped up if necessary, stepped down if possible).

Asthma severity is the intrinsic intensity of the disease process, most easily and directly measured in a patient not receiving long-term control therapy. For managing asthma, the recommendation is to assess severity to initiate therapy and assess control to adjust therapy. Recommendations for managing asthma include:

- **Childhood asthma**: Expanded section with addition of an age group 5 to 11 years old (earlier guidelines combined this group with adults).

- **Patient education and environmental factors**: New recommendations on patient education in settings beyond the physician's office and new advice for controlling environmental factors that can cause asthma symptoms.

The concepts of impairment (frequency and intensity of symptoms, low lung function, and limitations of daily activities) and future risk (likelihood of exacerbations, progressive loss of lung function, or adverse side effects from medications) support a new approach to assessing and managing asthma.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^114zPPhe]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for severe asthma phenotypes, specifically with respect to long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), the NHLBI 2020 guidelines recommend considering the addition of a LAMA to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) rather than continuing the same dose of ICS alone in patients aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma if a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) is not being used.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^115z1egX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

People with asthma may experience exacerbations or "attacks", during which their symptoms worsen, and additional treatment is required. Written action plans may advocate doubling the dose of inhaled steroids in the early stages of an asthma exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

- **Objectives**: To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as part of a patient-initiated action plan for home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) up to March 2016. We hand-searched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared increased versus stable doses of ICS for home management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies of children or adults with persistent asthma who were receiving daily maintenance ICS.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. We contacted authors of RCTs for additional information.

- **Main results**: This review update added three new studies, including 419 participants, to the review. In total, we identified eight RCTs, most of which were at low risk of bias, involving 1669 participants.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112UTXGN]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, particularly the management of exacerbations in the emergency department setting, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend continuing systemic (oral) corticosteroids. For adult patients, the recommendation is 40–50 mg/day of prednisolone or an equivalent for 5–7 days. For pediatric patients, a dosage of 1–2 mg/kg/day is advised, up to a maximum of 40 mg/day, for 3–5 days. This regimen aims to reduce the risk of relapse.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^116BCAjj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

What is the comparative effectiveness of ICS with LABA used as both controller and quick-relief therapy compared to ICS with or without LABA used as controller therapy in individuals aged 5 years and older with persistent asthma?

- **Recommendation 12**: In individuals aged 4 years and older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, the Expert Panel recommends ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler used as both daily controller and reliever therapy compared to either a higher-dose ICS as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy or the same-dose ICS-LABA as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy.

This is a strong recommendation, with high certainty of evidence for ages 12 years and above, and moderate certainty of evidence for ages 4 to 11 years.

- **Implementation guidance**:

	- **Clinician's summary**: In individuals aged 4 years and older, the preferred Step 3 (low-dose ICS) and Step 4 (medium-dose ICS) therapy is single-inhaler ICS-formoterol both daily and as needed. In the literature, inhaled ICS-formoterol is referred to as "single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART)". This form of therapy has only been used with formoterol as the LABA. Formoterol has a rapid onset and a maximum total daily dose that allows it to be used more than twice daily. The maximum total daily dose of formoterol should not exceed 8 puffs (36 μg) for ages 4 to 11 years and 12 puffs (54 μg) for ages 12 years and above. SMART is administered with a single inhaler containing both formoterol and an ICS (primarily budesonide in the reviewed studies, but one study used beclomethasone).

### The asthma control questionnaire as a clinical trial endpoint: past experience and recommendations for future use [^1167T7ed]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

The goal of asthma treatment is to control the disease according to guidelines issued by bodies such as the Global Initiative for Asthma. Effective control is dependent upon evaluation of symptoms, initiation of appropriate treatment, and minimization of the progressive adverse effects of the disease and its therapies. Although individual outcome measures have been shown to correlate with asthma control, composite endpoints are preferred to enable more accurate and robust monitoring of the health of the individual patient.

A number of validated instruments are utilized to capture these component endpoints; however, there is no consensus on the optimal instrument for use in clinical trials. The Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) has been shown to be a valid, reliable instrument that allows accurate and reproducible assessment of asthma control, comparing favorably with other commonly used instruments. This analysis provides a summary of the use of ACQ in phase II, III, and IV asthma trials. Comparisons between the ACQ and other instruments are also presented. Our analysis suggests that the ACQ is a valid and robust measure for use as a primary or secondary endpoint in future clinical trials.

- **Recorded observation of wheeze**: Heard by a healthcare professional.
- **Personal/family history of other atopic conditions**: Such as atopic dermatitis or allergic rhinitis.

### Acute asthma exacerbations: Management strategies [^116ULioj]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, specifically concerning the adjustment of treatment and stepping up, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend initiating single maintenance and reliever therapy with an ICS-LABA to reduce the risk of exacerbations in patients aged ≥ 12 years with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma. It is also advised to consider starting single maintenance and reliever therapy in pediatric patients aged ≥ 4 years with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma.

### Asthma yardstick: Practical recommendations for a sustained step-up in asthma therapy for poorly controlled asthma [^113CdJX3]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Asthma guidelines recommend a control-based approach to management that involves assessment of impairment and risk followed by implementation of treatment strategies individualized according to the patient's needs and preferences. The fact that many patients still experience severe symptoms that negatively affect quality of life suggests that asthma control remains an objective to be achieved. Tools are available to help patients and families manage the day-to-day and short-term variability in asthma symptoms; however, when and how to implement a sustained step-up in therapy is less clear.

The Asthma Yardstick is a comprehensive update on how to conduct a sustained step-up in asthma therapy for patients with not well-controlled or poorly controlled asthma. Patient profiles and step-up strategies are based on guidelines, newer data, and the authors' combined clinical experience and are intended to provide a practical and clinically meaningful guide toward the goal of well-controlled asthma for every patient. The development of this tool comes in response to the continued need to proactively address the sustained loss of asthma control at all levels of severity.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^111nz5nf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Jenkins et al. conducted a post hoc analysis of these three studies in 1,239 participants aged 12 years and older with milder asthma (daily maintenance ICS dose equal to 400 μg or less budesonide equivalent). The authors confirmed that SMART reduced exacerbations overall. However, in subgroup analyses, participants with the mildest asthma at enrollment (based on rescue SABA use of less than 1 inhalation per day) showed a marginal and statistically nonsignificant benefit.

Another post hoc analysis of one of the three RCTs (O'Byrne et al.) included 224 children aged 4 to 11 years who used medium to high ICS doses (any brand, 200–500 μg daily). The 118 participants in the SMART group were instructed to take budesonide-formoterol, 80/4.5 μg once daily, as their baseline therapy, with up to seven additional rescue puffs (total daily dose of 36 μg formoterol). The other 106 participants took budesonide, 320 μg daily, with rescue SABA. In the SMART group, the relative risk for a composite exacerbation measure comprised of systemic corticosteroids, hospitalization, emergency department visits, and an increase in ICS or other medication dose dropped by 57% (moderate certainty of evidence). The authors did not report on validated outcome measures of quality of life or asthma control, but nighttime awakenings declined significantly with SMART. SMART participants used a lower daily ICS dose (average 127 vs. 320 μg/day in the fixed-dose budesonide group) and demonstrated significantly improved growth rates (adjusted mean difference of 1 cm compared with fixed-dose budesonide).

### Global initiative for asthma strategy 2021: Executive summary and rationale for key changes [^1177LqWS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The general principles of asthma management emphasize achieving good symptom control, relieving symptoms when they occur, and minimizing the risk of exacerbations, asthma-related deaths, persistent airflow limitation, and side effects of treatment. It's essential to identify the patient's own treatment goals as they may differ from standard objectives. Effective asthma management requires a partnership between the patient (or parent/caregiver) and healthcare providers, underscored by shared decision-making and good communication.

Asthma management is not "one-size-fits-all" but should be personalized and adjusted in a continual cycle of assessment, treatment adjustment, and review.

- **Assessment**: Assess not only symptom control and lung function but also the individual's modifiable risk factors, comorbidities (also called "treatable traits"), and patient/parent goals and preferences. Frequently check adherence and inhaler technique. Poor symptom control is associated with a much higher risk of exacerbations, but patients with apparently mild asthma or with good symptom control can still have severe or life-threatening exacerbations.

- **Treatment adjustment**: This includes not only changes in the asthma medication dose or type but also the multidisciplinary management of modifiable risk factors and comorbidities and nonpharmacological strategies such as smoking cessation and avoidance of indoor/outdoor air pollution.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116RJgLJ]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, specifically concerning the adjustment of treatment and stepping down, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend offering the following options when stepping down treatment:

- **Step 5. High-dose ICS-LABA plus oral corticosteroids**:
	- Add biologic therapy in cases of type 2-high severe asthma if eligible, and reduce oral corticosteroids.
	- Optimize inhaled therapy and reduce oral corticosteroid dose.
	- Use a sputum-guided approach to reducing oral corticosteroids.
	- Switch to alternate-day dosing for low-dose oral corticosteroids.

- **Step 5. Biologic therapy plus high-dose ICS-LABA**:
	- Discontinue other add-on medications, especially oral corticosteroids, then consider reducing inhaled corticosteroid-long-acting β-agonist dose.

- **Step 4. Moderate-to-high-dose ICS-LABA maintenance treatment**:
	- Continue combination ICS-LABA with a 50% reduction in the ICS component by using available formulations.
	- Recognize that discontinuing LABA may lead to deterioration.
	- Switch to maintenance and reliever therapy with ICS-formoterol, with a lower maintenance dose.

- **Step 4. Medium-dose ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever**:
	- Reduce maintenance ICS-formoterol to a low dose, and continue as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol reliever.

- **Step 4. High-dose ICS plus second controller**:
	- Reduce ICS dose by 50% and continue the second controller.

- **Step 3. Low-dose ICS-LABA maintenance**:
	- Reduce ICS-LABA to once daily.
	- Recognize that discontinuing LABA may lead to deterioration.

- **Step 3. Low-dose ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever**:
	- Reduce the dose as per guidelines.

### Achieving asthma control with ICS/LABA: A review of strategies for asthma management and prevention [^115K2F7R]. Respiratory Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Maintenance treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) is recommended for patients whose asthma is not controlled with a low-to-moderate dose of ICS alone; a separate reliever medication is used on an as-needed basis. The Gaining Optimal Asthma Control (GOAL) study demonstrated that salmeterol/fluticasone maintenance treatment can improve asthma control and reduce future risk compared with fluticasone alone, although the dose escalation design of this study meant that most patients treated with salmeterol/fluticasone were receiving the highest dose of ICS at the end of the study.

Similarly, budesonide/formoterol maintenance therapy improved asthma control and reduced future risk compared with budesonide alone in the Formoterol and Corticosteroids Establishing Therapy (FACET) study. An alternative approach to asthma management is to use an ICS/LABA for both maintenance and reliever therapy. A large body of clinical evidence has shown that the use of budesonide/formoterol in this way improves both control and reduces future risk compared with ICS/LABA plus as-needed short-acting β2-agonist (SABA), even when patients receive lower maintenance doses of ICS as part of the maintenance and reliever therapy regimen.

In addition, one study has shown that beclometasone/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy reduces exacerbations more effectively than beclometasone/formoterol plus as-needed SABA. The use of ICS/LABA as both maintenance and reliever therapy ensures that an increase in reliever use in response to worsening symptoms is balanced by an increased dose of ICS to treat the underlying inflammation, providing an integrated approach to asthma management.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^1167KLGk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

In GRADE, each recommendation has a direction, indicating whether the recommendation is for, or against the use of an intervention. Each recommendation is also classified as either strong or conditional. Strong recommendations are those for which, in the judgment of the Expert Panel, after reviewing all evidence and individual judgments, all or almost all people would choose the recommended course of action. Conditional recommendations are those for which, after evaluating all evidence and judgments, the Expert Panel believes that many informed individuals may make different decisions about taking the recommended course of action. A conditional recommendation implies that engaging in a shared decision-making process is essential for individuals with asthma and their healthcare providers.

The Expert Panel drafted, discussed, and revised the recommendations multiple times before all eligible members (those without a conflict of interest for the topic) voted on each recommendation. The Expert Panel achieved consensus when more than 90% of its members voted in favor of a recommendation. If less than 90% of members voted in favor, the relevant topic team continued to revise the recommendation until it achieved consensus approval according to these criteria.

### The pediatric asthma yardstick: Practical recommendations for a sustained step-up in asthma therapy for children with inadequately controlled asthma [^112PixgH]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma guidelines recommend a control-based approach to management, involving assessment of impairment and risk, followed by implementation of treatment strategies individualized according to the patient's needs and preferences. However, achieving control for children with asthma can be elusive. Although tools are available to help children and families track and manage day-to-day symptoms, the timing and methodology for implementing a longer-term step-up in care are less clear.

The treatment is further complicated by the three age groups within childhood:

- **Adolescence**: 12–18 years old.

- **School age**: 6–11 years old.

- **Young children**: ≤ 5 years old.

What works for one age group might not be the best approach for another. The Pediatric Asthma Yardstick provides an in-depth assessment of when and how to step up therapy for children with not well or poorly controlled asthma.

Development of this tool follows others in the Yardstick series, presenting patient profiles and step-up strategies based on guidance documents, but modified according to newer data and the authors' combined clinical experience. The objective is to provide clinicians who treat children with asthma practical and clinically relevant recommendations for each step-up and intervention. This is intended to help practitioners better treat their pediatric patients with asthma, particularly those who do not always respond to recommended therapies.

### Should we apply a treatable traits approach to asthma care [^113U3MXE]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2022). High credibility.

To explore the evidence for adopting a "treatable traits" approach to asthma management, we conducted a comprehensive review using PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar. Our search targeted randomized, controlled phase III or IV trials involving adults, published in the last 10 years, with "asthma" in the title. Additionally, we searched for articles published in the past 5 years containing the title words "treatable AND trait(s)", "asthma AND biomarker(s) OR smoking OR obesity OR laryngeal OR management". Non-English articles were excluded, resulting in 257 articles identified for review. Further manual searches were performed on the reference lists of identified studies and the websites of the British Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, and Global Initiative for Asthma for specific guidance on asthma management.

The "treatable traits" in asthma are categorized into three domains: pulmonary, extrapulmonary, and behavioral/lifestyle traits. We evaluated whether treatments should target these traits when present in asthma patients, based on current evidence. This approach contrasts with the traditional step-up, step-down asthma management guidelines, which focus on symptom responsiveness.

We advocate for a broader application of the treatable traits approach in assessing and managing inadequately controlled asthma. This method emphasizes targeted treatment rather than the traditional symptom-based step-up, step-down approach, potentially improving patient outcomes.

- **Question 6.1**: What is the efficacy and safety of SCIT?

- **Recommendation 17**: In individuals aged 5 years and older with mild to moderate allergic asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends the use of SCIT as an adjunct treatment to standard pharmacotherapy. This recommendation applies to individuals whose asthma is controlled at the initiation, build-up, and maintenance phases of immunotherapy.

This is a conditional recommendation based on moderate certainty of evidence.

- **Implementation guidance**: Implement SCIT as adjunctive therapy only in patients whose asthma management is stable during all phases of immunotherapy.

### Focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^114yEirq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions on the use of LAMA therapy:

- **LAMA as an add-on therapy**: A LAMA can be used as an add-on to ICS therapy in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled asthma therapy as part of Step 4 therapy. However, add-on LABA therapy has a more favorable benefit-harm profile.

- **Considerations for specific populations**: Individuals at risk of urinary retention and those with glaucoma should not receive LAMA therapy. The small increase in the potential risk of harms from a LAMA may outweigh its benefits in some individuals, particularly in Black individuals.

- **Inhaler device usage**: LAMA treatment requires appropriate use of specific inhaler devices. Clinicians should teach individuals with asthma how to use these devices properly.

- **Prescription guidelines**: When prescribing LAMA therapy, clinicians should prescribe this medication for long-term asthma control in the ambulatory setting. LAMA therapy does not have a role in managing acute exacerbations of asthma in ambulatory, emergency department, or inpatient settings.

- **Assessment before intensifying therapy**: Clinicians should confirm the asthma diagnosis and address factors that often contribute to uncontrolled asthma before considering intensifying therapy by adding a LAMA. For example, clinicians should identify and suggest ways to mitigate occupational and environmental triggers and ensure individuals with asthma are using currently prescribed asthma controller therapy appropriately.

- **Patient discussions about LAMA therapy**: When discussing the addition of a LAMA versus a LABA for individuals already taking an ICS, clinicians should explain that a LABA is likely to be preferable.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^1177Woec]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for severe asthma phenotypes, specifically concerning long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), the NHLBI 2020 guidelines recommend considering the addition of a LAMA to an inhaled corticosteroid-long-acting beta-agonist (ICS-LABA) regimen. This recommendation applies to patients aged 12 years and older who have uncontrolled persistent asthma, suggesting it may be more beneficial than maintaining the same dose of ICS-LABA.

Moving forward, the process of guideline development needs to be more agile. Creating an ongoing process for developing recommendations that includes individuals with varied expertise and from multiple organizations may facilitate this process. In addition, the structure of the recommendations may need to change. The step diagrams, although useful, are a one-size-fits-all approach. The recommendations use a patient-centered approach that is critical but not sufficient. In the emerging era of personalized medicine, tailored interventions and treatments customized to particular individuals with specific characteristics will be needed. Discussions about how to address individualized approaches to asthma care and how to incorporate these approaches into the standard of care are needed now so that future recommendations can integrate these new approaches.

Finally, I thank the members of the Expert Panel who voluntarily gave their time and expertise to complete this work. The amount of work that was needed in a compressed period of time from each member was very high. To them, to Drs. Kiley and Mensah, whose support was unwavering, and to the NHLBI and Westat staff, thank you.

### Breaking new ground: Challenging existing asthma guidelines [^115VYmbg]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

While we have international guidelines and various national guidelines for asthma diagnosis and management, asthma remains poorly controlled in many children and adults. In this paper, we review the limitations of asthma guidelines and describe important issues and remaining questions regarding asthma guidelines for use, particularly in primary care.

- **Discussion**: Clinical practice guidelines based on evidence from randomized controlled trials are considered the most rigorous and accurate. Evidence-based guidelines are written predominantly from the perspective of the patient with a clear-cut asthma diagnosis, however, and tend not to consider the heterogeneity of asthma or to accommodate individual patient variations in response to treatment or their needs, differences in practice settings, or local differences in availability and cost of therapies. The results of randomized controlled trials, which are designed to establish efficacy of treatment under ideal conditions, may not apply to 'real-world' clinical practice, where patients are unselected, monitoring is less frequent, and effectiveness — the benefit of treatment in routine clinical practice — is the most relevant outcome. Moreover, most guidelines see asthma in isolation rather than considering other factors that may impact asthma and response to asthma therapy, particularly age, allergic rhinitis, cigarette smoking, adherence, and genetic factors. When these links are recognized, guidelines rarely provide practical recommendations for treatment in these scenarios. Finally, there is some…

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^111NPNLz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for severe asthma phenotypes, more specifically with respect to ICSs and LABAs, NHLBI 2020 guidelines recommend offering ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler used as both daily controller and reliever therapy in patients aged 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma rather than:

- **Higher-dose ICS** as daily controller therapy and short-acting β-agonist for quick-relief therapy

- **Same-dose ICS-LABA** as daily controller therapy and short-acting β-agonist for quick-relief therapy.
