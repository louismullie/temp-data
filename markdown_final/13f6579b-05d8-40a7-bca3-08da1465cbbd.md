## Question

how to counsel female pattern baldness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step counseling approach for female pattern hair loss. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify the psychosocial impact and set expectations. Next, I will review first-line therapy with minoxidil, including dosing, response assessment, and adherence counseling. After that, I need to check indications and evidence for antiandrogens, including contraception requirements and safety. I will then consider procedural options, adjunctive and emerging therapies, and finally address special populations and close with a practical follow-up plan and key counseling points, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude mimics, because diffuse nonscarring alopecia in women has a broad differential including telogen effluvium, diffuse alopecia areata, and nutritional or endocrine causes; I should review history for chronicity, pattern, shedding, menstrual regularity, hirsutism, acne, medications, and family history, and on exam look for diffuse mid-scalp thinning with frontal hairline preservation and confirm terminal-vellus miniaturization on dermoscopy or biopsy if uncertain, while remembering that FPHL is common and prevalence rises with age, especially after menopause, and that isolated FPHL without other hyperandrogenic signs is not itself diagnostic of hyperandrogenism [^115vwv6A] [^112VaZaR] [^1153P5ud] [^114R2EjR].

> Wait, let me verify the role of androgens before I over-order labs; many women with FPHL have normal androgen levels, and although androgens can contribute, nonandrogenic pathways likely participate, so routine hormonal testing is not indicated in isolated FPHL, but I should screen for hyperandrogenism if there are irregular menses, hirsutism, severe acne, or rapid progression, in which case total/free testosterone, DHEAS, and prolactin are reasonable, and I should also consider iron, ferritin, thyroid studies, vitamin D, and zinc when clinically suggested, keeping in mind that PCOS is the most common cause of clinical hyperandrogenism and that hirsutism alone is a stronger predictor of biochemical hyperandrogenism than FPHL alone [^114R2EjR] [^112BdEua] [^111QEiwz].

> I need to ensure I address psychosocial impact explicitly because distress is common and often disproportionate to objective severity; I should screen for anxiety, depression, social avoidance, and body image concerns, validate feelings, and offer resources such as support groups and mental health referrals, while also correcting a common misconception that women overestimate severity — evidence suggests many actually underestimate it, which can delay care and compound distress [^112xoydg] [^116As4f9].

> Next, I should review first-line therapy and set expectations; topical minoxidil is the only FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for women with FPHL, with guideline-supported options of 2% solution twice daily or 5% foam once daily, and I should counsel that visible improvement typically takes 3–6 months, peak at 6–12 months, and requires ongoing use to maintain gains, with discontinuation leading to loss of benefit within months; I should also prepare patients for a transient shedding phase early in therapy and discuss application technique and adherence to optimize outcomes [^117WRfby] [^11414oCi] [^113fzs38] [^116T8eEo].

> Hold on, I should verify the evidence base for minoxidil efficacy; randomized trials and meta-analyses show that minoxidil increases the proportion achieving moderate regrowth and increases total hair count by roughly 13 hairs/cm² versus placebo, with adverse events comparable to placebo aside from localized hypertrichosis, particularly at higher concentrations, and although 5% foam once daily is guideline-endorsed, head-to-head data suggest similar efficacy between 2% and 5% formulations, so concentration choice can be individualized to tolerability and adherence [^115smERx] [^115RdfET] [^117WRfby] [^115H84MG].

> I will now examine indications for antiandrogen therapy; in women with clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, adding an antiandrogen such as spironolactone or cyproterone acetate can be considered, but I must ensure effective contraception because of teratogenic risks, and I should counsel on expected timelines, safety, and monitoring; spironolactone 50–100 mg/day is commonly used off-label and may arrest progression with some regrowth, while cyproterone acetate is guideline-supported in hyperandrogenic women but carries meningioma risk at higher cumulative doses, and finasteride has mixed evidence in women with largely negative RCT data in postmenopausal cohorts, so I should reserve it for selected cases after shared decision-making and careful counseling [^111LWqTu] [^113gn2Gq] [^1141APvf] [^116m3vu8] [^115yfHcs].

> But wait, what if the patient is normoandrogenic and asks for finasteride; I should double-check guideline positions — European guidance states insufficient evidence to recommend oral antiandrogens, including finasteride, in normoandrogenic women, so I should avoid routine use and instead reinforce minoxidil adherence and consider procedural options if medical therapy is inadequate, documenting the off-label rationale if an exception is made in refractory cases [^11614FUJ] [^111yN9aC].

> Let me consider procedural options for advanced or treatment-refractory disease; follicular unit hair transplantation is a reasonable option in women with adequate donor density and stable disease, and I should counsel on realistic goals, staged planning, and the need for ongoing medical therapy to protect native hair; scalp micropigmentation offers a non-surgical camouflage option with high satisfaction in small series, and cosmetic strategies such as fibers, powders, and styling can meaningfully improve appearance while treatments take effect [^1117veL3] [^114Lo1XM] [^115wvTRY] [^115AYpGZ].

> Next, I should review adjunctive and emerging therapies with appropriate caution; low-level laser therapy shows modest increases in hair count in some RCTs but evidence quality is limited and inconsistent, so I can present it as an optional adjunct with uncertain magnitude of benefit; microneedling and compounded topical antiandrogens are promising but remain investigational in many settings, and I should avoid recommending unproven topicals such as alfatradiol, fluridil, or natural estrogens given insufficient evidence and potential harms [^116T8eEo] [^115smERx] [^115eRCMr].

> I need to ensure I tailor counseling to special populations; in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, I should discuss the unclear role of hormone replacement therapy for FPHL and focus on minoxidil and antiandrogens when indicated, while in women of reproductive potential I must coordinate contraception with any antiandrogen use; in transgender men on testosterone, I should counsel that androgenic alopecia is an expected, often irreversible effect and discuss risk mitigation strategies and expectations; in adolescents, I should prioritize minoxidil and address modifiable contributors, reserving antiandrogens cautiously with family and reproductive counseling [^1153P5ud] [^113gn2Gq] [^116kAvW8] [^1164PHy2].

> Let me outline a practical follow-up plan and key counseling points; reassess at 3 months for adherence and tolerability, at 6 months for efficacy using standardized scales or photography, and continue therapy if there is stabilization or improvement, recognizing that maintenance is lifelong; I should reinforce that earlier treatment yields better outcomes, that combination strategies may be needed in severe or hyperandrogenic cases, and that no therapy reliably restores a pre-alopecia density, so expectation management is essential to avoid disappointment and nonadherence [^11414oCi] [^111VWchs] [^112xoydg].

> Finally, I should double-check that I have addressed core counseling elements: confirm the diagnosis and exclude mimics, explain the chronic progressive nature of FPHL and the need for ongoing therapy, review first-line minoxidil with dosing, application, timeline, and shedding, discuss antiandrogen options only when appropriate with contraception and safety counseling, consider procedural and cosmetic solutions for refractory cases, and provide psychosocial support and resources, ensuring shared decision-making throughout and documenting the discussion and plan [^115vwv6A] [^117WRfby] [^113gn2Gq] [^112xoydg].

Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is a chronic, progressive thinning of scalp hair with a characteristic diffuse pattern and preserved frontal hairline [^115vwv6A]. Counseling should **confirm the diagnosis** and exclude mimics (telogen effluvium, alopecia areata, thyroid disease, iron deficiency) [^112VaZaR], and **explain the pathophysiology** as multifactorial, involving genetics, androgens, and aging, with many women having normal androgen levels [^113T3BQP] [^114R2EjR]. Emphasize that treatments can slow progression and improve density but **require ongoing therapy** [^115vwv6A]; minoxidil is first-line [^114R2EjR], anti-androgens are reserved for hyperandrogenic cases, and finasteride is generally ineffective in women [^116T8eEo] [^114R2EjR]. Address psychosocial impact, set realistic expectations, and provide resources for support and camouflage options [^112xoydg] [^115AYpGZ].

---

## Clinical features and diagnosis

- **Clinical presentation**: Diffuse thinning over the crown and frontal scalp with preservation of the frontal hairline; hair part widening and reduced density are common [^115vwv6A].

- **Diagnostic evaluation**: Clinical diagnosis supported by dermoscopy showing hair shaft diversity and peri-follicular pigmentation; exclude telogen effluvium, alopecia areata, thyroid disease, iron deficiency, and medication-induced hair loss [^112VaZaR].

- **Classification**: Ludwig (I–III) and Savin scales (I-1 to II-2) standardize severity and guide management [^112BdEua].

---

## Pathophysiology

Genetic predisposition contributes substantially, with **polygenic inheritance** and androgen receptor involvement [^113T3BQP] [^113R8Cjq] [^115vwv6A]. Androgens play a variable role; many women have normal androgen levels, though androgen excess can accelerate hair loss [^113T3BQP]. Aging and hormonal shifts, particularly menopause, further reduce density and miniaturize follicles [^1153P5ud].

---

## Psychological and emotional impact

Psychosocial distress is common, with **significant anxiety, depression, and reduced self-esteem** reported [^113Uvqpv]. quality of life is often impaired, with negative effects on social interactions and daily functioning [^113T3BQP]. Support needs include education, counseling, and access to support groups to mitigate psychosocial burden [^114iUD4J].

---

## Treatment options

### Topical therapies

- **Minoxidil**: First-line therapy; 2% solution twice daily or 5% foam once daily [^117WRfby]; improves density and slows progression; assess at 6 months and continue if effective [^11414oCi].

- **Low-level laser therapy**: Modest benefit in some studies; evidence is limited and inconsistent [^116T8eEo].

---

### Systemic therapies

- **Anti-androgens**: Spironolactone or cyproterone acetate for hyperandrogenic women; require effective contraception due to teratogenic risk [^113gn2Gq].

- **Finasteride**: Generally ineffective in women; not recommended routinely [^116T8eEo] [^116m3vu8].

---

### Surgical and cosmetic options

Hair transplantation is appropriate for women with **stable hair loss and adequate donor density** [^1117veL3]. Cosmetic camouflage — such as wigs, hairpieces, scalp micropigmentation, and topical fibers — can improve appearance and confidence [^115AYpGZ] [^115wvTRY].

---

## Lifestyle modifications and supportive care

Gentle hair care with **avoidance of harsh chemicals, heat, and tight hairstyles** helps reduce breakage [^1153P5ud]. Nutritional support — ensuring adequate protein, iron, vitamin D, and zinc — supports hair health [^notfound]. Stress management may reduce shedding, as stress can exacerbate hair loss [^notfound].

---

## Setting realistic expectations

Progression is chronic and progressive; **ongoing therapy is required** to maintain results [^115vwv6A]. Response is typically modest and gradual, with visible improvement taking 6–12 months [^111Fo9GR]. Individual variability in response necessitates tailored counseling and follow-up [^112xoydg].

---

## Patient education and counseling strategies

- **Clear communication**: Use simple language, visual aids, and written materials to explain diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis [^112xoydg].

- **Shared decision-making**: Engage patients in treatment choices, balancing efficacy, side effects, and preferences [^114iUD4J].

- **Emotional support**: Validate feelings, address body image concerns, and provide resources for psychological support [^112xoydg].

- **Follow-up**: Regular visits to monitor response, adherence, and adjust therapy [^11414oCi].

---

## Resources and support groups

Provide information on local and online support groups, counseling services, and educational websites. Connect patients with organizations such as the American Hair Loss Association and the National Alopecia Areata Foundation.

Female pattern hair loss counseling should be **comprehensive**, covering diagnosis, pathophysiology, treatment options, and psychosocial impact. Emphasize that treatments can slow progression and improve density but require ongoing therapy, and provide emotional support and resources to enhance quality of life [^115vwv6A].

### Female pattern hair loss [^113T3BQP]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Female pattern hair loss is a common condition characterized by a diffuse reduction in hair density over the crown and frontal scalp with retention of the frontal hairline. The prevalence increases with advancing age. It has been widely thought to be the female counterpart of male balding and is often referred to as female androgenetic alopecia. However, the role of androgens is not fully established. Scalp hair loss is undoubtedly a feature of hyperandrogenism in women but many women with female pattern hair loss have no other clinical or biochemical evidence of androgen excess. Female pattern hair loss is probably a multifactorial genetically determined trait and it is possible that both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent mechanisms contribute to the phenotype. In managing patients with female pattern hair loss the physician should be aware that the adverse effects on quality of life can be quite severe and do not necessarily correlate with the objective degree of hair loss. The treatment options are currently limited but modest improvements in hair density are achievable in some women.

23andMe data were obtained from research participants of 23andMe, Inc.who provided informed consent and participated in research online, under a protocol approved by the external AAHRPP-accredited IRB, Ethical & Independent Review Services. Participants provided responses to the "Hair Loss in Men and Women" survey. Only responses from male research participants were included. Survey questions included the following: "Please choose the image that best captures your hair's pattern and density. If your head is shaved, please answer for how your hair looks when grown out. If none of these images are similar to your hair's pattern and density, choose none of the above". (images a to s, corresponding to Hamilton scale); "Have you experienced hair loss or thinning?" (Yes, No, I'm not sure, Decline to state); "How old were you when you first started to notice hair loss?" (under age 18, 18–24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, 40–44, 45–49, 50–54, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, 70–74, 75–79, 80 years or older, I'm not sure.) Cases reported having experienced hair loss or thinning, with onset before age 40, and current hair loss of Hamilton grade III or higher. Controls are at least 30 years old, and report not having experienced hair loss or thinning, and at most Hamilton grade I, or if age 50 or older, Hamilton grade II.

The following constitutes key background information on androgenetic alopecia:

- **Definition**: Androgenetic alopecia, also known as male or female pattern baldness, is a common form of hair loss in both genders.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of androgenetic alopecia involves both genetic and hormonal factors. The condition is known to depend on the presence of the androgen dihydrotestosterone and a genetic predisposition, with the androgen receptor gene playing a significant role.
- **Epidemiology**: Androgenetic alopecia is estimated to affect about 0.2–2% of the population worldwide.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for androgenetic alopecia include a genetic predisposition, specifically a susceptibility locus at chromosome 20p11.22, advancing age, and hormonal influences.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, it is characterized by a progressive loss of hair, with a specific pattern of baldness. In men, it often presents as hairline recession at the temples and balding at the top of the head. In women, it typically manifests as a general thinning of hair across the entire scalp, with preservation of the frontal hairline.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of androgenetic alopecia is chronic and progressive. While treatments can slow the progression and improve hair density, there is currently no known cure. The hair loss typically continues over time.

### GWAS for male-pattern baldness identifies 71 susceptibility loci explaining 38% of the risk [^113R8Cjq]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Male pattern baldness (MPB) or androgenetic alopecia is one of the most common conditions affecting men, reaching a prevalence of ~50% by the age of 50; however, the known genes explain little of the heritability. Here, we present the results of a genome-wide association study including more than 70,000 men, identifying 71 independently replicated loci, of which 30 are novel. These loci explain 38% of the risk, suggesting that MPB is less genetically complex than other complex traits. We show that many of these loci contain genes that are relevant to the pathology and highlight pathways and functions underlying baldness. Finally, despite only showing genome-wide genetic correlation with height, pathway-specific genetic correlations are significant for traits including lifespan and cancer. Our study not only greatly increases the number of MPB loci, illuminating the genetic architecture, but also provides a new approach to disentangling the shared biological pathways underlying complex diseases.

Transgender males — testosterone therapy approach and targets indicate that clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of several different androgen preparations to induce masculinization in transgender males, and clinicians can use either parenteral or transdermal preparations to achieve testosterone values in the normal male range (this is dependent on the specific assay, but is typically 320 to 1000 ng/dL). Sustained supraphysiologic levels of testosterone increase the risk of adverse reactions and should be avoided. Similar to androgen therapy in hypogonadal men, testosterone treatment in transgender males results in increased muscle mass and decreased fat mass, increased facial hair and acne, male pattern baldness in those genetically predisposed, and increased sexual desire.

Gender-affirming medical interventions for nonbinary people — when a particular intervention lacks established precedent, it is important that before the intervention is considered, the individual is provided with an overview of the available information, including recognition of potential knowledge limits, and it is equally important to undertake and document a comprehensive discussion of the physical changes needed and the potential limitations in achieving those attributes, including whether an intervention may or may not enhance gender expression. For estrogen therapy in nonbinary people assigned male at birth (AMAB), it is important to note the possibility of breast growth cannot be avoided, and this should be made clear if a nonbinary person seeks some of the other changes associated with estrogen therapy (such as softening of skin and reduction in facial hair growth) but does not want or is ambivalent about breast growth. For testosterone in nonbinary people assigned female at birth (AFAB), it should be recognized that if facial hair development is needed, genital growth is inevitable, and the time frame for taking testosterone means these changes are likely also to be accompanied by an irreversible vocal pitch drop, although the extent of each is individual; a vocal pitch drop without the development of body hair is another such challenge, and for some nonbinary people a low dose may be justified as a compromise. If hormonal therapy is discontinued and endogenous hormones are retained, many physical changes will revert to pre-hormone therapy status, including reversal of amenorrhea and body hair development in nonbinary people AFAB and reduction in muscular definition and erectile dysfunction in nonbinary people AMAB, but other changes will be permanent such as "male-pattern" baldness, genital growth, and facial hair growth in nonbinary people AFAB or breast development in nonbinary people AMAB; these will require further interventions to reverse, such as electrolysis or mastectomy and are sometimes described as "partially reversible". As the implications of using low-dose hormone therapy are not documented in this patient population, it is important to consider monitoring for cardiovascular risk and bone health if low-dose hormone therapy is used.

In addition to discussing planning a transplant pattern for already bald men, I discuss a conservative approach for recognizing and transplanting younger patients who have telltale warning signs that may evolve to extensive hair loss. For both groups, a variant of a frontal forelock-type pattern is usually the best course to follow.

### Hair: what is new in diagnosis and management? Female pattern hair loss update: diagnosis and treatment [^111VWchs]. Dermatologic Clinics (2013). Low credibility.

Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is the most common cause of alopecia in women. FPHL is characterized histologically with increased numbers of miniaturized, velluslike hair follicles. The goal of treatment of FPHL is to arrest hair loss progression and stimulate hair regrowth. The treatments for FPHL can be divided into androgen-dependent and androgen-independent. There is an important adjuvant role for nutritional supplements, light therapy, and hair transplants. All treatments work best when initiated early. Combinations of treatments tend to be more efficacious.

Clinical Question

Which interventions are effective and safe for treating female pattern hair loss (FPHL)?

Bottom Line

There was low- to moderate-quality evidence that topical minoxidil (2% and 5%) was associated with improvements in FPHL. There was low-quality evidence that finasteride was no more effective than placebo. There were inconsistent results from studies that laser devices were effective, but total hair count increased compared with baseline (moderate- to low-quality evidence). Most treatments were not associated with higher adverse event rates than placebo.

### Hair loss in women: medical and cosmetic approaches to increase scalp hair fullness [^115AYpGZ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Androgenetic alopecia affects both men and women. In men it produces male pattern hair loss with bitemporal recession and vertex baldness. In women it produces female pattern hair loss (FPHL) with diffuse alopecia over the mid-frontal scalp. FPHL occurs as a result of nonuniform hair follicle miniaturization within follicular units. Diffuse alopecia is produced by a reduction in the number of terminal fibres per follicular unit. Baldness occurs only when all hairs within the follicular units are miniaturized and is a relatively late event in women. The concepts of follicular units and primary and secondary hair follicles within follicular units are well established in comparative mammalian studies, particularly in sheep. However, discovery of these structures in the human scalp hair and investigation of the changes in follicular unit anatomy during the development of androgenetic alopecia have provided a clearer understanding of the early stages of androgenetic alopecia and how the male and female patterns of hair loss are related. FPHL is the most common cause of alopecia in women and approximately one-third of adult caucasian women experience hair loss. The impact of FPHL is predominantly psychological. While men anticipate age-related hair loss, hair loss in women is usually unexpected and unwelcome at any age. Treatment options to arrest hair loss progression and stimulate partial hair regrowth for FPHL include the androgen receptor antagonists spironolactone and cyproterone acetate, the 5α-reductase inhibitor finasteride and the androgen-independent hair growth stimulator minoxidil. These treatments appear to work best when initiated early. Hair transplantation should be considered in advanced FPHL that is resistant to medical treatments. Hair transplantation requires well-preserved hair growth over the occipital donor area. The psychological impact of FPHL may also be reduced by cosmetic products that improve the appearance of the hair. These agents work to minimize hair fibre breakage, improve hair volume or conceal visible bald scalp.

### Female pattern hair loss in complete androgen insensitivity syndrome [^114FJrip]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Female pattern hair loss, also known as female androgenetic alopecia, is generally regarded as an androgen-dependent disorder representing the female counterpart of male balding. We describe female pattern hair loss occurring in a patient with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome suggesting that mechanisms other than direct androgen action contribute to this common form of hair loss in women.

Regarding medical management for androgenetic alopecia, more specifically with respect to hormonal therapy (female-pattern hair loss), EDF 2018 guidelines recommend to consider offering oral cyproterone acetate to prevent the progression of androgenetic alopecia in female patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism.

### Male pattern baldness and risk of colorectal neoplasia [^116Lb5Av]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

It is worth noting that an increased risk associated with frontal-plus-severe-vertex baldness was evident for CRA but not for CRC. The role of chance cannot be excluded. Yet, as for the association with frontal-only baldness, the association with frontal-plus-severe-vertex baldness was confined to adenomas of tubular histology. Although lack of studies on hormone profiles across each type of baldness hampers our understanding of biological mechanism underlying the heterogeneous finding, in light of an estimated 79% heritability of male pattern baldness, reaching the most progressed type of baldness at age 45 years may be driven by a strong genetic influence. Thus, it is plausible that there are genetic polymorphisms common to severe baldness and adenomas of tubular histology.

Our finding that male pattern baldness was associated with risk of tubular but not (tubulo)villous adenoma may suggest some aetiologic insights. Tubulo-villous and villous adenomas are more likely to progress and be of advanced stage than tubular adenomas, and this may explain why baldness was weakly associated with overall high-risk adenomas. However, baldness was strongly and significantly associated with the subset of high-risk adenomas that had exclusively a tubular component.

Methods

Study approval

All subjects gave written informed consent. UK Biobank has approval from the North West Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee (MREC), In Scotland, UK Biobank has approval from the Community Health Index Advisory Group (CHIAG). ARIC has approval from the ARIC Publications Committee and the ARIC Coordinating Center. The HPFS was approved by the IRB of the Harvard School of Public Health.

Phenotype definition and cohort description

In UK Biobank samples, the degree of baldness was defined as part of a self-administered questionnaire. Each male participant was asked to recognise his hair/balding pattern comparing with four different pictures. The first would correspond to no sign of baldness, the second to a II–IIIa grade on the Norwood–Hamiltonscale, the third to a IIIv–IV grade and the fourth to a V+ grade. To be certain of using people actually affected by MPB, we used as cases people who self-identified themselves as being in the third or fourth group while as controls people in the first category. Given that people in UK Biobank have been selected to be of ages between 40 and 69, by when baldness is fully developed, no age filter was applied. Genotypes both measured and imputed were obtained from UK Biobank and no further QC was applied. Details can be found atand.

Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) is an on-going prospective analysis of male US health professionals, information on hair pattern at age 45 was collected by self-administered questionnaires during the 1992 follow-up. Participants were asked to select their hair pattern at age 45 from five images (no baldness, frontal-only baldness, frontal-plus-mild-vertex baldness, frontal-plus-moderate-vertex baldness and frontal-plus severe vertex baldness) modified from the Hamilton–Norwood scaleCases were defined as experiencing frontal and (any) vertex baldness at age 45, which corresponds to at least a IV grade on the Hamilton–Norwood scale. Controls were defined as those experiencing no baldness at age 45.

### GWAS for male-pattern baldness identifies 71 susceptibility loci explaining 38% of the risk [^113EbL4i]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) is a prospective population-based cohort study of individuals from four US communities. Baseline examinations took place from 1987 to 1989. During the fourth visit (1996–1998), baldness pattern was classified according to the Hamilton baldness scale, as modified by Norwood. A trained technician in each clinic observed the participant's head from two angles (side and top), compared the natural hair pattern with a series of 12 figures, and chose the best matching figure. These figures corresponded to categories on the Hamilton baldness scale (I, II, IIa, III, IIIa, IIIva, III vertex, IV, V, Va, VI, VII). A score of 13 was recorded for complete baldness. More details about these measurements have been previously described. Cases were defined as individual with grade III or higher, whereas controls were defined as individuals with grade I. Given that the participants of the ARIC study were all between 53 and 74 years old, no age filter was applied. We restricted our analysis to European-American men.

### Innovative use of spironolactone as an antiandrogen in the treatment of female pattern hair loss [^1141APvf]. Dermatologic Clinics (2010). Low credibility.

Patterned hair loss in men and women, although medically benign, is a common, albeit unwelcome, event that may cause considerable anxiety and concern. Patterned hair loss is progressive and when untreated leads to baldness. The prevalence and severity of this physiologic process both increase with advancing age. Although androgens play a key role in the pathogenesis of male pattern hair loss (MPHL), the role of androgens in female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is less well established. Satisfactory treatment response to antiandrogen therapy supports the involvement of androgens in the pathogenesis of FPHL. Spironolactone has been used for 30 years as a potassium-sparing diuretic. Spironolactone is a synthetic steroid structurally related to aldosterone. Since the serendipitous discovery 20 years ago that spironolactone given to a woman for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and associated hypertension also improved hirsutism, it has been used as a primary medical treatment for hirsutism. Spironolactone both reduces adrenal androgen production and exerts competitive blockade on androgen receptors in target tissues. Spironolactone has been used off-label in FPHL for over 20 years. It has been shown to arrest hair loss progression with a long-term safety profile. A significant percentage of women also achieve partial hair regrowth. Spironolactone is not used in male androgenetic alopecia because of the risk of feminization.

In the Bonn Study, the 107-SNP models that did not include age as predictor, achieved considerably higher prediction accuracy estimates compared to UKBB i.e. 0.830 in Bonn vs. 0.696 in UKBB for no hair loss, 0.775 vs. 0.712 for severe hair loss, and 0.830 vs. 0.696 for any vs. no hair loss. For the slight hair loss phenotype, the AUC in Bonn was slightly higher than in UKBB with 0.599 vs. 0.573, while for moderate hair loss it was slightly lower with 0.591 vs. 0.602 (Table 3). For any vs. no hair loss prediction, the BLR model without considering age in Bonn provides accurate prediction for about 41.8% of males, that is, individuals with predicted probabilities of any hair loss < 0.2 or > 0.8 (0.2% < 0.2 and 41.6% > 0.8, Fig. 3B).

Gender-affirming testosterone therapy — routes, dosing, effects, monitoring, and screening — Gender-affirming testosterone can be taken orally, injected parenterally (subcutaneous or intramuscular), placed transdermally (as patch, gel, or cream), or implanted as subcutaneous pellets, although oral regimens are currently not recommended in the U.S.; in the U.S., one common regimen is injection (intramuscular or subcutaneous) with testosterone cypionate 20–100 mg weekly. The general goal of gender-affirming testosterone therapy is to develop the desired masculinizing secondary sex characteristics and to suppress or minimize female secondary sex characteristics, with permanent effects including enlargement of the thyroid cartilage or "Adam's Apple", thickening of the vocal cords resulting in deepening of the voice, androgenic balding and body hair growth, and clitoral enlargement; reversible effects include cessation of menses, increased muscle mass, redistribution of body fat and weight gain, skin oiliness or acne, increased libido, genitourinary atrophy, and increased physical energy. Some TGD patients, especially those who identify as androgynous, may use testosterone at lower doses or for shorter periods of time. Guidelines suggest monitoring for sleep apnea, hypertension, excessive weight gain, salt retention, and lipid changes given the potential for decreased high-density lipoprotein, increased low-density lipoprotein, and increased triglyceride levels. Gender-affirming testosterone use in TGD patients does not appear to alter baseline risk of breast cancer or gynecological cancer, and routine, age-appropriate screening exams are still warranted based on relevant body part(s).

### Male pattern baldness and risk of colorectal neoplasia [^1169qzvQ]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

There are several strengths in our study. To our knowledge, our study represents the first to report a potential relationship between male pattern baldness and the risk of colorectal neoplasia. By examining both adenoma and cancer outcomes and observing a positive association across neoplasias in colorectal carcinogenesis, we reduced the likelihood of chance findings. Furthermore, we had little evidence of confounding, as indicated by minimal association between baldness and lifestyle factors and little change in results from the age-adjusted to multivariable-adjusted model. By analysing by subtypes of colorectal neoplasia and accounting for finasteride use, our study was able to elucidate some mechanistic insight regarding the role of hormones across colorectal carcinogenesis.

Yet, our study has limitations. First, male pattern baldness at age 45 years was recalled and self-reported. Aside from random errors associated with recall, as baldness is considered unattractive, participants may have downgraded the severity of baldness. However, as this information was assessed before the diagnosis of colorectal neoplasia, misclassification is likely to be random with respect to the outcome, which can bias results toward the null. Yet, we were still able to observe significant associations. Second, our cancer analyses may have inadequate power to examine an association with more progressed types of baldness because of small number of CRC cases for frontal-plus-moderate-vertex baldness and frontal-plus-severe-vertex baldness. Yet, we attempted to address the limitation by complementing the cancer analyses with the adenoma analyses having approximately five times as many cases. Third, as male pattern baldness is a complex disorder determined by interplay of genetic and nongenetic factors, baldness pattern at different ages or rate of progressiveness may better capture the underlying factor responsible for an increased risk of colorectal neoplasia. However, our study with a single measurement of hair pattern could not address these questions. Finally, our findings may not be generalisable to other racial populations.

In conclusion, subtypes of male pattern baldness at age 45 years were positively associated with colorectal adenoma and cancer. To determine the predictive value of male pattern baldness in identifying those at high risk for colorectal neoplasia, our results need to be confirmed in future large epidemiologic studies. To better understand aetiologic mechanism linking male pattern baldness to colorectal neoplasia, additional studies are warranted to examine the association of sex hormones, IGFs, and insulin in relation to subtypes of male pattern baldness.

### Quantitative evaluation of female pattern hair loss in Chinese women: a preliminary study [^113d1aSs]. Dermatologic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The common grading systems for female pattern hair loss (FPHL), such as Ludwig and Savin scales, are subjective to visual inspection. To provide a more objective evaluation of baldness, the authors have developed a method to calculate baldness quantitatively through a computer-aided imaging system (CAIS).

Objective

To investigate the use of CAIS on Chinese women with FPHL.

Materials and Methods

Thirty-eight Chinese women with FPHL (Savin Scale I-2 to II-2) were recruited. A total of 215 photographs were taken. The central balding areas (CBAs) were calculated after exposure correction by CAIS for comparison with clinical staging.

Results

The average CBA was 9,391.12 mm in all patients, 3,828.84 mm in Type I-2, 5,880.38 mm in I-3, 8,267.44 mm in I-4, 12,999.26 mm in II-1, and 15,979.71 mm in II-2. The values of CBA correlated with clinical staging using Savin scales. A 7.53% difference was found in the calculated CBA by exposure correction.

Conclusion

The CAIS allows physicians to evaluate the severity of baldness more accurately through quantitative calculation, rather than qualitative visual observation. The values of the CBA measured by the CAIS, used in conjunction with the present grading systems, may be more precise and efficient to evaluate the severity of FPHL.

Fig. 2
Individual contribution of the ascertained 117 SNP predictors and age on the prediction accuracy expressed as AUC for the 4-category MLR and the 2-category BLR MPB prediction models obtained from the model testing dataset of 26,177 UKBB men.

These prediction models were built in the prediction model training dataset of 104,694 UKKBB men.

The 4-category MLR models without considering age predicted with considerably higher accuracies for severe (AUC = 0.718) and no hair loss (0.702) than for moderate (0.607) and slight (0.574) hair loss (see Table 2 for additional prediction accuracy metrics). Inclusion of age in the MLR modelling improved the estimates of accuracy to AUC of 0.728 for severe hair loss, 0.711 for no hair loss, 0.635 for moderate hair loss, and 0.602 for slight hair loss (Table 2). For the 2-category BLR model of predicting any vs. no hair loss, we obtained an AUC of 0.702 without age and a slightly higher AUC of 0.711 with age in the model (Table 2). This model provided informative prediction for about 26.2% of the 26,177 males tested, that is, individuals with predicted probabilities of any hair loss < 0.2 or > 0.8 (Fig. 3A).

Of note, sigmoidoscopy cannot detect proximal colon adenoma, potentially leading to outcome misclassification. Thus, for adenoma analysis, a sensitivity analysis was conducted by restricting the analytic cohort to men who had at least one colonoscopy. For participants with more than one adenoma diagnosed, analyses were performed using the adenoma of the largest size and most advanced histologic characteristics.

All the statistical tests were two sided and P -values of ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

5.1.3 Female Pattern Hair‐Loss (FPHL)

Scalp hair‐loss in women is relatively common, and its prevalence increases with age, affecting ~50% of women over the age of 80 years. Depending on whether it occurs before or after the menopause, it may be considered as either early‐ or late‐onset. The term FPHL is now more widely adopted than 'androgenic alopecia' in recognition of the fact that factors other than androgens may contribute to its pathophysiology. Nevertheless, androgen excess remains an important cause of FPHL, and may cause distinct patterns of alopecia, including hair‐loss with frontal accentuation or central expansion of hair‐loss with frontal hairline preservation.

5.1.4 Menstrual History

Although PCOS is the most common cause of androgen excess, other primary causes of hyperandrogenism can also result in menstrual irregularity via PCOS‐independent mechanisms, either because of the underlying disease process (e.g. hypogonadotropic hypogonadism secondary to Cushing's disease) or due to disruption of the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐gonadal (HPG) axis by elevated androgens of any cause. The menstrual cycle history should include age of menarche, frequency of menstrual cycles (oligomenorrhoea, typically defined as average menstrual cycle length > 35 days or fewer than eight cycles per year) and, where relevant, age of menopause and last menstrual bleed.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Endocrine and Urogenital, Female – The most common side effects of androgen therapy are amenorrhea and other menstrual irregularities, inhibition of gonadotropin secretion, and virilization, including deepening of the voice and clitoral enlargement. The latter usually is not reversible after androgens are discontinued. When administered to a pregnant woman, androgens cause virilization of the external genitalia of the female fetus.

Male – Gynecomastia, and excessive frequency and duration of penile erections. Oligospermia may occur at high dosages (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Skin and Appendages – Hirsutism, male pattern baldness, and acne.

Cardiovascular Disorders – myocardial infarction, stroke

Fluid and Electrolyte Disturbances – Retention of sodium, chloride, water, potassium, calcium (see WARNINGS), and inorganic phosphates.

Gastrointestinal – Nausea, cholestatic jaundice, alterations in liver function tests; rarely, hepatocellular neoplasms, peliosis hepatis (see WARNINGS).

Hematologic – Suppression of clotting factors II, V, VII, and X; bleeding in patients on concomitant anticoagulant therapy; polycythemia.

Nervous System – Increased or decreased libido, headache, anxiety, depression, and generalized paresthesia.

Metabolic – Increased serum cholesterol.

Vascular Disorders – venous thromboembolism

Miscellaneous – Rarely, anaphylactoid reactions; inflammation and pain at injection site.

### Pattern hair loss in men: diagnosis and medical treatment [^111Tv1nD]. Dermatologic Clinics (2013). Low credibility.

Androgenetic alopecia is a common cause of hair loss in both men and women. The exact pathogenesis of androgenetic alopecia is not well understood. As the name implies, the role of androgens and genetic susceptibility predisposes to pattern hair loss due to gradual conversion of terminal hair into vellus hair. Male and female pattern hair loss are clinically distinct entities but histologically indistinguishable. The role of sex hormones in females is less understood. This article discusses current understanding of the etiopathogenesis of hair loss in men, diagnostic tests available, and its medical management.

### Dissection of genetic variation and evidence for pleiotropy in male pattern baldness [^113b1THU]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The association between early-onset puberty and hair biology may be reconciled. Androgens regulate hair growth, and simultaneously promote facial hair while causing scalp hair regression in older men. Although the testes are the major source of androgens in males from puberty, the adrenal glands are an important source in both sexes during the earliest detectable stage of sexual maturation: adrenarche. Adrenarche occurs around the age of six, precedes pubarche (pubic hair development), correlates with puberty onset in both sexes, and may initiate puberty via hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis activation. Excess adrenal androgens may induce precocious puberty, manifested in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Both androgen sources converge upon the androgen signalling pathway, in which the X-linked AR gene is central.

Adrenarche may have a short evolutionary history as it only occurs in humans and higher primates, which is consistent with the X-linked AR locus having recently been under selection. Interestingly, mammalian patterned baldness may also have a recent evolutionary history as it is confined to a few primate species. However, the autosomal LDSC partitioned h² SNP analysis found enrichment among conserved regions of the genome (Supplementary Data 12), which may include the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway.

LDHub also showed statistically-significant positive r_g between MPB and bone mineral density (BMD) of lumbar spine (r_g = 0.15, SE = 0.04, P = 3.2e-5) and heel (r_g = 0.07, SE = 0.02, P = 2.0e-4) (Table 1, Supplementary Data 8). Early puberty correlates with increased BMD, suggesting pleiotropy between all three traits. Our downstream analyses also found enrichment for genes in bone and mesenchymal pathways and lineages. Both MPB and BMD are ageing-related traits with predeliction for one sex (osteoporosis is more prevalent in post-menopausal females). Similarly to early-onset puberty, androgen production may underpin both MPB and BMD. This is supported by multiple lines of evidence: androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer decreases BMD, whereas hypogonadal men have low BMD that normalises with testosterone therapy. Further, CAH patients with higher adrenal androgens (such as DHEAS), tend to have higher BMD, as do women with high testosterone levels due to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Interestingly, strontium ranelate (an osteoporosis therapy) induces alopecia in some patients.

### Interventions for female pattern hair loss [^115RdfET]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Female pattern hair loss, or androgenic alopecia, is the most common type of hair loss affecting women. It is characterised by progressive shortening of the duration of the growth phase of the hair with successive hair cycles, and progressive follicular miniaturisation with conversion of terminal to vellus hair follicles (terminal hairs are thicker and longer, while vellus hairs are soft, fine, and short). The frontal hair line may or may not be preserved. Hair loss can have a serious psychological impact on people.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of the available options for the treatment of female pattern hair loss in women.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to October 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), PsycINFO (from 1806), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), PubMed (from 1947), Web of Science (from 1945), and reference lists of articles. We also searched several online trials registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of interventions for female pattern hair loss in women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Twenty two trials, comprising 2349 participants, were included. A wide range of interventions were evaluated, with 10 studies investigating the different concentrations of minoxidil. Pooled data from 4 studies indicated that a greater proportion of participants (121/488) treated with minoxidil reported a moderate increase in their hair regrowth when compared with placebo (64/476) (risk ratio (RR) = 1.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to 2.43). In 7 studies, there was an important increase of 13.28 in total hair count per cm² in the minoxidil group compared to the placebo group (95% CI 10.89 to 15.68). There was no difference in the number of adverse events in the twice daily minoxidil and placebo intervention groups, with the exception of a reported increase of adverse events (additional hair growth on areas other than the scalp) with minoxidil (5%) twice daily. Most of the other comparisons consisted of single studies. These were assessed as high risk of bias: They did not address our prespecified outcomes and provided limited evidence of either the efficacy or safety of these interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

Although more than half of the included studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias, and the rest at unclear, there was evidence to support the effectiveness and safety of topical minoxidil in the treatment of female pattern hair loss. Further direct comparison studies of minoxidil 5% applied once a day, which could improve adherence when compared to minoxidil 2% twice daily, are still required. Consideration should also be given to conducting additional well-designed, adequately-powered randomised controlled trials investigating several of the other treatment options.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to July 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library (2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), PsycINFO (from 1872), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), PubMed (from 1947), and Web of Science (from 1945). We also searched five trial registries and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that assessed the efficacy of interventions for FPHL in women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality, extracted data and carried out analyses.

Main Results

We included 47 trials, with 5290 participants, of which 25 trials were new to this update. Only five trials were at 'low risk of bias', 26 were at 'unclear risk', and 16 were at 'high risk of bias'. The included trials evaluated a wide range of interventions, and 17 studies evaluated minoxidil. Pooled data from six studies indicated that a greater proportion of participants (157/593) treated with minoxidil (2% and one study with 1%) reported a moderate to marked increase in their hair regrowth when compared with placebo (77/555) (risk ratio (RR) = 1.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.51 to 2.47; moderate quality evidence). These results were confirmed by the investigator-rated assessments in seven studies with 1181 participants (RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.68 to 3.28; moderate quality evidence). Only one study reported on quality of life (QoL) (260 participants), albeit inadequately (low quality evidence). There was an important increase of 13.18 in total hair count per cm² in the minoxidil group compared to the placebo group (95% CI 10.92 to 15.44; low quality evidence) in eight studies (1242 participants). There were 40/407 adverse events in the twice daily minoxidil 2% group versus 28/320 in the placebo group (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.87; low quality evidence). There was also no statistically significant difference in adverse events between any of the individual concentrations against placebo. Four studies (1006 participants) evaluated minoxidil 2% versus 5%. In one study, 25/57 participants in the minoxidil 2% group experienced moderate to greatly increased hair regrowth versus 22/56 in the 5% group (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.73). In another study, 209 participants experienced no difference based on a visual analogue scale (P = 0.062; low quality evidence). The assessments of the investigators based on three studies (586 participants) were in agreement with these findings (moderate quality evidence). One study assessed QoL (209 participants) and reported limited data (low quality evidence). Four trials (1006 participants) did not show a difference in number of adverse events between the two concentrations (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.20; low quality evidence). Both concentrations did not show a difference in increase in total hair count at end of study in three trials with 631 participants (mean difference (MD) -2.12, 95% CI -5.47 to 1.23; low quality evidence). Three studies investigated finasteride 1 mg compared to placebo. In the finasteride group 30/67 participants experienced improvement compared to 33/70 in the placebo group (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.37; low quality evidence). This was consistent with the investigators' assessments (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.90; low quality evidence). QoL was not assessed. Only one study addressed adverse events (137 participants) (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.34; low quality evidence). In two studies (219 participants) there was no clinically meaningful difference in change of hair count, whilst one study (12 participants) favoured finasteride (low quality evidence). Two studies (141 participants) evaluated low-level laser comb therapy compared to a sham device. According to the participants, the low-level laser comb was not more effective than the sham device (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.49; and RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.89; moderate quality evidence). However, there was a difference in favour of low-level laser comb for change from baseline in hair count (MD 17.40, 95% CI 9.74 to 25.06; and MD 17.60, 95% CI 11.97 to 23.23; low quality evidence). These studies did not assess QoL and did not report adverse events per treatment arm and only in a generic way (low quality evidence). Low-level laser therapy against sham comparisons in two separate studies also showed an increase in total hair count but with limited further data. Single studies addressed the other comparisons and provided limited evidence of either the efficacy or safety of these interventions, or were unlikely to be examined in future trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Although there was a predominance of included studies at unclear to high risk of bias, there was evidence to support the efficacy and safety of topical minoxidil in the treatment of FPHL (mainly moderate to low quality evidence). Furthermore, there was no difference in effect between the minoxidil 2% and 5% with the quality of evidence rated moderate to low for most outcomes. Finasteride was no more effective than placebo (low quality evidence). There were inconsistent results in the studies that evaluated laser devices (moderate to low quality evidence), but there was an improvement in total hair count measured from baseline. Further randomised controlled trials of other widely-used treatments, such as spironolactone, finasteride (different dosages), dutasteride, cyproterone acetate, and laser-based therapy are needed.

### Evidence-based treatments for female pattern hair loss: a summary of a cochrane systematic review [^116atSaz]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) or androgenic alopecia is the most common type of hair loss affecting women with reduced hair density and can have a serious psychological impact. It is characterized by progressive replacement of slow cycling terminal hair follicles by miniaturized, rapidly cycling vellus hair follicles. The frontal hair line may or may not be preserved. The aim of this review was to assess the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of the treatments available for FPHL. Searches included: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, PsycINFO, LILACS and several ongoing trials registries (October 2011). Randomized controlled trials in women with FPHL were identified. Twenty-two trials, comprising 2349 participants, were included. A range of interventions was evaluated, with 10 studies examining varying concentrations of minoxidil. Pooled data from four studies indicated that a greater proportion of participants treated with minoxidil reported a moderate increase in their hair regrowth compared with placebo (relative risk 1·86, 95% confidence interval 1·42–2·43). There was no difference between the number of adverse events experienced in the twice daily minoxidil and the placebo intervention groups, except for a reported increase with minoxidil 5% twice daily. Single studies accounted for most of the other comparisons, which were assessed as either having high risk of bias and/or they did not address the prespecified outcomes for this review and provided limited evidence of either the effectiveness or safety of these interventions. Further well-designed, adequately powered randomized controlled trials investigating other treatment options are still required.

### Hair transplanting: an important but often forgotten treatment for female pattern hair loss [^114Lo1XM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

The techniques used in the early days of hair transplanting were not suitable for the treatment of a majority of women with pattern hair loss. For at least the last 10 years, changes in those techniques have resulted in a reversal of that situation. Today, many women with female pattern hair loss are suitable candidates for transplanting, however, this is not widely appreciated. This article provides potential explanations for this and demonstrates examples of the current methods. Hair transplanting should be considered as a potential treatment option for most women with pattern hair loss.

### Hair through the female life cycle [^117Rb9Tb]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

At a population level female scalp hair growth shows features of regression with chronological ageing, although there is wide interindividual variation in timing and degree. The subjective assessment of hair loss is classically determined by hair density but it is apparent that other factors contribute to the clinical picture. Changes can occur in hair cycling, hair density, hair diameter and pigmentation, and possibly in structural qualities of the hair fibre. These changes are most pronounced in female pattern hair loss. Although conventionally considered as the female counterpart of male androgenetic alopecia the evidence that female pattern hair loss is androgen dependent is less clear cut than in men and it probably has a multifactorial basis. The emerging evidence implicating environmental factors is of particular interest as, unlike genes, such factors may be amenable to intervention. The clinical signs in women complaining of hair loss may be variable. In evaluating the patient complaining of hair loss, while true pathology must always be considered, the clinician needs to be aware of how age affects hair growth. These changes form the focus of this article.

Clinical hyperandrogenism — evaluation and assessment specify that the presence of hirsutism alone should be considered predictive of biochemical hyperandrogenism and PCOS in adults, while healthcare professionals could recognize that female pattern hair loss and acne in isolation (without hirsutism) are relatively weak predictors of biochemical hyperandrogenism. A comprehensive history and physical examination should be completed for symptoms and signs of clinical hyperandrogenism, and healthcare professionals should be aware of the potential negative psychosocial impact and should consider the reporting of unwanted excess hair growth and/or female pattern hair loss as being important. A modified Ferriman Gallwey score (mFG) of 4–6 should be used to detect hirsutism, and healthcare professionals should consider that the severity of hirsutism may vary by ethnicity but the prevalence appears similar across ethnicities. For clinical scoring, healthcare professionals should be aware that standardized visual scales are preferred when assessing hirsutism and should consider the Ludwig or Olsen visual scales for female pattern hair loss; they should note that only terminal hairs need to be considered in defining hirsutism and these can reach > 5 mm if untreated, and note that new-onset severe or worsening hyperandrogenism requires further investigation and that clinical signs should be monitored for improvement or treatment adjustment during therapy.

### Female pattern hair loss and androgen excess: a report from the multidisciplinary androgen excess and PCOS committee [^114R2EjR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the current state of knowledge and provide evidence-based recommendations that could be valid for all specialists taking care of female pattern hair loss (FPHL), a common form of hair loss in women that is characterized by the reduction of hair density in the central area of the scalp, whereas the frontal hairline is generally well conserved.

Participants

An expert task force appointed by the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society, which included specialists from dermatology, endocrinology, and reproductive endocrinology.

Design

Levels of evidence were assessed and graded from A to D. Peer-reviewed studies evaluating FPHL published through December 2017 were reviewed. Criteria for inclusion/exclusion of the published papers were agreed on by at least two reviewers in each area and arbitrated by a third when necessary.

Conclusions

(i) The term "female pattern hair loss" should be used, avoiding the previous terms of alopecia or androgenetic alopecia. (ii) The two typical patterns of hair loss in FPHL are centrifugal expansion in the mid scalp, and a frontal accentuation or Christmas tree pattern. (iii) Isolated FPHL should not be considered a sign of hyperandrogenism when androgen levels are normal. (iv) The assessment of patients with FPHL is primarily clinical. (v) In all patients with FPHL, assessment of a possible androgen excess is mandatory. Measurement of vitamin D, iron, zinc, thyroid hormones, and prolactin are optional but recommended. (vi) Treatment of FPHL should start with minoxidil (5%), adding 5α-reductase inhibitors or antiandrogens when there is severe hair loss or hyperandrogenism.

### Evaluation of long-term efficacy of finasteride in Korean men with androgenetic alopecia using the basic and specific classification system [^111nSGEY]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common type of baldness, characterized as a patterned, progressive hair loss of the scalp. Traditionally, various classification methods have been proposed to describe the pattern and severity of AGA, including Hamilton, Norwood–Hamilton and Olsen classifications. Recently, Lee et al. 1 devised a new method – the basic and specific (BASP) classification (Fig. 1) – that can describe the variable clinical patterns of AGA. This classification provides a precise description of female pattern hair loss and may be applicable to both male and female patients. 2, 3 The BASP classification was demonstrated to be useful in describing the exact amount and distribution of hair loss in those with patterned hair loss; 1 therefore, it has been utilized in previous studies to investigate the association between the distribution of hair loss and familial factors. 4, 5

Figure 1
The basic and specific classification system (cited from Lee et al.). 1

Finasteride 1 mg is an approved treatment for male AGA patients aged 18–40 years. It selectively inhibits type 2‐selective 5α‐reductase, which converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which is known to be the main pathogenetic factor of AGA. 6, 7 Although finasteride has been used widely to treat male AGA in clinical settings, to the best of our knowledge, its efficacy or safety has not been fully studied in the Korean population to date. Furthermore, there are only a few clinical studies investigating its long‐term (> 5 year) efficacy, 8, 9, 10 and none – to the best of our knowledge – evaluating the treatment outcome using the BASP classification. In this study, we investigated the 5‐year efficacy of finasteride 1 mg in Korean men with AGA using the BASP classification and analyzed the changes in hair growth after finasteride 1 mg treatment according to the distribution of hair loss.

### Antiandrogen therapy for the treatment of female pattern hair loss: a clinical review of current and emerging therapies [^113jh7kq]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Androgenetic alopecia is the most common hair loss type in women, but topical minoxidil is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment option. The pathophysiology involves shortened anagen phases, lengthened telogen phases, and hair follicle miniaturization. Androgens, particularly dihydrotestosterone, play a crucial role in male androgenetic alopecia pathogenesis, but their exact role in female pattern hair loss is unclear. Oral antiandrogens demonstrate some efficacy in women, albeit with considerations for side effects and contraindications. Topical antiandrogens may be used in combination with topical minoxidil or as alternatives to oral medications, likely with fewer systemic adverse effects. Patient-specific factors, including age, signs of hyperandrogenism, or need for contraception may help determine which antiandrogen therapy is most appropriate. This review focuses on current antiandrogen treatments for female pattern hair loss available in the United States and their limitations, as well as emerging treatments that are investigational, studied in other hair loss types, or available in other countries.

### Micropigmentation: camouflaging scalp alopecia and scars in Korean patients [^115wvTRY]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to identify the usefulness of micropigmentation as a technique for alopecia and scalp scar camouflage in Korean patients.

Methods

Micropigmentation was performed in 43 Korean patients from November 2011 to October 2012. There were 23 female patients with female pattern hair loss (FPHL), 14 male patients with male pattern baldness, and 6 patients with scalp scars.

Results

The results for one patient with FPHL Ludwig stage I were satisfactory according to the physician's assessment, but the patient was dissatisfied because she did not notice any remarkable changes after the procedure. The results for the other 42 patients were highly satisfactory and there were no adverse effects or complications.

Conclusions

Micropigmentation appears to be a good method for camouflaging hair loss and scalp scars.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111QEiwz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

2.1 Evidence

The major clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism include hirsutism, acne, and androgenic alopecia. The history of skin problems should assess the age at onset, the rate of progression, previous long-term treatments (including anabolic agents), any change with treatment or with fluctuations in body weight, and the nature of the skin complaint relative to those of other family members. In rare instances, male pattern balding, increased muscle mass, deepening of the voice, or clitoromegaly may occur, suggesting virilizing androgen levels and a possible underlying ovarian or adrenal neoplasm or severe insulin-resistant states (Table 4). Notably, in obese, insulin-resistant women with PCOS, acanthosis nigricans is often present, as are skin tags.

Hirsutism

The prevalence of hirsutism in the general population ranges from 5–15%, with relevant differences according to ethnicity and geographic location. In a large study of patients with clinical hyperandrogenism, 72.1% of 950 patients were diagnosed with PCOS. Therefore, PCOS represents the major cause of hirsutism, but the presence of hirsutism does not fully predict ovulatory dysfunction. Overall, hirsutism is present in approximately 65–75% of patients with PCOS (although lower in Asian populations). Hirsutism may predict the metabolic sequelae of PCOS or failure to conceive with infertility treatment. Hirsutism often tends to be more severe in abdominally obese patients. The most common method of visually assessing hirsutism is still the modified Ferriman-Gallwey score.

The present study demonstrates that that low level laser (light) treatment of the scalp every other day for 16 weeks using the TOPHAT 655 device is a safe and effective treatment for androgenic alopecia in healthy women between the ages of 18–60 with Fitzpatrick Skin Types I–IV and Ludwig–Savin Baldness Scale I-2–II-2 baldness patterns. Subjects receiving LLLT at 655 nm achieved a 37% increase in hair counts as compared to sham treated control patients in this multicenter RCT. These results are similar to those reported in an earlier study using the same device in males with alopecia.

### Approach to the adult female patient with diffuse nonscarring alopecia [^112VaZaR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Alopecias are traditionally categorized by the presence or absence of scarring and by a diffuse or localized pattern. A common clinical conundrum is that of a woman presenting with the chief complaint of diffuse, nonscarring hair loss. We review the 4 main diagnostic possibilities for this clinical scenario: (1) female pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia), (2) acute and chronic telogen effluvium, (3) diffuse alopecia areata, and (4) loose anagen syndrome. We also outline our approach to the individual patient, emphasizing the pertinent history, physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic testing. This approach usually allows the clinician to make a definitive diagnosis or limited differential diagnosis and to offer the patient therapeutic options.

### A PAX1 enhancer locus is associated with susceptibility to idiopathic scoliosis in females [^111pfHZh]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Our investigation of the chromosome 20p11 locus provides the first genetic evidence to explain the puzzling sexual dimorphism that is a hallmark of IS. Besides susceptibility to progression, the pattern, onset and flexibility of deformity also differ between boys and girls. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain male/female differences in IS, including the existence of X-linked genetic risk factors and effects on circulating hormones. Neither mechanism has been clearly supported, although investigations have been limited. Our identification of a female-specific IS susceptibility locus suggests an underlying mechanism that is sensitive to the female milieu at the time of adolescence. Although we did not find evidence for oestrogen receptor-binding sites within the PEC7 enhancer locus itself, it is interesting to postulate that this locus increases risk of IS via downstream hormonal interactions. We note in this regard that the next-nearest gene, FOXA2, is implicated in sexually dimorphic gene expression via cooperation with androgen and oestrogen receptor. It is possible that PEC7 regulates FOXA2. However, we did not detect Foxa2 expression in embryonic or postnatal mouse spine (data not shown) and consider it an unlikely candidate for IS susceptibility. PAX1 is also expressed in the adult scalp. Whether variants in PEC7 affect this expression and drive association with early-onset male pattern baldness requires further study, but the overlapping genetic association suggests a possible correlation between the two sexually dimorphic conditions.

We provide evidence that PAX1 is expressed in paraspinal muscles, and to a lesser extent in spinal cord, at time points well after the initial patterning of the axial skeleton has been completed. This suggests a later developmental role for PAX1, possibly in the growth or maintenance of these tissues. It is interesting that other IS risk loci identified by GWAS occur in non-coding regions near or within genes involved in muscle and nerve biogenesis. In this regard, we expect that the functional fine-mapping method applied in the present study should prove fruitful for identifying the alleles and functional elements driving association at other IS risk loci. Our results also imply that additional sex-specific genetic loci may await discovery, and draw attention to the need to consider males and females in separate liability classes.

In a combined analysis of the two studies on vertex baldness, mean hair count changes from baseline were 91 vs -19 hairs (PROPECIA vs placebo) among Caucasians (n = 1185), 49 vs -27 hairs among Blacks (n = 84), 53 vs -38 hairs among Asians (n = 17), 67 vs 5 hairs among Hispanics (n = 45) and 67 vs -15 hairs among other ethnic groups (n = 20). Patient self-assessment showed improvement across racial groups with PROPECIA treatment, except for satisfaction of the frontal hairline and vertex in Black men, who were satisfied overall.

14.2	Study in Women

In a study involving 137 postmenopausal women with androgenetic alopecia who were treated with PROPECIA (n = 67) or placebo (n = 70) for 12 months, effectiveness could not be demonstrated. There was no improvement in hair counts, patient self-assessment, investigator assessment, or ratings of standardized photographs in the women treated with PROPECIA when compared with the placebo group [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) anti-androgens — clinical use, contraception, and safety considerations are as follows: In combination with effective contraception, anti-androgens could be considered to treat hirsutism in women with PCOS if there is a suboptimal response after a minimum of six months of COCP and/or cosmetic therapy; given the negative psychological impact of female pattern hair loss, anti-androgens in combination with COCP could be trialed, acknowledging the lack of evidence in the PCOS population; whenever pregnancy is possible, healthcare professionals must educate and counsel women and adolescents, parents/or guardian/s, regarding the risks of incomplete development of external genital structures of male fetuses when anti-androgens are used and, to prevent this, women who can get pregnant should be strongly counselled to use effective contraception (e.g., intrauterine device or COCPs); anti-androgens could be considered to treat hirsutism in the presence of another effective form of contraception for women with contraindications for COCP therapy or when COCPs are poorly tolerated; when prescribing anti-androgens, healthcare professionals should consider that spironolactone at 25–100mg / day appears to have lower risks of adverse effects, cyproterone acetate at doses ≥ 10mg is not advised due to an increased risk including for meningioma, finasteride has an increased risk of liver toxicity, flutamide and bicalutamide have an increased risk of severe liver toxicity, and the relatively limited evidence on anti-androgens in PCOS needs to be appreciated with small numbers of studies and limited numbers of participants.

### The growth of human scalp hair in females using visible red light laser and LED sources [^116cPCU9]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

There is a growing body of evidence that the use of LLLT for the purpose of promoting hair growth is both safe and effective in both men and women. The optimal wavelengths and treatment parameters for treatment of alopecia remain indeterminate at this time. There is a need to conduct further studies in order to determine the potential role for near infrared and/or combinations of wavelengths as well as to investigate the effects of parameters such as coherence, pulsing and treatment frequency on clinical outcomes. The present study was not designed to investigate alternative treatment regimes or parameters. It was designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a particular device designed for home use with specific parameters on the treatment of women with androgenetic alopecia.

We have demonstrated that the use of low level laser therapy at 655 nm applied to the scalp every other day for 16 weeks (60 treatments) via the TOPHAT 655 device resulted in a significant improvement in women who used the device. There was a 37% increase in terminal hair counts in the active treatment group as compared to the control (sham) group (P < 0.001) in 18–60 year old female subjects with I-2, I-3, I-4, II-1, or II-2 Ludwig–Savin baldness patterns and Fitzpatrick I–IV Skin Types. These results mirror those of the previously reported male trial which demonstrated a 35% increase in males with Hamilton–Norwood IIa-V baldness patterns and Type I–IV Fitzpatrick Skin Types.

Similarly, the female subjects were able to conduct the treatments at home and were able to apply and use the device as directed without any side effects or adverse events being reported at any time during the conduct of the study. This indicates that the device is safe for the unsupervised environment of home use and that the therapy is easily managed by both men and women using this device.

### How real is senescent alopecia? A histopathologic approach [^111vCbLA]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Senescent alopecia was originally thought to affect people aged 50 years or older with no family history or evidence of pattern balding. It was described as a diffuse thinning involving the whole scalp due to a steady decrease in thick terminal hairs, but without evidence of increased miniaturization. Senescent alopecia is not a primary diagnosis in this clinic. Most possible examples of it are assumed to be androgenetic or diffuse alopecia. In the study reported here, horizontal sections of 2149 scalp specimens from individuals with male and female pattern and diffuse alopecia, as well as from normal controls, were examined, and their follicular counts were recorded and sorted into decades. The decade of 20 to 29 years contained a significant number of patients and was used for baseline follicular counts for comparison with all succeeding decades up to age 99 years. A reduction of 15% below baseline was considered significant. In 10.6% of patients with male pattern alopecia, the age of onset of a significant reduction in follicular counts was 50 years; in 5.7% of patients with female pattern alopecia it was 70 years, and in 2.0% of patients with diffuse alopecia it was 80 years. These data suggest that most cases of significant hair loss in the elderly are androgen driven. The few patients with deteriorating diffuse alopecia may be the exception. The study concluded that old age is not a significant cause of hair loss.

### Improvement in scalp hair growth in androgen-deficient women treated with testosterone: a questionnaire study [^117PwVzT]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Thinning of hair is a common complaint in women. Its frequency in the female population increases with age. Two studies in caucasian women in the U.K. and U.S. A. reported prevalence rates of reduced hair density of 3–6% in women aged under 30 years, increasing to 29–42% in women aged ≥ 70 years. Although diverse pathologies can cause hair thinning, the most common diagnostic category is female pattern hair loss (FPHL). This typically presents as a diffuse reduction in hair density affecting the mid and frontal regions of the scalp with preservation of the frontal hairline. Although the distribution of hair loss in women is usually different from that seen in male balding (male androgenetic alopecia), the histopathological and dynamic changes in hair growth are similar, and FPHL has long been regarded as the female counterpart of male balding, giving rise to the term 'female androgenetic alopecia'. Male balding is undoubtedly an androgen-dependent genetically determined trait. Observations in men with a genetic deficiency of 5α-reductase type 2 suggest that the active androgen in male balding is dihydrotestosterone (DHT) rather than testosterone. These men have ambiguous genitalia with normal or high levels of circulating testosterone but low DHT. They do not go bald and have sparse or absent beard growth. The importance of DHT in male balding has been confirmed by the positive response to treatment in clinical trials of 5α-reductase inhibitors.

It is widely believed that androgens also have an adverse effect on scalp hair growth in women, and the idea that FPHL is an androgen-dependent trait remains prevalent. However, in our clinical experience (R.G.), treating more than 1100 female patients with over 10 000 subcutaneous testosterone pellet insertions, hair thinning has rarely been reported. In this institutional review board (IRB)-approved study, pre- and postmenopausal patients were treated with testosterone implants for symptoms of 'relative androgen deficiency' including: a diminished sense of well-being, dysphoric mood (sadness, depression, anxiety, irritability), fatigue, decreased libido, hot flushes, bone loss, decreased muscle strength, changes in cognition and memory, and insomnia. As part of a follow-up questionnaire aimed at assessing clinical response to therapy, patients were asked about their experience of hair loss before and after testosterone treatment.

Gender dysphoria/gender incongruence — pubertal suppression timing and reversibility: We therefore advise starting suppression in early puberty to prevent the irreversible development of undesirable secondary sex characteristics, and Thus, Tanner stage 2 is the optimal time to start pubertal suppression. Early puberty suppression will limit the growth of the penis and scrotum with a potential effect on future surgical treatments; suppression can also be used in later pubertal stages to stop menses in transgender males and prevent facial hair growth in transgender females, but physical sex characteristics such as more advanced breast development in transgender boys and lowering of the voice and outgrowth of the jaw and brow in transgender girls are not reversible. Clinicians can use pubertal LH and sex steroid levels to confirm sufficient progression before starting suppression, noting that reference ranges for sex steroids by Tanner stage may vary depending on the assay used and that ultrasensitive sex steroid and gonadotropin assays will help clinicians document early pubertal changes. Irreversible and, for GD/gender-incongruent adolescents, undesirable characteristics listed include female breasts and female body habitus (and in some cases relative short stature) and, in male puberty, a prominent Adam's apple, low voice, male bone configuration such as a large jaw, big feet and hands, tall stature, and male hair pattern on the face and extremities.

### Women who present with female pattern hair loss tend to underestimate the severity of their hair loss [^116As4f9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is the preferred term for androgenetic alopecia in women. FPHL can be a source of considerable distress for affected women. Our hypothesis was that women with FPHL who seek treatment would rate their condition as more severe than would their treating doctors.

Objectives

To identify discrepancies between the severity ratings of the women and their clinicians.

Methods

Participants were 30 women receiving treatment for biopsy-proven FPHL and 44 women on a waiting list to receive treatment for FPHL. Each woman completed a self-report photographic measure of severity of hair loss, specifically developed for the current study.

Results

Although no difference was found between the severity ratings of women receiving treatment and their clinicians, it was found that women in the waiting list group underestimated the severity of their hair loss compared with their clinicians' ratings.

Conclusion

The results indicate that FPHL-affected women who seek treatment for FPHL do not overestimate the severity of the hair loss; in fact, they tend to underestimate. The present findings have implications for the treatment of FPHL.

Hair disorders after menopause

Female pattern hair loss

Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) or androgenetic alopecia presents with thinning over the frontovertical scalp with preservation of the frontal hairline. It can be seen from early adulthood but commonly presents in menopause. The role of androgens and treatment options in male pattern alopecia are well researched; however, the role of oestrogen and androgens in FPHL is less clear. Although FPHL can be seen in hyperandrogenism, the vast majority of patients will have normal androgen levels and a reduction in oestrogen is thought to be implicated. Early‐onset and late‐onset FPHL are considered distinct conditions, with genetic factors thought to be important in both.

The differential diagnoses of FPHL include chronic telogen effluvium and diffuse alopecia areata. Unless hair loss is severe or is of rapid onset, investigations are usually not required. However, free testosterone and prolactin levels are sometimes warranted if other signs of androgen excess, such as hirsutism, severe acne vulgaris and/or irregular menses are also present.

Management options are listed in Table 2. There is insufficient evidence to support the role of HRT therapy in FPHL.

Table 2
Treatment options in female pattern hair loss.,

The entity of senile alopecia is often considered to be on a spectrum of FPHL. Reduced hair density and weakening of the hair shaft are considered key in the diagnosis. The aetiology of both FPHL and senile alopecia is multifactoral and with limited evidence available on treatment options. The impact of the menopause and the effect of HRT need further investigation.

Some hair‐care practices are known to damage the hair shaft, and include treatments such as flat irons and colouring, used by women of all ages. With age, the hair shaft can become more fragile and less able to withstand various hair care practices, leading to damaged and broken hair.

2. Although this condition is less common in women, 38% of women older than 70 years may be affected
3. Many patients with androgenetic alopecia have a family history of this condition. Hair thinning occurs in a sex-specific pattern. Men typically present with bitemporal thinning, thinning of the frontal and vertex scalp, or complete hair loss with residual hair at the occiput and temporal fringes. 5 Women typically present with diffuse hair thinning of the vertex with sparing of the frontal hairline. Some women experience thinning over the lateral scalp. Common conditions that mimic androgenetic alopecia include thyroid disease, iron deficiency anemia, and malnutrition. Treatment is based on patient preference. Topical minoxidil is approved for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia in men. Hair regrowth is more robust at the vertex than in the frontal area, and will take six to 12 months to improve.

Hair loss in alopecia areata occurs in three different patterns: patchy alopecia is circumscribed, oval-shaped, flesh-colored patches on any part of the body; alopecia totalis involves the entire scalp; and alopecia universalis involves the whole body. Evaluation of the scalp may reveal short vellus hairs, yellow or black dots, and broken hair shafts. Microscopic examination of the hair follicles demonstrates exclamation mark hair. Trichotillomania may be difficult to diagnose if the patient is not forthcoming about pulling at his or her hair. Patients typically present with frontoparietal patches of alopecia that progress posteriorly and may include the eyelashes and eyebrows. Bare patches are typical, and the hair may appear uneven, with twisted or broken off hairs. Trichotillomania may lead to problems with self-esteem and social avoidance. Complications include infection, skin damage, and permanent scarring.

### Finasteride treatment of female pattern hair loss… [^116m3vu8]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Female pattern hair loss, the most common form of hair loss, affects up to 50% of women during their life. 1 Although hair thinning in women with FPHL may be diffuse, 3 different clinical patterns have been described: the Christmas tree pattern, 2 the Ludwig pattern, 3 and the Hamilton pattern. 4 Patients who experience hair thinning complain of social anxiety and embarrassment. If left untreated, FPHL may be rapidly progressive. In a recent study, 10 treatment with oral antiandrogens produced hair regrowth in 35 of 80 women with FPHL. This study showed no relationship between response to treatment and patient age, menopausal status, and serum hormone levels. A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study16 of finasteride, 1 mg/d, in postmenopausal women with FPHL showed negative results in increasing hair growth and slowing the progression of hair thinning.

After 12 months of treatment, patients in the finasteride and placebo groups had a modest decrease in hair count from baseline. Recently, noncontrolled studies12, 17–19 indicated that finasteride therapy can be effective in premenopausal and postmenopausal women with and without signs of hyperandrogenism. Camacho12 reported hair regrowth using finasteride, 2. 5 mg/d, in 41 women with FPHL and SAHA syndrome. Thai and Sinclair17 administered finasteride at a dosage of 5 mg/wk to a 67-year-old postmenopausal woman without signs of hyperandrogenism and with Ludwig FPHL. After 12 months of treatment the patient showed a significant increase in hair density. Shum et al18 administered finasteride to 4 women with hyperandrogenism at a dosage of 1. 25 mg/d. The efficacy of finasteride in postmenopausal normoandrogenic women with FPHL was reported by Trueb19 as early as after 6 months of treatment. Finasteride was administered at 2.

5 mg/d in 4 women, 1 with the Christmas tree pattern and 3 with the Ludwig pattern, and finasteride, 5 mg/d, in 1 woman with the Hamilton pattern.

### Alopecia in women… [^113Uvqpv]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Although alopecia can occur anywhere on the body, it is most distressing when it affects the scalp. Hair loss can range from a small bare patch that is easily masked by hairstyling to a more diffuse and obvious pattern. Alopecia in women has been found to have significantly deleterious effects on self-esteem, psychologic well-being, and body image. 1, 2. Diagnosis A careful history often suggests the underlying cause of alopecia. Crucial factors include the duration and pattern of hair loss, whether the hair is broken or shed at the roots, and whether shedding or thinning has increased. The patient's diet, medications, present and past medical conditions, and family history of alopecia are other important factors. Hair follicles contain androgen receptors. In the presence of androgens, genes that shorten the anagen phase are activated, and hair follicles shrink or become miniaturized.

With successive anagen cycles, the follicles become smaller, and nonpigmented vellus hairs replace pigmented terminal hairs. In women, the thinning is diffuse, but more marked in the frontal and parietal regions. Even persons with severe androgenetic alopecia almost always have a thin fringe of hair frontally. The remaining hair configuration may resemble a monk's haircut. 6 Most women with androgenetic alopecia have normal menses, normal fertility, and normal endocrine function, including gender-appropriate levels of circulating androgens. Therefore, an extensive hormonal work-up is unnecessary. If a woman has irregular menses, abrupt hair loss, hirsutism, or acne recurrence, an endocrine evaluation is appropriate. In this situation, total testosterone, free testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and prolactin levels should be obtained.

6 Because the hair loss in androgenetic alopecia is an aberration of the normal hair cycle, it is theoretically reversible. Advanced androgenetic alopecia, however, may not respond to treatment, because the inflammation that surrounds the bulge area of the follicle may irreparably damage the follicular stem cell. Unless alopecia areata is mild and easily masked, psychologic distress can be extreme. Therefore, most physicians feel obliged to offer some form of treatment to affected patients. Treatment is based on identifying and treating or correcting the underlying cause of telogen effluvium. It can be reassuring for women to understand the relationship of their hair loss to a specific event or agent, and to know that hair regrowth is probable.
