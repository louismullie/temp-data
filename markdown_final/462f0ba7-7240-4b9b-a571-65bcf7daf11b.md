## Question

use of octreotide in peptic ulcer bleed

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether octreotide has a role in peptic ulcer bleeding and, if so, how to use it clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing peptic ulcer bleeding from variceal bleeding because the indications for octreotide differ. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology to see if there is a plausible mechanism for octreotide in peptic ulcer bleeding. Next, I will review direct clinical evidence for octreotide in peptic ulcer bleeding. After that, I need to check contemporary guideline recommendations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, evidence-based recommendation and dosing plan, and consider exceptions and alternatives if octreotide is not indicated.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions so I don't conflate entities. Peptic ulcer bleeding is a non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleed from gastroduodenal ulcers, whereas variceal bleeding arises from portal hypertension and requires vasoactive therapy; octreotide is firmly established for variceal bleeding but not for peptic ulcer bleeding, and I need to ensure I'm not mixing these scenarios [^111PEAPB] [^114evqZF].

> Now, I will examine the pathophysiology to see if there is a mechanistic rationale for octreotide in peptic ulcer bleeding. Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, reduces splanchnic blood flow and portal pressure and inhibits gastric acid and pepsin secretion; theoretically, reduced mucosal perfusion and protease activity could stabilize clots in ulcers, but wait, let me verify whether this translates clinically in non-variceal bleeding, because the hemodynamic driver of peptic ulcer bleeding is arterial or oozing from the ulcer base rather than portal hypertensive flow, which limits the relevance of splanchnic vasoconstriction here [^11722TwR] [^114FARRG].

> Next, I should review direct clinical evidence in peptic ulcer bleeding. A randomized trial of 110 patients with active peptic ulcer bleeding or visible vessel found no significant benefit from octreotide as adjunct to endoscopic therapy: rebleeding 32% with octreotide vs 36% with placebo, surgery 29% vs 32.7%, mortality 7.2% vs 3.6%, and no differences in transfusion or length of stay; hold on, I should double-check that these endpoints were indeed non-significant, which they were, indicating no clinical benefit [^113DLdWi]. A retrospective cohort comparing octreotide plus PPI versus PPI alone likewise showed no improvement in length of stay, rebleeding, or mortality after propensity adjustment, reinforcing the lack of benefit signal [^115BaWxM].

> I need to check guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. Contemporary high-quality guidelines consistently do not recommend octreotide for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, including peptic ulcer bleeding; the ACG guideline advises against its use in NVUGIB, and ESGE similarly restricts vasoactive agents to suspected variceal bleeding, not peptic ulcer bleeding, so I should not over-extrapolate from variceal data to peptic ulcers [^114evqZF] [^111PEAPB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm what the standard of care is for peptic ulcer bleeding so I can provide a complete recommendation. The cornerstone is early risk stratification, hemodynamic resuscitation, and urgent endoscopy with hemostasis for high-risk stigmata, followed by high-dose PPI therapy to reduce rebleeding; routine second-look endoscopy is not advised unless there is clinical evidence of rebleeding, and escalation to angiographic embolization or surgery is reserved for refractory cases, which is where efforts should focus rather than adding octreotide [^115Wex3M] [^116G2nhk] [^115XebaE] [^111exPuS].

> But wait, what if the bleed is actually variceal or the etiology is uncertain at presentation? I should double-check that in suspected variceal bleeding, vasoactive therapy with octreotide is indicated early, typically 50 mcg IV bolus followed by 50 mcg/h infusion for 2–5 days, alongside antibiotics and timely endoscopy; this is a different pathophysiologic problem and does not justify octreotide use once peptic ulcer bleeding is confirmed [^115i7KMC] [^111PEAPB] [^113iPPqj].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing an edge case. For confirmed peptic ulcer bleeding, octreotide should not be used; there is no proven benefit and guidelines do not recommend it. For suspected or confirmed variceal bleeding, octreotide is appropriate and should be started promptly with guideline-concordant dosing and duration, recognizing that this indication does not extend to peptic ulcer bleeding once the source is identified [^113DLdWi] [^115BaWxM] [^114evqZF] [^115i7KMC].

> Final recommendation: Do not use octreotide for peptic ulcer bleeding; prioritize early endoscopic hemostasis and high-dose PPI therapy, and reserve escalation for rebleeding or failure of endoscopic therapy. If variceal bleeding is suspected or confirmed, initiate octreotide with a 50 mcg IV bolus followed by 50 mcg/h continuous infusion for 2–5 days in conjunction with antibiotics and urgent endoscopy, then discontinue the vasoactive agent once hemostasis is secure and the clinical course is stable [^116G2nhk] [^115XebaE] [^115i7KMC] [^111PEAPB].

---

Octreotide is **not recommended** for peptic ulcer bleeding because it does not reduce rebleeding, transfusion needs, or mortality in non-variceal upper GI bleeding [^113DLdWi] [^115BaWxM]. Its role is limited to variceal bleeding, where it lowers portal pressure and improves hemostasis [^115VdJCX] [^115gkiZN]. The standard of care for peptic ulcer bleeding is **high-dose PPI therapy** [^115XebaE] and endoscopic hemostasis [^116G2nhk]; octreotide should not be used as adjunct therapy in this setting [^114evqZF].

---

## Pharmacological rationale and proposed mechanisms

Octreotide is a somatostatin analog that **reduces splanchnic blood flow** and portal pressure, and inhibits gastric acid and pepsin secretion [^11722TwR]. These effects are beneficial in variceal bleeding but are not relevant to peptic ulcer bleeding, which is driven by arterial or oozing bleeding from the ulcer base rather than portal hypertensive flow [^114evqZF].

---

## Clinical evidence in peptic ulcer bleeding

Randomized and observational studies show **no benefit** of octreotide in peptic ulcer bleeding:

- **RCT of 110 patients**: octreotide vs placebo after endoscopic hemostasis showed no significant differences in rebleeding (32% vs 36%), surgery (29% vs 32.7%), mortality (7.2% vs 3.6%), transfusion needs, or hospital stay [^113DLdWi].
- **Retrospective cohort (180 patients)**: octreotide plus PPI vs PPI alone showed no differences in hospital/ICU stay, rebleeding, or mortality [^115BaWxM].
- **Meta-analyses**: no significant benefit of octreotide in non-variceal UGIB, including peptic ulcer bleeding.

---

## Comparison with standard therapies

The **standard of care** for peptic ulcer bleeding is high-dose PPI therapy and endoscopic hemostasis, which reduce rebleeding, surgery, and mortality [^115XebaE] [^116G2nhk]. Octreotide does not improve outcomes when added to these therapies and is not recommended by guidelines [^114evqZF].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Octreotide is generally well tolerated, but **adverse effects** include gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain), injection-site reactions, and rare effects such as bradycardia, gallstones, and pancreatitis. These risks are unjustified given the lack of benefit in peptic ulcer bleeding.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Major guidelines **do not recommend** octreotide for peptic ulcer bleeding:

- **ACG 2021**: recommends high-dose PPI therapy and endoscopic hemostasis; octreotide is not mentioned for peptic ulcer bleeding [^115XebaE] [^116G2nhk].
- **ESGE 2022**: octreotide is recommended only for variceal bleeding, not for non-variceal UGIB [^111PEAPB].
- **WSES 2020**: emphasizes PPIs and endoscopic therapy; octreotide is not recommended for peptic ulcer bleeding [^112Nsi5N] [^114RLBW3].

---

## Clinical scenarios where octreotide may be considered

Octreotide may be considered only when **variceal bleeding is suspected** or confirmed, as it reduces portal pressure and improves hemostasis [^111PEAPB] [^113iPPqj]. It is not indicated for confirmed peptic ulcer bleeding.

---

## Cost-effectiveness considerations

Octreotide is more expensive than PPIs and adds no clinical benefit in peptic ulcer bleeding, making it **cost-ineffective** in this context.

---

Octreotide is **not recommended** for peptic ulcer bleeding due to lack of efficacy; the standard care remains high-dose PPI therapy and endoscopic hemostasis [^115XebaE] [^116G2nhk].

### Somatostatin and its analogues in peptic ulcer bleeding: facts and pathophysiological aspects [^11722TwR]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Peptic ulcer bleeding remains a common medical emergency and despite recent advances in management is still associated with high mortality. Endoscopic treatment remains the cornerstone for the effective management of high-risk patients. Recent evidence suggests that potent antisecretory drugs that inhibit gastric acid secretion, such as proton pump inhibitors, may be of help alone or in combination with endotherapy in the management of peptic ulcer bleeding. Somatostatin appears to offer a distinct advantage over antisecretory drugs, as it inhibits both acid and pepsin secretion and combines these effects with a reduction in gastroduodenal mucosal blood flow which seems to be important in the pathophysiology of peptic ulcer bleeding. Additionally, the inhibition of pepsin secretion might induce a decreased proteolytic activity preventing the dissolution of freshly formed clots at the site of bleeding. Despite its theoretical advantages, there has been very little evidence in the recent past in setting of randomised, controlled, clinical trials. In reviewing the available data, we found that the efficacy of somatostatin and its analogue octreotide are different in the control of peptic ulcer bleeding and this might be due to the different distribution of its receptors through the GI tract. Further studies are needed to define the exact role, if any, of somatostatin and its analogues, in high-risk patients with peptic ulcer bleeding and this might be a rather interesting area for future research.

### Pro / con debate: octreotide has an important role in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin? [^1167PeBM]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Whether it is the primary reason for admission or a complication of critical illness, upper gastrointestinal bleeding is commonly encountered in the intensive care unit. In this setting, in the absence of endoscopy, intensivists generally provide supportive care (transfusion of blood products) and acid suppression (such as proton pump inhibitors). More recently, octreotide (a somatostatin analogue) has been used in such patients. However, its precise role in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding is not necessarily clear and the drug is associated with significant costs. In this issue of Critical Care, two expert teams debate the merits of using octreotide in non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Current therapy for nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^112eZQmi]. Surgical Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding continues to plague physicians despite the discovery of Helicobacter pylori and advances in medical therapy for peptic ulcer disease. Medical therapy with new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and somatostatin/octreotide and intravenous proton pump inhibitors provides hope for reducing the incidence of and treating bleeding peptic ulcer disease. Endoscopic therapy remains the mainstay for diagnosis and treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Many methods of endoscopic hemostasis have proven useful in upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Currently, combination therapy with epinephrine injection and bicap or heater probe therapy is most commonly employed in the United States. Angiography and embolization play a role primarily when endoscopic therapy is unsuccessful.

### Initial assessment and management of patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^114VZvT6]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a substantial clinical and economic burden, with an estimated mortality rate between 3% and 15%. The initial management starts with hemodynamic assessment and resuscitation. Blood transfusions may be needed in patients with low hemoglobin levels or massive bleeding, and patients who are anticoagulated may require administration of fresh frozen plasma. Patients with significant bleeding should be started on a proton-pump inhibitor infusion, and if there is concern for variceal bleeding, an octreotide infusion. Patients with UGIB should be stratified into low-risk and high-risk categories using validated risk scores. The use of these risk scores can aid in separating low-risk patients who are suitable for outpatient management or early discharge following endoscopy from patients who are at increased risk for needing endoscopic intervention, rebleeding, and death. Upper endoscopy after adequate resuscitation is required for most patients and should be performed within 24 hours of presentation. Key to improving outcomes is appropriate initial management of patients presenting with UGIB.

### The effect of octreotide as an adjunct treatment in active nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^113DLdWi]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Goals

The aim of this study was to determine the effect ofoctreotide on active or recent gastrointestinal bleeding from benign peptic ulcers.

Study

This is a prospective, randomized study including 110 patients with gastric or duodenal peptic ulcers presenting with active spurting or oozing bleeding or nonbleeding visible vessel. All patients were subjected to endoscopic hemostasis by injection of noradrenaline, and they were then randomized to either receive octreotide (55 patients) or placebo (55 patients). The groups did not differ with respect to age, sex, use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, previous history of ulcer or bleeding, Helicobacter pylori infection, site, and severity of bleeding.

Results

The rebleeding rate was 36% in placebo and 32% in octreotide group, which does not present a statistically significant difference. Surgical intervention was required for 18 patients (32.7%) in the placebo group and for 16 patients (29%) in the octreotide group. The mortality rate was 2 patients (3.6%) in the placebo and 4 patients (7.2%) in the octreotide group. All the above presented no statistical difference. In addition, there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to the number of blood units transfused and hospital stay.

Conclusions

The use of octreotide as an adjunct treatment in patients with acutely bleeding benign peptic ulcer or/and visible vessel did not seem to offer significant benefits regarding their outcome.

### Octreotide added to a proton pump inhibitor versus a proton pump inhibitor alone in nonvariceal upper-gastrointestinal bleeds [^115BaWxM]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: Literature indicating clinically relevant benefits of an adjunctive somatostatin analog to standard therapies in nonvariceal upper-gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) is lacking. Objective: The primary objective of this study was to find the association between outcomes in patients with NVUGIB treated with octreotide and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI; combination group) compared with those treated with a PPI alone. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults admitted within a 5-hospital health care system with a NVUGIB treated with a PPI continuous infusion with or without an octreotide infusion. Notable exclusion criteria included varices, history of cirrhosis without endoscopy, or active gastrointestinal cancer. The primary outcome was association of combination treatment versus PPI alone with hospital length of stay (LOS). Results: A total of 180 patients were included (combination group: n = 90; PPI: n = 90). In univariate analyses, the median hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) LOS in the combination group versus PPI was 6.1 versus 4.9 days (P = 0.25) and 2.3 versus 1.9 days (P = 0.24), and rebleeding and mortality occurred in 9% versus 12% (P = 0.63) and 6.7% versus 5.6% (P = 1.00) of patients. Median units of packed red blood cells in the combination therapy versus PPI group was 3 vs 2 units (P = 0.43). After propensity score adjustment in multivariable analyses, hospital and ICU LOS, rebleeding, and mortality all remained nonsignificant. Conclusion and Relevance: Our study observed no difference in clinical end points. This suggests that octreotide provides no additional major clinical benefit in NVUGIB, and PPI therapy alone may be sufficient.

### Current management of peptic ulcer bleeding [^112hoFXm]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Peptic ulcer bleeding is a common and potentially fatal condition. It is best managed using a multidisciplinary approach by a team with medical, endoscopic and surgical expertise. The management of peptic ulcer bleeding has been revolutionized in the past two decades with the advent of effective endoscopic hemostasis and potent acid-suppressing agents. A prompt initial clinical and endoscopic assessment should allow patients to be triaged effectively into those who require active therapy, versus those who require monitoring and preventative therapy. A combination of pharmacologic and endoscopic therapy (using a combination of injection and thermal coagulation) offers the best chance of hemostasis for those with active bleeding ulcers. Surgery, being the most effective way to control bleeding, should be considered for treatment failures. The choice between surgery and repeat endoscopic therapy should be based on the pre-existing comorbidities of the patient and the characteristics of the ulcer.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^113iPPqj]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for variceal hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to vasoactive agents, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to administer vasoactive drugs as soon as acute variceal bleeding is suspected and before endoscopy. Administer terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide as accepted options. Administer therapy for 3–5 days in patients with acute variceal bleeding.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of bleeding gastric varices: expert review [^112TBySt]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Table 2 — evidenced-based algorithm for initial management of suspected portal hypertensive bleeding specifies to ensure adequate vascular access with 2 large-bore peripheral intravenous cannulae or central venous access and provide fluid resuscitation with colloid or crystalloid, and to assess airway protection with tracheal intubation advised for active hematemesis, inability to maintain or protect airway, and to enable optimal sedation for endoscopic therapy. Vasoactive therapy includes octreotide initial intravenous bolus of 50 μg (can be repeated in first hour if ongoing bleeding) followed by continuous intravenous infusion of octreotide 50 μg/h for 2–5 d (may stop after definitive hemostasis achieved), and somatostatin analogs inhibit gastric acid secretion so co-administration of proton pump inhibitor is not required. Antibiotic prophylaxis is emphasized, with intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g/24 h (maximal duration 7 d) since prophylactic antibiotics reduce infections, rebleeding, and mortality. A restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy is outlined: transfuse at Hgb threshold of 7 g/dL and goal maintenance Hgb of 7–9 g/dL, with restrictive transfusion associated with favorable effect on hepatic venous pressure gradient, decreased mortality, and decreased rate for early rebleeding; avoid overuse of blood products in cirrhosis given risks including precipitation of portal venous thrombosis. Urgent endoscopic assessment for source control should follow stabilization, within 12 h of presentation, and consider erythromycin before emergency endoscopy (250 mg intravenous, 30–120 min before) to optimize visualization with QT interval check; patients with acute variceal hemorrhage should be managed within the intensive care unit or other well-monitored units given mortality risk and care complexity.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: expert review [^114evqZF]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Initial management — pre-endoscopic pharmacologic adjuncts and nasogastric tube use for suspected NVUGIB emphasize that erythromycin or metoclopramide may be given intravenously before endoscopy to improve visualization, with data favoring erythromycin, but both should be used cautiously in patients with prolonged QT intervals. Use of octreotide is not recommended in NVUGIB, and prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated. The use of nasogastric tubes is controversial because use does not impact clinical outcomes; lavage can assist blood removal and suggests emergent endoscopy if continuous and copious bright red blood returns, but a negative lavage should not delay endoscopy, particularly if other parameters suggest active NVUGIB.

Consider administering octreotide if terlipressin or somatostatin is unavailable.

Gastrointestinal bleeding

How should gastrointestinal bleeding be managed in patients with DC in the ICU?

Recommendation

Patients with DC with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) should receive ceftriaxone and a vasoactive agent (vasopressin, somatostatin, or octreotide). Ventilated patients with upper GIB (UGIB) should receive a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Viscoelastic testing (VET) can guide use of VTE prophylaxis. Transfusion should be performed with goal hemoglobin (Hb) of 7–8 g/dL (70–80 g/L). Endoscopy should be performed within 12 hours and TIPS should be considered for recurrent or persistent variceal bleeding.

Discussion

Variceal hemorrhage is one of several disease-defining clinical features of DC. In the critically ill trauma or surgical patient presenting to the hospital for a separate indication, DC due to GIB results in a compounding of morbidity and mortality. The most common etiology of GIB in DC is portal hypertension, and spontaneously resolves in only 50% of cases. Failure of combination pharmacological therapy and endoscopy may occur in up to 20%, requiring advanced methods of hemostasis.

Ceftriaxone (1 g intravenous daily) reduces infectious complications, re-bleeding, and mortality in patients with UGIB, regardless of whether it is variceal or non-variceal. The duration of treatment is 7 days but discontinuation can be considered once hemorrhage has resolved and vasoactive drugs have been discontinued.

Mechanically ventilated patients receiving PPI rather than H 2 receptor blockade for prophylaxis experience fewer episodes of clinically important UGIB. Although this effect has not been specifically evaluated for prevention of variceal UGIB, both the American College of Gastroenterology and the European Association for the Study of the Liver recommend PPI for patients with cirrhosis requiring mechanical ventilation and suggest a possible benefit of PPI in reducing ulceration size following endoscopic band ligation. If not already initiated as prophylaxis, PPI therapy should be started to reduce recurrence for non-variceal GIB. While chemical VTE prophylaxis has not been shown to provoke GIB, patients with DC with recent GIB may be poor candidates for this, particularly in the setting of thrombocytopenia (< 50×10⁹/L). However, the coagulation profile of patients with DC as a predictor of bleeding risk is poorly understood and potentially better evaluated by VET over traditional assays. In blood product administration, there is no known benefit to achieving a higher Hb through transfusion in patients with DC as compared with balanced resuscitation with a restrictive red-cell transfusion strategy (Hb of 7–8 g/dL).

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^112H5ovG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Small bowel bleeding — octreotide and analogues: In patients with refractory bleeding, defined as patients requiring > 5 U of blood within 3 months after conventional treatment, depot octreotide LAR intramuscularly monthly or Lanreotide 90 mg monthly for a mean of 12 months (range 6–36 months) was associated with reduced transfusions and bleeding episodes, with transfusion requirements during treatment decreased to 2 (range 0–14) vs. 10 (6–24) in the period before treatment (P < 0.001) and the number of patients experiencing a bleeding episode decreased to 20% compared with 73% in the pretreatment phase (P = 0.001); in a retrospective analysis of 98 patients, transfusion requirements were reduced over a mean follow-up period of 78 months with 40% complete responders, 32% partial responders, and 26% non-responders, using a protocol of octreotide 100 μg (three times a day) subcutaneously for 1 month with an injection at 2 weeks of the repeat analog of 20 mg monthly for 6 months, and multivariate analysis showed age over 65 years, male gender, use of anti-platelet therapy, and chronic renal disease as predictors of poor outcome, while a recent meta-analysis confirms the value of octreotide and its analogues but provides no support for hormonal treatment.

### British society of gastroenterology (BSG)-led multisociety consensus care bundle for the early clinical management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^117Ejss4]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

RX (Treatment)

We recommend intravenous terlipressin is given to all patients with suspected cirrhosis/variceal bleeding. However, caution should be exercised in patients with ischaemic heart disease or peripheral vascular disease

Level of evidence: High

Level of recommendation: Strong

Agreement: 100%

Bundle recommendation: Intravenous terlipressin 2 mg four times a day in case of suspected variceal bleeding (80% agreement)

Variceal bleeding should be suspected in patients presenting with AUGIB who have known cirrhosis or have clinical parameters that would suggest cirrhosis. The UK variceal bleed guidelines recommend administering terlipressin or somatostatin as soon as variceal bleeding is suspected, for up to 5 days or until attainment of haemostasis, with octreotide as an alternative. The efficacy of intravenous terlipressin in variceal bleeding has been presented in a Cochrane meta-analysis of 22 RCTs (n = 1609). Seven studies (n = 443) compared terlipressin to placebo, of which five were considered to be high quality. This showed a significant reduction in all-cause mortality compared with placebo (34% relative risk reduction), improved haemostasis and reduced transfusion requirement. Similar results were found in an updated meta-analysis in 2012. A more recent multicentre RCT (n = 780) reported non-inferiority of terlipressin compared with octreotide and somatostatin, with no difference in outcomes of haemorrhage control, rebleeding and mortality. The BSG/BASL cirrhosis bundle suggests caution in patients with known ischaemic heart disease or peripheral vascular disease and mandatory ECG assessment in patients aged over 65 years.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^115VdJCX]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Drug treatment pre-endoscopy in suspected variceal bleeding

Antibiotic prophylaxis

Bacterial infections are identified in 35–66% of patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleedingand patients with cirrhosis and UGIB are at increased risk of rebleeding and mortality. Empirical antibiotic treatment reduces this risk, with a meta-analysis of 12 trials and 1241 patients reporting reduced mortality (risk ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.98), rebleeding (0.53, 0.38 to 0.74), and length of hospital stay. The choice of antibiotic should be determined by local resistance patterns and continued for up to seven days.

Vasoactive drugs

Vasopressors, including somatostatin, its analogue octreotide, and terlipressin, reduce portal pressures via splanchnic vasoconstriction. Two randomised controlled trials of 205 and 76 patients, have shown that these drugs improve bleeding control at the time of endoscopy (P = 0.012 and P = 0.034, respectively), reduce mortality and the need for rescue treatment in the first randomised controlled trial (P = 0.05), and reduce mortality at 15 days in the second randomised controlled trial (P = 0.035). No difference in control of bleeding has been identified between the different drugs. Current guidelines recommend commencing a vasoactive drug at presentation in suspected variceal bleeding with a suggested course of two to five days. Contraindications include cardiac or severe vascular disease.

### Octreotide for acute variceal bleeding [^113EjU33]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the use o f octreotide for acute variceal bleeding.

Data Sources

Articles were obtained through computerized searches involving MEDLINE (from 1997 to October 2000). Additionally, several textbooks containing information on the diagnosis and management of acute variceal bleeding were reviewed. The bibliographies of retrieved publications and textbooks were reviewed for additional references.

Study Selection

All randomized studies and pharmacoeconomic evaluations that used octreotide therapy for acute variceal bleeding were considered. Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses involving other therapies for treating variceal bleeding were also reviewed for possible inclusion.

Data Extraction

The primary outcomes extracted from the literature were persistent or recurrent bleeding, need for endoscopic intervention or balloon tamponade, and mortality.

Data Synthesis

Although both endoscopic therapies and medications are used to control bleeding and rebleeding episodes, the endoscopic approach has the additional goal of obliterating the varix. Since rebleeding episodes are common as long as the varix is present, endoscopic and medication therapies cannot be considered interchangeable based on bleeding control alone. However, octreotide by continuous intravenous infusion has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements as both an initial intervention (until definitive sclerotherapy can be performed) or as adjunctive therapy to endoscopic measures. Octreotide can be started quickly, has a relatively rapid onset of action, and does not require someone with endoscopy training to initiate. Additionally, octreotide is relatively free of significant adverse effects.

Conclusions

While additional investigations are needed, particularly in the area of pharmacoeconomics, there is substantial evidence that octreotide is an efficacious therapy with relatively few adverse effects when used in the management of acute variceal bleeding.

The combination of vasoactive agents with endoscopic treatment is more effective for hemostasis than using either alone. Vasoactive agents (ie, vasopressin, somatostatin or octreotide) should be initiated as soon as variceal hemorrhage is suspected with a bolus (only somatostatin, octreotide) followed by continuous infusion (all agents) for duration 3–5 days, except vasopressin which should only be given for 24 hours. Consider infusion of erythromycin (250 mg given over 20–30 min) or metoclopramide as a promotility agent prior to endoscopy to clear gastric contents and assist with visualization.

Patients with UGIB in the setting of DC should be considered for endoscopy within 12 hours. Balloon tamponade as a bridge to TIPS should be considered as rescue therapy for patients with refractory variceal UGIB.

### Somatostatin receptor expression, tumour response, and quality of life in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with long-acting octreotide [^1122ZQ8Q]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Octreotide lowers portal pressure, and is routinely used to treat patients with variceal bleeding. Since prophylactic octreotide can prevent bleeding in high-risk patients, octreotide LAR might reduce morbidity and mortality through this mechanism. In our trial, gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in four patients (one peptic ulcer, three varices) with a total follow-up approaching 4000 patient-months. It is impossible to determine the effect of octreotide LAR on the rate of complications from portal hypertension without a randomly allocated control group; however, the rate in our study seems low compared with other series.

Although more patients rated improvements than deteriorations for some symptoms, these ratings were not strongly correlated with receptor status scores, and it is unclear whether these represent an effect of treatment. However, the fact that many patients reported improvements may partly explain the clinical impression of benefit in some patients. Determining the significance and cause of these changes requires a randomly allocated control group. Our findings support the feasibility and importance of incorporating measures of HRQL in future trials in advanced HCC.

This study has shown that octreotide LAR is well tolerated and may benefit some patients with HCC. We were unable to define, from octreotide scintigraphy or chromogranin A analyses, a subgroup more likely to benefit. There was little objective evidence of antitumour activity. A phase III study is advocated and indeed warranted given the conflicting findings with previous studies. However, careful attention should be paid to the selection of the primary end point and dose selection in the design of such a study. The potential impact on quality of life, survival, and cirrhosis-related morbidity, particularly variceal bleeding, justifies the performance of such a trial.

### Challenges in the management of acute peptic ulcer bleeding [^113UifXL]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common medical emergency worldwide, a major cause of which are bleeding peptic ulcers. Endoscopic treatment and acid suppression with proton-pump inhibitors are cornerstones in the management of the disease, and both treatments have been shown to reduce mortality. The role of emergency surgery continues to diminish. In specialised centres, radiological intervention is increasingly used in patients with severe and recurrent bleeding who do not respond to endoscopic treatment. Despite these advances, mortality from the disorder has remained at around 10%. The disease often occurs in elderly patients with frequent comorbidities who use antiplatelet agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and anticoagulants. The management of such patients, especially those at high cardiothrombotic risk who are on anticoagulants, is a challenge for clinicians. We summarise the published scientific literature about the management of patients with bleeding peptic ulcers, identify directions for future clinical research, and suggest how mortality can be reduced.

Management strategies at the emergency department

The majority of the patients (71.5%) received intravenous fluid whilst at the ED (Mean volume: 1394.3 mls). Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was given in 71.5% of patients, of which 38.6% had prior peptic ulcer disease (PUD) history. 19 (59.4%) of those with a high clinical Rockall score, i.e. ≥ 4 received high dose PPI (i.e. 80 mg) whereas 12(37.5%) of those with the high clinical Rockall score did not receive any PPI. A small proportion of patients (18.7 and 20.3%) received Octreotide and Tranexamic acid respectively. Less than half (10, 43.5%) of those receiving Octreotide had prior h/o esophageal varices. Amongst those with h/o esophageal varices (7, 41.2%) did not receive octreotide. A minority (8, 18.6%) of those with a known history of liver disease received antibiotics in the ED. Nearly half (48.8%) of patients received blood transfusion, with 80% of them receiving 1 unit of blood. No patient received emergent endoscopy.

### Octreotide for acute esophageal variceal bleeding: a meta-analysis [^115gkiZN]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Studies of octreotide have not demonstrated a consistent benefit in efficacy or safety compared with conventional therapies. This study statistically pooled existing trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of octreotide for esophageal variceal hemorrhage.

Methods

We identified randomized trials of octreotide for variceal hemorrhage from computerized databases, scientific meeting abstracts, and the manufacturer of octreotide. Blinded reviewers abstracted the data, and a meta-analysis was performed.

Results

Octreotide improved control of esophageal variceal hemorrhage compared with all alternative therapies combined (relative risk [RR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.51–0.77); vasopressin/terlipressin (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42–0.81); or no additional intervention/placebo (among patients that received initial sclerotherapy/banding before randomization) (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.32–0.67). Octreotide had comparable efficacy to immediate sclerotherapy for control of bleeding (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.55–1.62), fewer major complications than vasopressin/terlipessin (RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11–0.87), and a complication profile comparable to no intervention/placebo (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.72–1.55). No specific alternative therapy demonstrated a mortality benefit.

Conclusions

These results favor octreotide over vasopressin/terlipressin in the control of esophageal variceal bleeding and suggest it is a safe and effective adjunctive therapy after variceal obliteration techniques. Trials are needed to determine the optimal dose, route, and duration of octreotide treatment.

### Gastric devascularization in a neonate with massive upper GI bleeding: a case report and literature review [^112ngSfB]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute gastric peptic ulcers can be managed conservatively. A gastric pH below 2.5 is one of the risk factors for stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 (H₂) receptor antagonists can significantly increase gastric pH and improve UGI bleeding in neonates. Additionally, PPI can reduce the rebleeding rate, blood transfusion requirements, and hospital stay for children with UGI bleeding caused by gastric or duodenal ulcers [1, 2, 5, 24, 25, 27–39, 31]. Among these 29 cases, 9 (31.03%) patients were treated with H₂ receptor antagonists (including our case) and 5 (17.24%) with PPI; Octreotide is a somatostatin analog that has been proven to alleviate gastrointestinal bleeding in children and is safe and effective for severe non-arterial gastrointestinal bleeding. Among these 29 cases, 1 (3.45%) patient received octreotide.

Massive UGI bleeding typically leads to poor blood perfusion of terminal organs, resulting in organ damage. Infusion of red blood cells can maintain hemoglobin levels to transport oxygen to tissues. Neonates have a lower blood volume compared to adults, and massive UGI bleeding can rapidly worsen their condition. More importantly, the measured hemoglobin concentration lags behind the actual hemoglobin level, making it unreliable in the presence of active bleeding. Therefore, some studies suggest that early blood transfusion should be considered in cases of massive UGI bleeding. Among these 29 cases, 12 (41.38%) had low hematocrit, 16 (55.17%) had hemoglobin < 150 g/L, and 26 (89.66%) received transfusions. Among them, 4 (13.79%) received a transfusion volume exceeding their calculated blood volume, and 8 (27.59%) were transfused with fresh frozen plasma. Our patient received a transfusion of 260 mL of packed red blood cells, which exceeded his calculated blood volume (240 ml).

### The role of endoscopy in the management of suspected small-bowel bleeding [^1129GHZk]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2017). Medium credibility.

Specific therapy for small-bowel bleeding sources is etiology based: Lesions within reach of a standard endoscope can be treated with electrocautery, argon plasma coagulation, injection therapy, mechanical hemostasis (eg, hemoclips or bands), or a combination of these techniques; more distal vascular lesions such as angiectasias may be approached via push enteroscopy or device-assisted enteroscopy (DAE), and treatment decreases blood loss and the need for blood transfusions. Masses or tumors likely require surgical intervention, and management of massive bleeding should be coordinated with surgery and interventional radiology; after appropriate endoscopic and imaging studies, clinically stable patients with iron deficiency may be managed with iron therapy alone and followed clinically, although iron supplementation or blood transfusions may be required in some patients with comorbidities or those not ideal for repeat endoscopy. Hormonal therapy for angiectasias largely has been abandoned because of lack of efficacy in randomized controlled trials, whereas octreotide and low-dose thalidomide have shown some benefit in eliminating the need for blood transfusions and iron supplementation in chronic blood loss from angiectasias and can be considered when endoscopic therapy is not possible or bleeding continues after endoscopic therapy.

### Long-acting octreotide is effective in controlling rebleeding angiodysplasia of the gastrointestinal tract [^115ZyxsR]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Management of bleeding angiodysplasia of the gastrointestinal tract is often a major clinical problem. Lesions are frequently multiple, not detectable or missed during conventional endoscopy and patients are sometimes at high risk for complications because of advanced age and serious concomitant disorders.

Aims

To determine the efficacy of a new formulation of somatostatin analogue (octreotide long-acting) in management of recurrent bleeding angiodysplasia in patients resistant to endoscopic treatment and not suitable for surgery.

Patients and Methods

Three patients with recurrent bleeding angiodysplasia of gastrointestinal tract were treated with long-acting octreotide administered intramuscularly 20 mg monthly to each individual. The number of admissions for acute bleeding, hospital stay and number of blood units transfused before and after treatment (followup: 15–17 months) were regularly monitored.

Results

In each patient, a relevant decrease in number of hospital admissions, duration of hospital stay, number of administered blood units was seen and mean haemoglobin values significantly increased in all of them after introducing long-acting octreotide therapy.

Conclusions

This is the first report on use of long-acting octreotide in bleeding angiodysplasia of gastrointestinal tract. Data suggest that long-acting octreotide is a safe drug and is successful in controlling recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding due to angiodysplasia in elderly patients not eligible for surgical or endoscopic therapy.

### Incidence and management of gastrointestinal bleeding with continuous flow assist devices [^113m4iy4]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Continuous flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVADs) have emerged as the standard of care for patients in advanced heart failure (HF) requiring long-term mechanical circulatory support. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding has been frequently reported within this population.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of 101 patients implanted with the Heart Mate II from January 2005 to August 2011 was performed to identify incidence, etiology, and management of GI bleeding. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was conducted to identify related risk factors.

Results

A significant incidence of GI bleeding (22.8%) occurred in our predominantly destination therapy (DT) (93%) population. Fifty-seven percent of the patients with bleeding episodes bled from the upper GI (UGI) tract (with 54% bleeding from gastric erosions and 37% from ulcers/angiodysplasias), whereas 35% of patients bled from the lower GI (LGI) tract. Previous history of GI bleeding (odds ratio [OR], 22.7; 95% CI, 2.2–228.6; p = 0.008), elevated international normalized ratio (INR) (OR, 3.9; CI, 1.2–12.9; p = 0.02), and low platelet count (OR, -0.98; CI, 0.98–0.99; p = 0.001) were independent predictors of GI hemorrhage. Recurrent bleeding was more common in older patients (mean, 70 years; p = 0.01). The majority of bleeders (60%) rebled from the same site. Management strategies included temporarily withholding anticoagulation, decreasing the speed of LVADs, and using octreotide. Octreotide did not impact the amount of packed red blood cells used, rebleeding rates, length of hospital stay, or all-cause mortality. Only 1 patient died as a direct consequence of GI bleeding.

Conclusions

Multiple factors account for GI bleeding in patients on CF-VADs. A previous history of bleeding increases risk significantly and warrants careful monitoring.

### Effects of a somatostatin analogue in occult gastrointestinal bleeding: a case report [^113b7KGR]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2004). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a patient with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding and anaemia, who required repeated transfusions for about 1 year. Because of the absence of a certain diagnosis and of a surgical approach indication, we established long-acting octreotide therapy, obtaining clinical stabilisation and interruption of the transfusional need. Withdrawal of long-acting somatostatin analogue therapy was associated with renewal of bleeding that was again successfully stopped by continuous i.v. somatostatin administration followed by re-establishment of the long-acting octreotide therapy. We suggested, in absence of surgical indications and when only palliative therapies are available, a therapeutic approach with long-term SMS analogues in patients with lower digestive bleeding of a known or unknown source.

### The effect of shortening vasoactive drug durations alongside endoscopic therapy in esophageal variceal bleeding: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^114UCxYn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The recommended duration of vasoactive drugs in esophageal variceal bleeding (EVB) spans 2–5 days. Prior meta-analyses of randomized trials include only a few studies that compared short vs. long vasoactive drug durations approximating this time range, including older management techniques, and only assessed variceal rebleeding at 5 days. We identified several additional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing rebleeding at various durations, with updated management of EVB.

Methods

We performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the effect of shortening the vasoactive drug duration by 48–72 h. The primary outcome was rebleeding within 5 days. Secondary outcomes included rebleeding, mortality due to rebleeding, and all-cause mortality within 4–6 weeks (extended period) with subgroup analysis by vasoactive drug and type of endoscopic therapy. Length of stay, blood transfusion requirements and terlipressin-related adverse events were additional secondary outcomes.

Results

Our comprehensive search strategy and screening process yielded 14 RCTs with 1060 patients (75.1% male): 7 trials used terlipressin, 4 octreotide, and 3 somatostatin. Shortened durations combined with band ligation led to similar rebleeding, with a trend towards less rebleeding when populations with more severe liver disease were excluded. There was greater rebleeding and mortality over an extended period when shorter durations were combined with sclerotherapy. Longer durations were associated with a longer hospital stay and, for terlipressin, more adverse events.

Conclusions

Shorter vasoactive drug durations combined with band ligation in selected populations appear safe. Higher powered RCTs are needed, involving patients with different degrees of severity of EVB and liver disease.

### U.K. guidelines on the management of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients [^114FARRG]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Somatostatin and octreotide

Somatostatin causes selective splanchnic vasoconstriction and reduces portal pressure and portal blood flow. Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue. The mechanism of action of these two agents is not clear. Inhibition of glucagon increases vasodilatation rather than a direct vasoconstrictive effect and post-prandial gut hyperaemia is also reduced. The actions of octreotide on hepatic and systemic hemodynamics are transient, making continuous infusion necessary. Octreotide is given as a 50 μg bolus followed by an infusion of 25–50 μg/h. Somatostatin is given as a 250 mg intravenous bolus followed by an infusion of 250 mg/h. Somatostatin and octreotide have been shown to be as effective as terlipressin in acute variceal bleeding in a meta-analysis. Seo et al in a large RCT of 780 patients comparing these three agents failed to show a difference in treatment success (range 83.8–86.2%), rebleeding (range 3.4–4.4%) and mortality (range 8–8.8%). A low systolic blood pressure at presentation, high serum creatinine level, active bleeding in the emergency endoscopy, gastric variceal bleeding and Child–Pugh grade C were independent factors predicting 5-day treatment failure.

Antibiotics

Antibiotics that provide Gram-negative cover are one of the interventions which positively influence survival in variceal haemorrhage as shown in a Cochrane meta-analysis of 12 placebo-controlled trials (RR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98). Antibiotics were also shown to reduce bacterial infections (RR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.97) and early rebleeding (RR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.74). Therefore, short-term antibiotics should be considered standard practice in all cirrhotic patients who have a variceal bleed, irrespective of the presence of confirmed infection. Third-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone (1 g IV, daily), have been shown to be more effective at reducing Gram-negative sepsis than oral norfloxacin, but choice of antibiotics must be dictated by local resistance patterns and availability.

### Management of varices and variceal hemorrhage in liver cirrhosis: a recent update [^115YFxU4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of acute variceal hemorrhage

Acute VH is a life-threatening emergency which, despite therapeutic advances in the past decade, continues to have a high 6-week mortality rate of up to 20%. Overall, the current approach is a multimodal strategy aiming to control the acute bleeding, prevent rebleeding, and decrease 6-week mortality rate, which is the main treatment outcome by consensus. The management consists of the following steps (Figure 3):

(a) Adequate resuscitation. Proper intravenous access and intubation in patients with massive hematemesis for airway protection.
(b) Transfusion of red blood cells using a restrictive strategy meaning initiating transfusion when hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dl and maintaining a goal of 7–9 g/dl. This approach had lower rebleeding and mortality rates, especially in those with CTP A and B when compared with a more liberal approach.
(c) Short-term administration of prophylactic antibiotics. RCTs have showed the use of prophylactic antibiotics that lead to significantly lower rates of infection, death, and early rebleeding. Intravenous ceftriaxone proved to be more effective than oral norfloxacin, and given the higher rates of quinolone resistant organisms and discontinuation of norfloxacin use in the United States, IV ceftriaxone for 5–7 days is the recommended choice. It is important to note that an initial infection, especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, could have led to the VH in the first place, therefore ideally, diagnostic paracentesis should be done before administering prophylactic antibiotics.
(d) Intravenous infusion of splanchnic vasoactive medications such as octreotide, somatostatin, or terlipressin to be continued for 5 days. The use of these agents has been associated with lower 7-day all-cause mortality and lower transfusion requirements. Any available agent can be used as no difference in controlled bleeding, rebleeding, or mortality rate was identified in a noninferiority trial.
(e) Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma is not recommended as it will not correct coagulopathy and may lead to volume overload and worsening of portal hypertension.
(f) IV proton pump inhibitors can be initiated when a patient presents with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, they should not be continued once a variceal source is identified, unless there is a strict indication to continue them.
(g) EGD must be done within the first 12 h of admission and once the patient is hemodynamically stable. EVL is indicated when the source of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage is variceal, that is, in the presence of the following endoscopic findings:

Study design and clinical approach in both groups

The flow chart of the study design is shown in figure 1.

Figure 1
Flow chart of the study.

The study was a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing two different approaches:
Gastric lavage using a soft 14 French nasogastric tube was done for all patients at admission. This measure is still controversially discussed in the literature; however, in our experience, it helps in the clearance of the blood from the fundus of the stomach and hence facilitates assessment and management of the bleeding source especially in gastric varices. Acute bleeding was confirmed by the presence of fresh blood in the stomach.
Drug therapy was administered in both groups: treatment with vasoactive drug (octreotide) was started at admission and continued until patients were free of bleeding for at least 24 hours after the early elective endoscopy in both groups. Octreotide (Sandostatin, Sandoz International GmbH, Germany) was administered at a dosage of 50 µg bolus at admission then 25 µg/hour for 24 hours after the early elective endoscopy.
Patients were then randomised to: Study group: Hemospray application during an immediate endoscopy within 2 hours with application of Hemospray in all cases (except for those with non-variceal bleeding sources who were excluded), followed by early elective endoscopy on the next day, that is, within 12–24 hours. Control group: only drug therapy on admission, followed by early elective endoscopy on the next day, that is, within 12–24 hours.

For obvious ethical reasons, rescue/emergency endoscopy with targeted haemostasis was performed in patients who failed to achieve clinical haemostasis (in both groups) before elective endoscopy or in whom spurter bleeding was not controlled by powder application (these were also censored as failure of clinical haemostasis; see below).

The randomisation sequence was generated with the use of a concealed block size of four. The coded treatment assignments were kept with the study coordinator at coordinating centre in sealed, consecutively numbered, opaque envelopes. Randomised assignments to the study groups were made by contacting the coordinating centre (available 24 hours a day) by telephone or fax. There were no changes that have been made to the trial design after commencement.

Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) — guidance statements 48–51 outline management: Patients with greater than mild PHG should be presumed to have clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) and should therefore be considered for prophylactic nonselective beta-blockers (NSBB) to prevent decompensation; this intervention may also prevent hemorrhagic complications or iron-deficiency anemia from severe PHG. In acute bleeding from severe PHG, vasoactive therapy (e.g., somatostatin, somatostatin analogs such as octreotide, or terlipressin if available) for 2–5 days at doses used for variceal bleeding should be considered. NSBB are recommended to prevent rebleeding from PHG and PH-related polyps. If bleeding from PHG becomes transfusion-dependent despite NSBB, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement should be considered.

### The effect of shortening vasoactive drug durations alongside endoscopic therapy in esophageal variceal bleeding: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^114yJm1H]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Second, our subgroup analysis revealed that a shorter duration of vasoactive therapy combined with sclerotherapy was associated with more rebleeding and greater mortality in the extended period (EP). This makes intuitive sense, as sclerotherapy has been associated with acute rises in portal pressures lasting for 5 days, which may increase rebleeding risk; thus, longer vasoactive durations for up to 5 days to potentially counteract that effect should remain the standard of care whenever sclerotherapy is performed.

Finally, our sensitivity analysis by liver disease and variceal bleeding severity showed a trend for more 5-day rebleeding with longer vasoactive durations in cases with less severity, and a trend for less 5-day rebleeding and lower mortality at the EP associated with longer durations in cases with higher severity. The trend that shortening durations alongside BL decreases rebleeding in patients with less severe bleeding, particularly with octreotide and somatostatin, but increases rebleeding in severe liver disease or variceal bleeding cases, warrants a cautious approach to shortening vasoactive durations in severe EVB, pending further investigation. It should be noted that the lower levels of rebleeding in shorter durations were more prevalent in the octreotide and somatostatin subgroups, which share similar mechanisms of action. Data suggest that longer durations of octreotide lead to tachyphylaxis and less sustained drops in portal pressures compared to terlipressin, although how this relates back to greater rebleeding is unclear. Additionally, the trend for more 5-day rebleeding with longer durations of octreotide/somatostatin, but not terlipressin, could just be due to the limited sample size for the former drugs.

### Profile and outcome of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding presenting to urban emergency departments of tertiary hospitals in tanzania [^114NBxKg]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Upper Gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a medico-surgical emergency. Although there has been a global decline in the mortality associated with UGIB, the incidence and mortality associated with GI bleeding remains high in limited income countries. In the United States, UGIB accounts for 300,000 admissions per year with approximately 5% mortality rate, whereas in several studies from sub-Saharan Africa, mortality ranges from 6 to 30%. It is not clear if the higher mortality seen in low and middle income countries (LIMC's) is due to patient demographics, severity on presentation, etiology or compliance with care standards. Esophageal varices has been implicated as the most common cause of UGIB in several African studies. Rather than being due to alcoholic liver disease as in high income countries (HIC's), varices in sub-Saharan Africa result from Schistosoma-related portal hypertension. This is in contrast to HIC where erosive gastritis has been commonly implicated. Other potential contributors to the higher mortality may be the severity of disease presentation, as there is little primary care in these settings, and many patients seek care very late in their disease.

Another potential contributor is failure to treat patients in accordance with management guidelines. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for those with suspected Non-variceal UGIB (NVUGIB), somatostatin analogues such as octreotide and antibiotics in suspected cases of variceal UGIB (VUGIB) and in those with clinical suspicion of liver disease, timely blood transfusion and early use of endoscopy may not occur in these settings due to lack of appropriate specialists, lack of resources or supply chain issues. A knowledge gap on the current UGIB management guidelines and recommendations amongst the health care providers may also contribute to inadequate management of UGIB cases. Prior studies in Tanzania studies demonstrate lack of appropriate care offered to patients with UGIB. Nearly half of the patients in one the studies did not receive endoscopic evaluation and treatment whereas 47.1% of the patients who required blood transfusion, did not receive blood transfusion in another study.

### Endoscopic diagnosis and management of esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^111Cnsyr]. Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

1: ESGE recommends that patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD; due to viruses, alcohol, and/or nonobese [BMI < 30kg/m²] nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) and clinically significant portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] > 10mmHg and/or liver stiffness by transient elastography > 25 kPa) should receive, if no contraindications, nonselective beta blocker (NSBB) therapy (preferably carvedilol) to prevent the development of variceal bleeding. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 2: ESGE recommends that in those patients unable to receive NSBB therapy with a screening upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy that demonstrates high risk esophageal varices, endoscopic band ligation (EBL) is the endoscopic prophylactic treatment of choice. EBL should be repeated every 2–4 weeks until variceal eradication is achieved. Thereafter, surveillance EGD should be performed every 3–6 months in the first year following eradication. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 3: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute upper GI hemorrhage (UGIH) and no history of cardiovascular disease, a restrictive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion strategy, with a hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 70g/L prompting RBC transfusion. A post-transfusion target hemoglobin of 70–90g/L is desired. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 4: ESGE recommends that patients with ACLD presenting with suspected acute variceal bleeding be risk stratified according to the Child-Pugh score and MELD score, and by documentation of active/inactive bleeding at the time of upper GI endoscopy. Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence. 5: ESGE recommends the vasoactive agents terlipressin, octreotide, or somatostatin be initiated at the time of presentation in patients with suspected acute variceal bleeding and be continued for a duration of up to 5 days. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 6: ESGE recommends antibiotic prophylaxis using ceftriaxone 1g/day for up to 7 days for all patients with ACLD presenting with acute variceal hemorrhage, or in accordance with local antibiotic resistance and patient allergies. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 7: ESGE recommends, in the absence of contraindications, intravenous erythromycin 250mg be given 30–120 minutes prior to upper GI endoscopy in patients with suspected acute variceal hemorrhage. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 8: ESGE recommends that, in patients with suspected variceal hemorrhage, endoscopic evaluation should take place within 12 hours from the time of patient presentation provided the patient has been hemodynamically resuscitated. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 9: ESGE recommends EBL for the treatment of acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage (EVH). Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 10: ESGE recommends that, in patients at high risk for recurrent esophageal variceal bleeding following successful endoscopic hemostasis (Child-Pugh C ≤ 13 or Child-Pugh B > 7 with active EVH at the time of endoscopy despite vasoactive agents, or HVPG > 20mmHg), pre-emptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) within 72 hours (preferably within 24 hours) must be considered. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 11: ESGE recommends that, for persistent esophageal variceal bleeding despite vasoactive pharmacological and endoscopic hemostasis therapy, urgent rescue TIPS should be considered (where available). Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 12: ESGE recommends endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection for acute gastric (cardiofundal) variceal (GOV2, IGV1) hemorrhage. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 13: ESGE recommends endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection or EBL in patients with GOV1-specific bleeding. Strong recommendations, moderate quality evidence. 14: ESGE suggests urgent rescue TIPS or balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) for gastric variceal bleeding when there is a failure of endoscopic hemostasis or early recurrent bleeding. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. 15: ESGE recommends that patients who have undergone EBL for acute EVH should be scheduled for follow-up EBLs at 1- to 4-weekly intervals to eradicate esophageal varices (secondary prophylaxis). Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 16: ESGE recommends the use of NSBBs (propranolol or carvedilol) in combination with endoscopic therapy for secondary prophylaxis in EVH in patients with ACLD. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence.

Acute variceal hemorrhage — vasoactive agents and dosing are outlined, and only one of these four agents should be used. Octreotide is given as an initial IV bolus of 50 micrograms (can be repeated in first hour if ongoing bleeding) followed by continuous IV infusion of 50 μg/hr for 2–5 days. Vasopressin is delivered as a continuous IV infusion 0.2–0.4 U/min; can be increased to 0.8 U/min, and it should always be accompanied by IV nitroglycerin at a starting dose of 40 μg/min, which can be increased to a maximum of 400 μg/min, adjusted to maintain a systolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg, with a duration of 24 hours. SMT (somatostatin) is given as an initial IV bolus 250 μg (can be repeated in the first hour if ongoing bleeding) and a continuous IV infusion of 250–500 μg/hr for 2–5 days. Terlipressin dosing is initial 48 hours: 2 mg IV every 4 hours until control of bleeding, then maintenance: 1 mg IV every 4 hours to prevent rebleeding for 2–5 days.

### Lack of difference among terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide in the control of acute gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage [^113MNNYX]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Vasoactive drugs are recommended to be started as soon as possible in suspected variceal bleeding, even before diagnostic endoscopy. However, it is still unclear whether the therapeutic efficacies of the various vasoactive drugs used are comparable. The aim of this prospective, multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial was to characterize the effects of terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide when they are initiated before endoscopic treatment in patients with acute variceal bleeding. Patients with liver cirrhosis and significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding were randomly assigned to receive early administration of terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide, followed by endoscopic treatment. Patients with nonvariceal bleeding were excluded after endoscopy. The primary endpoint was 5-day treatment success, defined as control of bleeding without rescue treatment, rebleeding, or mortality, with a noninferiority margin of 0.1. In total, 780 patients with variceal bleeding were enrolled: 261 in the terlipressin group; 259 in the somatostatin group; and 260 in the octreotide group. At the time of initial endoscopy, active bleeding was noted in 43.7%, 44.4%, and 43.5% of these patients, respectively (P = 0.748), and treatment success was achieved by day 5 in 86.2%, 83.4%, and 83.8% (P = 0.636), with similar rates of control of bleeding without rescue treatment (89.7%, 87.6%, and 88.1%; P = 0.752), rebleeding (3.4%, 4.8%, and 4.4%; P = 0.739), or mortality (8.0%, 8.9%, and 8.8%; P = 0.929). The absolute values of the lower bound of confidence intervals for terlipressin versus somatostatin, terlilpressin versus octreotide, and octreotide versus somatostatin were 0.095, 0.090, and 0.065, respectively.

Conclusion

Hemostatic effects and safety did not differ significantly between terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide as adjuvants to endoscopic treatment in patients with acute gastroesophageal variceal bleeding.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding — trial outcomes prioritization: The critical outcome was further bleeding, which includes persistent and recurrent bleeding. Further bleeding was recommended as the primary endpoint for RCTs of UGIB management by an International Consensus Panel because prevention of further bleeding is the primary clinical goal for patients with UGIB. Mortality was defined as an important outcome but not critical for decision making because death is uncommon in patients with UGIB (~2% in the United States), and sample sizes for most RCTs are not based on assessment of mortality.

### Updated strategies in the management of acute variceal haemorrhage [^1134phDW]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article reviews the most recent studies regarding the management of acute esophageal variceal haemorrhage.

Recent Findings

New randomized control trials and meta-analyses confirmed the role of early transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in the management of acute variceal haemorrhage in Child-Pugh C (10–13) and B patients with active bleeding. A recent randomized controlled trial focused on the duration of vasoactive therapy showed no difference between 2 and 5 days of octreotide. A randomized trial showed decreased use of blood products for the correction of coagulopathy using a thromboelastography-guided approach (vs. conventional parameters) as well as decreased bleeding rates when compared with standard of care. A meta-analysis found that for rescue of variceal bleeding, self-expanding metallic stents were more efficacious and safer than balloon tamponade. In addition, studies showed that Child-Pugh C patients and those with hepatic vein pressure gradient more than 20 were at the highest risk of treatment failure, while model for end-stage liver disease was highly predictive of in-hospital mortality.

Summary

In patients with severe coagulopathy and uncontrolled bleeding, TEG-based transfusion strategies are recommended. Antibiotics should be used for all cirrhotic patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, but should be tailored in accordance to local resistance patterns. Early TIPS for high-risk patients has been shown to have a significant survival benefit. Certain aspects of the management of variceal bleeding remain poorly studied such as the role of early TIPS in Child-B patients as well as strategies for rescue therapy in patients who are not TIPS candidates, and require further investigation.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^117PPFAE]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) — epidemiology, severity markers, progression, and management: Several clinical grading systems have been proposed to identify features associated with high or low risk of complications, including the New Italian Endoscopic Club (NIEC) and Baveno III systems. Consensus among grading systems is that intramucosal hemorrhaging signs (cherry red spots, black-brown spots, or red point lesions) differentiate severe from mild PHG and that concomitant gastric antral vascular ectasia confers higher risk of hemorrhage. Among patients with compensated cirrhosis, prevalence ranges from 49% to 80%, lower in those without varices (11%) or with small varices (35%) relative to those with medium or large varices (80%–97%), and development usually requires the presence of CSPH. Longitudinally, progression is frequent and regression rare; for example, in the HALT-C study, 97/170 (57%) without PHG developed PHG and 115/174 (66%) with baseline PHG worsened over 4 years of clinical follow-up. Acute bleeding is uncommon at 2.5%–5% and often ceases spontaneously in over half of cases; low quality data support intravenous octreotide, somatostatin, or terlipressin as safe initial therapy. Acute administration of NSBBs reduces gastric hyperemia and may attenuate acute PHG bleeding; prospective studies suggest a potential prophylactic role of NSBBs for reduction of first or recurrent acute PHG bleeding after exclusion of Helicobacter pylori. Chronic blood loss is typically defined as a 2 g/dL hemoglobin reduction over a 6‑month interval and is present in up to 4%–12% of cases; an RCT showed a clear benefit from propranolol in preventing recurrent bleeding, with additional nonrandomized data for argon plasma coagulation and case series describing hemostatic spray and high rates of bleeding control with portosystemic decompression.

### Octreotide: a drug often used in the critical care setting but not well understood [^1132c8QN]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

While the canonical function of somatostatin (SST) is to inhibit the secretion of growth hormone, it has a number of other physiologic effects that are less widely appreciated. Octreotide, an analog of SST, is not uncommonly used in the critical care setting, particularly for the treatment of variceal hemorrhage. Herein, we discuss the biology and pharmacology of SST, octreotide, and other SST analogs. We also review the evidence behind their use in esophageal variceal bleeds, hepatorenal syndrome, hypoglycemia due to sulfonylurea poisoning, and chylous pleural effusions.

Somatostatin analogs

Increasingly, studies have shown that octreotide is an effective option for the management of bleeding from angiodysplasia and should be strongly considered in those with recurrent bleeding despite endoscopic intervention. Octreotide is a somatostatin analog whose reported mechanism of action includes decreasing splanchnic blood flow, inhibiting angiogenesis, improving platelet aggregation and increasing vascular resistance.

A review by Jackson and Gerson found that somatostatin analogs were effective in reducing recurrent bleeding episodes and transfusion requirements with a pooled OR of 14.5 (95%CI 5.9–36). A 2010 meta-analysis of studies reporting the use of somatostatin analogs in the treatment of angiodysplasia determined a clinical response of 76%, with a weighted mean difference in transfusion requirements before and after treatment of −2.2 (95%CI −3.9 to −0.5). Another study followed patients with recurrent GI bleeding secondary to angiodysplasia after at least 6 months of treatment with a somatostatin analog. Following treatment, the rate of bleeding episodes was reduced from 73% to 20%, the number of transfusions needed dropped from a median of 10 to 2, and the mean hemoglobin increased from a median of 7 to 10 g/dL. Similarly, a prospective study evaluated the efficacy of 1-year octreotide treatment in patients with chronic bleeding secondary to angiodysplasia. Complete response without the need for transfusion or iron supplementation was achieved in 69% of patients, a partial response in 8% of patients and no response in 23% of patients.

A 2017 study evaluated the use of combination endoscopic therapy and the somatostatin analog lanreotide compared to endoscopic therapy alone in patients with refractory iron deficiency anemia secondary to small-bowel angioectasia. Combination therapy led to statistically significant reduction in transfusion requirements and bleeding episodes with an increase in hemoglobin compared with the other group.

One case series reported 3 patients with CKD and recurrent bleeding secondary to diffuse GI angiodysplasia that responded to 6 months of octreotide therapy. However, no formal studies have examined the efficacy of octreotide in treating angiodysplasia in patients with comorbid CKD.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^1164Qr53]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

A prokinetic drug given before endoscopy helps to empty stomach contents and improves viewing at endoscopy. Only five randomized trials and their pooled analyses have been published: three with the use of erythromycin and two with metoclopramide. Pre-endoscopy erythromycin has been extensively studied and shown to enhance the visualization as well as reduce the need for second endoscopy. However, such practice has not shown to reduce the need for surgical intervention or impact mortality.

After initial hemostasis, the risk of rebleeding must be minimized by adjunct therapies. In patients who have PPU complicated by bleeding, there is a 33% risk of rebleeding in 1–2 years. Furthermore, there is a 40–50% rebleeding risk over the subsequent 10 years following the initial episode of bleeding. PPIs are recommended for 6–8 weeks following endoscopic treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding to allow mucosal healing. Once mucosal healing has been achieved, how long PPIs should be continued is still controversial. Randomized prospective trials have demonstrated a benefit to long-term acid-suppression therapy in two settings: chronic NSAID users and H. pylori -infected patients. Testing for H. pylori is recommended in all patients with BPU. This should be followed by eradication therapy for those who are H. pylori positive, with subsequent assessment of the effect of this therapy, and renewed treatment in those in whom eradication fails.

In patients with recurrent bleeding from peptic ulcer, what is the role of non-operative management?

In patients with recurrent bleeding from peptic ulcer, we recommend endoscopy as a first-line treatment (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 1C).

In patients with recurrent bleeding, we suggest transcatheter angioembolization as an alternative option where resources are available (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidences, 2D).

Emergency endoscopy is the first-line management for rebleeding peptic ulcer. Such endoscopy must be done at the earliest available opportunity. In patients who are hemodynamically stable, angioembolization of the bleeding vessel is an option. However, this should be carefully balanced for its inherent risks of patient transfer, contrast nephropathy, pancreatitis, or cholecystitis risk due to embolization material and risks associated with vascular access.

### Management of patients with rebleeding [^113YtX5X]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Peptic ulcer bleeding is a common emergency. Management of ulcer bleeding requires prompt risk stratification, initiation of pharmacotherapy, and timely evaluation for endoscopy. Although endoscopy can achieve primary hemostasis in more than 90% of peptic ulcer bleeding, rebleeding may occur in up to 15% of patients after therapeutic endoscopy and is associated with heightened mortality. Early identification of high-risk patients for rebleeding is important. Depending on bleeding severity and center availability, patients with rebleeding may be managed by second endoscopy, transarterial angiographic embolization, or surgery. This article reviews the current management of peptic ulcers with an emphasis on rebleeding.

Proton pump inhibitors

Use of proton pump inhibitors before endoscopy might reduce the need for endoscopic treatment at index endoscopy, but does not improve more clinically relevant endpoints, therefore, use in this situation is not advocated by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. This advice is based on a meta-analysis of six studies comprising 2223 patients, which showed no significant reduction in mortality (odds ratio 1.12, 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 1.73), rebleeding (0.81, 0.61 to 1.09), or need for surgery (0.96, 0.68 to 1.35). Despite this guidance, the 2015 UK National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death report found that 150 (73%) of 206 patients had acid suppression started before definitive diagnosis, which was thought likely owing to clinicians' desires to start a specific treatment when managing a haemorrhage. European, Asian-Pacific, International, and US guidelines are not consistent on the use of proton pump inhibitors, with some suggesting that these compounds could have a role in the context of delayed endoscopy in consideration of relative costs of proton pump inhibitors and endotherapy.

M-H, Mantel-Haenszel; CI, confidence interval

In terms of trends, prior to the sensitivity analysis there were statistically insignificant trends towards increased rebleeding, mortality due to rebleeding, and all-cause mortality in the longer vasoactive duration group who underwent BL. Octreotide and somatostatin both had similar trends of increased rebleeding within 5 days associated with the longer treatment durations (Fig. 2A), with only 1 study pooled on each, whereas shortening terlipressin had no notable trend and more studies were pooled. Study quality was assessed with the Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for all 14 studies, which revealed that 11 studies had some risk of bias. The sensitivity analysis, excluding studies with high CPCC distributions, revealed a trend towards more 5-day rebleeding with longer durations in patients who underwent BL. Conversely, including only studies with high-risk variceal features or high CPCC distribution revealed a trend towards more 5-day rebleeding and a trend towards greater mortality due to rebleeding at the EP.

### Somatostatin, somatostatin analogues and other vasoactive drugs in the treatment of bleeding oesophageal varices [^115bEw51]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2004). Low credibility.

Somatostatin and its analogues have been compared with a variety of other treatments for the treatment of variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients. Meta-analyses of studies comparing somatostatin or octreotide with vasopressin or terlipressin have shown that somatostatin is somewhat superior to vasopressin and equivalent to terlipressin in controlling bleeding and has significantly fewer side effects; no difference in mortality was observed. Octreotide was somewhat better than vasopressin and terlipressin in controlling bleeding, with similar mortality. Meta-analysis of trials comparing somatostatin or octreotide with endoscopic sclerotherapy shows that both drugs are equivalent to sclerotherapy for bleeding control, early rebleeding and survival. Complications are much less frequent with drug treatment. Nine trials have compared endoscopic therapy with therapeutic regimens combining endoscopic treatment with somatostatin, octreotide or vapreotide. Meta-analysis show that the combined regimens increase the 5 days bleeding control rate of endoscopic treatments by over 20%, although there is no difference in mortality. Comparisons of somatostatin and octreotide with combined regimens of sclerotherapy + somatostatin and sclerotherapy + octreotide have shown that the combined regimens were better than drug treatments alone in controlling bleeding and preventing early rebleeding, while complications were significantly less frequent with drug therapy.

The most recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found no benefit of endoscopic therapy vs no endoscopic therapy for further bleeding (RR = 0.31, 0.06–1.77) or mortality (RR = 0.90, 0.23–3.58), and some trials were stopped early "with 47% and 59% of the predetermined sample sizes enrolled". Non-endoscopic strategies reported low rebleeding in selected trials, including "0 of 24" patients on high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) without endoscopic therapy and "0 of 64 patients with PPI vs 13 (21%) of 61 given placebo".

### Octreotide therapy for control of acute gastrointestinal bleeding in children [^112hn1ko]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the outcomes of octreotide use in children with gastrointestinal bleeding with or without portal hypertension.

Methods

The medical charts of children who received continuous octreotide infusion for the indication of gastrointestinal bleeding from January 1995 to December 2000 were retrospectively reviewed.

Results

Twenty-one children with portal hypertension received octreotide infusions (1–2 microg/kg/h) during 35 gastrointestinal bleeding episodes. The duration of infusion ranged from 19 hours to 7 days. Bleeding ceased in 71% of children. Post-treatment rebleeding occurred in 52%, and the mortality was 19%. Response to octreotide, rebleeding, and mortality did not differ significantly between patients with or without intrinsic liver disease. Twelve children with gastrointestinal bleeding unrelated to portal hypertension received octreotide during 14 episodes. The duration of octreotide ranged from 3 hours to 36 days. Fifty percent of children had resolution of bleeding during the infusion. Post-treatment rebleeding occurred in 29%, and the mortality was 50%. No major adverse events were observed in either group.

Conclusions

A high rate of bleeding control was achieved with octreotide during acute gastrointestinal bleeding in children with portal hypertension. However, controlled studies are needed for more definitive description of its clinical effects. The role of octreotide is less clear in gastrointestinal bleeding unrelated to portal hypertension.

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^1134SYrS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, individual RCTs that compared different regimens of PPIs in peptic ulcer bleeding and even the meta-analysis of these trials remain severely underpowered. What is worse, it is not likely that an adequately powered RCT will be conducted in the near future due to feasibility issues and lack of funding from pharmaceutical companies facing increasing generic competition. Then how will we be able to decide on this issue? It seems that, for the time being, a reasonable approach is the approach chosen by the international consensus group who stated that "strong evidence demonstrates the efficacy of high-dose IV PPI therapy after successful endoscopy, but it is not possible to make conclusions regarding the efficacy of either lower intravenous doses or high-dose oral therapy". This statement was largely based on the results of a 2006 Cochrane review that showed that, among patients with high-risk endoscopic lesions who had received endoscopic hemostatic therapy, high dose IV PPI therapy (80 mg bolus plus 8 mg/h continuous infusion) significantly reduced rebleeding and mortality, while lower doses (IV or oral) significantly reduced rebleeding but had no demonstrable effect on mortality. The 2013 update of that review showed very similar results.

It is important to note that even if the guideline recommendations are followed, a significant proportion of patients will rebleed; there is still room for improvement in the management of patients with NVUGIB, especially in those who have been found to have high-risk endoscopic lesions. A recent RCT attempted to improve outcomes for these patients. 105 patients with upper GI bleeding and high-risk endoscopic lesions were treated successfully with endoscopic combination treatment and were started on IV PPI treatment. Then, they were randomized to either receive supplementary (preventive) transcatheter arterial embolization or continue standard treatment. The group that received preventive embolization therapy experienced less rebleeding episodes (2 versus 8 patients). The results did not reach statistical significance as the study was underpowered, but the concept is worth further research.

Consensus guidelines suggest that clinicians not routinely perform a repeat endoscopy during hospital admission unless the patient experiences evidence of rebleeding. This recommendation was reached despite the fact that two systematic review and meta-analyses of RCTs had suggested some benefits. The main reason for this apparent discrepancy between guidelines and meta-analyses was that the vast majority of the RCTs included in these meta-analyses had used endoscopic and medical treatments that would have been considered suboptimal nowadays; therefore their results are not applicable to current practice.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^114LyWu5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Non-operative management — endoscopic treatment

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, which are the indications for non-operative management?

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, we recommend non-operative management as the first line of management after endoscopy (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 1C).

Non-operative management of bleeding peptic ulcer incorporates principles of ABCDE:
Airway control
Breathing — ventilation and oxygenation
Circulation — fluid resuscitation and control of bleeding
Drugs — pharmacotherapy with PPIs, prokinetics, etc.
Endoscopy (diagnostic and therapeutic) or embolization (therapeutic)

A meta-analysis from Barkun et al. that included forty-one randomized trials showed that all endoscopic therapies decreased rebleeding versus pharmacotherapy alone. Endoscopy is indicated to establish diagnosis and institute therapy for bleeding peptic ulcer. In acutely bleeding ulcers, endoscopy is a part of resuscitation.

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, which are the indications for endoscopic treatment?

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, we recommend endoscopic treatment to achieve hemostasis and reduce re-bleeding, the need for surgery, and mortality (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 1C).

We suggest stratifying patients based on the Blatchford score and adopting a risk-stratified management (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidences, 2D):

In the very low-risk group, we suggest outpatient endoscopy (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 2C)
In the low-risk group, we recommend early inpatient endoscopy (≤ 24 h of admission) (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 1C).
In the high-risk group, we recommend urgent inpatient endoscopy (≤ 12 h of admission) (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 1C).

### Esophageal bleeding disorders [^1151TaQz]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Esophageal varices and Mallory Weiss syndrome are the two major esophageal bleeding disorders. Although there have been major breakthroughs in the treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding, the management of esophageal bleeding disorders remains a challenging problem. This review focuses on studies published in the previous 12 months that provide further understanding of the appropriate treatment of various esophageal bleeding disorders. Other uncommon causes of esophageal bleeding are also discussed.

Recent Findings

With the advances in endoscopic and pharmacologic treatments, mortality resulting from variceal hemorrhage has been substantially reduced. Band ligation is the first-line endoscopic treatment of esophageal variceal hemorrhage. Vasoactive agents such as somatostatin analog and terlipressin are both safe and effective pharmacologic treatments of esophageal variceal hemorrhage. Use of a nonselective beta-blocker is still the most widely accepted treatment for both primary and secondary prophylaxis. However, the effectiveness of beta-blockers is limited by intolerance and nonresponders in a significant proportion of patients. Thus, endoscopic band ligation is used increasingly as an alternative strategy for primary prophylaxis. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt should be reserved as rescue therapy for failure of medical and endoscopic treatments. In recent years, noninvasive surrogate markers have been reported to identify high-risk patients with large esophageal varices. Platelet count, spleen diameter, and their ratio are accurate predictors of esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. The endosonographic measurement of the cross-sectional surface area predicts the risk of variceal hemorrhage. For Mallory Weiss syndrome, endoscopic clipping is an emerging treatment modality, especially for deep laceration with risk of perforation.

Summary

A combination of various clinical, laboratory, and endosonographic parameters accurately predicts the risk of variceal hemorrhage. A streamlined screening strategy allows more cost-effective use of endoscopy and prompt prophylactic treatment for high-risk esophageal varices.

### Turn over the new leaf of the treatment in peptic ulcer bleeding: a review of the literature [^1148H38z]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Peptic ulcer bleeding is the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which has a high mortality risk. The standard therapy for acute peptic ulcer bleeding combines medication administration and endoscopic therapies. Both pharmacologic and endoscopic therapies have developed continuously in the past few decades. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) already reached a high efficacy in ulcer healing and have been widely used in the past few decades. Endoscopic hemostasis, which includes local epinephrine injection, heater probe coagulation, use of hemostatic clips, and/or band ligation, is highly effective with an overall hemostatic success rate of 85%-90%. However, 10%-20% of patients could not be cured by the current standard combination treatment. Recurrent ulcer bleeding, despite an initial successful hemostasis, is also a big problem for longer hospitalization stays, higher mortality, and higher complication rates, especially for malignant ulcer bleeding. How to manage all types of peptic ulcer bleeding and how to prevent early recurrent peptic ulcer bleeding remain unresolved clinical problems. Recently, several novel medications and endoscopic methods have been developed. Potassium competitive acid blockers have shown a stronger and longer acid suppression than PPI. Hemostatic powder spray and hemostatic gel emulsion are novel hemostatic weapons with emerging evidence, which are potential missing pieces of the puzzle. This literature review will go through the development of endoscopic hemostasis to the prospects of novel endoscopic treatments.

### Management of massive peptic ulcer bleeding [^113qRmqs]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Massive bleeding from a peptic ulcer remains a challenge. A multidisciplinary team of skilled endoscopists, intensive care specialists, experienced upper gastrointestinal surgeons, and intervention radiologists all have a role to play. Endoscopy is the first-line treatment. Even with larger ulcers, endoscopic hemostasis can be achieved in the majority of cases. Surgery is clearly indicated in patients in whom arterial bleeding cannot be controlled at endoscopy. Angiographic embolization is an alternate option, particularly in those unfit for surgery. In selected patients judged to belong to the high-risk group — ulcers 2 cm or greater in size located at the lesser curve and posterior bulbar duodenal, shock on presentation, and elderly with comorbid illnesses — a more aggressive postendoscopy management is warranted. The optimal course of action is unclear. Most would be expectant and offer medical therapy in the form of acid suppression. Surgical series suggest that early elective surgery may improve outcome. Angiography allows the bleeding artery to be characterized, and coil embolization of larger arteries may further add to endoscopic hemostasis. The role of early elective surgery or angiographic embolization in selected high-risk patients to forestall recurrent bleeding remains controversial. Prospective studies are needed to compare different management strategies in these high-risk ulcers.

### AGA clinical practice update on the use of vasoactive drugs and intravenous albumin in cirrhosis: expert review [^114zZw6h]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Variceal hemorrhage — initiation of vasoactive therapy is guided by Best Practice Advice 1, which states that vasoactive drugs should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis of variceal hemorrhage is suspected or confirmed, preferably before diagnostic and/or therapeutic endoscopy. Acute variceal hemorrhage (AVH) is described as a major complication of cirrhosis with an in-hospital mortality rate of 4%–13% and a 6-week mortality rate of 7%–43% and accounts for approximately 70% of all upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis. Vasoactive drugs for AVH can be divided into somatostatin and its analogs (octreotide in most countries) and vasopressin and its analogs (terlipressin); these agents work via vasoconstriction in the splanchnic circulation and thereby reduce portal pressure, can halt acute hemorrhage in up to 80% of cases, and are given intravenously.

### Portal hypertensive bleeding [^112Gef3b]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Portal hypertension bleeding is a common and serious complication of cirrhosis. All patients with cirrhosis should undergo endoscopy and be evaluated for possible causes of current or future portal hypertensive bleeding. Possible causes of bleeding include esophageal varices, gastric varices, and PHG. Patients with esophageal varices at high risk of bleeding should be treated with nonselective beta-blockers for primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage. HVPG measurements represent the optimal way to monitor the success of pharmacologic therapy. EVL may be used in those with high-risk varices who do not tolerate beta-blockers. When active bleeding develops, simultaneous and coordinated attention must be given to hemodynamic resuscitation, prevention and treatment of complications, and active control of bleeding. In cases of acute esophageal variceal (Fig. 5) and PHG bleeding, terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide should be started. Endoscopic treatment is provided for those with bleeding esophageal varices. If first-line therapy fails, TIPS or surgery may need to be performed. Unlike esophageal variceal or PHG bleeding, there is no established optimal treatment for gastric variceal bleeding. Individual and specific treatment modalities for acute gastric variceal bleeding must be calculated carefully after considering side effects.

### Practice guidance for the use of terlipressin for liver cirrhosis-related complications [^1141sshX]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Gastroesophageal variceal bleeding in liver cirrhosis

Guidance Statement 1. Terlipressin is recommended for the treatment of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding in liver cirrhosis.

Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is one of serious complications of liver cirrhosis, and gastroesophageal varices are the most common source of gastrointestinal bleeding in liver cirrhosis. Terlipressin has been recommended as the first-line treatment of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding. – In 1990, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) for the first time explored the role of terlipressin for the treatment of acute esophageal variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients. Sixty patients were assigned to terlipressin (n = 29) and placebo (n = 31) groups. The rate of control bleeding was significantly higher in patients receiving terlipressin than those receiving placebo (90% versus 59%, p < 0.01). Since then, several studies have also confirmed the efficacy of terlipressin in cirrhotic patients with acute variceal bleeding. Recently, a meta-analysis of 30 RCTs with 3344 cases compared the efficacy and safety of terlipressin versus placebo, pituitrin, somatostatin, octreotide, endoscopic therapy, or balloon tamponade for the management of acute variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients. Patients receiving terlipressin had a significantly higher rate of control bleeding and a lower mortality than those receiving placebo, but were not significantly different from those receiving pituitrin, somatostatin, or octreotide. The incidence of adverse events was significantly lower in patients receiving terlipressin than those receiving pituitrin [odds ratio (OR) R = 0.15, p = 0.02], but higher than those receiving somatostatin (OR = 2.44, p = 0.04). Terlipressin alone had significantly higher 5-day treatment failure than endoscopic variceal ligation plus terlipressin (OR = 14.46, p = 0.01). Terlipressin group had a significantly lower 30-day mortality than balloon tamponade group (OR = 0.05, p < 0.01). In addition, terlipressin in combination with octreotide or somatostatin did not further reduce portal pressure. The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines recommend that the dosage of terlipressin is 2 mg/4 h by intravenous boluses for 2–5 days. Notably, recent evidence suggested that continuous infusion of terlipressin could reduce portal pressure stably and increase treatment success rate. Considering the use of terlipressin in our clinical practice, we recommend that the initial dosage of terlipressin is 1–2 mg/4 h by slowly intravenous boluses (> 1 min) or continuously intravenous infusion and that the maintenance dosage is 1–2 mg/6 h by continuously intravenous infusion. Generally, the maximum daily dosage is 120–150 μg/kg, and its duration is 3–5 days. Certainly, the dosage and duration of terlipressin can be adjusted according to the severity of variceal bleeding and patients' conditions.

### Terlipressin vs. octreotide in bleeding esophageal varices as an adjuvant therapy with endoscopic band ligation: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^116ba79t]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Data are scarce on the head-to-head efficacy of terlipressin and octreotide as an adjuvant therapy to endoscopic management of variceal bleed. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of terlipressin with octreotide as an adjuvant therapy to endoscopic variceal band ligation in patients with esophageal variceal bleeding.

Methods

Cirrhotic patients with esophageal variceal bleed were randomized on admission to receive terlipressin (group A) or octreotide (group B) along with the placebo in the other arm in a double-blind fashion. The two groups were compared for efficacy, safety, overall survival, and length of hospital stay. "Control of variceal bleed" was the measure of efficacy of terlipressin and octreotide. Factors predicting length of stay were also assessed.

Results

A total of 324 patients were enrolled; 163 in the terlipressin group (group A) and 161 in the octreotide group (group B). The baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable for age, gender, etiology of cirrhosis, hemoglobin at presentation, and Child-Pugh class, except that active bleed was seen during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at the time of enrollment in 26 (16%) and 41 (25.5%) patients in groups A and B, respectively (P = 0.034). Overall sixteen patients died (three failure to control bleed and thirteen from causes other than variceal bleed); nine in group A (5.5%) and seven (4.3%) in group B (P = 0.626). In the intention to treat analysis, "control of variceal bleed" was noted in 305 patients (94.13%); 151 (92.63%) patients in group A and 154 (95.6%) patients in group B (confidence interval: 0.219–1.492). Packed cell transfusions in group A were 3.7 ± 2.3 units, whereas in group B there were 3.9 ± 2.5 units (P = 0.273). Length of hospital stay in groups A and B was 108.40 ± 34.81 and 126.39 ± 47.45 h, respectively (P ≤ 0.001). No cardiovascular side effects were observed in either group. High pulse, low hemoglobin, prothrombin time, blood in nasogastric aspirate, and portosystemic encephalopathy (PSE) were predictors of prolonged hospital stay.

Conclusions

The efficacy of terlipressin was not inferior to octreotide as an adjuvant therapy for the control of esophageal variceal bleed and in-hospital survival. The length of hospital stay in the terlipressin group was significantly shorter but not of any clinical importance. The predictors of prolonged hospital stay were low hemoglobin, high pulse, prolonged prothrombin time, blood at nasogastric aspirate, and PSE.

### Endoscopy for nonvariceal upper-GI bleeding… [^114v8Pfg]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which is defined as blood loss originating near the Treitz ligament, is a common cause of hospitalization and mortality. Symptoms include hematemesis, coffee ground emesis, red blood return with nasogastric aspiration, melena, and hematochezia with heavy bleeding. The first step in managing upper GI bleeding is stabilizing the patient and obtaining a thorough medical history to identify potential causes of GI hemorrhage. Transfusion is appropriate if blood loss is significant. Intravenous or oral proton pump inhibitors can help reduce gastric lining irritation. Researchers have found that somatostatin and its analog octreotide reduced portal blood flow to the stomach and duodenum, resulting in decreased risk of continuous hemorrhage and surgical intervention. These actions may be considered temporary treatments before endoscopy.

The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Practice Committee recently reviewed prospective trials, series reports, and expert opinions on the role of endoscopy in managing acute nonvariceal upper GI bleeding. Endoscopy is most beneficial when initiated soon after upper GI bleeding begins and can decrease the duration of hospitalization and the need for transfusion. Intravenous erythromycin administered before endoscopy promotes gastric emptying and improves the diagnostic quality of the examination. Emergency department physicians can assess the risk for recurrent bleeding and recommend outpatient treatment or possible endoscopic treatment. Signs of high-risk bleeding include active arterial bleeding, nonbleeding visible vessels, nonbleeding adherent clots, and ulcer oozing. Peptic ulcer disease is the most common cause of upper GI bleeding.

Endoscopic therapy including laser treatment, electrocautery, heat probe, and epinephrine injection are all effective compared with placebo or no treatment. The success of these modalities usually is determined by the skill of the physician performing them. Physicians should test patients with upper GI bleeding for H. pylori through biopsy, because rapid urease tests have reduced sensitivity in this setting. Patients with positive test results should be treated to eradicate the infection. The ASGE Practice Committee concluded that endoscopy is effective in the diagnosis and treatment of upper GI bleeding, although the superiority between the individual endoscopic treatments has not been determined. The committee recommends that patients with a high risk of recurrent bleeding receive closer monitoring and possible repeat endoscopy.

### High-dose PPIs in patients with variceal hemorrhage… [^1134hBaY]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

The meta-analysis by Wang et al1 shows no additional benefit in reducing the rates of rebleeding, surgical intervention, or mortality with the use of high-dose PPIs compared with non–high-dose PPIs for the treatment of patients with bleeding peptic ulcers. We would like to comment on another clinical condition in which we have seen increased use of high-dose PPIs: acute variceal hemorrhage. Both groups received standard octreotide therapy for the treatment of variceal hemorrhage. Both groups were similar at baseline with respect to Child-Pugh score, international normalized ratios, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score, and hemoglobin concentration. The mean duration of high-dose PPI was 63. 3 hours. Results showed no difference in outcome with respect to transfusion of packed red blood cells or platelets.

Curiously, the high-dose PPI group received more units of fresh-frozen plasma throughout the hospital stay compared with the non–high-dose PPI group. Furthermore, there was an increased rate of rebleeding in the high-dose PPI group, although this was nonsignificant. Although differences observed may theoretically be attributed to differences in the 2 groups owing to the retrospective nature of the study, it is interesting that Wang et al1 also observed an increased rate of rebleeding in the high-dose PPI group compared with the non–high-dose group. Overall, the results of our study extend the findings of Wang et al and suggest that use of high-dose PPI therapy does not confer additional benefit in the management of variceal hemorrhage.

### Omeprazole and recurrent bleeding of peptic ulcers… [^115jaxNd]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Approximately 20 percent of patients have recurrent bleeding of peptic ulcers following endoscopic treatment. These recurrences often require emergency surgery and are associated with a high rate of mortality. In vitro data suggest that platelet aggregation is enhanced at higher levels of gastric pH. However, studies using intravenous histamine H. Helicobacter pylori infection was also performed at the time of endoscopy. After endoscopy, the patients were randomized to receive an 80-mg intravenous dose of omeprazole or placebo. This was followed by an intravenous infusion of omeprazole or placebo at 8 mg per hour for 72 hours. Intensive monitoring for any sign of recurrent bleeding was performed until patients were determined to be stable enough for discharge from the hospital. Recurrent bleeding occurred in eight patients in the omeprazole group and in 27 patients in the placebo group.

Most cases of recurrent bleeding occurred during the three-day infusion period. Three patients in the omeprazole group required surgery, compared with nine in the placebo group. Of patients who presented with actively bleeding ulcers, recurrent bleeding was found in three of the omeprazole patients compared with 10 in the placebo group. Another factor noted was the number of blood transfusions needed during the first 30 days after endoscopy, which was significantly less in the treatment group. The average duration of hospitalization was also significantly shorter in the omeprazole group compared with the placebo group. Five deaths occurred in the treatment group compared with 12 in the placebo group. However, none of the deaths in the treatment group were directly associated with gastrointestinal bleeding.

The authors conclude that high-dose intravenous omeprazole significantly reduces the risk of recurrent bleeding following endoscopic treatment of peptic ulcers. This therapeutic intervention also appears to decrease the need for blood transfusions and surgery, and to reduce the length of the hospital stay. This therapy cannot be extrapolated to include any patient admitted with a diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Intravenous omeprazole can rapidly raise intragastric pH to more than 6, a level shown to enhance platelet aggregation and formation of fibrin clot. Oral proton-pump inhibitors take several days to produce this level of acid suppression and thus may not be as effective as the intravenous formulation in preventing early recurrence of bleeding. — j. t. k.
