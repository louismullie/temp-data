## Question

Loculated effusions

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about loculated effusions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining loculated effusions and their pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, especially the role of ultrasound versus CT and the limitations of pH sampling. Next, I will examine etiologies and prognostic implications. After that, I need to review management by etiology, including parapneumonic effusions, malignant pleural effusions, and pericardial effusions. Finally, I should consider special scenarios, emerging biomarkers, and synthesize a practical algorithm with key takeaways, making sure I double-check any numerical claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Loculated effusions are pleural or pericardial fluid collections divided into non-gravity-dependent pockets by fibrin septations, typically reflecting deranged fibrinolysis with high PAI-1 activity and impaired uPA-mediated plasmin generation, which traps fluid and impedes drainage; this mechanism is well described in pleural infection and also applies to malignant and other inflammatory effusions, with suPAR as a key regulator of the uPA system and a potential biomarker of loculation risk [^427a2d20] [^4db2c1b1] [^74d79f5c].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before jumping to conclusions. Ultrasound is the first-line modality to detect and characterize loculations, with high sensitivity and specificity and proven safety benefits for procedural guidance; CT adds anatomic detail and is particularly useful when ultrasound windows are limited or when planning interventions, but it is less sensitive than ultrasound for septations and should not replace ultrasound for routine assessment; importantly, a single pH measurement can misclassify multiloculated parapneumonic effusions because pH varies between locules, so I need to ensure sampling strategy accounts for this heterogeneity [^69b40446] [^6c2f45f0] [^dc2d22bc] [^c7db2da0].

> Hold on, I should verify the prognostic implications. Loculations signal a more complicated disease process and are associated with higher risks of treatment failure, prolonged symptoms, and need for invasive procedures; in parapneumonic effusions, loculation correlates with the fibrinopurulent stage and predicts need for chest tube drainage, intrapleural fibrinolytics, or surgery; in malignant pleural effusions, loculations reduce the likelihood of successful pleurodesis and favor indwelling pleural catheters; in pericardial disease, loculated effusions can cause regional tamponade physiology and may be missed by echocardiography, necessitating CT or CMR for localization and planning [^4ab05966] [^154065f3] [^26101749] [^3e9b7bf0].

> Next, I should review parapneumonic effusions and empyema. I need to ensure I apply the right triggers for drainage: large or loculated effusions, purulent fluid, pH less than 7.20, glucose less than 60 mg/dL, LDH greater than 1000 IU/L, or positive Gram stain/culture warrant tube thoracostomy; intrapleural fibrinolytics reduce surgical referrals in early fibrinopurulent disease, with tPA/DNase supported by randomized data, though patient selection and timing matter; suPAR outperforms pH for predicting need for invasive management, and I should double-check that threshold — yes, pleural suPAR above about 35–65 ng/mL predicts loculation and rescue therapies with high AUC, which can refine decisions when imaging is equivocal [^4ab05966] [^eca7ec93] [^9c792e9c] [^2dce2165].

> Let me consider malignant pleural effusions carefully. Initially, I thought pleurodesis might still be reasonable in loculated MPE, but wait, I should correct that — guidelines suggest indwelling pleural catheters over chemical pleurodesis in loculated effusions because pleurodesis is less likely to succeed; IPCs improve symptoms and reduce hospital stay, though loculations can impair drainage in 5–14% and may require catheter manipulation, intrapleural fibrinolytics, or additional catheters; tPA or tPA/DNase can restore drainage in selected patients, with retrospective data showing high response rates and low bleeding risk, but I should confirm that evidence quality is low and decisions should be individualized [^154065f3] [^97a4736c] [^9e0baa9d] [^c6323da5] [^d1a9b345].

> I will now examine pericardial effusions. Echocardiography remains first-line, but loculated pericardial effusions can be missed due to acoustic windows; CT or CMR helps localize collections, detect clots or debris, and plan safe drainage trajectories; in postoperative or post-procedural settings, loculated effusions can compress specific chambers and cause regional tamponade, so I need to maintain a high index of suspicion when hemodynamics and symptoms are discordant with a seemingly "small" effusion on echo [^26101749] [^cb17b6ed] [^3e9b7bf0].

> But wait, what about special scenarios and mimics. Pulmonary embolism can produce loculated pleural effusions, often lymphocytic exudates that resolve with anticoagulation; tuberculosis pleuritis frequently loculates and may leave trapped lung; interlobar effusions from heart failure can mimic masses; and rare entities like paragonimiasis can cause recurrent loculated effusions requiring antiparasitic therapy and drainage; I should confirm that these are considered when the clinical picture does not fit common causes [^cc9cb905] [^1ab876e3] [^72ac2e83] [^9534a4ff] [^d9d36d4d].

> Next, I should review emerging biomarkers and where they fit. suPAR consistently predicts loculation and need for invasive management in pleural infection, outperforming pH and conventional markers, but I need to emphasize that prospective, multicenter trials are still needed before routine adoption; PAI-1 activity and fibrinolytic potential are promising mechanistic markers under investigation; until then, I should integrate suPAR with imaging and clinical trajectory rather than rely on it in isolation [^9c792e9c] [^74d79f5c].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check alignment with guidelines. For any suspected effusion, start with ultrasound to confirm, quantify, and characterize loculations; if ultrasound is limited or intervention is planned, add CT for anatomic mapping; perform diagnostic thoracentesis when the effusion is new, unilateral, or larger than minimal, and consider sampling multiple locules if parapneumonic and pH is borderline; in parapneumonic effusions, escalate to drainage and fibrinolytics when indicated by size, loculation, or biochemical markers, using suPAR to refine risk; in malignant effusions, prefer IPCs when loculated or nonexpandable lung is present; in pericardial disease, use echo first and add CT/CMR if loculation is suspected or drainage is planned; throughout, use image guidance for all procedures to minimize complications [^e5255fe6] [^69b40446] [^154065f3] [^26101749].

> Key takeaway, and I should confirm this is supported: loculated effusions reflect organized, fibrin-rich collections that resist passive drainage and signal higher risks of treatment failure; ultrasound is the cornerstone for detection and procedural planning, CT refines anatomy, and suPAR is a promising biomarker to predict need for invasive therapy; management must be etiology-specific, with early source control in infection and symptom-focused, catheter-based strategies in malignancy, always anchored to shared decision-making and patient goals of care [^69b40446] [^9c792e9c] [^154065f3].

---

Loculated effusions are **pleural fluid collections divided by fibrin septations** into non-communicating compartments, most often due to infection, malignancy, or inflammation [^4db2c1b1]. They are best identified by **ultrasound** [^69b40446], which outperforms CT for detecting septations and guiding safe drainage [^dc2d22bc]. Management is **etiology-specific**: parapneumonic effusions often need chest tube drainage with intrapleural fibrinolytics [^4ab05966] [^eca7ec93], malignant effusions are managed with indwelling pleural catheters [^154065f3], and pericardial loculations may require echocardiography-guided drainage or surgery [^26101749]. Early recognition and image-guided therapy are essential to prevent complications such as trapped lung, fibrothorax, or tamponade [^7a05a344] [^3e9b7bf0].

---

## Pathophysiology

Loculated effusions arise from **fibrin deposition and septation** within the pleural space, creating multiple non-communicating fluid pockets. This process is driven by inflammation, infection, or malignancy, which disrupt normal pleural fluid dynamics and fibrinolysis [^4db2c1b1] [^427a2d20].

---

## Etiology

Loculated effusions occur in diverse clinical contexts; the **most common causes** include:

| **Etiology** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Parapneumonic effusions <br/> - Empyema <br/> - Tuberculous pleurisy [^1f8229a4] [^72ac2e83] |
| Malignant | - Malignant pleural effusions (lung, breast, lymphoma) [^8a2986a4] |
| Inflammatory | - Rheumatoid pleurisy <br/> - Lupus pleuritis [^notfound] |
| Traumatic | - Hemothorax with organization <br/> - Post-surgical adhesions [^notfound] |
| Pulmonary embolism | - Delayed loculated pleural effusions [^cc9cb905] [^1ab876e3] |

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients typically present with:

- **Dyspnea**: from restricted lung expansion and compression atelectasis [^95283f7c].
- **Pleuritic chest pain**: from pleural inflammation and adhesions.
- **Cough**: often dry, from pleural irritation.
- **Systemic symptoms**: fever and malaise, especially in infectious etiologies [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Imaging modalities

- **Ultrasound (US)**: First-line for detection, characterization, and guidance of interventions; superior to CT for identifying septations and loculations [^69b40446] [^dc2d22bc].
- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Useful for detailed anatomical mapping, especially when ultrasound is limited or prior to surgical planning [^cb17b6ed].
- **Chest radiography**: Limited sensitivity; may miss or underestimate loculations [^notfound].

---

### Laboratory analysis

Pleural fluid analysis distinguishes exudative from transudative effusions and guides etiologic diagnosis. In parapneumonic effusions, **low pH (< 7.20), low glucose (< 60 mg/dL), and high LDH (> 1,000 IU/L)** indicate complicated effusions requiring drainage [^4ab05966] [^c51dcba0].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying etiology**, extent of loculation, and patient factors:

---

### Parapneumonic effusions and empyema

- **Chest tube drainage**: Indicated for complicated parapneumonic effusions or empyema [^4ab05966].
- **Intrapleural fibrinolytics**: tPA with or without DNase improves drainage and reduces surgical referrals [^eca7ec93] [^427a2d20].
- **Surgical intervention**: VATS or decortication if medical therapy fails or fibrothorax develops [^7a05a344].

---

### Malignant pleural effusions

Indwelling pleural catheters (**IPCs**) are preferred for symptomatic loculated malignant effusions, offering effective palliation and reduced hospital stay [^154065f3] [^97a4736c]. Intrapleural **fibrinolytics** may be considered for IPC malfunction due to loculations, though evidence is limited [^9e0baa9d] [^c6323da5].

---

### Pericardial effusions

Echocardiography guides diagnosis and management; **CT or CMR** helps define loculations and plan interventions [^26101749] [^72361f5c]. Pericardiocentesis or surgical drainage is indicated for **hemodynamic compromise** or **loculated collections** [^notfound].

---

## Complications

Untreated or inadequately managed loculated effusions can lead to:

- **Trapped lung**: From pleural fibrosis and adhesions [^9e0baa9d].
- **Fibrothorax**: Chronic pleural thickening with restrictive physiology [^notfound].
- **Empyema**: Persistent infection with sepsis risk [^notfound].
- **Tamponade**: In loculated pericardial effusions [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by **etiology and timeliness of intervention**. Early recognition and appropriate therapy improve outcomes, whereas delayed treatment increases morbidity and mortality [^1ab20950].

---

Loculated effusions are **complex pleural collections** requiring targeted imaging and etiology-specific therapy. Ultrasound is the diagnostic cornerstone, and early, image-guided interventions — including drainage and fibrinolytics — are essential to prevent complications and improve outcomes [^69b40446] [^4ab05966].

Purpose Of Review

The review highlights both the radiographic and the fluid characteristics of pleural effusions occurring in patients with pulmonary embolism.

Recent Findings

Recent data show that one third of patients with pulmonary embolism have pleural effusions as demonstrated by chest radiograph. By using computed tomography or ultrasonography, pleural effusions have been observed in half of these patients. The effusions occupy one third or less of the hemithorax in 90% of the patients and are unilateral in more than three quarters of them (even if computed tomography is the reference technique). On computed tomography, about 20% of pleural effusions show loculations, which is true particularly in those patients with a delayed diagnosis. Although previously thought to be transudates on occasion, two recent series found that all of the effusions are exudates.

Summary

Pleural effusions associated with pulmonary embolism are usually small, unilateral and exudative when analyzed. If the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is delayed, the effusion may become loculated.

Loculated MPE

Loculated MPE involves multiple fluid collections in separate pockets, often requiring a chest tube in each pocket to obtain successful drainage. Loculations can prevent complete drainage of the pleural space and limit lung re-expansion, often contraindicating talc pleurodesis or resulting in insufficient symptomatic relief from IPCs. Loculations and septations may coexist. Up to 14% of patients with MPE develop symptomatic loculations, and septated effusions may progress to loculated forms.

The guidelines differ in terms of loculated MPE treatment recommendations. ATS recommends IPC over talc pleurodesis because IPC may enable further drainage of fluid, alleviation of symptoms, avoidance of admission, and fewer subsequent procedures. The guideline also emphasizes the heterogeneity within the loculated effusion group, such that patients with few loculations may still benefit from talc pleurodesis. Minimally invasive decortication may be considered in patients with a good performance status and low LENT score.

The ERS/EATC and SECT guidelines lack strong recommendations, noting that a nonexpandable lung contraindicates pleurodesis and that IPCs may fail to completely drain the pleural space, limiting symptom improvement. Both guidelines suggest intrapleural fibrinolytics, acknowledging their limited effects on dyspnea or pleurodesis success. The ERS/EATC guideline adds that thoracic surgery may be needed for multiple loculations, particularly near the mediastinum, with limited options for surgically ineligible patients.BTS guidelines provide no specific recommendations for loculated MPE, except for referral to the pleural team.

In our experience, therapeutic thoracentesis can be initially performed in loculated cases, as in nonloculated effusions, to observe the effect on dyspnea and pulmonary expansibility. This procedure can aid in differentiating loculated effusions from atelectasis or consolidation, and facilitates pleural fluid analysis if not previously conducted. An exception to this would be if the decision had been taken to treat the loculated MPE with an IPC, in which case the IPC could be inserted without previous therapeutic thoracentesis.

### SuPAR surprises as a biomarker of invasive outcomes in pleural infection [^6bae221b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Loculations, however, are not good predictors of ability to drain pleural effusions; they are often (but not necessarily correctly) the reason why chest tubes are inserted and intrapleural therapy and/or surgery is initiated. Currently, there is no consensus about the definition of "loculation", let alone a validated quantification method of loculation in the literature. In daily practice, a loculated effusion can range from a few septations to extensive "honeycombing". In the study by Arnold and colleagues, loculation was graded as "yes" or "no" without a preset definition, often by junior staff. This highlights the need for a way to evaluate the severity of loculation within the pleural cavity, and suPAR may serve such a role. If so, the next step will be to determine what outcome suPAR (or degree of loculation) accurately predicts various pleural diseases extending beyond infection.

The results of the work of Arnold and colleagues add credence to the possibility that suPAR may contribute to the regulation of pleural loculation in addition to its role as a biomarker. suPAR is known to bind scuPA (single-chain urokinase plasminogen activator), which increases its ability to exhibit plasminogen activator activity. suPAR can also bind the more active two-chain urokinase (tcuPA) that derives from plasmin-mediated cleavage of scuPA and thus could localize plasminogen activator activity within pleural fluids. These effects could support fibrinolysis in the presence of low concentrations of PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor) that may occur after intrapleural administration of fibrinolysins, as occurs when scuPA is administered intrapleurally. However, suPAR-bound single- or two-chain uPA is susceptible to PAI-1, and increments of PAI-1 are generally seen in pleural loculation in pleural infection. Thus, the role of suPAR in the regulation of intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy remains unclear and is worthy of further investigation.

Apart from suPAR, other new inflammation- and fibrinolysis-related biomarkers of the outcomes of pleural infection may soon emerge. For instance, PAI-1 and its activity have likewise been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of pleural injury outcomes. The ability of baseline pleural fluids to support fibrinolytic activity, called the "fibrinolytic potential", is another candidate biomarker. The clinical implication of these markers as predictors of treatment or prognosis provides a new and exciting area of pleural disease research.

### Distinguishing complicated from uncomplicated parapneumonic effusions [^c51dcba0]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Treatment of parapneumonic effusions (PPEs) is challenged by the decision of whether or not to insert chest tubes. This review focuses on the factors that may aid in determining which patients require an immediate drainage of the pleural space, that is, have a complicated PPE.

Recent Findings

Clinical guidelines advocate the evaluation of radiological (large effusion or loculation), bacteriological (Gram-positive stain or culture), biochemical (pH < 7.20 or glucose < 60 mg/dl), and macroscopic (pus) characteristics of the pleural fluid to assist in the identification of complicated PPEs. In the past few years, a number of new pleural fluid biomarkers have been tested for the same purpose, but with the exception of C-reactive protein (CRP), they should be considered investigative. A pleural fluid CRP higher than 100 mg/l or a serum CRP higher than 200 mg/l, when combined with pleural fluid pH or glucose, may greatly increase our capability to predict the need for instituting tube thoracostomy. Although some ultrasonographic and computed tomography features favor the diagnosis of pleural infection, their role in uncomplicated-complicated PPE discrimination has not been systematically evaluated.

Summary

No pleural fluid tests, other than pH or glucose, have gained wide acceptance for the assessment of patients with PPE. However, if corroborated with further studies, the measurement of pleural fluid or serum CRP, in combination with the classical fluid parameters, may have the potential to be incorporated into medical decision making.

### Percutaneous management of parapneumonic effusions [^b06cd96a]. European Journal of Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Parapneumonic effusions continue to be a significant source of morbidity and mortality. Treatment at earlier stages before fibrous peel and loculations occur has a much better prognosis. Using image guidance, addition of intracavitary fibrinolytic instillation, close follow-up with drainage of residual or new collections are some of the other factors that improve prognosis. In this article, we discussed treatment strategies, percutaneous management of parapneumonic effusions, its alternatives and results.

### British thoracic society guideline for pleural disease [^3cc824c4]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for pleural effusion, more specifically with respect to patients with malignant pleural effusion, indwelling pleural catheter, BTS 2023 guidelines recommend to refer patients back to the primary pleural team for further assessment in case of complications, such as infection refractory to community management, suspected drain fracture, loculations, or blockage with persistent breathlessness.

### Diagnosis and management of parapneumonic effusions and empyema [^1ab20950]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Approximately 1 million patients develop parapneumonic effusions (PPEs) annually in the United States. The outcome of these effusions is related to the interval between the onset of clinical symptoms and presentation to the physician, comorbidities, and timely management. Early antibiotic treatment usually prevents the development of a PPE and its progression to a complicated PPE and empyema. Pleural fluid analysis provides diagnostic information and guides therapy. If the PPE is small to moderate in size, free-flowing, and nonpurulent (pH, > 7.30), it is highly likely that antibiotic treatment alone will be effective. Prolonged pneumonia symptoms before evaluation, pleural fluid with a pH < 7.20, and loculated pleural fluid suggest the need for pleural space drainage. The presence of pus (empyema) aspirated from the pleural space always requires drainage. Fibrinolytics are most likely to be effective during the early fibrinolytic stage and may make surgical drainage unnecessary. If pleural space drainage is ineffective, video-assisted thoracic surgery should be performed without delay.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions. An official ATS / STS / STR clinical practice guideline [^154065f3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) with nonexpandable lung, failed pleurodesis, or loculated effusion — indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) is suggested over chemical pleurodesis with low-certainty evidence, supported by reduced length of stay and low complication rates. In patients with symptomatic MPEs with nonexpandable lung, failed pleurodesis, or loculated effusion, we suggest the use of IPCs over chemical pleurodesis (conditional recommendation), very low confidence in estimate of effects; Tables E4F and E5F). No difference was demonstrated in mortality in the single comparative study, and reduced hospital stay favored IPCs with 19 of 34 patients with IPC (56%) staying in the hospital less than 2 days compared with 0 of 7 patients receiving talc pleurodesis. Pooled complications across case series were relatively low for empyema (2.4%) and cellulitis (3.8%). Additional context includes that pleurodesis is unsuccessful in up to 20% of patients and as many as 14% develop symptomatic loculations after prior treatment; fibrinolytics for IPC-related loculations had a small (3%) risk of nonfatal hemorrhagic complications, a recent RCT suggested no benefit of intrapleural urokinase, and no studies reported breathlessness or treatment failures as an outcome.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions. An official ATS / STS / STR clinical practice guideline [^53931da9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Management of patients with known or suspected malignant pleural effusion (MPE) — the algorithm branches to "Asymptomatic", where "Pleural intervention not needed (unless for diagnostic purposes)", and to "Symptomatic", where "Ultrasound-guided therapeutic thoracentesis (i.e., large-volume tap*)" is performed "With goals of assessing lung expansion and relief of dyspnea" and "may not be necessary if the patient's dyspnea is known to be attributable to the MPE". Subsequent decision-making includes "Lung re-expansion"; if "Predicted very short survival", then "Palliate dyspnea with: repeat thoracentesis if needed, oxygen, morphine", whereas if not, "Consider placement of IPC (IPC should also be considered in patients with failed pleurodesis or symptomatic loculated effusion)". When lung re-expansion is achieved, proceed to "Discussion of relative risks / benefits of IPC vs. pleurodesis vs. combination approaches" and consider "Talc poudrage or talc slurry ± IPC". For "Evidence of IPC-related infection", the pathway directs "Initiation of oral antibiotics based on local sensitivities. Attempt to keep catheter in place"; the footnote notes "there is a low likelihood (2–4%) of indwelling pleural catheter (IPC)–related infection" and that escalation of care "should be made on a case-by-case basis and is recommended if there are any signs/symptoms of worsening infection". A prognostic caution states "Physicians are not great predictors of prognosis" and the "Predicted very short survival" recommendation "should be used as a rough guideline and individualized on a case-by-case basis".

### Diagnostically significant variations in pleural fluid pH in loculated parapneumonic effusions [^c7db2da0]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Parapneumonic effusions are common, and measurement of pleural pH is one of the most useful measurements in assessing the need for tube drainage. Use of pleural pH assumes that a single measurement conveys a representative picture of pH throughout the effusion. Often effusions are multiloculated, and varying concentrations of nondiffusible acids such as lactic acid, if present in different concentrations, could mean clinically significant variations in pH between locules. If these differences were large, a single pH measurement could misrepresent the "stage" that the parapneumonic effusion had reached. We therefore set out to test the hypothesis that pH varies significantly between locules in complicated parapneumonic effusions.

Design

The study was performed in seven consecutive patients presenting to our institution with complicated parapneumonic effusions.

Interventions

In each case, pleural pH was measured in several separate pleural fluid locules, using ultrasound-guided pleural fluid sampling.

Results

Significant variations were found in pleural fluid visual appearance, pH, and lactate dehydrogenase between locules in four of seven patients. Three of seven patients had variations, resulting in pH levels both above and below 7.2, which is the threshold used in our institution to indicate the need for tube drainage.

Conclusions

This is the first reported series of variation in pleural pH between different locules in complicated parapneumonic effusions. These variations are clinically important and cast light on the mechanisms responsible for the acidosis seen in infected effusions. Physicians should be aware of this when making drainage decisions in these patients using the clinical picture and a single pH result alone.

### Automated detection, segmentation, and classification of pleural effusion from computed tomography scans using machine learning [^b8760186]. Investigative Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Computer-aided quantification and diagnosis systems have become widely available in thoracic radiology, and various pathologies can be automatically detected, segmented and classified on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT). – For pleural disease, effusions can be detected accurately from radiographs, also with deep learning–based image analysis. However, the occurrenceand amount, of effusions are independent prognostic indicators. This became evident in the COVID-19 pandemic when infected patients with pleural effusions had a higher incidence of severe courses, prolonged hospital stays, and higher mortality rates.

Compared with radiography, CT provides accurate pleural effusion quantification; nevertheless, in radiology reports, effusions are commonly described only qualitatively because manual delineation is time-consuming. Automated quantification methods based on traditional image processing or atlas segmentation have resulted in moderate performance, have not included effusion-free control cohorts, or had limited sample sizes.

Computed tomography is especially relevant for a detailed assessment of effusion subtypes (ie, hemothorax, empyema, malignant effusion, and pneumothorax) and for detection of the causative diagnosis. Additional pleural complexity features, such as hyperdense fluid, pleural thickening, gas, and loculation, are used to differentiate between serous and these more complex effusion subtypes – (from now on referred to as simple and complex effusions, respectively). This differentiation has implications for patient management – and outcome, whereas machine learning models could also be used for CT-guided planning and fast detection of associated periprocedural pneumothorax and hemothorax.

### American Society of Echocardiography clinical recommendations for multimodality cardiovascular imaging of patients with pericardial disease: endorsed by the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance and Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^8f16ce9c]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Pericardial effusion CMR tissue characterization uses gated images and signal characteristics to suggest composition and complexity. Using gated images to limit cardiac motion of the beating heart, some CMR features help characterize the nature of pericardial effusion. Transudative effusions usually exhibit low signal intensity on standard dark-blood images. The presence of loculations, septations, and debris on CMR suggests a complex pericardial effusion. Proteinaceous, exudative, and hemorrhagic effusions generally exhibit high signal intensity on both T1 and T2 images because of their high protein content. Acute hemorrhage into the pericardial space usually exhibits low signal intensity on gradient-echo images, although both the composition of the fluid and time from hemorrhage affect the CMR appearance.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was an improvement in respiratory symptoms, or if this was not documented, an increase in IPC drainage volume or decrease in pleural effusion on subsequent chest x-ray was used as a surrogate. Secondary endpoints included repeat pleural procedures (eg, thoracentesis, IPC reinsertion, chest tube insertion, or surgical intervention), IPC removal due to spontaneous pleurodesis, and IPC-related complications including pleural infection, skin infection, hemorrhage requiring transfusion, catheter tract metastasis, IPC-related hospitalization, and IPC-related death. As a tertiary objective, we also aimed to characterize the natural history, prognosis, and complications of IPCs and pleural fluid loculations.

Statistical Analysis

We summarized the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with symptomatic loculated MPEs using descriptive statistics. For the primary outcome, we constructed frequency tables based on each intervention and used bivariate logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio with associated 95% confidence intervals of each intervention compared with tPA as the reference. For the secondary outcomes of pleurodesis, repeat procedure, and complications, we conducted survival analysis using cumulative incidence functions with death as a competing risk. Patients were censored if they did not meet the outcome of interest or death by the end of the study period. We then used the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model to estimate the hazard ratio and associated 95% confidence intervals of each intervention compared with tPA as the reference. For patients who had multiple IPCs during the study period, only the first IPC with loculations was included. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 software. Statistical significance was defined as P -value < 0.05 for all analyses.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for parapneumonic effusion and empyema, more specifically with respect to pleural fluid analysis, BTS 2023 guidelines recommend to be vigilant of alternative diagnoses likely to mimic parapneumonic effusion with a low pH and potential for loculations, such as rheumatoid effusion, effusions due to advanced malignancy/mesothelioma.

### Pleural fluid suPAR levels predict the need for invasive management in parapneumonic effusions [^7560635e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The management of parapneumonic effusions has been dictated by crude measures of inflammation and bacterial replication for decades. The uPA system plays a key role in the development of pleural loculations and is a theoretically promising target of study. This prospective cohort study demonstrated that high pleural fluid suPAR levels are strongly correlated with the development of loculations in parapneumonic effusions, as well as subsequent invasive management, including chest tube drainage, fibrinolytics, and thoracic surgery. A comprehensive assessment of the utility of pleural suPAR in parapneumonic effusions requires a prospective multicenter trial of suPAR-guided management versus standard care.

### Thoracentesis under fluoroscopic control… [^44af2711]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

A ROUTINE thoracentesis performed on the ward often fails to yield fluid, particularly when only a small amount is present. 1 In such cases, thoracentesis performed under fluoroscopic control offers a safe, quick, and relatively inexpensive method to remove fluid into the pleural space. At our institution, we have performed more than 100 thoracenteses under fluoroscopic guidance to obtain fluid for diagnosis. The indications have been the following: Suspected small pleural effusion. Loculated pleural effusion. Repeated, unsuccessful attempts at withdrawal by conventional means. Patients who need pleural biopsy as well as thoracentesis. Patients who cannot tolerate upright thoracentesis.

Patients who need replacement of fluid with a chemical agent Methods and Materials This procedure takes approximately ten minutes and requires a minimum of materials, which include 14-gauge intracatheter needle, Collins JD, Byrd SE, Bassett LW.

Coronary perforation (CP) poses a significant risk of morbidity and mortality, particularly, in patients with a history of cardiac surgery. The occurrence of loculated pericardial effusion presents distinctive challenges in these postcardiac surgical patients. This study delves into the complexities arising from the formation of loculated pericardial effusions subsequent to CP, with a specific focus on the loculated effusion in the posterior wall leading to left atrial compression syndrome. This analysis is dedicated to elucidating pathophysiology diagnostic and treatment strategies tailored for addressing left atrium compression syndrome, providing invaluable insights into the intricacies of diagnosing, treating, and managing this entity in the postcardiac surgical patient.

### Parapneumonic effusions and empyema [^7a05a344]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Parapneumonic effusions occur in 20 to 40% of patients who are hospitalized with pneumonia. The mortality rate in patients with a parapneumonic effusion is higher than that in patients with pneumonia without a parapneumonic effusion. Some of the excess mortality is due to mismanagement of the parapneumonic effusion. Characteristics of patients that indicate that an invasive procedure will be necessary for its resolution include the following: an effusion occupying more than 50% of the hemithorax or one that is loculated; a positive Gram stain or culture of the pleural fluid; and a purulent pleural fluid that has a pH below 7.20 or a glucose below 60, or has a lactic acid dehydrogenase level of more than three times the upper normal limit for serum. Patients with pneumonia and an effusion of more than minimal size should have a therapeutic thoracentesis. If the fluid cannot be removed with a therapeutic thoracentesis, a chest tube should be inserted and consideration be given to the intrapleural instillation of fibrinolytics. If the loculated effusion persists, the patient should be subjected to video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, and if the lung cannot be expanded with this procedure, a full thoracotomy with decortication should be performed. The definitive procedure should be performed within 14 d.

### CDC guidelines for the prevention and treatment of anthrax, 2023 [^03ae1ae7]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Special Considerations for Inhalation and Ingestion Anthrax

Pleural effusion and other fluid collections are common complications of anthrax. Hypothetically, draining pleural fluid or ascites might reduce the amount of lethal factor, thereby reducing illness severity and decreasing mortality. In addition, drainage of pleural fluid is believed to improve survival by decreasing mechanical lung compression. Early and aggressive drainage of any clinically or radiographically apparent pleural effusion is recommended; chest tube drainage is preferred over thoracentesis because many effusions will require prolonged drainage. Thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracic surgery might be required to remove gelatinous or loculated collections. Ascites should also be drained, if feasible, and monitored for reaccumulation; continuous drainage might be required. Standard precautions are sufficient when caring for anthrax patients. The exception is when the patient is potentially contaminated with B. anthracis spores. In such cases, the patient should be isolated in an airborne infection isolation room until decontamination is completed.

### Thoracic ultrasound for pleural effusion in the intensive care unit: a narrative review from diagnosis to treatment [^6c2f45f0]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Ultrasound guidance helps to locate the insertion site and prevent organ perforation. Diacon et al. compared ultrasound and physical examination to identify the pleural puncture site for thoracentesis. Ultrasound increased the number of accurate sites detected (presence/absence and thickness of the pleural effusion) by 26% compared to chest percussion, and prevented potential complications in 15% of clinically determined puncture sites. Three characteristics were associated with puncture site inaccuracy: small effusions (p < 0.001), radiological evidence of fluid loculation (p ≤ 0.01), and sharp costodiaphragmatic angle on CXR (p < 0.001). Several other studies confirm the superiority of ultrasound to detect the best puncture site and reduce complications (e.g. pneumothorax). Consequently, The British Thoracic Society pleural disease guideline 2010 concluded that, "site selection for all pleural aspiration should be ultrasound guided".

### Pleural fluid suPAR levels predict the need for invasive management in parapneumonic effusions [^427a2d20]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Loculations develop due to derangement of the normal fibrinolysis cascade mediated by the uPA system (Figure 5). This is composed of a proteinase called uPA, a cell-bound uPAR, and suPAR. suPAR, the soluble form of uPAR, is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 55 to 60 kDa. uPAR is cleaved from its glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor by various proteases related to infection and inflammation. The uPA system is involved in pericellular proteolysis, cell migration, and tissue remodeling. Most notably, uPA, once bound to uPAR, catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen into plasmin, a potent endogenous fibrinolytic. It has been demonstrated in both animal models and humans that the development of pleural loculations is related to levels of PAI-1, which is released by pleural mesothelial cells. PAI-1 inhibits uPA and, therefore, the conversion of plasminogen, as well as suppressing the activity of several other endogenous and therapeutic fibrinolytics. Given these pathological roles, it is logical that PAI-1 itself could serve as a biomarker of pleural organization; however, this is limited by the instability and variation of the enzyme. We have shown that in parapneumonic effusions pleural suPAR is dramatically raised in the presence or even future development of pleural loculations. The biological role of suPAR in pleural fluid are less well understood. Although neutrophil-bound uPAR is inversely correlated with suPAR levels in critically ill patients, binding of scuPA to suPAR increases its plasminogen activation activity, suggesting that suPAR can augment pleural fluid plasminogen activator activity and plasmin generation. This interaction could localize plasminogen activation within pleural fluid, similar to that which occurs at cell surfaces. Measurement of suPAR could potentially provide a method to assess the capacity of pleural fluids to support uPA-related plasminogen activator activity. The MIST-2 (Multicenter Intrapleural Sepsis Trial 2) trial demonstrated that the combination of intrapleural alteplase and DNase improved radiographic appearance and reduced hospital length of stay and surgical referral rates in pleural infection. However, uncertainty persists around patient selection and optimal timing of both fibrinolytics and surgical intervention given the difficulty of predicting the course of pleural infection at baseline. Given its ability to predict the development of complicated effusions, suPAR may be an opportunity to use biomarkers in lung precision medicine to identify which patients are likely to require admission for drainage and early rescue treatments, addressing a "specific clinical unmet need".

### The pathogenesis of pleural space loculation and fibrosis [^4db2c1b1]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Organization of parapneumonic effusions may complicate pneumonia, and, annually, thousands of patients require procedures to treat intrapleural loculation and fibrosis. Surgical procedures are often used for the treatment, as fibrinolytic therapy is now not a routine and is undergoing reassessment. Investigation of mechanisms that underlie intrapleural loculation and fibrosis is therefore timely, as are studies on new strategies to medically address these problems with improved efficacy and safety.

Recent Findings

Contributions made over the past year include basic and translational studies unified by their broad focus on mechanisms by which the pleural compartment undergoes repair. Intrapleural single-chain urokinase was reported to effectively reverse intrapleural loculation when compared with commercially available agents in rabbits with tetracycline-induced pleurodesis. The ability of exogenous sclerosants to produce intrapleural loculation and fibrosis was compared. Overexpression of transforming growth factor beta in the pleural mesothelium promoted subpleural fibrosis, implicating the mesothelial cell in the pathogenesis of this lesion. A new model of pleurodesis in mice was reported, which could facilitate the use of transgenic animals to study the pathogenesis of pleural injury.

Summary

New findings consolidate and extend the view that common mechanisms by which intrapleural organization occurs can be exploited to either generate pleurodesis or effectively reverse intrapleural loculation and fibrosis.

### Clinical characteristics, evaluation and outcomes of chylopericardium: a systematic review [^9145e3b3]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

The proposed pathophysiology of CPE development is damage to the thoracic duct, leading to abnormal communication of lymphatic vessels between the thoracic duct and the pericardial space. This results in heightened thoracic duct pressure, yielding outflow of chyle into the pericardial space from the thoracic duct.

Imaging findings of CPE are often variable and non-specific for confirmatory diagnosis. CXR, echocardiography (echo), CT, CMR imaging and lymphangiography are the various modalities needed for diagnosis and management.CXR will often show enlarged cardiac silhouette, and identification on imaging should direct further evaluation for CPE. Echo is instrumental in detecting the presence of pericardial effusion secondary to CPE. Furthermore, echo can quantify effusion size and haemodynamic impact. However, notably echo does not provide information about the underlying pericardial effusion cause.

In the setting of pericardial disease, echo is also the initial diagnostic modality for patients who develop or are clinically suspected to have cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis (figure 2). Findings of collapse of the right atrium during systole, presence of inferior vena cava plethora and large pericardial effusion on echo may suggest concomitant cardiac tamponade. Septal bounce, respiratory variation of the mitral and tricuspid inflows on Doppler, plethoric inferior vena cava, and hepatic vein flow diastolic reversal during expiration are suggestive of constrictive pericarditis on echo.CT can also provide information about the localisation and quantification of pericardial effusion especially in cases of anterior and superior loculated effusions, which are difficult to detect on echocardiogram.CMR is not routinely performed for diagnosis and management of CPE, attributed to its accessibility and high cost in the real-world setting. However, in the setting of pericardial disease, CMR is particularly helpful in pericardial tissue characterisation, specifically identification of inflammation and oedema and assessment of pericardial thickness. Suggestive features of constrictive pericarditis on CMR include septal bounce, sudden termination of diastolic filling or respirophasic discrepancy in septal excursion. Lymphangiography is used most frequently for anatomical assessment of lymphatic leakage and can greatly guide surgical management of CPE.

### Efficacy of intrapleural tissue-type plasminogen activator in the treatment of loculated parapneumonic effusions [^b898c564]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the feasibility and effectiveness of intrapleural recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (r-tPA) in the treatment of loculated parapneumonic effusions (PPEs).

Materials and Methods

A single-arm prospective study of 25 consecutive patients with loculated PPEs was analyzed. All patients received 6-mg doses of intrapleural r-tPA on a defined schedule via a thoracostomy tube. The volume of output from the tubes was recorded and analysis of the fluid composition performed. Follow-up was both clinical and radiographic, with all patients undergoing pre- and postprocedural computed tomography.

Results

Eighteen of the 25 patients (72%) required no additional intervention and had a complete clinical and radiographic response with the fibrinolytic therapy. Seven patients (28%) were treated with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, but no patient required thoracotomy for total decortication. There were no hemorrhagic complications.

Conclusions

Intrapleural r-tPA is effective in the treatment of loculated PPEs. It can be performed safely and in some patients may avoid the need for additional surgical intervention.

### Pleural fluid suPAR levels predict the need for invasive management in parapneumonic effusions [^1b449617]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

A crucial factor in the management of parapneumonic effusions is the development of pleural thickening, septations, and loculations. The tendency for loculation development is not only associated with more severe infection; it also reduces the likely success of simple fluid drainage versus the need for more invasive medical (e.g. intrapleural fibrinolytics) or surgical therapies. Again, a low pleural pH is more likely in loculated effusions but is inaccurate because it is a sequalae of numerous biochemical reactions, not simply the derangement of normal fibrinolysis, so cannot be used as an indicator for fibrinolytics or surgery. Other markers to predict which patients might require more invasive management of their parapneumonic effusion have been elusive. Pleural fluid biomarkers such as procalcitonin, CRP, and calprotectin have been tested in parapneumonic effusions but, given these markers focus on neutrophilic activation and/or a general increase in chemo-cytokine activity, they are no more specific than pH in prognostication. Recent studies have tested cytokines involved in the production of pleural fluid but fewer have focused on those related to loculation development, for which suPAR seems a more specific target.

### Loculated interlobar pleural effusion due to congestive heart failure… [^9534a4ff]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In recent years the problem of cancer of the lung has been emphasized increasingly in the medical and lay press. Programs for mass x-ray surveys and the routine use of roentgenograms of the thorax as part of the physical examination have resulted in earlier detection of thoracic neoplasms, and improved surgical techniques have made the removal of these tumors more practicable. With this emphasis on the early detection and surgical removal of thoracic tumors, it seems appropriate to call attention to an uncommon and nonsurgical cause of a circumscribed density which may appear on the roentgenogram of the thorax. A loculated pleural effusion within an interlobar fissure can be of various shapes and sizes and can produce a density simulating a tumor or other types of disease of the lung on the roentgenogram of the thorax. These interlobar pleural effusions may be due to congestive heart failure, and, if so. HIGGINS JA, JUERGENS JL, BRUWER AJ, PARKIN TW.

### Pleural effusion: characterization with CT attenuation values and CT appearance [^6de0e417]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of CT in characterizing pleural effusions on the basis of attenuation values and CT appearance.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 100 pleural effusions in patients who underwent chest CT and diagnostic thoracentesis within 48 hours of each other. On the basis of Light's criteria, effusions were classified as exudates or transudates using laboratory biochemistry markers. The mean value in Hounsfield units of an effusion was determined using a region of interest on the three slices with the greatest quantity of fluid. All CT scans also were reviewed for the presence of additional pleural features such as fluid loculation, pleural thickening, and pleural nodules.

Results

Twenty-two of the 100 pleural effusions were transudates and 78 were exudates. The mean attenuation of the exudates (7.2 HU; [SD] 9.4 HU; range, 21–28 HU) was not significantly lower than the mean attenuation of the transudates (10.1 HU; 6.9 HU; range, 0.3–32 HU), (p = 0.24). None of the additional CT features accurately differentiated exudates from transudates (p > 0.1). Fluid loculation was found in 58% of exudates and in 36% of transudates. Pleural thickening was found in 59% of exudates and in 36% of transudates.

Conclusion

The clinical use of CT attenuation values to characterize pleural fluid is not accurate. Although fluid loculation, pleural thickness, and pleural nodules were more commonly found in patients with exudative effusions, the presence of these features does not accurately differentiate between exudates and transudates.

The following constitutes key background information on pleural effusion:

- **Definition**: Pleural effusion is a disease characterized by pathologic accumulation of fluid in the pleural space.
- **Pathophysiology**: Common causes of pleural effusions include congestive HF, pneumonia, malignancy, and PE.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of pleural effusion in the US is estimated at 400 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Accumulation of fluid in the pleural space with resultant pleural irritation and compression atelectasis results in clinical manifestations of dyspnea, pleuritic pain, and dry cough.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In hospitalized patients, pleural effusion is associated with 30-day and 1-year mortality of 15% and 32%, respectively.

American Thoracic Society — Asymptomatic malignant pleural effusion (MPE) management — we suggest that therapeutic pleural interventions not be performed in patients with known or suspected MPE who are asymptomatic (conditional recommendation, very low confidence in estimate of effects; Tables E4B and E5B). Data are insufficient to recommend sampling or draining these asymptomatic effusions, and drainage would only subject the patient to the risks of the procedure without providing clinical benefit; however, if pleural fluid is required for diagnostic purposes, fluid and/or tissue sampling would be appropriate.

Pericardial effusion — definition, causes, imaging goals, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) size grading: Pericardial effusion is defined by the accumulation of > 50 mL of fluid in the pericardial space. Approximately one-half of pericardial effusions are idiopathic; in North America and Western Europe, postviral infection is the most common identifiable cause, whereas tuberculosis is the most common cause in places where it is endemic. The objectives of imaging pericardial effusions are to support diagnosis, evaluate the size and location of the effusion, assess its hemodynamic impact, and inform decisions regarding drainage, if indicated, and TTE is the first-line imaging investigation. Echocardiographic size categories are: trivial (< 1.0 cm and not visualized throughout cardiac cycle), small (< 1.0 cm), moderate (1.0–1.9 cm), large (2.0–2.5 cm), and very large (> 2.5 cm). Common mimickers on echocardiography include a left pleural effusion and an epicardial fat pad that has a heterogenous echodensity, moves with the myocardium, and is often located anterior to the right ventricle.

### SuPAR surprises as a biomarker of invasive outcomes in pleural infection [^54127760]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Arnold and colleagues found that pleural fluid suPAR concentrations were increased in 37 patients with pleural infections versus 47 control subjects who had either transudative effusions or malignancy. The pleural fluids were removed at presentation and archived, after which suPAR concentrations were measured using a commercially available assay. The assay detects suPAR (consisting of domains I–III) and the suPAR (or uPAR) domains II and III, so that the readout of the assay reflects intact suPAR and a fragment that may be present in solution. In addition, the assay may also detect the membrane-bound cell receptor uPAR because microvesicles or cellular fragments may be present in pleural fluids.

Pleural fluid suPAR concentrations were significantly elevated in pleural fluids obtained from patients with loculated pleural infection versus those with infection who did not have progression to loculation. Although traditional biomarker trends were similar, pleural fluid suPAR concentrations predicted subsequent chest tube insertion more accurately than did pleural fluid pH. Pleural fluid suPAR also more accurately predicted the need for more invasive management, as assessed by referral for intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy or thoracic surgery.

Clinician behavior in deciding on chest tube drainage, and more so in employing fibrinolytic therapy and surgery, is notoriously variable among or even within medical centers. It is therefore most intriguing that pleural fluid suPAR concentrations are able to predict these rather difficult clinical decisions. Can this be chance, or is suPAR causally related to more severe (or worsening of) parapneumonic effusions? To make a firm statement about the clinical relevance of suPAR will require a prospective validation cohort from different healthcare systems with assessment against clinical data relating to patient progress (e.g. ongoing fever, leukocyte counts, and C-reactive protein) and predetermined criteria for intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy and/or surgery.

Is it possible that suPAR is a marker of pleural loculation not specific to pleural infection? Pleural loculation is usually an indirect reflection of the degree of inflammation and not solely found in parapneumonic effusions. The authors provide data showing that similar results were found within an albeit small malignant effusion cohort, supporting this hypothesis. The findings suggest that high-grade inflammation that progresses to intrapleural organization results in elevations in pleural fluid suPAR that in turn can predict the need for interventions to expedite drainage in patients with pleural infection.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® workup of pleural effusion or pleural disease [^d6f78c29]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pleural effusions are categorized as transudative or exudative, with transudative effusions usually reflecting the sequala of a systemic etiology and exudative effusions usually resulting from a process localized to the pleura. Common causes of transudative pleural effusions include congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and renal failure, whereas exudative effusions are typically due to infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disorders. This document summarizes appropriateness guidelines for imaging in four common clinical scenarios in patients with known or suspected pleural effusion or pleural disease. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Pleural fluid suPAR levels predict the need for invasive management in parapneumonic effusions [^26e010c0]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The clinical spectrum of pleural effusions related to infection is wide. From simple parapneumonic effusions that settle with conservative management through to grossly septated fibrinopurulent collections needing chest tube drainage, intrapleural fibrinolytics, or thoracic surgery for resolution. The process by which an effusion progresses down this cascade has been the subject of much research but the ability to predict which patients will require more aggressive intervention remains elusive. In 1980, Light and colleagues proposed the use of a pleural fluid pH cutoff of 7.2 to indicate the need for chest tube drainage on the basis that as bacteria metabolize and neutrophils phagocytose the pleural pH falls. This cutoff is referenced in the majority of international guidelines despite never being prospectively validated.

A defining feature in the spectrum of parapneumonic effusions is the dysregulation of the fibrinogenesis/fibrinolytic cascade and the subsequent development of loculations within the effusion. Loculations prevent adequate chest tube drainage, impede source control, can result in long-term respiratory compromise, and might even reduce the effectiveness of antibiotics. Pleural fluid pH, although a mainstay of initial management decisions, does not predict the development of loculations. A biomarker called suPAR (soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor) is theoretically a more appropriate guide for management. suPAR is the soluble form of uPAR (urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor), which, once bound to endogenous uPA (urokinase), catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin (a potent fibrinolytic). Originally documented in the plasma, serum, and urine of patients with HIV, pneumonia, sepsis, tuberculosis, and various solid tumors, more recent studies have shown suPAR also rises in infected ascitic and pleural fluid.

We aimed to assess the potential role of pleural fluid suPAR in the investigation and subsequent management of parapneumonic effusions using a prospectively collected cohort of patients.

Some of the results of this study have been previously reported in the form of an abstract.

Future directions

Great progress has been made in building what is now a robust evidence base to inform a number of management strategies in MPE but nonetheless these still primarily focus on optimal drainage strategies. Over the next decade, more upstream research is needed to advance our understanding of the mechanistic drivers of MPE formation on a cellular level. Advances in immunological and intrapleural therapies pose exciting therapeutic directions that may offer targeted pharmacological treatment of MPE and it remains to be seen what effect the increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies will have on the incidence of MPE. Early translational work has suggested that pleural fluid may not be an innocent bystander and may have pro-growth properties promoting cancer cell proliferation thus requiring pro-active drainage beyond palliative symptom control. As we increasingly define treatment pathways based on patient preference, there is a need for high quality qualitative data exploring the patient experience along the varied treatment strategies to inform discussions and to empower patients to make informed decisions.

### The imaging appearances of various pericardial disorders [^3e9b7bf0]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Pericardial fluid collections

Pericardial effusion is a frequently encountered disorder. Increased venous or lymphatic pressure is the common etiology of simple pericardial effusion; however, rheumatologic diseases, infection, malignancy, and trauma may also cause pericardial effusion. Pericardial thickening could be associated with pericardial effusion. The differentiation of benign and malignant pericardial effusions by imaging could be challenging. Echocardiography is the first-line imaging technique in the evaluation of pericardial effusions. However, there could be limitations in the detection of fluid due to acoustic windows and in cases of loculated fluid (Fig. 5). MRI is more sensitive than echocardiography in the detection of small collections, mostly in loculated fluid. CT may also demonstrate the extension of effusion. Post-contrast images, particularly fat-saturated T1-weighted MR images, may reveal the presence of pericardial thickening. The contents of pericardial effusion either sampled or diagnosed by imaging (i.e. hemorrhagic, serous, or pyogenic) may give clue for the etiology.

### A new radiologic appearance of pulmonary thromboembolism: multiloculated pleural effusions [^1ab876e3]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the clinical course and response to treatment of five patients who developed loculated pleural effusions as complications of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). The clinical charts of five patients who had loculated pleural effusions in the course of their PTE were reviewed, with special attention paid to the duration of symptoms before diagnosis, the pleural fluid analysis findings, and the response of the loculations to anticoagulant therapy. In a tertiary care academic medical center, the five patients described in the present study had multiple locules of pleural fluid seen on chest radiographs and thoracic CT scans. In all cases, the diagnosis of PTE had been delayed for at least 2 weeks after symptoms developed. The loculated pleural fluid had led to the mistaken diagnosis of empyema in three cases. The pleural fluid in all cases was exudative, with a predominance of lymphocytes. With anticoagulant therapy, the loculations largely disappeared within the first few days of therapy. Although most pleural effusions secondary to PTE are relatively small and free-flowing, this study demonstrates that PTE can lead to loculated pleural effusions. The loculations occurred in patients who had been symptomatic from their PTE for > 2 weeks. In each instance, the pleural fluid was a lymphocytic exudate. The effusions rapidly resolved with the institution of anticoagulant therapy. PTE should be included in the differential diagnosis of a loculated pleural effusion, particularly if the pleural fluid contains predominantly lymphocytes.

### Management of pleural space: effusions and empyema [^1e58cc26]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Pleural effusions are commonly encountered in clinical medicine. They can represent both a diagnostic and a therapeutic challenge. This article discusses the diagnostic modalities used to evaluate the patient with a pleural effusion. Also discussed are the therapeutic options for the 2 most common causes of pleural effusions encountered by the surgeon: pleural sepsis and malignant pleural effusions.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for parapneumonic effusion and empyema, more specifically with respect to pleural fluid drainage (tube thoracostomy, indications), AATS 2017 guidelines recommend to perform tube thoracostomy in patients with pleural fluid LDH > 1,000 IU/L, glucose < 40 mg/dL, or a loculated pleural effusion (suggesting that the pleural effusion is unlikely to resolve with antibiotics alone).

### Thoracic ultrasound for pleural effusion in the intensive care unit: a narrative review from diagnosis to treatment [^adc866af]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Lung ultrasound is a simple non-invasive bedside procedure, with better sensitivity and specificity than chest radiography, for the diagnosis of PLEFF. It is not only crucial for visualizing the effusion, but can also help distinguish between different forms of PLEFF. The use of ultrasound to guide thoracentesis and to insert chest tubes has recently been advocated to increase the safety of this invasive procedure, especially in ventilated ICU patients, or for small, loculated effusions. Furthermore, TUS is also essential to monitor the volume of PLEFF drained, and to decide when to remove the drainage.

### Corticosteroids for pleural infection: should we STOPPE studying? [^141525aa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Pleural infection is a challenging condition to manage, and, unlike other infectious diseases, outcomes have improved little over the past decade. Pleural infection results in extended hospital stays, a mortality rate of 15%, and a considerable healthcare burden, given the potential requirement of chest tube drainage, intrapleural fibrinolytics, or thoracic surgery. Preventing the development or progression of pleural infection is a very worthwhile venture. In this issue of the Journal, Fitzgerald and colleagues (pp.) describe the STOPPE (Steroid Therapy and Outcome of Parapneumonic Pleural Effusions) trial, the first randomized trial of corticosteroids in adults presenting with parapneumonic effusions.

The rationale behind corticosteroids in parapneumonic effusions is sound. Numerous laboratory studies have demonstrated that effusions are rich in proinflammatory cytokines even in the early stages. Bacterial replication adjacent to the pleural space sets off an inflammatory cascade that results in a spectrum of fluid volume and complexity, from small, simple parapneumonic effusions to grossly loculated, fibropurulent collections. The cytokines upregulated within infected fluid include IL-6 and IL-8, TNFα (tumor necrosis factor-α), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), and MCP (monocyte chemotactic protein), which theoretically could be attenuated by systemic corticosteroids. Arresting the inflammatory cascade at an early stage might avoid the derangement of fibrinolysis and resultant loculation development that can hamper subsequent pleural fluid drainage. Whether persistence of bacteria or inflammation alone drives ongoing fluid accumulation and loculation is uncertain, although the notoriously low yield of causative microbes from pleural fluid (just 10% in this trial) would point to the latter.

A previous trial by Tagarro and colleagues in a pediatric population demonstrated a benefit from administering intravenous dexamethasone in terms of clinical recovery from parapneumonic effusions. As the first trial in adults, the STOPPE trial was designed as a pilot study without a primary endpoint, with the aim of capturing a wide range of clinical outcomes. Adult patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia were screened for the presence of an associated pleural effusion in the first 3 days of admission. Eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either 4 mg of dexamethasone intravenously every 12 hours up to a maximum of four doses or the same course of normal saline. This was a regimen extrapolated from the pediatric study. Importantly, the whole spectrum of parapneumonic effusions were eligible for study, from simple, small effusions to frank empyema.

### Chest imaging for the diagnosis of complicated parapneumonic effusions [^dc2d22bc]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide an overview of the contribution of thoracic ultrasound (TUS) and computed tomography (CT) in the identification of complicated parapneumonic effusions (CPPE), defined as those which need chest tube drainage for resolution.

Recent Findings

A recent retrospective study found that visualization of complex (nonanechoic) effusions on TUS (likelihood ratio positive = 6.92) outperformed the recognition of loculated/septated effusions on CT (likelihood ratio = 2.20) or chest radiographs (likelihood ratio = 1.54) for predicting a CPPE. In another retrospective study, a weighted CT scoring system consisting of pleural contrast enhancement (three points), pleural microbubbles, increased extrapleural fat attenuation, and fluid volume at least 400ml (one point each) had relatively good accuracy for labeling CPPE (likelihood ratio positive = 3.4; likelihood ratio negative = 0.22) when four or more points were achieved.

Summary

Although a gold standard for CPPE diagnosis is lacking, bedside TUS primarily, and CT scan in certain circumstances, may help to drive clinical decisions regarding chest tube placement in parapneumonic effusions (PPE). However, recommendations are limited by the absence of prospective trials.

### Intra-pleural fibrinolytic therapy versus conservative management in the treatment of adult parapneumonic effusions and empyema [^eca7ec93]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusions and empyema may complicate lower respiratory tract infections. Treatment of these collections of pus includes surgical drainage and the use of intra-pleural fibrinolysis to break down fibrin bands that may cause loculation.

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review of the benefit of adding intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy to intercostal tube drainage in the treatment of complicated para pneumonic effusions and empyema to reduce mortality or the need for subsequent surgical debridement of the pleural space.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. Trial authors were contacted for further information and details regarding the possibility of unpublished trials was requested. The most recent search was conducted in November 2006.

Selection Criteria

All studies in the review were Randomised Controlled Trials in adult patients with post-pneumonic empyema or complicated parapneumonic effusions who had not had prior surgical intervention or trauma. The intervention was an intrapleural fibrinolytic agent (streptokinase or urokinase) via an intercostal chest drain (ICD) versus control, or a comparison of the two agents.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data. Study authors were contacted for further information.

Main Results

Seven studies met the eligibility criteria of the review, recruiting 761 participants. The only consistent end points in all trials were treatment failure, as gauged by the requirement for additional intervention including surgery or death. In studies where patients had either loculation and empyema, there was no significant difference in the risk of death with fibrinolytics (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.68). When treatment failure was considered as surgical intervention, fibrinolytics reduced the risk of this outcome (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.85), but there is discordance between earlier positive studies and the more recent negative study by Maskell.

Authors' Conclusions

Intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy confers significant benefit in reducing the requirement for surgical intervention for patients in the early studies included in this review but not in the more recently published Maskell study. The reasons for this difference are uncertain. Separate subgroup analysis of proven loculated/septated effusions from the available data in our meta-analysis suggests a potential overall treatment benefit with fibrinolytics, but these results should be treated with caution as the data are incomplete and the benefit is not significant in the subgroup of high quality trials (Cochrane Grade A). Intrapleural fibrinolytics have not been shown to significantly increase adverse events, but the confidence interval is too wide to firmly exclude this possibility.

### Tuberculous pleuritis: clinical presentations and diagnostic challenges [^72ac2e83]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS AND RADIOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF TUBERCULOUS PLEURITIS

Clinical symptoms and radiographic manifestations on chest radiographs are not sensitive nor specific to diagnosing TBP, even in TB-endemic regions. Fever, cough and pleuritic chest pain are common. Systemic complaints, for example weight loss, may be absent, while anaemia and hypoalbuminaemia are often present. Among patients with EPTB, TBP is more common in men, older age groups and HIV-infected individuals.

TBP typically presents with subacute unilateral pleural effusion, which is more likely right-sided. The size of pleural effusion can range from minimal to massive. In a retrospective study in Korea, 39.3% of TBP effusions were loculated and residual trapped lung may be revealed after pleural fluid drainage (Fig. 1). Concomitant lung parenchymal involvement was present in 15% of TBP patients in a large Chinese TB registry (Fig. 2).

FIGURE 1
Chest X-rays showing right-sided tuberculous pleuritis of the same patient. (a) At baseline before effusion drainage, (b) trapped lung after effusion drainage, (c) resolution of pleural effusion and trapped lung after 9 months of antituberculous treatment.

FIGURE 2
(a) Chest X-ray showing concomitant pulmonary infiltrates (nodular infiltrates at the right lung apex and mass lesion at the left upper zone) and left pleural effusion, with both confirmed to be tuberculosis. (b) CT thorax of the same patient showing nodular infiltrates, bronchiectasis at the right lung apex and mass lesion at the left upper zone.

The utility of other radiological examinations in TBP has been described. Thoracic ultrasound (TUS) can guide pleural biopsy but lacks diagnostic specificity for TBP. Computed tomography (CT) and PET-CT may help to differentiate TBP from malignant pleural effusion (MPE) by characterizing the nature of pleural thickening in predefined clinical conditions.

### Pleural and parenchymal radiological characteristics of tuberculous pleuritis and correlation with microbiological and molecular diagnostic yield [^f83dbeea]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of patients with TB pleuritis diagnosed at a tertiary hospital in Singapore was performed. A definite diagnosis of TB pleuritis was made in patients who had pleural effusion and (i) a positive sputum, pleural fluid or tissue microbiology for Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Complex (MTC), either in the form of AFB staining or culture or TB PCR, or (ii) tissue histology demonstrating necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. A presumptive diagnosis of TB pleuritis was made in patients who had a lymphocytic exudative pleural effusion with raised adenosine deaminase (ADA), which was defined as > 30 units/L, and both a clinical and radiological response to anti-tuberculous treatment. All patients with a definite or presumptive diagnosis of TB pleuritis during January 2021 to December 2024 were included in this analysis. As this study was performed with anonymized data retrieved from a clinical audit, it was exempted from formal institutional review board approval.

Data on patient baseline characteristics, radiological and microbiological results were collected. Radiological evaluation of chest radiographs and CT imaging of the thorax were performed by respiratory consultants (S.L.Y. and K.J.G.) with reference to the formal radiological reports by the hospital's radiologists. The definitions of radiological abnormalities were adopted from the Fleischner glossary, namely for consolidation, ground glass opacities, nodules and masses. The effusion sizes as determined on chest radiograph are defined as follows: Small refers to effusions less than 25% of the hemithorax, moderate refers to effusions occupying 25–50% of the hemithorax, large refers to effusions occupying 50–75% of the hemithorax, and massive refers to effusions larger than 75% of the hemithorax or with evidence of mediastinal shift. Loculated effusions refer to effusions that show features of non-gravity dependence. The presence of parenchymal abnormalities on chest radiograph was determined based on the film performed after the effusion was mostly drained. Representative images are included in the appendix for further reference.

Data analysis was performed on SPSS version 23. Descriptive statistics of the variables were expressed with in median with interquartile range (IQR), or numbers with percentage. Discrete variables were analysed with chi-square test (or Fischer's exact test) and continuous variables were analysed with Mann-Whitney-U test. P values of less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

Data from the study are not publicly available due to privacy restrictions. Requests for access should be directed to the corresponding author.

### Combination tissue plasminogen activator and DNase for loculated malignant pleural effusions: a single-center retrospective review [^f76788f5]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Patient Population

Our tertiary care center has established a specialized pleural effusion clinic that includes interventional respirologists, thoracic surgeons, and specialized nurse practitioners. We performed a retrospective single-center review of patients with confirmed or presumed MPEs requiring IPC insertion by a physician associated with our pleural effusion clinic. Patients who had their IPCs inserted between November 1, 2012, to December 31, 2018, were considered for enrollment, and data were extracted up to December 31, 2019. Patients were included if they developed significant pleural loculations, defined as a nondraining IPC with loculations that were verified on bedside ultrasound associated with significant respiratory symptoms. This study was approved by the University of Alberta Research Ethics Board (Pro00108928).

Procedures

Patients at our pleural effusion clinic are followed by physicians and nurse practitioners until IPC removal or death. A follow-up chest x-ray and clinical assessment occurs 2 weeks after IPC insertion and every 3 months thereafter. Procedures are performed in an outpatient setting. Nondraining IPCs with significant pleural effusion and loculations are initially flushed with saline. If unsuccessful, patients are presented with the options of intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy (tPA or combination tPA-DNase), procedural intervention (thoracentesis, replacement of the IPC, or surgical intervention), or conservative medical management. The choice between tPA and tPA-DNase (usually 10 and 5 mg, respectively) is left to the discretion of the treating physician. In some cases, the physician may suggest procedural intervention, for example, if the complexity of the pleural space may render fibrinolytic therapy futile or if the current IPC does not access the dominant fluid pocket. The final therapeutic decision is ultimately determined by the treating physician in consultation with the patient, following a discussion of the benefits and risks of each option, considering comorbidities, the success of prior therapies, and patient preference.

### Guidelines for the appropriate use of bedside general and cardiac ultrasonography in the evaluation of critically ill patients-part I: general ultrasonography [^69b40446]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Noncardiac thoracic imaging — pleural effusion recommendations state: "We recommend that ultrasound should be used to complement physical examination and conventional chest radiography to diagnose and localize a pleural effusion. Grade 1A". and "We recommend that ultrasound guidance should be used to assist in drainage (including needle guidance), particularly of small or loculated effusions compared with landmark technique. Grade 1B". with "no recommendation regarding the preference to use of either static or dynamic technique to do so". Reported diagnostic performance is that "The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ultrasound to diagnose a pleural effusion are about 84%, 100%, and 94%, respectively", and "Other data indicate a favorable accuracy (nearly 100%) compared with chest CT". Regarding safety and complications, events with drainage of large effusions "were decreased from 33 or 50% to 0% when they were drained using ultrasound guidance", and in a large observational series there was "a 1.3% complication rate in a series of over 200 patients versus 6.5% in a historical control"; additionally, "Appropriately trained intensivists can perform ultrasound-guided drainage with an acceptable complication profile".

### Clinical characteristics of pediatric pleuropulmonary paragonimiasis with pleural effusion: a single-center retrospective analysis [^6fd79261]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

Paragonimiasis, a cause of pleuropulmonary disease, is a neglected etiology of pediatric pleural effusion. We retrospectively analyzed children with paragonimiasis-induced pleural effusion admitted to our center, aiming to summarize their diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. A total of 103 children were included, with a mean age of 8.2 years, and 87.4% resided in rural areas. 81/91 (89.0%) were initially misdiagnosed with other infectious diseases including community-acquired pneumonia (43.9%; 40/91) and tuberculosis (16.5%; 15/91). The predominant blood test findings included hypereosinophilia (98.1%), leukocytosis (95.1%), thrombocytosis (42.7%), hyperglobulinemia (78.6%), and elevated immunoglobulin G levels (85.4%; 76/89). Multiple serous cavity effusions exhibited higher globulin levels (44.7 g/L versus 36.7 g/L) and lower albumin-globulin ratios (0.8 versus 1.0) than single pleural effusions, and loculation was more common in medium or large pleural effusions. After 3 days of praziquantel treatment at a dosage of 75–90 mg/(kg·day), with a median of four courses, all of the children improved, but no patients were cured with a single course of therapy. Almost half of the patients (44/99) continued to exhibit medium or small residual effusion on chest computed tomography scans. Additionally, various types of lung lesions remained, and the incidence of pleural lesions increased during the follow-up period. Unexplained pediatric pleural effusion with eosinophilia requires paragonimiasis evaluation. Early diagnosis and accurate treatment critically improve clinical prognosis, whereas post-paragonimiasis pulmonary injuries necessitate clinical attention.

### Pleural fluid suPAR levels predict the need for invasive management in parapneumonic effusions [^9c792e9c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Parapneumonic effusions have a wide clinical spectrum. The majority settle with conservative management but some progress to complex collections requiring intervention. For decades, physicians have relied on pleural fluid pH to determine the need for chest tube drainage despite a lack of prospective validation and no ability to predict the requirement for fibrinolytics or thoracic surgery.

Objectives: To study the ability of suPAR (soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor), a potential biomarker of pleural fluid loculation, to predict the need for invasive management compared with conventional fluid biomarkers (pH, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase) in parapneumonic effusions.

Methods: Patients presenting with pleural effusions were prospectively recruited to an observational study with biological samples stored at presentation. Pleural fluid and serum suPAR levels were measured using the suPARnostic double-monoclonal antibody sandwich ELISA on 93 patients with parapneumonic effusions and 47 control subjects (benign and malignant effusions).

Measurements and Main Results: Pleural suPAR levels were significantly higher in effusions that were loculated versus nonloculated parapneumonic effusions (median, 132 ng/ml vs. 22 ng/ml; P < 0.001). Pleural suPAR could more accurately predict the subsequent insertion of a chest tube with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.89–0.98) compared with pleural pH (AUC 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.73–0.90). suPAR was superior to the combination of conventional pleural biomarkers (pH, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase) when predicting the referral for intrapleural fibrinolysis or thoracic surgery (AUC 0.92 vs. 0.76).

Conclusions: Raised pleural suPAR was predictive of patients receiving more invasive management of parapneumonic effusions and added value to conventional biomarkers. These results need validation in a prospective multicenter trial.

### Predictive factors of patient length of stay with multiloculated pleural effusion after medical thoracoscopy: single-center retrospective cohort study [^5b6eafda]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Multiloculated pleural effusion presents a significant clinical challenge in Indonesia because of the high prevalence of TB and other infectious diseases. Rigid thoracoscopy is a management procedure for loculated pleural effusion conditions. This model could be useful for clinicians to estimate a patient's hospital stay after surgery, assisting in resource planning and patient management. By understanding the impact of surgical duration and preoperative predictive FEV 1, healthcare providers can identify patients at greater risk for extended hospital stays and potentially intervene earlier to mitigate these risks.

### Real-time ultrasound-guided pigtail catheter chest drain for complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema in children-16-year, single-centre experience of radiologically placed drains [^5bdcc9a9]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

In line with current guidelines, we use chest radiography and US to assess the severity of pneumonia, size and appearance of the effusion, and any complications such as abscess formation or bronchopleural fistula. US is safe and noninvasive and is the most useful investigation. Loculations/septations and increased echogenicity within the collection correlate moderately with purulence, but even anechoic effusions may contain frank pus. Overall, no reliable clinical, radiologic or pleural fluid characteristic can determine outcome, the only factor reported to be predictive for failure being necrotising pneumonia identified on initial imaging. Although US cannot reliably establish the stage of collection, it can estimate the effusion size and echogenicity, whether fluid is free or loculated, assess pleural thickening and guide the best site for drainage.

CT has a limited role and is unnecessary for diagnosing or managing most cases. Apart from the radiation risks involved, it is inferior at identifying septations and rarely provides useful information before intervention that is not identified on US. It may be required in complicated cases, for assessing misplaced tubes or bronchopleural fistulae/abscesses or prior to surgery. Our use of CT for diagnosis has decreased over time; only one child has required CT at admission in the last 9 years. The most common indication for its use is in evaluating bronchopleural fistulae; however, only 71.4% of our patients in this group were evaluated with CT, the remainder were managed with plain film imaging alone.

### Combination tissue plasminogen activator and DNase for loculated malignant pleural effusions: a single-center retrospective review [^d1a9b345]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2023). Medium credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) are a common cause of morbidity, with an annual incidence of over 150,000 cases in the United States alone. Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) have emerged as a first-line intervention option for symptomatic MPE. Increased procoagulant and decreased fibrinolytic activity in malignant pleural diseases lead to excessive fibrin deposition and formation of pleural septations, a mechanism similar to that seen in parapneumonic effusions and tuberculous pleurisy. This can complicate drainage of the pleural space, leaving the patient with disabling dyspnea.

Three randomized trials with moderate sample sizes (ranging from 40 to 71 patients) have demonstrated that intrapleural instillation of fibrinolytics in patients with MPEs results in improved radiographic appearance following instillation. – The use of combination tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and deoxyribonuclease (DNase) in the treatment of loculated MPE, however, has not been well studied due to theoretical concerns of pleural hemorrhage. Pleural malignancy stimulates the formation of new blood vessels, which can be friable and increase the risk of bleeding. Combination tPA-DNase has been used successfully for the treatment of loculated pleural infections. A landmark trial in 2011 showed that combination therapy improved the radiographic appearance of effusions, decreased surgical referrals, and decreased hospital length of stay compared with placebo, with no difference in adverse events. One retrospective review of 21 patients with symptomatic loculated MPE and nondraining IPC or chest tube demonstrated that combination tPA-DNase resulted in improved radiographic appearance of MPEs, increased pleural fluid drainage, and improved dyspnea scores with no noted pleural bleeding. However, this study did not provide a control arm. The role of combination intrapleural tPA-DNase for loculated MPE is the subject of an upcoming small clinical trial.

Given the lack of definitive data surrounding the treatment of loculated MPE, patients in our clinic have been variably treated with tPA or combination tPA-DNase (off-label) or in some cases, procedural intervention. We aimed to review patients with loculated MPEs to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of intrapleural tPA versus combination tPA-DNase in the treatment of loculated MPEs.

Effusive constriction — echocardiographic characteristics include thickened pericardium, respiratory variation in mitral inflow, and decreased regional longitudinal strain, with Doppler assessment of mitral E velocity in inspiration and expiration; these M-mode, 2D, and Doppler features can be consistent with a sizable pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade, and effusions may contain organized material or echogenic fluid with bandlike fibrous strands causing loculation and sometimes no change in fluid position with patient repositioning; speckle-tracking has been used to evaluate regional strain before and after pericardiectomy in effusive CP.

### Intra-pleural fibrinolytic therapy versus conservative management in the treatment of parapneumonic effusions and empyema [^f7d89952]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Effusions and empyema may complicate lower respiratory tract infections. Loculation of fluid is a major problem with this condition and treatments have included surgical drainage and the use of intra-pleural fibrinolysis to break down fibrin bands that may cause loculation.

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review of the benefit of adding intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy to intercostal tube drainage in the treatment of complicated para pneumonic effusions and empyema.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was initially searched for relevant RCT's. Trial authors were contacted for further information and details regarding the possibility of unpublished trials was requested. The most recent search was conducted in July 2003.

Selection Criteria

All studies in the review were Randomised Controlled Trials in adult patients with empyema or complicated para pneumonic effusions who had not had prior surgical intervention or trauma. The intervention was an intrapleural fibrinolytic agent (streptokinase or urokinase) versus control or a comparison of the two.

Data Collection and Analysis

All identified studies were reviewed independently by two reviewer and all data collected. Reviews were scored according to the Cochrane assessment of allocation concealment and the Jadad scale of methodological quality. Disagreements between reviewers were referred to a third reviewer. Where further information was required, authors of trial papers were contacted for further details.

Main Results

Four studies were included, one which directly compared the fibrinolytics streptokinase and urokinase. Three small RCTs (total 104 patients) compared streptokinase or urokinase versus normal saline control. The pooled data showed significant benefits in terms of hospital stay, time to defervescence, improvement in chest radiograph, requirement for surgery, but the results were not always consistent across studies. Complications attributable to therapy were not observed.

Reviewers' Conclusions

The numbers of patients in the controlled trials are small. In meta-analysis of these trials, intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy confers significant benefit when compared with normal saline control. Although lesser levels of evidence suggest that intrapleural fibrinolysis can be considered as an important adjunctive therapy to intercostal tube drainage in these conditions, on the basis of RCT evidence alone, we cannot recommend the routine use of fibrinolysis in their management as the trial numbers are too small. Both streptokinase and urokinase are equally efficacious but streptokinase has a slightly higher non-fatal complication rate. Life-threatening complications are rare and were not seen in the RCTs.

### Focused cardiac ultrasound: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^e257368b]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Focused cardiac ultrasound (FCU) in cardiac arrest and acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF) can be used during cardiopulmonary resuscitation to evaluate for large pericardial effusion suggestive of cardiac tamponade and to evaluate for cardiac standstill, may help guide early post‑arrest management by allowing rapid assessment of LV systolic function, pericardial tamponade, signs of pulmonary embolism, and volume status, and in chest trauma can identify the presence or absence of pericardial effusion; comprehensive echocardiography should be performed to confirm abnormal findings and assess LV regional wall motion, valvular heart disease severity, and loculated pericardial effusions if clinically suspected. In ADHF, FCU can readily distinguish normal versus reduced LV systolic function and is superior to traditional bedside evaluation, enables earlier therapy initiation and avoidance of contraindicated therapies, started directed therapy 18 hours (on average) before the complete echocardiogram in one study, and another trial demonstrated reduced length of stay when a hospitalist used FCU to guide care.

### Pleural fluid suPAR levels predict the need for invasive management in parapneumonic effusions [^a67f11b2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 4.
Boxplot of pleural suPAR (soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor) levels in malignant effusions.

Figure 5.
The biology of suPAR and the urokinase-type plasminogen activator system.

The higher levels of pleural suPAR in loculated effusions of a malignant etiology compared with nonloculated suggest that malignant locule development follows a similar fibrinogenesis cascade. Levels were lower in loculated malignant effusions compared with loculated parapneumonic effusions, suggesting the process is more subacute in malignancy. However, there were several cases in which malignant effusions had pleural suPAR levels similar to loculated parapneumonic effusions, limiting its utility as a diagnostic test in the sometimes challenging clinical situation of distinguishing an advanced malignant effusion from infection. We also tested the ability of pleural suPAR to predict the development of loculations within malignant effusions that were simple at baseline. Levels were nonsignificantly higher in the delayed loculation group and, given the small numbers involved, this relationship needs further investigation.

### American Society of Echocardiography clinical recommendations for multimodality cardiovascular imaging of patients with pericardial disease: endorsed by the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance and Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^cb17b6ed]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) — role in pericardial effusion (PEff) includes detection, indications, and attenuation-based characterization: PEff is often an incidental finding detected by a chest CT performed for other clinical indications, and in emergency room patients who underwent CT to exclude pulmonary embolus, the incidence of PEff was 5%. Although clinically suspected cases of PEff are initially investigated by echocardiography, CT is an important adjunct when localization and quantification of pericardial fluid are important or when the effusion is complex or loculated or clot is present; epicardial fat is reliably identified by CT and can aid when echocardiographic findings are equivocal or fibrin is adherent to the cardiac surface. CT can also help resolve other pathologic conditions that simulate pericardial disease, with complex pleural effusions, lower lobe atelectasis, external masses abutting the pericardium, and other mediastinal abnormalities usually more definitively demonstrated by CT. A PEff may be characterized with CT by measuring attenuation, where attenuation close to water (< 10 Hounsfield units) suggests a simple, transudative effusion and low values close to fat (−60 to −80 Hounsfield units) have been reported in cases of chylopericardium; nongated unenhanced cardiac CT demonstrates only minimal thickening of the pericardium up to 3 mm but presence of linear pericardial calcification.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^e412946a]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

What Does Optimal Communication Look Like?

Optimal communication involves a clear, written referral from the oncology team to the pleural services/pulmonology team. Referral should encourage two-way communication by including an invitation to contact the referrer if the receiving department has any queries. Proactive collaboration and communication between referring and recipient services is crucial for ensuring that guidelines are followed, and any deviations from the guidelines are appropriate. Subsequent interactions can be via phone, e-mail, or in-person and should focus on addressing treatment issues. The referring clinician must also ensure that the recipient team is adequately trained. Identification of knowledge gaps should prompt clinicians to organize training initiatives that should be led by health care professionals experienced in the treatment of MPE.

The pulmonologist placing the IPC should report the details of the procedure, including the amount of fluid drained, followed by specific recommendations on drainage frequency and volume at home.

Unanswered Questions

Treatments for MPE have seen little evolution for decades. Talc pleurodesis was first described in 1935 and IPCs were released onto the market in 1997. In the coming decade, we hope for progress on several key unanswered research questions, which could be transformative for the management of MPE and patient outcomes.

Unanswered questions:

1. Are there biomarkers that may help predict which treatment a patient will benefit the most from?
2. Are there drugs that may suppress pleural fluid production, thus avoiding interventions on the pleural space?
3. Are there any novel oncologic treatments that might be effective for managing MPE?
4. What are patients' and carers' key priorities concerning future MPE management?

In conclusion, the benefits and drawbacks of various treatment options may result in certain patients deriving greater advantages from one particular treatment than from another. It is possible that some patients are not offered optimal treatment, at times due to a reliance on specific local procedures, personal preferences of clinicians, lack of awareness, or misconceptions about specific treatment options. One size does not fit all; treatment choice needs to be made on the basis of the suitability, benefits, and risk profile for each particular patient. A detailed consideration of the patient's clinical characteristics at each step of the treatment pathway will help clinicians and patients to identify the optimal treatment. This can be supported by providing patients with balanced information regarding the benefits and risks of all treatment options. Following treatment choice, effective coordination of care between different teams will help maximize the benefits that each person can obtain from their chosen intervention.

### Efficacy of medical thoracoscopy combined with fibrinolytic therapy in the treatment of complicated parapneumonic effusions and empyema [^0e801bd2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Traditional treatment group

In the traditional treatment group, an 8Fr pleural drainage tube was inserted under ultrasound guidance. Starting the next day, patients received urokinase fibrinolytic therapy once daily for three consecutive days. The administration protocol and criteria for tube removal were consistent with those used in the medical thoracoscopy group.

For cases of complicated pleural effusion, such as loculated effusions, the decision to insert an intercostal drainage tube was guided by the following considerations:

Volume of Effusion: Drainage was recommended if the effusion occupied 50% or more of one hemithorax and was accompanied by clinical symptoms such as dyspnea.
Pleural Loculations: Significant loculations observed on imaging studies (e.g. chest CT or ultrasound) that could not be adequately addressed by traditional thoracentesis necessitated tube insertion.
Effusion Characteristics: Indicators included grossly purulent fluid, a positive Gram stain or microbial culture, pleural fluid pH < 7.2, or pleural fluid glucose < 2.2 mmol/L combined with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > 1000 IU/L.
Drainage Tube Selection: An 8Fr or larger tube was selected based on the characteristics of the effusion and the patient's clinical condition, with adjustments made as necessary during observation.

Primary and secondary outcome measures

Primary outcomes

Inflammatory Markers: White blood cell count (WBC), CRP and PCT.

### Phenotyping malignant pleural effusions [^58010dc8]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Patients with malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) are heterogenous in their disease course, symptom severity, responses to cancer therapies, fluid recurrence rates, and thus need for definitive fluid control measures. To tailor the most appropriate treatment for individual patients, clinicians need to 'phenotype' the patients and predict their clinical course. This review highlights the recent efforts to develop better predictive tools and knowledge gaps for further research.

Recent Findings

The LENT scoring system, which includes pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase, performance status, serum neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and tumor type, allows prediction of the survival of patients with MPE. Symptomatic response after therapeutic pleural drainage is highly variable; ongoing studies aim to identify those who would derive symptomatic benefit from fluid drainages. Multivariate analysis found that patients with low pleural fluid pH [odds ratio (OR) 37.04], large effusions (OR 3.31), and increasing age (OR 1.02) were more likely to require pleurodesis or indwelling pleural catheter placement for fluid control. Better predictive tools for rate of fluid recurrence and likelihood of successful pleurodesis would help guide clinical decision-making.

Summary

Phenotyping MPE would guide the formulation of optimal management for individual MPE patients.

### Characterizing risk factors associated with recurrent pleural effusions in the lung transplant recipients [^412e2451]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pleural effusions remain a common postoperative complication following lung transplantation, occurring in 10% to 26% of cases. We aimed to explore potential clinical or radiographic features associated with clinically significant post-lung transplant pleural effusions requiring repeat interventions for their management.

Methods

Lung transplantation recipients who underwent thoracentesis at our institution between June 2012 and October 2022 were reviewed. In total, 77 patients were included. Data were collected via the electronic health record and adjudicated through direct chart review. Patients were stratified by the need for a single thoracentesis (control group) or additional interventions, including serial thoracentesis, pigtail placement, and surgery (composite group). The computed tomography (CT) of the chest before the first thoracentesis was reviewed by a thoracic radiologist who was blinded to patient outcome.

Results

Single thoracentesis was used to manage 25 (32.5%) patients, 4 (5.2%) required multiple thoracenteses, 42 (54.5%) required a pigtail catheter, and 6 (7.8%) required decortication for definitive management. In the composite group compared with the control group, who were managed by a single thoracentesis, there was an increased incidence of loculations (36.8% vs. 8%, P = 0.01), rounded atelectasis (22.8% vs. 4%, P = 0.05), and larger effusion size (P = 0.01). The composite group had higher pleural fluid eosinophils (0.33% vs. 0% in control, P = < 0.01) and monocytes (14.8% vs. 7.3%, P = 0.04) levels.

Conclusion

Baseline imaging, such as larger effusion size, loculations and rounded atelectasis, and pleural fluid cell profile with increased eosinophils and monocytes, can potentially identify clinically significant and refractory pleural effusions.

### Predictive factors of patient length of stay with multiloculated pleural effusion after medical thoracoscopy: single-center retrospective cohort study [^06c4ecd2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pleural effusion (PE) is a pathological condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity due to inflammatory processes or systemic conditions. One common form of PE caused by inflammation is loculated PE. Disruptions in the integrity of the pleura or tissue integrity due to malignancy trigger disordered fibrin turnover and the release of various inflammatory mediators. The release of these mediators and fibrin promotes the growth of fibrotic tissue in the pleural cavity, leading to the localized accumulation of fluid. This condition can occur in various clinical scenarios, including parapneumonic effusion, empyema, malignant PE, hemothorax, and extrapulmonary tuberculosis. PE, especially in loculated cases, requires careful management. While thoracentesis is typically used to treat PE, advanced procedures such as thoracoscopy or thoracotomy are necessary for loculated conditions.

Thoracoscopy is a valuable tool for diagnosing and treating various conditions, including lung cancer, PE, infections, pleuritis, and lung nodules. Compared with open chest surgery, it is now considered the gold standard for managing most pleural disorders, offering benefits such as smaller incisions, faster recovery, less pain, and shorter hospital stays. Loculated PE can be challenging to diagnose and often complicates thoracentesis, making thoracoscopy a preferred option. Thoracoscopy also has a relatively high treatment success rate in cases of pleural infections. However, performing thoracoscopy in such cases requires significant expertise due to the complexity of the condition.

Postthoracoscopy patient care, including discharge readiness, requires a multidisciplinary team approach. The length of stay (LoS) is a critical factor evaluated during this period, alongside other parameters such as complications, reinfection, and readmission. A study conducted in Canada on patients who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy examined the influence of various pre- and post-procedure variables on LoS. These findings indicate that advanced age, longer operative duration, and post-procedure complications are associated with prolonged LoS. Additionally, interoperator variability among surgeons was also found to be a contributing factor to extended hospital stays.

However, to date, no studies have specifically addressed LoS following thoracoscopy in patients with multiloculated PE. The objectives of this study were to identify factors influencing LoS after rigid thoracoscopy for loculated PE, assess clinical outcomes, evaluate improvements in lung function, and determine associated variables.

### Complications of indwelling pleural catheter use and their management [^9e0baa9d]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic loculations

The presence of an IPC could facilitate pleural symphysis or 'spontaneous pleurodesis' in approximately 40% of patients. It has been hypothesised that the catheter may induce fibrin deposition within the pleural cavity, and/or that regular drainage keeps the pleural space dry allowing apposition of the visceral and parietal pleura. However, fibrin deposition, whether stimulated by the IPC or underlying tumour, can also unfavourably induce septations and pleural fluid loculation, thus limiting effective IPC drainage.

IPC-related symptomatic loculation is defined by residual pleural effusion that fails to evacuate through a patent IPC, breathlessness related to the effusion and absence of evidence of pleural infection. It is reported to be present in 5–14% of IPC-treated patients, and typically occurs at about 2 months after IPC insertion. Pleural aspiration, removal of the ineffective IPC and insertion of a second catheter targeting the residual locules can be considered. These strategies necessitate invasive procedures with inherent risks, and the feasibility depends on the locations and sizes of the residual locules.

Intrapleural fibrinolysis provides a feasible alternative. This may help to lyse adhesions, restores drainage via IPC and thus avoids a second invasive pleural procedure (figure 2). A recent four-centre retrospective study examined 66 patients with IPC insertion for MPE, who received intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy for symptomatic loculations. Symptomatic response and improvement in pleural fluid drainage were achieved in the majority of the patients (83% and 93%, respectively) (figure 2), with corresponding reduction in residual pleural fluid on chest X-ray. Pleural bleeding occurred in two (3%) patients; both responded to supportive blood transfusion without haemodynamic consequences or need of invasive interventions. No systemic bleeding was reported. The efficacy and safety profile of intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy is encouraging, but heterogeneity in its use and the high recurrence rate of symptomatic loculation (40%)clearly call for further clinical trials to guide patient selection and optimise the delivery regimen of fibrinolytics.

Figure 2
This patient with a malignant pleural effusion was treated with an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC). After 4 months of drainage, he developed symptomatic loculations. The fluid could not be evacuated despite a patent catheter in the right pleural cavity. He was given intrapleural instillation of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), with excellent effect. The post-treatment chest radiograph revealed an underlying trapped lung and a significant pleural rind of tumour.

### Bilateral loculated pleural effusion as a manifestation of acute parenteral organophosphate intoxication: a case report [^ce04807d]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute organophosphate (OP) toxicity causes a wide range of clinical effects on the respiratory system, including pulmonary bronchoconstriction and bronchorrhea. Morbidity and mortality from acute OP toxicity correlate best with pulmonary secretions.

Objective

In this article, we report bilateral loculated pleural effusion as a rare pulmonary effect in a patient with acute parenteral OP toxicity.

Case Report

A 25-year-old, previously healthy woman was transferred to our Poison Department 3 days after suicidal injection of malathion. At the time of presentation her vital signs were normal, except that her respiratory rate was 24 breaths/min. She complained of pleuritic chest pain and had a cough productive of yellow sputum. She had generalized chest wall tenderness, and breath sounds were decreased in the base of both lung fields. Standard therapy for OP toxicity, including atropine, pralidoxime, and diazepam, was initiated. Due to persistent pleuritic chest pain, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed that showed bilateral loculated pleural effusions. Shortly after hospital admission, the patient developed respiratory distress, for which she was intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit. She received continued medical therapy and was extubated on hospital day 3. A CT scan of the chest on hospital day 9, after completion of the treatment, documented resolution of the effusions.

Conclusion

Parenteral OP toxicity occurs rarely, and in this case it was associated with bilateral loculated pleural effusions. In this regard, it should be considered in a patient with acute parenteral OP toxicity and persistent chest wall pain.

### Combination tissue plasminogen activator and DNase for loculated malignant pleural effusions: a single-center retrospective review [^c6323da5]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) are frequently used for the management of malignant pleural effusions (MPEs), but drainage can be impaired by pleural loculations. We aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) versus combination tPA-deoxyribonuclease (DNase) in the treatment of loculated MPE.

Methods:

We performed a retrospective review of patients with confirmed or presumed MPEs requiring IPC insertion. We compared the efficacy of intrapleural tPA, tPA-DNase, and procedural intervention on pleural fluid drainage. Secondary endpoints included the need for future pleural procedures (eg, thoracentesis, IPC reinsertion, chest tube insertion, or surgical intervention), IPC removal due to spontaneous pleurodesis, and IPC-related complications.

Results:

Among 437 patients with MPEs, loculations developed in 81 (19%) patients. Twenty-four (30%) received intrapleural tPA, 46 (57%) received intrapleural tPA-DNase, 4 (5%) underwent a procedural intervention, and 7 (9%) received ongoing medical management. tPA improved pleural drainage in 83% of patients, and tPA-DNase improved pleural drainage in 80% of patients. tPA alone may be associated with increased rates of spontaneous pleurodesis compared with tPA-DNase. There was no difference in complications when comparing tPA, combination tPA-DNase, procedural intervention, and no therapy.

Conclusion:

Both intrapleural tPA and combination tPA-DNase appear to be safe and effective in improving pleural fluid drainage in selected patients with loculated MPE, although further studies are needed.

### AABIP evidence-informed guidelines and expert panel report for the management of indwelling pleural catheters [^26165b79]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2020). High credibility.

AABIP pleural catheter guidelines — Recommendation 4 (nondraining catheter with symptomatic reaccumulation) states that in patients with IPCs for the management of known or suspected MPEs and symptomatic pleural fluid reaccumulation due to a nondraining pleural catheter, we suggest saline flushing of the catheter to relieve any obstruction, and if saline is unsuccessful at relieving the obstruction and there are no contraindications, instillation of fibrinolytics via the catheter should be attempted to restore flow (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). Background notes that nondraining IPCs with symptomatic pleural fluid reaccumulation occur in 5% to 14% of patients; a sudden cessation of previously large-volume drainage suggests catheter malfunction most commonly caused by fibrin occlusion, whereas gradual reduction with a persistent or enlarging effusion is likely related to increased pleural fluid viscosity, poor communication of the fluid with the catheter due to loculations, or partial obstruction of the catheter; reduced drainage from an IPC can indicate successful pleurodesis or a poorly draining pleural space, and worsening dyspnea with increasing effusion on chest imaging suggests the latter scenario.

### Pleural fluid suPAR levels predict the need for invasive management in parapneumonic effusions [^fa52cc8a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Pleural suPAR in Parapneumonic Effusions

Table 2 shows the levels of pleural and serum suPAR from patients with parapneumonic effusions alongside routine pleural fluid and serum tests depending on the presence/absence of fluid loculation during hospital admission. Levels of pleural suPAR were significantly higher in loculated versus nonloculated effusions (P < 0.01). Using a cutoff of 35 ng/ml, pleural suPAR had a 100% sensitivity (95% CI, 91–100) for predicting pleural fluid loculations with a specificity of 91% (95% CI, 80–97), a PLR of 12.3, and an NLR of 0.0. This compared with pleural pH, which, using the conventional cutoff of 7.2, had a sensitivity of 52% (95% CI, 37–68), a specificity of 84% (95% CI, 70–93), a PLR of 3.2, and an NLR of 0.57 (Figure 1). In a multivariable analysis model, including all the analytes presented in Table 2, pleural suPAR was the only independent predictor of pleural effusion loculation during hospital admission; see Appendix E4.

In nine patients in whom the initial ultrasound was simple, loculations developed on subsequent pleural ultrasound and/or computed tomography scans at a median of 5 days (range, 3–10). The baseline pleural suPAR was significantly higher in parapneumonic effusions that subsequently loculated (median, 139.6 ng/ml; IQR, 41.9–312.8) compared with those that remained nonloculated (median, 22.3; IQR, 14.0–28.1) and was equivalent to effusions that were loculated from baseline (median, 131.0; IQR, 52.7–223.8) (P < 0.01).

### Scan the lung: point-of-care ultrasound of a pulmonary consolidation with loculated pleural effusion [^5741d46f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Thoracic ultrasound has become an increasingly valuable tool in the evaluation of critically ill patients in the emergency department (ED). The utility of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to identify suspected pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion and pneumonia has been well established (Pagano et al; Brogi et al; Cortellaro et al; Irwin and Cook [1–4]). The 2014 American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) Ultrasound Imaging Compendium included lung and pleural ultrasound with the primary indication of identifying pneumothorax and pleural effusion as part of the core POCUS indications for all emergency physicians [5]. We present a unique case in which a patient presented to the ED in respiratory distress. Portable chest X-ray demonstrated near complete opacification of his right hemithorax. POCUS demonstrated a large right sided loculated pleural effusion with associated septations and surrounding consolidation suggestive of a parapneumonic effusion.

### Pleural fluid suPAR levels predict the need for invasive management in parapneumonic effusions [^2dce2165]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Pleural suPAR and Referral for Medical/Surgical Rescue Therapies

Pleural suPAR was superior to all other conventional markers combined at predicting the need for rescue therapies (intrapleural fibrinolytics or thoracic surgery) with an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.87–0.98; P = 0.02, using DeLong's test). Using a cutoff of 65 ng/ml, pleural suPAR was 94% sensitive and 84% specific (PLR, 6.0 and NLR, 0.1) at predicting the referral for these therapies (16 of the 93 patients) (Table 3).

The combination of markers that are conventionally used to define a complex parapneumonic effusion (including pleural pH < 7.2 or pleural glucose ≤ 3.0 mmol/L [≤ 55 mg/dl] or pleural LDH > 1000 IU/L) had an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71–0.81) for predicting rescue therapies (Figure 3). Pleural suPAR was the only significant baseline predictor of rescue therapies (P = 0.01); see Appendix E4.

LDH = lactate dehydrogenase.

Pleural suPAR in Malignant Effusions

Pleural suPAR levels were significantly higher in malignant effusions that were loculated at the time of pleural fluid analysis (P < 0.01) (Table 4). We performed a further analysis to assess whether baseline pleural suPAR levels could predict future malignant loculations. The "delayed loculation" group included effusions that started out nonloculated (simple) and became loculated (over a period of 4–6 mo). Baseline pleural suPAR levels were nonsignificantly higher in the delayed loculation group compared with those that remained nonloculated (P = 0.19) (Figure 4).

Concurrent pleural and pericardial effusions are not an unusual finding, but their differential diagnosis remains uncertain. Medline-based review identified an extensive list of infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, iatrogenic, and myriad other etiologies. A single retrospective study had addressed this presentation. Several principles of a diagnostic workup are suggested, acknowledging that a significant minority of patients may not require a comprehensive workup and remain 'idiopathic'.

### Diagnostic work-up of pleural effusion: recommendations… [^e3b9e51a]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Contemplating the clinical possibilities when a pleural effusion is evident on a chest radiograph is a situation that family physicians face numerous times. The author, Light, updates readers on the topic of pleural effusions and provides an algorithm for the diagnostic work-up. Although the complete differential diagnosis for pleural effusion is wide, the most common causes in the United States are congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and cancer. The initial history and physical examination can help guide the further work-up of pleural effusion. Findings suggestive of congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or cancer will influence the choice of study. Ultrasonography or lateral decubitus chest radiograph is commonly used to confirm the presence of pleural effusion.

The author suggests restricting thoracentesis to cases with a clinically significant pleural effusion with no obvious underlying cause. The initial appearance of the pleural fluid obtained by thoracentesis can suggest different common possible etiologies. Bloody fluid is most often caused by cancer, pulmonary embolus, or trauma; straw-colored, transudative pleural effusions indicate congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or pulmonary embolism; and thicker exudative fluid suggests pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or cancer. The pleural fluid occurring with pulmonary embolus can appear like any of these three types. Light's criteria rely on the serum-to-pleural fluid gradients for protein and lactate dehydrogenase to differentiate transudative and exudative effusions.

If the clinical suspicion is a transudative process but Light's criteria suggest exudate, an additional criterion that would favor transudate is a serum albumin level of at least 1. 2 g per dL higher than that of pleural-fluid albumin. Exudative effusions require further work-up to separate infectious causes from cancer and other possibilities. A predominance of neutrophils in the pleural fluid favors an acute process, while a lymphocytic majority is indicative of chronic disease. Cell cytology analysis can efficiently identify many adenocarcinomas but is less sensitive for squamous cell cancer or lymphoma.

### Respositionable chest tube for pleural drainage [^fe558e5a]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Patients can develop pleural effusions for multiple reasons to includes: infection, trauma, malignancy, and heart failure. Placement of a thoracostomy tube for drainage is a common management strategy. However, the fluid is not always free flowing in the pleural space and may be loculated. One of the drawbacks of the standard chest tube is that it remains stationary in the chest after being placed. This may prevent maximum pleural fluid drainage from a standard chest tube. Often, only fluid in the general vicinity of the tube is drained, while fluid farther away is unaffected. When the pleural space is infected, it is more likely to be loculated and maximum pleural fluid drainage, which is desired to clear the space of the infection, is less likely with a single tube.

An innovative tube has been developed which can be repositioned within the pleural space readily from exterior to the thorax. We hypothesize that a chest tube which can be repositioned after placement in the pleural space should eliminate inadequate drainage, speed the patient's recovery, and reduce the cost of hospitalization via a reduction in hospital length of stay. As it can be repositioned, it may reduce the need for additional chest tubes or surgical interventions. If any or all of these occur, the overall cost of treatment may be significantly reduced. The repositionable chest tube (RCT) is substantially similar in other aspects to chest tubes in current use including common radiographic markings and number and size of drainage holes. It is a 510(k) exempt item with the FDA and is approved for use in humans. However, the main difference of the RCT compared with a standard chest tubes is the ability to adjust its position in the thorax cavity after placement. This can aide with evacuation of unwanted or loculated fluid after initial drainage. These repositionable tubes allow the intrathoracic portion to be moved in a symmetric 135 degree arc from midline to both sides for a total 270-degree arc. Two control wires within the tubing connected to a mechanical actuator outside the chest that can then adjust the tube inside the pleural space.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: non-small cell lung cancer, version 7.2025 [^dfae281d]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer pleural effusion and metastatic disease confirmation — Patients with lung cancer with an associated pleural effusion should undergo thoracentesis and cytology. A negative pleural cytology result does not exclude pleural involvement. Thoracoscopic evaluation of the pleura should be considered before starting curative intent therapy if pleural fluid is a lymphocytic exudate with negative pleural fluid cytology. Patients suspected of having a solitary site of metastatic disease should have tissue confirmation of that site if feasible. Patients suspected of having metastatic disease should have confirmation from one of the metastatic sites if feasible. Patients who may have multiple sites of metastatic disease — based on a strong clinical suspicion — should have biopsy of the primary lung lesion or mediastinal lymph nodes if it is technically difficult or very risky to biopsy a metastatic site. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Methods

Patients

Between 2009 and 2016, patients presenting to a UK tertiary pleural service with undiagnosed pleural effusions requiring a diagnostic thoracentesis were prospectively recruited to an observational study (IRAS ethics number 08/H0102/11). All had routine serum and pleural fluid analysis, including a full blood count, serum CRP (C-reactive protein), pleural fluid pH, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). At the time of pleural fluid sampling, pleural ultrasound was performed by a physician at least level 1 British Thoracic Society ultrasound-trained (or equivalent) with the presence of loculations documented. Repeat ultrasounds or computed tomography scans were performed if clinically indicated, and the development of loculations was recorded. Patients gave consent for storage of their baseline pleural fluid and serum samples in a −70°C freezer for future analysis.

Patients were followed up at 1 year to ascertain the final diagnosis of their pleural effusion, which was decided by two independent respiratory consultants based on prespecified criteria (see Appendix E1 in the online supplement). Patients were otherwise treated as per standard care; see Appendix E2 for local guidelines on parapneumonic effusion management.

### A pleural effusion of multiple causes [^3ed5427c]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Multiple medical disorders can lead to the development of pleural effusions. Most effusions are given a single diagnosis in clinical practice. However, the cause of the effusion can change during the disease course, and concomitant yet distinct causes are often underrecognized. We highlight this point by reporting a complex case of recurrent pleural effusions with different predominant causes during the disease course. Five causes for the pleural effusion were diagnosed, namely malignant pleural effusion, empyema, chylothorax, transudative pleural effusion secondary to hypoalbuminemia, and esophagopleural fistula. This case serves as a reminder to clinicians that recurrent pleural effusion, even within the same pleural space, can arise from different causes and, whenever clinically appropriate, reinvestigation of the pleural effusion may be needed.

### Tissue plasminogen activator with prolonged dwell time effectively evacuates pleural effusions [^8d5055d0]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The natural history of pleural fibrosis suggests that symptom duration, and perhaps other clinical features should predict the efficacy of intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy. However symptom duration is a highly subjective and unreliable metric, and proved essentially useless as a predictor of outcome in our series. Pleural fluid characteristics also had no predictive value. As a result it is our practice to give tPA if imaging shows incomplete pleural drainage regardless of effusion etiology or duration. Minimal drainage (< 100 mL) or imaging showing a trapped lung indicates that further tPA therapy is futile, while a high volume of drainage suggests that further therapy may be successful. This protocol facilitates rapid clinical decision-making and is safe.

### Transthoracic ultrasound to predict exudative pleural effusion etiology [^0f0502ef]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Pleural effusions often require invasive sampling to establish underlying etiologies. Transthoracic ultrasound (TUS) has shown promise in the diagnostics of pleural effusions; however, there lacks consensus regarding its clinical application. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of specific TUS findings for exudative effusions, specifically complex parapneumonic effusion and empyema.

Methods

Ultrasound-guided pleural effusion drainage cases were retrospectively reviewed at a single university-based medical center from July 2015 to May 2023. Procedure-related images were reviewed for specific ultrasound findings: anechoic, fibrin, septation, loculation, plankton/swirl sign, hematocrit sign, jellyfish sign, and visceral pleura thickening. Exudative or transudative nature, underlying etiology, and other patient data were collected from chart review. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and positive likelihood ratio (LR+) were calculated for these findings, either individually or in combination, to predict nature and specific etiology for pleural effusion. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to analyze the association between TUS findings and complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema.

Results

A total of 389 cases included, 252 (64.8%) were exudative and 137 (35.2%) were transudative effusions. Findings of anechoic and jellyfish sign were more common in the transudative group, while septation, loculation, and pleural thickening appeared more commonly in exudative effusion (P < 0.05). Absence of all three signs of fibrin, septation, and loculation had 83% sensitivity (95% CI 77–90) and 78% NPV (95% CI 70–86) for transudative effusion. Septation and loculation had 98% specificity (95% CI 95–100) and 94% PPV (95% CI 88–100) for exudative effusion. Fibrin, loculation, and septation, when found concurrently, had 99% specificity (95% CI 98–100) and 96% PPV (95% CI 88–100) for exudative effusion. Multivariable logistic regression showed the presence of septation (odds ratio [OR] 5.3, 95% CI 1.7–16.3, P = 0.0038) and loculation (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.1–10.0, P = 0.0327) were each independently associated with the likelihood of complicated parapneumonic and empyema cases.

Conclusions

TUS features of loculation or septation are specific and predictive for exudative pleural effusion. The presence of septation and loculation was each associated with a higher likelihood of complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema. Further studies are needed to validate diagnostic models that incorporate both TUS and clinical features to predict the nature and etiology of pleural effusions.

Pleural Effusion Classification

We defined effusions with additional pleural complexity features as complex and effusions without complexity features as simple. In the 335 cases for effusion classification, the additional pleural complexity features "hyperdense fluid", "pleural thickening", "gas", and "loculation" were visually determined by reader 1 in consensus with reader 4 (J.B. 29 PGY) and radiologically defined as:

- **Hyperdense fluid**: Density values greater than 15.6 HU in the pleural cavity, not otherwise explained, for example, by artifacts. Additional potential indicators such as rib fractures, postoperative changes, pleural fluid sedimentation, or pleural contrast extravasation confirmed the diagnosis, if present.
- **Pleural thickening**: Nodular or smooth pleural line as seen in the soft tissue kernel.
- **Gas**: Density values less than −850 within the pleural cavity resembling microbubbles (gas surrounded by pleural fluid) and/or pneumothorax.
- **Loculation**: Pleural effusion with an obtuse angle to the lung parenchyma (90 degrees < α < 180 degrees).

In addition, the classification dataset was dichotomized based on the resulting diagnosis of serous effusion from biopsy or thoracocentesis in the test dataset. However, microscopic evidence of erythrocytes in an otherwise serous effusion was not rated as a complex effusion, as this can be periprocedural.

The sample was randomly split into training/validation and testing datasets (n = 234 and n = 101, 70% and 30%, respectively).

### Recurrent loculated pleural effusions due to pleuropulmonary paragonimus westermani infection [^d9d36d4d]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
(A) Chest x-ray posteroanterior and lateral views demonstrating large loculated left-sided pleural effusion. (B) Chest computed tomography, contrast enhanced in coronal and axial cuts, showing loculated left pleural effusion with curvilinear ossification inferiorly. (C) Wet mount images derived from pleural fluid specimen demonstrating multiple Paragonimus westermani ova clumped together. (D) A single P. westermani ovum.

Paragonimus westermani is a foodborne infection transmitted through ingestion of raw crustaceans and is endemic to multiple Asian, African, and South American countries. Paragonimiasis is treated with praziquantel, and alternative treatment is with triclabendazole. There are reports of recurrent pleural effusions caused by pulmonary paragonimiasis treated with pleural drainage and four cycles of praziquantel at 75 mg/kg for 2- to 3-day courses at 3-week intervals with cure. Expected duration of ova persistence in pleural fluid after treatment and fluid evacuation is unknown. Treatment is effective only against the adult fluke, not the ova.

This case demonstrates a rare scenario of recurrent pleural effusion from P. westermani infection. It is unlikely that this was a result of repeated infections because of lack of travel and dietary history. The adult Paragonimus spp. life span is up to 20 years; however, given her recurrent presentations over 10 years (confirmed in Canada) and 40 years (including effusion drained) in Korea plus her directly observed completion of first- and second-line treatments make it unlikely she still had live Paragonimus adult flukes excreting ova. Most likely, this represents chronic pleural inflammation related to the large ova burden released from a chronic calcified sequestrum with ossification (Figure 1B) rather than inadequate treatment or antiparasitic resistance.

Biomarkers and predictive factors

Recently, it has been recognized that components of the fibrinolytic system within pleural fluids not only regulate fibrinolytic agents and IPFT but relate to outcomes of pleural infection. Pleural fluid PAI-1 was found to relate to the formation of intrapleural septations, their severity, length of hospital stay and 12-month mortality. While increasing concentrations of PAI-1 antigen were associated with the severity of septations, their presence did not relate to clinical outcomes. PAI-1 rapidly inhibits tPA and the two chain active form of urokinase and lesser amounts of PAI-1 activity are detectable in pleural fluids of empyema patients than total PAI-1 antigen. While PAI-1 activity was not measured in this study, it likely contributes to both pleural septation/loculation severity and may better reflect clinical outcomes. At present, this issue remains to be further clarified in future clinical trial testing. IPFT was used in a minority of these patients as the samples were collected some time ago, before IPFT became more commonly used. Prospective future analyses will be needed to assess the contribution of PAI-1 to clinical outcomes and to the effectiveness of IPFT and its safety. In a related vein, increased soluble urokinase receptor (suPAR) concentrations in pleural fluids of patients with pleural infections were recently found to occur in loculated versus non-loculated parapneumonic pleural effusions and predict the need for more invasive chest tube management. While this is a another promising biomarker, its validation and clinical utility awaits further rigorous clinical trial testing. The potential role of pleural fluid suPAR as a repository for uPA or scuPA, and its influence on uPA-based forms of intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy (IPFT), remains uncertain at this time.

### Computed tomography in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^45d03e9a]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Pleural complications of pneumonia

Pneumonia can also be complicated by pleural effusions that do not resolve with antibiotic therapy and may require surgical drainage or thoracoscopy. It is estimated that while 1% of children with community-acquired pneumonia develop pleural effusions, effusions are seen much more frequently in hospitalized children (up to 40%). According to the British Thoracic Society guidelines, when there is persisting fever despite adequate antibiotic treatment, clinicians should suspect the development of an empyema. Lai et al. also report an incidence of 12% to 66% of bronchopleural fistula developing as a complication of necrotizing pneumonia.

Even though pleural effusion is visible on chest radiographs, ultrasound (US) is the recommended method for estimating the amount of fluid (Fig. 6). The size of the effusion is significant when deciding on management. Chest US is also considered superior to chest CT in its ability to demonstrate internal components of an effusion such as loculations and fibrin strands (Fig. 7). The British Thoracic Society guidelines recommend chest US for detecting pleural effusion and guiding drain placement, but indicate that CT with intravenous contrast "is useful for evaluation of advanced parenchymal disease" associated with effusions (Figs. 8 and 9). The Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America note that even though history and physical examination can suggest the possibility of an accompanying effusion in children with community-acquired pneumonia, chest radiographs should be used for confirmation while chest US or CT should only be performed when chest radiography is inconclusive (Fig. 10). Identifying any parenchymal complication such as necrotizing pneumonia or abscess coexisting with an effusion is important because these findings will ensure treatment with a prolonged course of antibiotics.

### Malignant pleural effusion: presentation, diagnosis, and management [^8a2986a4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions are common in patients with cancer. Most malignant pleural effusions are secondary to metastases to the pleura, most often from lung or breast cancer. The presence of malignant effusion indicates advanced disease and poor survival; in lung cancer, the presence of malignant effusion upstages the cancer to stage 4. Usually presenting as a large, unilateral exudative effusion, most patients with malignant pleural effusion experience dyspnea. Prior to intervention, diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion and exclusion of infection should be made. Thoracic imaging is typically performed, with computed tomography considered by many to be the gold standard. Thoracic ultrasound is also useful, particularly if diaphragmatic or pleural thickening and nodularity can be identified. Cytology should then be obtained; this is typically done via pleural fluid aspiration or pleural biopsy. Treatment focuses on palliation and relief of symptoms. Numerous interventions are available, ranging from drainage with thoracentesis or indwelling pleural catheter to more definitive, invasive options such as pleurodesis. There is no clear best approach, and a patient-centered approach should be taken.
