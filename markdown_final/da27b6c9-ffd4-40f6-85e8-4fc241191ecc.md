## Question

How can comorbid psychiatric disorders complicate alcohol withdrawal treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how comorbid psychiatric disorders complicate alcohol withdrawal treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how common psychiatric comorbidity is and whether it meaningfully alters withdrawal risk. Then, I should examine diagnostic pitfalls created by symptom overlap and medication masking. Next, I will assess how comorbidity distorts risk stratification tools and influences level-of-care decisions and monitoring. After that, I need to analyze pharmacologic management challenges, including drug–drug interactions, hepatic considerations, and special populations. Finally, I will consider outcome implications and practical strategies to mitigate these risks, drawing on guideline recommendations and research gaps, while verifying each step against the cited sources as I go [^113V4SF3] [^115QwBEZ].

> Let me first confirm the clinical relevance. Psychiatric comorbidity is common in alcohol-dependent populations, with NESARC showing about 39% having an independent mood or anxiety disorder overall and over 52% among those seeking treatment, which means this is a routine, not exceptional, scenario that will regularly affect withdrawal care [^114rKNUh]. I need to ensure that guideline frameworks recognize this risk; ASAM explicitly lists signs or symptoms of co-occurring psychiatric disorders as individual risk factors for complicated withdrawal, underscoring that psychiatric illness is not merely coexistent but prognostically active during detoxification [^113V4SF3].

> Now, diagnostic complexity: Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, because anxiety, agitation, tremor, and insomnia can come from withdrawal or from primary psychiatric disorders, creating substantial overlap. ASAM stresses comprehensive assessment to exclude other serious illnesses that can mimic withdrawal, and to check whether psychiatric medications could be masking early withdrawal signs, which can delay recognition or lead to misattribution of symptoms [^115QwBEZ]. Wait, let me verify one potential misstep: I initially thought we could rely on CIWA-Ar to diagnose AWS, but the guideline cautions that severity scales should not be used as diagnostic tools and that clinicians should neither rule in nor rule out concurrent mental health disorders just because withdrawal is present, so concurrent evaluation must proceed in parallel with withdrawal management and should use collateral information when possible [^116swBj5] [^116S92Xj] [^111NFt91].

> Risk stratification next. I should confirm whether standard tools are reliable when psychiatric symptoms inflate scores. ASAM notes that most withdrawal severity scales reflect signs and symptoms and should not be used alone to determine level of care, which matters because panic, psychosis, or medication side effects can distort physiologic and symptom-based scoring in comorbid patients [^113f7ydV]. ATS research further cautions that measurable inpatient variables are often confounded by common comorbidities, diminishing the predictive value of risk models in acutely ill patients, so clinical judgment becomes paramount in this group [^114DXc1E]. Let me consider validated risk assessment again: ASAM advises using a validated risk assessment scale alongside individualized risk factors, rather than substituting one for the other, precisely to mitigate misclassification in complex psychiatric presentations [^111JEAzC].

> I will now examine implications for setting of care and monitoring. ASAM recommends determining level of care using current signs, risk of severe or complicated withdrawal, potential complications, and contextual factors such as recovery capital and environment; patients with unstable psychiatric conditions often have limited recovery capital and are pushed toward higher-acuity settings to ensure safety and adherence [^116cvriX]. For outpatient care, ASAM limits eligibility to those with mitigated risk factors; serious psychiatric instability usually disqualifies patients from ambulatory detox given the need for close observation and swift intervention [^1152Qhw6]. But wait, what if suicidality is present? ASAM advises inpatient management in a psychiatric setting equipped to manage suicide risk while also delivering withdrawal care, which becomes the decisive factor when acute risk is identified [^114i5YH4]. Hmm, wait a minute, do most patients with severe alcohol withdrawal land in the ICU, and does this hold for psychiatric comorbidity too? ATS describes that most SAWS cases are managed in ICU settings and emphasizes the heterogeneity of practice, so severe withdrawal plus psychiatric instability often necessitates intensive monitoring and rapid titration protocols, though I should acknowledge this is an expert research statement rather than a formal guideline [^114zBLS4]. Next, I should review monitoring cadence; ASAM recommends frequent reassessment for moderate-to-severe withdrawal, including vital signs, orientation, sleep, and emotional status with attention to suicidality, especially during the first 24–48 hours when trajectory can rapidly evolve [^112hxC3U] [^116wzTe8].

> Pharmacologic management gets complicated by comorbid psychiatric disorders and their treatments, so let me think about core principles and exceptions. Benzodiazepines remain first-line for moderate-to-severe AWS, with alternatives like phenobarbital considered by experienced clinicians or when benzodiazepines are contraindicated, but treatment must be individualized around comorbidities and concomitant psychotropics that increase sedation risk or prolong QTc, and this requires close monitoring for oversedation and respiratory depression in higher-acuity settings [^113V64BP] [^1146XYaD]. I should double-check hepatic considerations, since many psychotropics and benzodiazepines are hepatically metabolized; ASAM advises dose adjustments or choosing agents with less hepatic metabolism in liver disease, and gastroenterology guidance cautions that benzodiazepines can precipitate or worsen hepatic encephalopathy in alcohol-associated liver disease, necessitating cautious dosing and vigilant monitoring [^115Fj7cS] [^1152gmix]. Hold on, I need to ensure safety when psychiatric comorbidity includes opioid agonist therapy or chronic opioids; ASAM recommends close monitoring due to elevated respiratory depression risk when combining benzodiazepines with opioids, and it reminds us to account for tolerance to sedatives in those previously exposed to GABAergic agents, which is common in psychiatric populations treated with benzodiazepines [^115WoR5r] [^113rUFS5]. Let me verify nuanced scenarios: distinguishing alcohol-related psychosis from primary psychosis matters because ASAM allows diazepam for hallucinations in alcohol-induced psychosis, but misclassification could delay appropriate antipsychotic therapy or overlook a primary disorder requiring different long-term management, so psychiatric consultation is often necessary in ambiguous cases [^111MJvW1] [^111yJFuW].

> Next, outcomes and the evidence gap. I should confirm whether the population we are discussing is represented in trials; NESARC-based analyses suggest that the vast majority of treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent individuals with independent mood or anxiety disorders would be excluded from typical alcohol treatment trials, which leaves clinicians with limited high-quality evidence tailored to this common scenario [^114rKNUh]. ATS highlights the need for predictive and prognostic enrichment strategies and for expanding targets beyond GABAergic systems, recognizing that benzodiazepine tolerance and adverse effects can limit efficacy in severe withdrawal and that neuroimmune and neuropeptide systems may be relevant in complex cases with psychiatric comorbidity [^111pDErr]. I need to check the status of definitions and tools; there is still no validated diagnostic tool for SAWS in general hospital or ICU settings and no consensus operational definition, compounding uncertainty when comorbid psychiatric conditions are present and complicating both clinical care and research [^116MddGX].

> Practical implications follow from these challenges. I should confirm that guidelines recommend broad lab and collateral data gathering to surface comorbidities and alternative diagnoses; ASAM endorses comprehensive metabolic and hepatic panels, CBC, and targeted infectious screening where indicated, and advises evaluating for polysubstance use with toxicology testing and collateral history to anticipate additional withdrawal syndromes and drug interactions that are common in psychiatric comorbidity [^114yfmTr] [^1176AXT7] [^111NFt91]. Supportive care must be robust, with calm, oriented environments and frequent reassurance, alongside escalation plans for delirium requiring continuous monitoring and resuscitative readiness in settings where high benzodiazepine doses or infusions are used, particularly in patients with complex comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions [^112WDTPe] [^112t2tP9].

> Synthesis: I need to ensure I am not oversimplifying. Comorbid psychiatric disorders complicate alcohol withdrawal treatment by obscuring diagnosis through symptom overlap and medication masking, degrading the accuracy of symptom-based risk tools, escalating the required level of care and monitoring because of suicidality or instability, and creating pharmacologic uncertainty due to polypharmacy, hepatic dysfunction, sedative tolerance, and respiratory depression risk, all amid an evidence base that underrepresents this population and necessitates multidisciplinary coordination to prevent harm [^115QwBEZ] [^113f7ydV] [^116cvriX] [^115WoR5r] [^114rKNUh] [^1167NqUg]. Hold on, I should verify that we also integrate longitudinal care; ASAM and APA recommend initiating treatment for alcohol use disorder and assessing co-occurring psychiatric disorders during or immediately after withdrawal management to reduce relapse risk and to align pharmacotherapy with psychiatric needs, reinforcing that detox is the start, not the end, of treatment planning [^115P5zLM] [^111g1dYE].

Comorbid psychiatric disorders complicate alcohol withdrawal treatment by **masking or mimicking withdrawal symptoms** [^115QwBEZ], which complicates diagnosis and monitoring [^116swBj5]. They also **increase the risk of severe withdrawal** — seizures and delirium tremens — and relapse, and raise the risk of dangerous drug interactions and oversedation with benzodiazepines [^113V4SF3] [^117SVsCL] [^1121XKfL]. Management requires **integrated care** [^114cAwqv], **close monitoring** for oversedation and respiratory depression [^1146XYaD], and **individualized pharmacotherapy** to address both withdrawal and psychiatric symptoms [^111yR89h].

---

## Diagnostic challenges

- **Symptom overlap**: Anxiety, agitation, insomnia, and hallucinations [^114cWaGK] from psychiatric disorders can mimic or mask withdrawal [^115QwBEZ], complicating diagnosis and monitoring.

- **Misattribution risk**: Psychiatric symptoms may be misattributed to withdrawal [^116S92Xj], delaying appropriate psychiatric care and worsening outcomes.

- **Assessment complexity**: Comorbid psychiatric disorders require comprehensive assessment [^111NFt91] and differential diagnosis to distinguish withdrawal from psychiatric symptoms [^115QwBEZ].

---

## Increased severity and complications

Comorbid psychiatric disorders **increase the risk of severe withdrawal** [^113V4SF3], including seizures and delirium tremens [^117613y8]. They can exacerbate autonomic hyperactivity, thereby increasing cardiovascular complications. Psychiatric symptoms can trigger relapse, which complicates withdrawal management and raises the risk of recurrence [^1144TLyy].

---

## Pharmacological management complexities

- **Drug interactions**: Psychiatric medications can interact experiencing withdrawal treatments, causing adverse effects or reduced efficacy [^117SVsCL].

- **Oversedation risk**: Benzodiazepines, first-line for withdrawal, can cause oversedation and respiratory depression, especially with psychiatric medications [^1121XKfL] [^115WoR5r].

- **Individualized pharmacotherapy**: Treatment must be tailored to address both withdrawal and psychiatric symptoms, requiring careful medication selection and dosing [^111yR89h] [^115Fj7cS].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

Patients with psychiatric comorbidities require **frequent monitoring** [^112hxC3U] for oversedation, respiratory depression [^1146XYaD], and exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms [^116wzTe8]. Given the increased suicide risk, vigilant monitoring and safety planning are essential [^114i5YH4]. Significant psychiatric comorbidity may necessitate a higher level of care, such as inpatient or intensive outpatient treatment [^116cvriX].

---

## Integrated treatment approaches

Integrated care involving **addiction specialists, psychiatrists, and primary care providers** is essential for optimal outcomes [^114cAwqv]. Manage alcohol withdrawal and psychiatric disorders concurrently to reduce relapse and improve recovery [^111g1dYE]. Educate patients about withdrawal, psychiatric symptoms, and treatment options to support adherence and recovery [^112WDTPe].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **ASAM guidelines**: Emphasize comprehensive assessment, individualized pharmacotherapy, and close monitoring for patients with psychiatric comorbidities [^112hxC3U] [^115QwBEZ].

- **APA guidelines**: Recommend assessing and treating psychiatric comorbidities concurrently with alcohol withdrawal management.

- **CRISM guidelines**: Use clinical parameters and validated tools (e.g. PAWSS) to assess risk and guide management [^112KZJFz].

---

Comorbid psychiatric disorders complicate alcohol withdrawal treatment by increasing severity, complicating diagnosis, and creating pharmacological challenges [^117SVsCL]. Effective management requires **integrated care**, **individualized pharmacotherapy**, and **close monitoring** to address both withdrawal and psychiatric symptoms [^115P5zLM] [^112hxC3U].

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^1137v4Pk]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Two co-chairs (T.L.S. and E.L.B.), who are members of the ATS, organized an ad hoc committee. The co-chairs aimed to assemble a committee with unique but complementary research expertise related to unhealthy alcohol consumption and alcohol withdrawal, encompassing the research proficiency across the translational spectrum. Invitations to participate were based in part on the publication record of potential participants.

Given the interdisciplinary nature of care for patients with SAWS, committee members with diverse laboratory and clinical backgrounds were invited. These included basic scientists, pulmonary and critical care physicians, psychiatrists, addiction medicine specialists, emergency medicine physicians, medical toxicologists, surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, and pharmacists from both U.S. and international research communities, encompassing members and nonmembers of the ATS. Not all who were invited could ultimately participate, and the total number of committee members was limited by funding for the project. The co-chairs continued to extend invitations until a sufficiently diverse cohort had been assembled.

The final assembled committee was charged with addressing specific questions posed a priori relating to the management of SAWS, including:

- **What is the relevant pathophysiology underlying SAWS?**
- **What clinical endpoints should be targeted through treatment?**
- **What are the limitations of strategies for diagnosing, grading, and treating SAWS?**
- **What patient factors warrant consideration in the management of SAWS?**

The primary obstacles to advancing T0–T1 SAWS research include the lack of a precise definition of SAWS and the delineation of time points associated with its clinical progression. The distinct features of AUD, physical/somatic dependence, withdrawal, and SAWS do not have specific biological correlates or animal models that clearly recapitulate these conditions. A particular challenge for basic scientists is the lack of readily accessible biomarkers to support early identification and prevention of SAWS. Greater progress and further insight might be achieved by following recommendations from the National Institute of Mental Health, which launched its Research Domain Criteria framework in 2009 to better organize diagnostic and research efforts toward valid objective criteria and away from homogeneous constructs and classifications associated with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual classifications.

Another challenge for the application of preclinical research to patients with SAWS is the preponderance of comorbidities in this population, including acute medical and surgical illnesses and polysubstance use. The common occurrence of polysubstance use in the setting of SAWS has been partially addressed by recent efforts from the Collaborative Research on Addiction at NIH. This initiative aims to support integrative investigations across used substances. As a result, additional research funding is now available to understand how diverse substances such as nicotine and opioids interact with alcohol to modify SAWS vulnerability, including neurobiological mechanisms.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly in an outpatient setting, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend regular reassessment of the patient's health since the last checkup. Assessments should include evaluating general physical condition, vital signs, hydration, orientation, sleep, and emotional status, including any suicidal thoughts, at each visit. Additionally, it is important to inquire about alcohol and other substance use and, if possible, measure blood alcohol content with a breathalyzer to detect recent alcohol use.

Experts agree that early identification and treatment of patients at risk for severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS) would improve patient outcomes, but there is little consensus regarding the optimal approach for risk stratifying hospitalized patients according to their likelihood of developing SAWS. An operational definition could support early identification of patients at risk for SAWS for both clinical and research purposes. Internally and externally valid operational definitions created for a variety of syndromes in critically ill patients (e.g. sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome) have facilitated research and advanced patient care. SAWS investigations would similarly benefit from an operational definition that could be used to identify cases with high interrater reliability, reduce study heterogeneity, and allow clinical trials to build off one another, ultimately improving care for patients.

Numerous studies have sought to understand and develop reliable predictors and assessment tools for SAWS. Unfortunately, few have been validated and subsequently employed in clinical studies. Interpretation of study outcomes remains limited by varying definitions of SAWS, as well as small sample sizes and single-center study designs. At the time of writing, no diagnostic tools for SAWS have been validated in general hospital and/or ICU settings. Although early identification and prediction of disease manifestations are being increasingly applied to other ICU conditions and are likely applicable to SAWS, appropriate resource allocation and management strategies are necessary.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically in terms of indications for pharmacotherapy in an outpatient setting, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering preventative pharmacotherapy for patients at risk of severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or its complications. This should be at the discretion of providers with extensive experience in managing alcohol withdrawal. Benzodiazepines should be administered as first-line therapy to reduce signs and symptoms of withdrawal, including the incidence of seizure and delirium. As an alternative, phenobarbital may be administered by providers experienced with its use. If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, phenobarbital should be administered, or patients should be transferred to a more intensive level of care.

### Do clinical trials of treatment of alcohol dependence adequately enroll participants with co-occurring independent mood and anxiety disorders? An analysis of data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) [^114rKNUh]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

In the care of alcohol-dependent patients, co-occurring independent (i.e. not substance-induced) mood and anxiety disorders present a significant challenge. Clinical trials of alcohol dependence treatment could help clinicians meet this challenge, but only if they enroll such complex patients. This study examined whether such individuals are likely to be included in alcohol dependence treatment trials under typical eligibility criteria.

- **Method**: Data were derived from the 2001–2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a national representative sample of 43,093 adults in the United States population. Psychiatric diagnoses were made according to the DSM-IV criteria with the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-DSM-IV Version (AUDADIS-IV).

- **Results**: Of 1,484 alcohol-dependent participants, 39.22% (SE = 1.67) had a co-occurring independent mood or anxiety disorder; more than 60% of these individuals would be ineligible for an alcohol dependence treatment trial under typical eligibility criteria. Alcohol-dependent individuals with major depressive episode, mania, dysthymia, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder were particularly likely to be excluded from clinical trials. In a subsample of 185 individuals who had sought alcohol treatment, 52.59% (SE = 4.42) had an independent mood or anxiety disorder. Remarkably, almost all of these individuals (96.93%, SE = 1.97) would have been ineligible for clinical trials.

- **Conclusions**: Independent mood and anxiety disorders are prevalent in th

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically concerning screening for comorbidities, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend conducting or arranging a comprehensive metabolic profile or basic metabolic profile, a hepatic panel, and a CBC with differential in settings with laboratory testing access. These tests evaluate the patient's electrolytes, liver function, renal function, and immune function. In settings with limited laboratory testing access, obtain results when feasible to assist with treatment planning decisions. It is important to address any detected nutritional deficiencies. Initial screening may also include laboratory tests for hepatitis, HIV (with consent), and tuberculosis.

At the in-person meeting in May 2019, each of the four section leaders briefly provided a synopsis of the available literature regarding research questions assigned to their section/translational domain. The section leaders identified preliminary knowledge gaps, which were vetted and expanded on by the full committee through discussion and consensus. The four sections then convened separately in breakout sessions to further define and delineate urgent research priorities. Finally, the entire committee reconvened to present refined concepts of needed research for severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS). The meeting was recorded, and the co-chairs and section leaders took notes, which were later used in document development.

- **Document development**: One chairperson (T.L.S.) drafted an outline of the research statement and circulated the outline to section leaders, who were tasked with drafting their sections of the manuscript. Notes from the in-person meeting held in May 2019 were available as needed. The co-chairs drafted all additional content with input and editing by committee members. The full committee reviewed the final draft of the manuscript and provided iterative feedback and revisions. After additional review and revision by the co-chairs and approval of the manuscript by committee members, a final draft was submitted to the ATS executive committee.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^113pRDwj]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly concerning indications for pharmacotherapy in an outpatient setting, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as the first-line therapy for patients experiencing moderate alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score of 10–18). As alternative options, carbamazepine or gabapentin can be administered. If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital (for providers experienced with its use) should be considered. Additionally, carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid (with no liver disease or childbearing potential) may be used as adjuncts to benzodiazepines.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly in terms of clinical assessment, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend gathering additional information about risk factors. This can be achieved by interviewing family, friends, and caregivers about the patient's history of alcohol withdrawal, seizures, and delirium, as appropriate. It is important to obtain written or verbal consent from the patient in non-emergent situations before speaking with or consulting collateral sources.

### Alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^114cWaGK]. Nursing (2023). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on alcohol withdrawal syndrome:

- **Definition**: AWS is a condition that occurs after the abrupt cessation or significant reduction of alcohol intake following heavy and prolonged use.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of AWS involves neuroadaptive changes in the CNS due to chronic alcohol consumption. Chronic alcohol use leads to the upregulation of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and the downregulation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. When alcohol consumption is abruptly stopped, this results in a hyperadrenergic state and increased glutamatergic activity, causing withdrawal symptoms.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for AWS include heavy and prolonged alcohol use, prior withdrawal episodes, concomitant use of other sedative-hypnotics, and comorbid medical or psychiatric conditions.

- **Disease course**: The clinical course of AWS typically begins with mild symptoms, such as tremors, anxiety, and nausea within 6–12 hours of cessation of alcohol intake. More severe symptoms, such as hallucinations and seizures, can occur within 12–48 hours. Delirium tremens, characterized by severe confusion, hallucinations, and cardiovascular instability, typically occurs within 48–96 hours.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Although most cases of AWS are self-limiting and resolve within a week, severe complications such as seizures and delirium tremens can be life-threatening. The use of validated risk assessment tools, such as the PAWSS, can help identify patients at risk of severe AWS and guide management strategies.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113vAkLG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Amid impressive research collaborations and noteworthy advances in critical care medicine, certain conditions have received less attention than others. This inequality in the application of science to practice has not clearly tracked with disease prevalence, morbidity, or mortality. Addiction research and treatment is under-resourced compared with other medical conditions. Although the overarching reasons for these inequalities are likely multifactorial, in the case of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS), stigma and stereotypes pose challenges that have arguably blunted the standards of research and acceptable practices in this field.

At the same time, opioid use disorder and overdose have captured the public's attention and are garnering appropriate research support. However, treatment standards for the more common manifestations of alcohol use disorder (AUD), including alcohol withdrawal, remain underdeveloped. This report takes a step toward addressing this imbalance by identifying several investigative opportunities for improving the management of SAWS. Subsequent steps will be the true catalysts for change. Scientists from various disciplines need to direct their attention to the problem of SAWS, pool their energies and expertise, and convince funding agencies to support the research efforts described in this report.

Providers from various disciplines care for patients with SAWS, making it a broadly relevant problem, but this diversity may also contribute to a historical lack of ownership. Through this report, the ATS and its critical care community assume responsibility for elevating the standards.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^114zBLS4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS) is a highly morbid condition characterized by brain hyperexcitation that occurs among patients who discontinue heavy alcohol use. The definition of heavy alcohol use varies. Daily consumption in the range of four or more drinks for men, or three or more drinks for women, has been used to define heavy alcohol use, as well as binge drinking on 5 or more days per month. However, central nervous system alterations can occur at levels of alcohol consumption differing from these quantitative definitions, culminating in SAWS.

SAWS is commonly encountered by inpatient providers of various disciplines, but most patients with SAWS are managed in the ICU. Minimal evidence exists to guide inpatient management of SAWS, underscoring broad research questions that span the translational science spectrum. This research statement summarizes existing literature, identifies knowledge gaps, and offers recommendations for high-impact research related to SAWS in each domain of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) T0–T4 research continuum, in which T0–T1 includes basic science research with translation to humans, and T2, T3, and T4 include research with translation to improved patient care, clinical practice, and community health, respectively.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^116aPktZ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly concerning pharmacotherapy indications in an inpatient setting, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering pharmacotherapy or supportive care alone for patients experiencing mild alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score < 10) who are at minimal risk of severe or complicated withdrawal. For pharmacotherapy, administer benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin. If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, administer carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital (for providers experienced with its use). Additionally, consider administering carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid (if no liver disease or childbearing potential) as an adjunct to benzodiazepines.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically concerning indications for pharmacotherapy in an outpatient setting, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering pharmacotherapy initiation (at the discretion of providers with extensive experience in managing alcohol withdrawal) for patients experiencing severe but not complicated withdrawal (CIWA-Ar ≥ 19). Benzodiazepines should be administered as first-line therapy. Phenobarbital is recommended as an alternative option for providers experienced with its use. If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or gabapentin may be administered.

### Promising strategies for the prevention of alcohol-related brain damage through optimised management of acute alcohol withdrawal: A focussed literature review [^115SPkTJ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Low credibility.

The literature review focuses on understanding glutamate balance, a key component in the management of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). The glutamate receptor family includes eight metabotropic G-protein coupled receptors and three ionotropic receptors: NMDA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid (AMPA), and kainate receptors. All these receptors have multiple sub-unit configurations and play a vital role in both the acute presentation and long-term sequelae of AWS.

During AWS, disruptions in glutamate clearance, synthesis, and receptor trafficking lead to hyperfunctioning of the glutamatergic system. This is compounded by a reduction in GABAergic functioning, underpinning many acute symptoms of AWS, such as tremor, tachycardia, and hypertension. The overstimulation of neurons via glutamate receptors can initiate apoptotic processes, resulting in cell death. This is demonstrated by the AMPA and metabotropic glutamate receptor-5 (mGlu 5) dependent hippocampal pyramidal neuron cell death following alcohol exposure at concentrations found in individuals with alcohol dependence presenting to the emergency department and after subsequent withdrawal.

Similarly, NMDA receptor overactivation from chronic ethanol exposure contributes to increased cell death through apoptotic mechanisms. In the long term, these mechanisms can lead to structural brain volume loss, where repeated cycles of withdrawal, detoxification, relapse, and withdrawal contribute significantly to the damage observed.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113J17fo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

- **Pathophysiology of SAWS and development of novel therapeutics (T 0 –T 1 research)**: Basic science research, classified within the T 0 and T 1 research domains, has driven numerous advances in the understanding of alcohol-related pathophysiology. Investigation of nervous system dysfunction after chronic alcohol consumption has grown exponentially in neuroscience research. Over the past decade, preclinical work has successfully promoted new translational strategies aimed at the treatment of pathologic craving and escalated drinking patterns in patients with AUD. SAWS is a highly morbid manifestation of AUD that could be successfully examined by using a similar translational strategy.

At the preclinical level, the biological mediators and consequences of alcohol withdrawal have been delineated using multiple approaches, ranging from ex vivo brain-slice recordings to whole-animal behavior. Fortunately, substantial construct and translational validity exists in animal modeling of SAWS for the human condition. This is particularly true for objective symptoms like seizures and tachycardia, but may also be true for subjective alterations in negative affective states, such as increased irritability and anxiety-like behavior mimicking delirium, which manifest in later stages of SAWS.

- **GABA and glutamate neuroadaptation**: SAWS symptomatology is intricately tied to the neuropharmacologic effects of alcohol and opponent physiologic processes that manifest as withdrawal during periods of abstinence. Research in this area is generally framed in terms of allostatic adaptation.

### Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: Outpatient management [^113E6nER]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Approximately one-half of patients with alcohol use disorder who abruptly stop or reduce their alcohol use will develop signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. This condition is due to the overactivity of the central and autonomic nervous systems, leading to tremors, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, anxiety, and agitation. If untreated or inadequately treated, withdrawal can progress to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, delirium tremens, and death.

The three-question Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption and the single alcohol screening question instrument have the best accuracy for assessing unhealthy alcohol use in adults 18 years and older.

- **Common tools**: Two commonly used tools to assess withdrawal symptoms are the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale, Revised, and the Short Alcohol Withdrawal Scale.

Patients with mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms without additional risk factors for developing severe or complicated withdrawal should be treated as outpatients when possible. Ambulatory withdrawal treatment should include supportive care and pharmacotherapy as appropriate. Mild symptoms can be treated with carbamazepine or gabapentin. Benzodiazepines are first-line therapy for moderate to severe symptoms, with carbamazepine and gabapentin as potential adjunctive or alternative therapies. Physicians should monitor outpatients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome daily for up to five days after their last drink to verify symptom improvement and to evaluate the need for additional treatment.

### Systematic review of symptom-level networks of alcohol use disorder [^11786MtC]. Addiction (2025). Low credibility.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is one of the most prevalent yet consistently undertreated mental health conditions. Individuals struggling with AUD find it challenging to manage their alcohol use despite its negative impact on their physical and mental wellbeing, as well as on their close social network. Under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), AUD is described as a problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two symptoms occurring within a 12-month period.

### The alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^1167NqUg]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is a common management problem in hospital practice for neurologists, psychiatrists, and general physicians alike. Although some patients have mild symptoms and may even be managed in the outpatient setting, others have more severe symptoms or a history of adverse outcomes that requires close inpatient supervision and benzodiazepine therapy.

Many patients with AWS have multiple management issues (including withdrawal symptoms, delirium tremens, the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, seizures, depression, polysubstance abuse, electrolyte disturbances, and liver disease), which requires a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach. Although AWS may be complex, careful evaluation and available treatments should ensure safe detoxification for most patients.

### Executive summary of the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111UhY7w]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Clinical Practice Guideline on Alcohol Withdrawal Management provides guidance on the identification and management of alcohol withdrawal in adults with varying degrees of syndrome severity. The guideline addresses both ambulatory and inpatient care and considers special patient populations. It was developed primarily using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method (RAM), a process to determine the appropriateness of a set of clinical procedures. This process included a review of gray and empirical literature published between January 2012 and October 2017. Nineteen existing guidelines, 112 reviews, and 150 research studies were utilized to develop draft guideline statements, which were assessed by a panel of physicians experienced in withdrawal management and representing a diverse range of settings and patient populations. Recommendations were included in the guideline where consensus on appropriate clinical practice was identified by the panel. Areas where additional research could provide valuable information for determining best practices were highlighted.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^114DXc1E]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Other risk factors for severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS) have been inferred from small, retrospective studies lacking separate validation cohorts. Importantly, the strongest identified predictors of SAWS include previous hospitalizations complicated by SAWS, such as prior episodes of severe withdrawal, diagnosis of alcohol use disorder (AUD), and heavy alcohol consumption as measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). In one meta-analysis, a history of delirium tremens had a likelihood ratio of 2.9 for the development of SAWS and was a stronger predictor than a history of withdrawal seizures.

Other variables, including demographic characteristics, vital signs, laboratory values, and comorbidities, have been reported, but findings were mainly from small retrospective studies. Among this list of reported variables are elevated systolic blood pressure, a blood alcohol concentration above 200 mg/dl, elevated blood urea nitrogen, hypokalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Few studies have examined how differences in patient characteristics, such as demographic data, laboratory values, vital signs, mental status, and medical history, influence the utility of existing tools for predicting SAWS.

Measurable inpatient variables may be confounded by the effects of comorbid conditions that commonly coexist in acutely ill patients, diminishing their potential utility for assessing SAWS risk. The potential for misclassification should also be considered a limitation in applying these findings to critically ill patients, and further studies are needed to demonstrate their added value.

### Alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^115xE3EE]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The spectrum of alcohol withdrawal symptoms ranges from minor symptoms, such as insomnia and tremulousness, to severe complications like withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens. Although history and physical examination are usually sufficient to diagnose alcohol withdrawal syndrome, other conditions may present with similar symptoms. Most patients can be treated safely and effectively as outpatients.

Pharmacologic treatment involves the use of medications that are cross-tolerant with alcohol. Benzodiazepines, the agents of choice, may be administered on a fixed or symptom-triggered schedule. Carbamazepine is an appropriate alternative to a benzodiazepine in the outpatient treatment of patients with mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Medications such as haloperidol, beta blockers, clonidine, and phenytoin may be used as adjuncts to a benzodiazepine in the treatment of complications of withdrawal. Treatment of alcohol withdrawal should be followed by treatment for alcohol dependence.

### Methylation predicts seizures and severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^111sKmb7]. Epigenetics (2024). Low credibility.

Between 2014 and 2018, alcohol use disorder (AUD) was present in 1 in 11 emergency room (ER) visits in the United States. In each of these alcohol-related ER presentations, clinicians must assess potential for alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), with nearly 1.4 million of these ER patients being admitted in hopes of preventing severe AWS.

AWS is a syndrome of autonomic dysregulation, neurologic and psychiatric signs, and symptoms that can begin a few hours or several days following a reduction or cessation in drinking. Although generally mild, severe AWS can be fatal, with hallucinations, delirium, and seizures being frequently observed. Unfortunately, there is no generally accepted method for determining who is at risk for AWS, with only a minority of admitted patients, between 2% and 7%, actually developing severe AWS. As a result, clinicians tend to err on the side of caution and admit many patients who could otherwise be managed in less restrictive care settings.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114E3L4E]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically concerning indications for pharmacotherapy in outpatient settings, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacotherapy in patients at risk of developing new or worsening signs or symptoms of withdrawal while away from the outpatient treatment setting. This includes those with a history of withdrawal episodes of at least moderate severity and those within the window for the development of symptoms during the withdrawal time course.

It is advised to administer benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin as monotherapy. Alternatively, at least a single dose of benzodiazepine may be administered, followed by ongoing treatment according to symptom severity. Patients should be reassessed frequently over the next 24 hours to monitor their need for withdrawal medication, especially if the risk of developing worse withdrawal is unknown.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^114JfoQY]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

High-quality evidence-based treatments for hospitalized patients with severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS) do not yet exist; thus, no published data are available regarding how to best implement guideline-recommended care or monitor outcomes at the population level. Early consideration of implementation frameworks, such as reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance, will help minimize the gaps between efficacious therapies for SAWS and their effective delivery to patients.

- **Recommendation 1**: A wide array of stakeholders (e.g. patients, caregivers, advocacy groups, community members, interdisciplinary clinicians, purchasers, payers, administrators, policymakers, and researchers) should be engaged. Nontraditional partnerships, for example among critical care, medical toxicology, and addiction specialists, should be established before examining an innovation's effectiveness to accelerate the transfer of innovations into practice.

- **Recommendation 2**: Knowledge and infrastructure from existing critical care research networks should be harnessed to establish systems for real-time data collection and feedback spanning multiple hospitals. By describing processes of patient care and providing feedback regarding performance and interventions such as guideline distribution and progress updates, best practices can be refined and reinforced alongside clinical research activities for SAWS to homogenize care.

### Clinical management of cannabis withdrawal [^111zs8ei]. Addiction (2022). High credibility.

In most instances, cannabis withdrawal is not severe and does not have a high risk of severe adverse outcomes. Medical or psychiatric comorbidities increase the risk of severity and the requirement for additional management. Cannabis withdrawal severity can be evaluated by a clinical examination of the number and intensity of DSM-5 or ICD-11 cannabis withdrawal features and by administering standardized measures of cannabis withdrawal. Unlike symptoms of other substance use disorders (SUDs), DSM-5 and ICD-11 assess only the presence or absence of cannabis withdrawal symptoms, rather than their severity. The most clinically relevant criterion is the degree of patient distress or impairment in functioning. This can be assessed both subjectively (e.g. anxiety, sleep quality) and objectively (e.g. weight loss, fever).

- **Cannabis withdrawal scales**: The two most widely used cannabis withdrawal scales are the 16-item marijuana withdrawal checklist (MWC), a revised version of the original 22-item scale, and the 19-item cannabis withdrawal scale (CWS). Both the MWC and CWS were developed before DSM-5. There is considerable overlap of features between DSM-5 and MWC and CWS, but not complete concordance. An adaption of the MWC, the 14-item composite withdrawal scale (WDS), corresponds more closely with cannabis withdrawal symptoms described in the DSM-5. By comparison with other substance withdrawal scales (e.g. alcohol withdrawal scale), there has been limited psychometric validation of the various cannabis withdrawal scales.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1176AXT7]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically concerning the screening for comorbidities, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend evaluating patients for polysubstance use and preparing to treat other potential withdrawal syndromes. To assess a patient's use of other substances, consider the following:

- **Use of validated scales**: Utilize tools like the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test to address other substance use.
- **Toxicology testing**: Conduct urine or other toxicology tests to detect other substance use.
- **Collateral information**: When possible, gather information from collateral sources, such as family and friends, to gain a fuller understanding of the patient's substance use.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^111pDErr]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Despite a strong focus on GABA and glutamate systems in the existing literature, neuroadaptations beyond these neurotransmitters are essential to the pathophysiology of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS) and warrant further investigation to improve treatment strategies, which largely rely on benzodiazepines. The importance of identifying therapeutic targets beyond benzodiazepines is underscored by the adverse effects associated with the use of benzodiazepines in hospitalized patients. In addition, tolerance may render this class of medication ineffective for SAWS in certain patients, mediated by alcohol's interaction with the GABA A/benzodiazepine receptor complex.

- **Other neuromodulatory systems**: Apart from mechanisms involving GABA and glutamate, multiple hormonal and neuromodulatory systems act as higher-level regulators of excitatory and inhibitory neurosignaling during SAWS. Alcohol dysregulates several major neuropeptide systems in the brain, including CRF. CRF receptor signaling mediates both increased pain sensitivity and irritability-like behavior observed during withdrawal in alcohol-dependent rodents. CRF modulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling is altered by chronic alcohol exposure and subsequent withdrawal. CRF also potentiates neuroimmune signaling. Furthermore, the cytokine/chemokine factors IL-6 and CCL2 modify neuronal excitability during alcohol withdrawal. Therefore, mechanisms of neuropeptide and neuroimmune dysregulation during alcohol withdrawal remain worthy of additional investigation.

Alcohol has significant effects on ligand- and voltage-gated channels.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^112WDTPe]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically with respect to inpatient supportive care, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend administering supportive care as a crucial part of managing alcohol withdrawal. Provide frequent reassurance, reorientation to time and place, and nursing care as part of nonpharmacological management. Educate patients about the withdrawal process, including common signs, symptoms, and treatment methods. Manage patients with severe alcohol withdrawal in a quiet, evenly lit room. Offer patients hope and the expectation of recovery.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^114cAwqv]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In hospital settings, no universally accepted method exists for tailoring severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS) treatments to individual patients or patient populations. Strategies vary by treating provider and inpatient context (e.g. emergency department vs. ICU) and patient characteristics (e.g. mechanically ventilated vs. not). Such heterogeneity highlights the need for clinical practice guidelines to improve both recognition and management of SAWS in acutely ill patients. Previous efforts to guide best practices for SAWS and updated guidelines from the American Society of Addiction Medicine do not offer specific recommendations for the treatment of hospitalized patients with co-occurring medical diseases. Instead, a consultative, multidisciplinary approach is recommended for assistance in selecting medications and/or treatment protocols for alcohol withdrawal. Although such an approach can be helpful, it raises concerns for treatment delays and the misapplication of therapies that may have adverse effects. Therefore, understanding the unique needs of hospitalized patients with SAWS, together with the successful implementation of evidence-based practices, requires additional research.

- **Research needs span the translational science spectrum**: Gaps in SAWS research span the translational spectrum — from the use of animal models to approximate the complexities of human disease and support biomarker development, to predictive and prognostic enrichment strategies, rigorous clinical trials to evaluate therapies, comparative-effectiveness research, and implementation studies. Recognizing a broad array of unanswered questions necessitates further investigation into these areas.

### Promising strategies for the prevention of alcohol-related brain damage through optimised management of acute alcohol withdrawal: A focussed literature review [^117JUaSJ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Low credibility.

Alcohol-related brain damage (ARBD) is an umbrella term describing the long-term effects of harmful levels of alcohol consumption on cognition. The following diagnoses are often discussed as examples of pathologies that fall under the ARBD umbrella, representing conditions that are directly, and indirectly associated with the long-term impact of alcohol on the brain: Wernicke's encephalopathy, Korsakoff's syndrome, Marchia–Fava Bignami, and alcohol-related central pontine myelinolysis. However, a diagnosis of ARBD is often made clinically through repeated comprehensive assessment and engagement with patients. The absence of a prior diagnosis of an alcohol-related condition, such as Wernicke's or Korsakoff's syndrome, for example, should not limit patient access to ARBD services. The impact of chronic alcohol consumption on cognition ranges from episodic and working memory impairments, deficits in sustained and divided attention, altered sensory processing speeds, poor impulse control, and changes in behavioral and emotional regulation.

The link between AWS and ARBD is an area of ongoing research. Whilst the precise link between suboptimally managed or repeated cycles of withdrawal and ARBD is not yet clear, various lines of evidence suggest that an increasing number of episodes of alcohol withdrawal may be associated with more complex patterns of cognitive impairment. These include impaired attentional and executive function, altered functional connectivity in brain regions regulating emotional perception of stimuli, dysfunction of inhibitory control, and increased emotional dysregulation.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114D4UXd]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly concerning differential diagnosis, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend performing a neurological examination in patients presenting with a seizure to identify the cause. Attribute a seizure to alcohol withdrawal only if there has been a recent cessation of or reduction in alcohol consumption. Obtain an EEG and/or neuroimaging in patients experiencing new onset seizures or with a known history of alcohol withdrawal seizures showing a new pattern. Avoid obtaining additional neurological testing and neurology consultation in patients with a known history of withdrawal seizures presenting with a seizure attributable to alcohol withdrawal, including when the seizure was generalized and without focal elements. This should be done if a thorough neurological examination reveals no evidence of focal deficits, and if there is no suspicion of meningitis or other causes.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^117AcVbr]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS) is highly morbid, costly, and common among hospitalized patients, yet minimal evidence exists to guide inpatient management. Research needs in this field are broad, spanning the translational science spectrum. The goals of this research statement are to describe what is known about SAWS, identify knowledge gaps, and offer recommendations for research in each domain of the Institute of Medicine T0-T4 continuum to advance the care of hospitalized patients who experience SAWS.

Clinicians and researchers with unique and complementary expertise in basic, clinical, and implementation research related to unhealthy alcohol consumption and alcohol withdrawal were invited to participate in a workshop at the American Thoracic Society 2019 International Conference. The committee was subdivided into four groups based on interest and expertise:

- **T0-T1**: Basic science research with translation to humans.
- T2✱*: Research translating to patients.
- **T3**: Research translating to clinical practice.
- **T4**: Research translating to communities.

A medical librarian conducted a pragmatic literature search to facilitate this work, and committee members reviewed and supplemented the resulting evidence, identifying key knowledge gaps. The committee identified several investigative opportunities to advance the care of patients with SAWS in each domain of the translational science spectrum. Major themes included:

- **The need to investigate non-γ-aminobutyric acid pathways** for alcohol withdrawal syndrome treatment.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^1171yMkc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The existing systematic reviews did not fully address the a priori research questions. As such, a broad literature search strategy was implemented to identify studies evaluating the pathophysiology, diagnostics, and therapeutics for severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS). This literature search was designed not as a systematic review but as a comprehensive exploration to provide a structure for the committee's subsequent activities.

A research librarian at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus conducted a detailed search for relevant articles on SAWS, published from January 1960 to March 2019 in MEDLINE (Ovid interface), using keywords and Medical Subject Heading terms developed with the committee. Articles were excluded if they were not available in English or if the full text was inaccessible online due to cost and time constraints. Ultimately, 251 records were retrieved. The committee co-chairs reviewed all identified publications and organized them into four translational groups (i.e. T0–T1, T2, T3, and T4) based on content. These initial articles formed the foundation of SAWS literature for the committee to build upon.

In April 2019, committee members were tasked with identifying additional studies of relevance, resulting in 36 more references pertaining to SAWS pathophysiology, rating scales, risk stratification, and health services. Committee members reviewed all references related to their specific section and supplemented these resources as necessary.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113xp9WU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Traditionally, studies of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS) have focused on short-term clinical outcomes, such as the need for intubation, hospital length of stay, and cumulative benzodiazepine exposure. These outcomes are of interest to clinicians, researchers, and hospital administrators but are not necessarily patient-centric unless they are associated with acute discomfort or morbidity.

The ability of short-term clinical outcomes to predict long-term psychological and cognitive effects or functioning should be explored, including their relationship with subsequent alcohol cravings, persistent sobriety, and cognition. Simultaneous collection of data on short-term and long-term outcomes allows for early events, such as delirium, to be evaluated as predictors of later events, like cognitive impairment three months after hospital discharge. If strongly predictive, future investigations could rely on short-term endpoints as proxies for long-term endpoints. This approach could answer important clinical questions that are meaningful to patients in shorter-duration, more cost-effective clinical trials.

- **High-priority short-term outcomes**: Treatment for SAWS includes the time to control of agitation, duration of delirium, and prevention of adverse events, such as the need for mechanical ventilation. During SAWS, the time to control of agitation is believed to be associated with clinically important adverse events, although this relationship needs further elaboration to affirm its significance for treatment trials. In survivors of critical illness, the duration of delirium is associated with short- and long-term mortality, long-term cognition, and function.

### Promising strategies for the prevention of alcohol-related brain damage through optimised management of acute alcohol withdrawal: A focussed literature review [^116LCPDs]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Low credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal syndromes (AWS) result when the balance between γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptor adaptation through escalating ethanol use leads to unopposed upregulated glutamate activity. This causes hyperexcitability across various central and peripheral physiological systems, leading to a wide range of clinically observed symptoms. AWS may present with autonomic dysregulation, confusion, motor disturbances, and complex behavioral and psychological alterations. These symptoms can vary in severity from mild agitation or tachycardia to complete disorientation, tremulousness, hypertensive crisis, delirium, and seizures. Individuals with significant physical dependence on alcohol are more likely to experience severe AWS.

Beyond factors such as co-morbidity with a mental health diagnosis and various psychosocial characteristics associated with relapse and continued consumption, such as availability, consumption may also be driven by a need to avoid, and fear of, AWS rather than the desire to experience pleasure associated with consumption. Furthermore, individuals who experience repeated episodes of AWS are more likely to undergo more severe AWS episodes and have worse long-term outcomes.

Guidance on the management of AWS recommends a holistic assessment by a healthcare professional trained in assessing and managing alcohol-related conditions, along with high-dose thiamine provision for the prevention and management of Wernicke's encephalopathy.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^11134BoJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is common among hospitalized patients and can be fatal without appropriate pharmacologic management. Nevertheless, high-quality evidence to guide treatment decisions for inpatient AWS is lacking. Studies examining treatments for inpatient AWS are limited by small sample sizes and often exclude patients with serious medical and/or surgical comorbidities, although such conditions frequently coexist with AWS in acute care, and especially critical care settings.

AWS is a continuum of neurophysiologic signs and symptoms, influenced by the severity of underlying alcohol use disorder (AUD) and other medical conditions that can alter brain signaling pathways. AWS has been associated with increased ICU and hospital lengths of stay, hospital-acquired infections, the risk of sepsis, and in-hospital mortality.

- **Syndrome lacking clear definitions**: Severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS) is regularly encountered and managed by ICU providers but has been inconsistently defined. Most clinicians and researchers would agree that SAWS is a progressive manifestation of alcohol withdrawal that often requires admission to intensive care settings for close monitoring and frequent administration of medications to address hyperautonomia (including but not limited to pyrexia, tachycardia, and/or hypertension), agitation, and/or delirium. These clinical features represent the hallmarks of SAWS, also called alcohol withdrawal delirium, delirium tremens, and "DTs" in the literature.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^117613y8]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically with respect to risk assessment, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend assessing the following factors associated with an increased risk of complicated withdrawal or complications of withdrawal:

- **History of alcohol withdrawal delirium or alcohol withdrawal seizure**: A history of these conditions can indicate a higher risk for complicated withdrawal in future episodes.

- **Numerous prior withdrawal episodes in the patient's lifetime**: The frequency of past withdrawal episodes is a critical factor in evaluating risk.

- **Comorbid medical or surgical illness**: Conditions such as traumatic brain injury can exacerbate withdrawal symptoms.

- **Advanced age**: Patients over 65 years old may have an increased risk due to physiological changes.

- **Long duration of heavy and regular alcohol consumption**: Chronically high alcohol intake tends to elevate withdrawal risk.

- **Seizures during the withdrawal episode**: The presence of seizures can complicate the withdrawal process.

- **Marked autonomic hyperactivity on presentation**: Signs of significant autonomic disturbance may indicate more severe withdrawal.

- **Physiological dependence on GABAergic agents**: Dependence on agents like benzodiazepines or barbiturates can complicate withdrawal management.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^116Y7qnv]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The ASAM 2020 guidelines provide recommendations for the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly concerning indications for pharmacotherapy in outpatient settings.

For patients with mild alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score < 10) who are at minimal risk of severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal, the guidelines recommend considering either initiating pharmacotherapy or offering supportive care alone. Pharmacotherapy options include administering carbamazepine or gabapentin.

For patients at risk of developing new or worsening withdrawal while away from the treatment setting, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin should be administered.

### Clinical management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^117SVsCL]. Addiction (2022). High credibility.

Up to half of individuals with a history of long-term, heavy alcohol consumption will experience the alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) when consumption is significantly decreased or stopped. In its most severe form, AWS can be life-threatening. Medically assisted withdrawal (MAW) often forms the first part of a treatment pathway. This clinical review discusses key elements of the clinical management of MAW, necessary adjustments for pregnancy and older adults, likely outcomes of an episode of MAW, factors that might prevent completion of the MAW process, and ways of overcoming barriers to ongoing treatment of alcohol use disorder.

The review also discusses the use of benzodiazepines in MAW. Although there is clear evidence for their use, benzodiazepines have been associated with abuse liability, blunting of cognition, interactions with depressant drugs, craving, delirium, dementia, and disrupted sleep patterns. Because glutamatergic activation and glutamate receptor upregulation contribute to alcohol withdrawal, anti-glutamatergic strategies for MAW and other potential treatment innovations are also considered.

- **Tailor preclinical models to the patient experience**: The second major recommendation is to refine preclinical animal models to recapitulate the full symptomatology of patients with severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS) by using stratification by sex to understand the contexts in which sex differences matter most. The search for reliable methods to produce blood alcohol concentrations that are sufficient to mimic intoxication and relevant comorbidities observed in alcohol use disorder (AUD) and SAWS has been challenging.

	- One potentially valuable method is the chronic intermittent alcohol vapor procedure, an exposure protocol that can be paired with complementary investigative measures, including volitional alcohol self-administration, somatic withdrawal, autonomic system potentiation, traumatic brain injury and neuroinflammation, and cognitive deficits. In the future, such exposure paradigms could be used to model comorbid conditions (e.g. sepsis, trauma, organ failure) and important clinical outcomes (e.g. long-term cognitive function) in the setting of SAWS.

	- Although the vapor model may not completely recapitulate all organ-specific alterations accompanying oral alcohol intake (e.g. gastrointestinal effects), it allows for cyclic periods of intoxication interspersed with various lengths of forced abstinence. As such, it can experimentally recreate human drinking patterns that increase SAWS susceptibility. Automated vapor exposures are also relatively straightforward to sustain over a period of weeks or months and may therefore support investigations to inform the timing and efficacy of prophylactic interventions for SAWS.
