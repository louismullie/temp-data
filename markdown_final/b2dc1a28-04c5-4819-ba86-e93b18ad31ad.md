## Question

should statin be discontinued if mildly elevated liver enzymes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether statins should be discontinued when liver enzymes are only mildly elevated, and how to manage that scenario. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "mildly elevated" liver enzymes in a way that aligns with guidelines. Then, I should verify the evidence on statin hepatotoxicity risk at these levels. Next, I will review what major guidelines (AHA/ACC, AASLD, VA/DoD, Endocrine Society) recommend regarding continuation versus discontinuation. After that, I need to check for exceptions such as decompensated cirrhosis or cholestatic injury patterns. Finally, I will outline a practical monitoring and action plan, including when to stop, when to reduce dose, and when to investigate alternative causes of liver enzyme elevation.

> Let me first confirm the definition of "mildly elevated" liver enzymes in this context. Mild elevation typically means AST or ALT above the upper limit of normal but less than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN), whereas ALT or AST greater than 3× ULN is the threshold that warrants action or closer evaluation in statin-treated patients, especially if persistent or accompanied by symptoms or hyperbilirubinemia [^113fCbNs] [^115HfXj2] [^112LWdqB].

> Wait, let me verify the risk signal for statin hepatotoxicity at these mild levels. Large randomized trials and meta-analyses show that persistent ALT/AST elevations greater than 3× ULN occur in roughly 0.5–1% of statin-treated patients, and that mild, transient transaminase elevations are more common but rarely progress to clinically significant liver injury; importantly, patients with baseline mild transaminase elevations do not have a higher risk of statin hepatotoxicity than those with normal baselines, and many mild elevations resolve spontaneously or with dose adjustment rather than requiring discontinuation [^1176of7Z] [^1141HZDQ] [^112LWdqB] [^1136c3F8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should confirm what the guidelines say about continuation in this exact scenario. The AHA/ACC multisociety guideline advises that statins are not contraindicated in patients with chronic, stable liver disease, including NAFLD, and that routine on-treatment liver enzyme monitoring is not recommended; instead, obtain baseline enzymes and recheck only if symptoms suggest hepatotoxicity, which supports continuing statins in the setting of mild, asymptomatic transaminase elevations [^113fCbNs] [^112c5Q38]. The AASLD similarly recommends baseline liver chemistries before starting statins but no routine on-treatment monitoring, and explicitly supports statin use in compensated chronic liver disease, again arguing against discontinuation for mild enzyme elevations [^112ePokM] [^113hH75J]. The VA/DoD guideline notes that while baseline LFTs are reasonable, routine follow-up monitoring is not required, aligning with continuation in mild, asymptomatic cases [^117TPCeq]. The Endocrine Society states statins are safe to initiate and continue in patients with transaminases up to 3× ULN, including those with NAFLD, reinforcing that mild elevations are not a reason to stop therapy [^115HfXj2].

> I should double-check the NAFLD/NASH angle because mild ALT/AST elevations are common there. Multiple liver society guidelines conclude that patients with NAFLD/NASH are not at increased risk of serious statin-induced liver injury, and that statins should be used for cardiovascular risk reduction in this population; in fact, some observational data suggest potential liver benefits, though causality remains uncertain pending randomized trials with histologic endpoints [^1158iStU] [^116opauW] [^112Symxu].

> But wait, what if the enzyme pattern or clinical context changes? I need to ensure we distinguish hepatocellular from cholestatic injury and look for red flags. If ALT/AST rise above 3× ULN on two occasions, or if there is a concurrent increase in bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, or symptoms such as jaundice, fatigue, or abdominal pain, then I should pause the statin, evaluate for alternative etiologies, and follow label guidance to interrupt therapy if serious liver injury is suspected; conversely, isolated mild transaminase elevations without these features should not trigger automatic discontinuation [^113fCbNs] [^1136c3F8] [^112eit57]. I should also remember that decompensated cirrhosis or acute liver failure are settings where statins are generally avoided or individualized with great caution, which is a different risk calculus than mild, stable enzyme elevations [^112ePokM] [^112tSgbE].

> Let me think about a practical management plan I can stand behind. If the patient has mild, asymptomatic ALT/AST elevations less than 3× ULN on a statin, I should continue the statin, confirm baseline liver tests were obtained, and avoid routine monitoring unless symptoms arise; if enzymes drift upward toward 3× ULN, I can consider reducing the dose or switching to a different statin and rechecking in 4–12 weeks, recognizing that many elevations are transient and dose-related; if ALT/AST exceed 3× ULN on repeat testing or if cholestasis or symptoms appear, I should hold the statin, evaluate for other causes (alcohol, viral hepatitis, supplements/medications, NAFLD progression, hemochromatosis, etc.), and only consider rechallenge after resolution and exclusion of serious liver disease; throughout, I should prioritize cardiovascular risk reduction because the net clinical benefit of statins generally outweighs the very low risk of significant hepatotoxicity [^113fCbNs] [^115HfXj2] [^114RoPh6] [^112eit57].

> Hmm, wait a minute — earlier I almost implied that any elevation beyond baseline mandates stopping; that would be too aggressive. I should correct that: only persistent elevations greater than 3× ULN, or those accompanied by hyperbilirubinemia, cholestatic pattern, or symptoms, warrant interruption; mild, asymptomatic elevations should prompt observation and, if needed, dose adjustment rather than reflex discontinuation, given the high cardiovascular cost of unnecessary statin cessation [^113fCbNs] [^111Yh8sk].

> Bottom line, after verifying definitions, risk data, and guidelines, I should not discontinue a statin solely for mildly elevated liver enzymes in an asymptomatic patient; continue the statin, avoid routine monitoring, and act only if thresholds or clinical features of significant liver injury emerge, while investigating alternative causes when appropriate [^113fCbNs] [^112ePokM] [^115HfXj2].

In general, **statins should not be discontinued** for mildly elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST < 3× ULN) in asymptomatic patients, as this is common, usually transient, and rarely indicates clinically significant liver injury [^112QSXWb] [^111Yh8sk]. Current guidelines recommend **continuing statins** and checking liver enzymes only if symptoms of hepatotoxicity occur [^112c5Q38] [^112ePokM]. Discontinuation is warranted only if ALT/AST rise to > 3× ULN on two occasions, or if symptoms such as jaundice or fatigue develop [^111Yh8sk] [^1136c3F8]. Statins are safe in chronic liver disease, including NAFLD, and may even improve liver enzymes and reduce cardiovascular risk [^1158iStU] [^111cGJzi] [^111e2Z7t].

---

## Frequency and clinical significance of mildly elevated liver enzymes

- **Frequency**: Mild ALT/AST elevations occur in 0.5–2% of statin users, typically within 3 months of initiation and often resolve spontaneously or with continued therapy [^117VDSBK] [^112LWdqB].

- **Clinical significance**: Mild elevations are usually transient, asymptomatic, and not associated with clinically significant liver injury or failure [^1176of7Z] [^112LWdqB].

- **Persistent elevations**: Persistent ALT/AST > 3× ULN occurs in ~0.5–1% of patients and is dose-related; severe hepatotoxicity is rare (~1 in 100,000) [^115HfXj2] [^1136c3F8].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from major cardiovascular and hepatology societies provide **clear recommendations** on managing mildly elevated liver enzymes in patients receiving statin therapy:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) | - Do not discontinue statins for mild asymptomatic elevations (< 3× ULN) [^notfound] <br/> - Continue statins and monitor only if symptoms of hepatotoxicity occur [^112c5Q38] |
| American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) | - Statins are safe in chronic liver disease, including NAFLD <br/> - Do not discontinue for mild elevations; monitor only if clinically indicated [^112ePokM] [^111cGJzi] |
| Endocrine Society | - Statins are safe in patients with mild transaminase elevations (< 3× ULN) <br/> - Discontinue only if ALT/AST > 3× ULN on two occasions or if symptoms develop [^111Yh8sk] |

---

## Risks associated with discontinuation of statins

Discontinuing statins solely due to mildly elevated liver enzymes can have **significant clinical consequences**:

- **Increased cardiovascular risk**: Statin discontinuation increases cardiovascular event risk, including myocardial infarction and stroke [^113FSL2h].

- **Loss of cardiovascular benefit**: Statins reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; stopping negates these benefits [^113FSL2h].

- **Unnecessary interventions**: Discontinuation can lead to alternative therapies with less favorable risk-benefit profiles [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting statin discontinuation

While mild elevations alone do not warrant discontinuation, **specific scenarios require action**:

- **ALT/AST > 3× ULN**: On two separate occasions, measured 4–12 weeks apart [^112LWdqB] [^1136c3F8].

- **Symptomatic hepatotoxicity**: Jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, or dark urine [^112c5Q38] [^112LWdqB].

- **Active liver disease**: Acute hepatitis, decompensated cirrhosis, or acute liver failure [^1126YTbT] [^112LWdqB].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

When mildly elevated liver enzymes are detected, **the following strategies are recommended**:

- **Confirm elevation**: Repeat liver enzymes after 4–12 weeks to confirm persistence [^notfound].

- **Evaluate other causes**: Assess for alcohol use, viral hepatitis, NAFLD, and other medications [^112eit57].

- **Continue statin therapy**: Unless ALT/AST > 3× ULN or symptoms occur [^111Yh8sk].

- **Monitor clinically**: Recheck liver enzymes only if symptoms of hepatotoxicity develop [^112c5Q38].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Several studies support the **safety of statins** in patients with mildly elevated liver enzymes:

- **GREACE study**: Statin therapy improved liver enzymes and reduced cardiovascular events in patients with abnormal liver function tests [^111e2Z7t].

- **PITCH study**: Pitavastatin and atorvastatin safely reduced LDL and improved liver enzymes in patients with mild hepatic impairment [^115SzGUG].

- **Meta-analysis**: Statins are safe in chronic liver disease, including NAFLD, with no significant increase in severe hepatotoxicity [^1158iStU].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Statins should not be discontinued for mildly elevated liver enzymes (**ALT/AST < 3× ULN**) in asymptomatic patients. These elevations are common, usually transient, and rarely indicate significant liver injury [^1176of7Z]. Continue statins and monitor only if **symptoms of hepatotoxicity** occur; discontinue only if **ALT/AST > 3× ULN on two occasions** or if symptoms develop [^112c5Q38]. Statins are safe in chronic liver disease, including NAFLD, and may improve liver enzymes and reduce cardiovascular risk [^111cGJzi].

Background & Aims

Studies that evaluate the risk of hepatotoxicity from statins in hyperlipidemic subjects with elevated baseline serum transaminases are lacking. We conducted a study to test the hypothesis that patients with elevated baseline liver enzymes have higher risk of statin hepatotoxicity.

Methods

Our study consisted of the following 3 cohorts of patients seen between January 1, 1998 and June 31, 2002: Cohort 1: 342 hyperlipidemic patients with elevated baseline enzymes (AST > 40 IU/L or ALT > 35 IU/L) who were prescribed a statin; cohort 2: 1437 hyperlipidemic patients with normal transaminases who were prescribed a statin; and cohort 3: 2245 patients with elevated liver enzymes but who were not prescribed a statin. The effect of statins on liver biochemistries was assessed over a 6-month period after statins were prescribed. Elevations in liver biochemistries during follow-up were categorized into mild-moderate or severe based on predefined criteria.

Results

The incidence of mild-moderate elevations and severe elevations in liver biochemistries in cohort 1 were 4.7% and 0.6%, respectively. Compared with cohort 1, individuals in cohort 2 had lower incidence of mild-moderate elevations (1.9%, P = 0.002) but not severe elevations (0.2%, P = 0.2). However, between cohorts 1 and 3, there were no differences in the incidence of mild-moderate elevations (4.7% vs. 6.4%, respectively, P = 0.2) or severe elevations (0.6% vs. 0.4%, respectively, P = 0.6). Statin discontinuation during the follow-up was similar between cohorts 1 and 2 (11.1% vs. 10.7%, respectively, P = 0.8).

Conclusions

These data suggest that individuals with elevated baseline liver enzymes do not have higher risk for hepatotoxicity from statins.

### Lovastatin [^1111mmwa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with Lovastatin and repeated as clinically indicated.

There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including lovastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with Lovastatin, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found do not restart Lovastatin.

The drug should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of lovastatin.

Moderate (less than three times the upper limit of normal) elevations of serum transaminases have been reported following therapy with lovastatin (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). These changes appeared soon after initiation of therapy with lovastatin, were often transient, were not accompanied by any symptoms and interruption of treatment was not required.

Monitoring liver enzyme elevation

Routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes during statin therapy is not supported by current evidence, and is thus not recommended in asymptomatic patients. Indeed, routine periodic monitoring could identify patients with isolated increased ALT, AST, or GGT levels, and prompt physicians to reduce or discontinue statin therapy, thereby placing patients at increased risk for CVD events. It is, however, reasonable to measure hepatic function if symptoms suggestive of hepatotoxicity arise (e.g. unusual fatigue or weakness, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, dark-coloured urine, or yellowing of the skin or sclera). If the patient develops ALT levels > 3× ULN (or lower when combined with a new increase in bilirubin levels), the statin should be discontinued. Other potential aetiologies should be considered before assuming that the elevated liver enzymes are due to the statin.

Take home messages

Mild ALT elevation in isolation in asymptomatic statin users is not clinically relevant. In patients with mild ALT elevation due to steatosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, statin therapy does not worsen liver disease.
Clinically apparent liver injury with statin therapy is very rare and likely to be a class effect of statins.
Routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes is not justified.
Liver enzymes should be measured in the rare patient who develops symptoms suggestive of hepatotoxicity.

### An assessment by the statin liver safety task force: 2014 update [^115GVUte]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

In the 2006 Report of the National Lipid Association's Statin Safety Task Force, a panel of experts in hepatology published their findings on specific questions related to the liver blood testing during statin therapy. Among their recommendations was that regulatory agencies reconsider the statin-labeling recommendation at that time, which required post-statin liver enzyme testing. Since then, the Food and Drug Administration altered statin labeling such that unless clinically indicated for other reasons, after a pre-statin therapy baseline evaluation, follow-up liver enzyme testing was not uniformly required after statin initiation. This 2014 report provides an update on interim issues relevant to statins and liver safety. Some of the points discussed include the value of baseline liver enzymes before initiating statin therapy, safety of statin use in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, potential drug interactions between statins and drugs used to treat hepatitis, the use of statins in liver transplant recipients, and the use of statins in patients with autoimmune liver disease. Finally, this panel provides diagnostic and algorithmic approaches when evaluating statin-treated patients who experience elevations in liver enzymes.

Why Physicians Mistakenly Discontinue Statins

Reasons why physicians inappropriately discontinue or limit the dose of statins include commonly held myths about statin adverse effects including hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, cognitive decline, cataracts, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). In some cases, this may be driven by concern about litigation, when guidelines specify, for example, monitoring of liver function.

Although rare cases of true hepatotoxicity may exist, 1 statins probably do not cause hepatotoxicity, as stated in the 2013 International Atherosclerosis Society guideline. 18 Fluctuations in blood levels of transaminase enzymes that are often blamed on statins ("transaminitis") are more likely to be caused by fatty liver or by release of enzymes from muscle in patients with statin myopathy. 19, 20 In the Heart Protection Study, in which > 20 000 high‐risk patients were randomized to simvastatin 40 mg versus placebo and were followed for 5 years, hepatotoxicity was undetectable. 21 Athyros et al 22 compared patients with and without abnormal liver function tests in the Greek Atorvastatin and Coronary Heart Disease Evaluation (GREACE) study. They found that liver function tests actually improved among patients given statins, whereas they worsened in patients not given statins. Further, the cardiovascular benefit of statins was greater among patients with abnormal liver function tests than among patients with normal liver function tests at baseline. Their conclusion 22 was that "Statin treatment is safe and can improve liver tests and reduce cardiovascular morbidity in patients with mild‐to‐moderately abnormal liver tests that are potentially attributable to non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease". Guidelines regarding monitoring of liver function in patients taking statins should be revised accordingly.

### The liver and lovastatin [^117DgUkh]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

The cholesterol-lowering agents, known as statins, have been in use for 15 years and are among the most commonly prescribed drugs. Animal studies and premarketing clinical trials have given signals of hepatotoxicity, primarily minor elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase enzyme (ALT) levels. For that reason, all of the cholesterol-lowering drugs have labeling that requires monitoring of liver enzymes. Postmarketing experience, however, suggests that hepatotoxicity is rare and thus it is timely to revisit the issue. The first of the statins, lovastatin, was approved in 1986 and has acquired 24 million patient-years of clinical experience. Minor elevations in liver enzymes, i.e. ALT 3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) occur in 2.6% and 5.0% of patients on lovastatin doses of 20 and 80 mg/day, respectively. These elevations are reversible with continuing therapy, are dose related, and are probably related to cholesterol lowering per se. Rare cases of acute liver failure (ALF) have been reported with all of the cholesterol-lowering drugs. With lovastatin, the rate is approximately 1/1.14 million patient-treatment years, which is 9% of the background rate of all causes of ALF and approximately equal to the background rate of idiopathic ALF. Monitoring for hepatotoxicity has not been effective in preventing serious liver disease, largely because of its rarity and the poor predictive value of minor ALT elevations. In fact, it may increase patient risk because of needless discontinuation of cholesterol-lowering therapy for false-positive results in patients who are benefiting from treatment.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^114r5oB3]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Monitoring of lipid levels.

There is no consensus on the best approach to monitor lipid profiles in patients before and during treatment. Generally, lipids should be assessed at least twice before starting drug therapy, and then repeated 8–12 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment (Table 3). For individuals being treated for secondary prevention of ASCVD or higher risk primary prevention with LDL-C below treatment intensification thresholds, monitoring annually is reasonable. For low-risk primary ASCVD prevention individuals with LDL-C levels below treatment intensification thresholds, less frequent monitoring (ie, every 5 years) may be appropriate.

Table 3.
Laboratory assessment of patients with dyslipidemias

For biochemical monitoring for adverse effects of statins, we advocate that ALT and creatine kinase (CK) should be measured before starting treatment to obtain a baseline as a point of reference should future concerns arise; however, routine monitoring is generally unnecessary. Several studies have concluded that the rates of statin-induced elevations of aminotransferase levels are rare and may not be significantly different than in the general population. Statins are not contraindicated in individuals with mild baseline elevation in transaminases (< 3× upper limit of normal [ULN]) or in those with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and these individuals do not seem to be at increased risk for statin hepatotoxicity. Statins are, however, contraindicated in those with decompensated cirrhosis or acute liver failure. For those individuals with transaminase elevations > 3× ULN, using a lower starting dose of statin and monitoring transaminases at 4- to 12-week intervals during cautious up-titration may be reasonable. A clinical approach to the patient with statin intolerance is discussed later.

If baseline CK is > 5 times ULN, some would advise refraining from statin initiation and considering alternative therapy because CK may rise even higher when a statin is introduced. However, if a patient has no risk factors for myopathy, CK does not need to be routinely monitored. A clinical approach to the patient with statin intolerance is discussed in more detail later.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^112ePokM]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Statin use and monitoring in liver disease are delineated with specific recommendations. "Predosing liver biochemistries are recommended for all patients initiating statin therapy. However, routine on-treatment monitoring of liver biochemistries is not recommended because of the low risk of hepatotoxicity, including patients with liver disease". Furthermore, "Patients with known compensated chronic liver disease and cirrhosis can and should receive statins as clinically indicated", while in decompensated cirrhosis, "use of statins… should be individualized based on assessment of risk versus benefit".

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115HfXj2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Hepatic adverse events with statins: Statins cause asymptomatic, dose-related transaminase elevations greater than 3 times ULN (ALT greater than AST) in up to 1% of patients in clinical trials, but severe liver disease usually does not develop; statins are safe in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease including with modest elevations (< 3 times ULN), and statins may be safely initiated when needed in individuals with transaminase elevations up to 3 times ULN; severe liver injury is extremely rare, estimated at about 1 in 100 000 patients and not detectable in clinical trials, and monitoring of ALT and AST does not prevent severe liver disease.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^111h8Frx]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for drug-induced liver injury, more specifically with respect to indications for monitoring, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that patients with known compensated chronic liver disease and cirrhosis can and should receive statins as clinically indicated. Individualize the use of statins in patients with decompensated cirrhosis based on the assessment of risk versus benefit.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^1126YTbT]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Statins — monitoring and cirrhosis use: We do not recommend checking liver biochemistries in patients receiving statins unless there are new or unexplained symptoms of hepatitis, consistent with FDA label changes that baseline liver biochemistries be obtained but that on-treatment liver biochemistry monitoring is not required unless clinically indicated; in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, statins should be avoided due to hepatic metabolism, though low doses can be considered on an individual basis after assessing overall risk versus benefit.

### Considerations for safe use of statins: liver enzyme abnormalities and muscle toxicity [^112QSXWb]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Statins play an important role in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease and have a good safety record in clinical practice. The risk of hepatic injury caused by statins is estimated to be about 1 percent, similar to that of patients taking a placebo. Patients with transaminase levels no more than three times the upper limit of normal can continue taking statins; often the elevations will resolve spontaneously. Coexisting elevations of transaminase levels from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and stable hepatitis B and C viral infections are not contra- indications to statin use. Although myalgias are common with statin use, myositis and rhabdomyolysis are rare. When prescribed at one-half the recommended maximal dosage or less, statins are associated with an incidence of myopathy similar to that of placebo; therefore, rou- tine monitoring of creatine kinase levels in asymptomatic patients is not recommended. Myopathic symptoms usually resolve approximately two months after discontinuing the statin, and the same statin can be restarted at a lower dosage, or patients can try a different statin. Clinically important drugs that interact with statins and increase the risk of adverse effects include fibrates, diltiazem, verapamil, and amiodarone.

Elevation in liver enzymes

Mild elevation in liver transaminases occurs in 0.5–2.0% of patients on any statin, usually within 3 months of initiation of therapy. This may not differ significantly from placebo, and in isolation, is unlikely to be clinically relevant. A systematic meta-analysis of 135 RCTs involving more than 246 000 patients reported that statins as a class produced ∼50% higher risk of transaminase elevation compared with control or placebo. There was a clear dose–response relationship for atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin. These elevations were transient, and usually normalized with continuing therapy. Clinically relevant ALT elevations are rare. An analysis of 49 trials involving more than 14 000 patients, reported persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases [> 3× upper limit of normal (ULN)] in 0.1%, 0.6%, and 0.2% of patients on atorvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, and placebo (Table 4).

Table 4
Summary of evidence for possible adverse effects of statin treatment on hepatic function

In patients with mild ALT elevation due to steatosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, statin therapy does not result in worsening of liver disease, although caution may be needed in patients with pre-existing primary biliary cirrhosis. Moreover, the cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy are likely to outweigh any potential safety issues, as highlighted by the Joint Task Force guidelines. Indeed, an updated meta-analysis in more than 120 000 patients with chronic liver disease showed that statin use was associated with a lower risk of hepatic decompensation and mortality, and possibly reduced portal hypertension. Statins should not be prescribed, however, in patients with active hepatitis B virus infection until serum levels of AST, ALT, GGT, total bilirubin, and ALP have normalized.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for drug-induced liver injury, more specifically with respect to indications for monitoring, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend to assess predosing liver biochemistries in all patients initiating statin therapy, but do not obtain routine on-treatment monitoring of liver biochemistries because of the low risk of hepatotoxicity, including patients with liver disease.

### Is there value in liver function test and creatine phosphokinase monitoring with statin use? [^114L6dya]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Statins have transformed the care of patients with vascular disease. Patients in almost every category that has been studied have benefited substantially. On the other hand, although the incidence of side effects is remarkably low, statins, like any other therapy, are not entirely free of serious risks. From the outset, based on the mechanism of action of statins, hepatotoxicity has been a concern. Moreover, although the mechanisms remain obscure, significant skeletal muscle injury, which can lead to renal failure and death, unquestionably does occur. To mitigate these risks, screening and monitoring programs for hepatic and skeletal muscle injury were put in place when statins were introduced into clinical practice. This article reviews the benefits and the costs of these efforts. Although the benefits have not been shown, the costs are real and substantial. These include the harm caused by inappropriate withdrawal of therapy, which has been shown to be life-saving, as well as the considerable financial expenditure. The conclusion that follows, based on the evidence in hand, is that although these programs were appropriate at the time statins were introduced, they are not appropriate now.

### Editorial: statins and liver disease: is it time to recommend statins to prevent liver disease progression? [^112Symxu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence is emerging that statins may reduce liver-related adverse outcomes in individuals with chronic liver disease. In this issue of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, Kamal et al. found in their meta-analysis that statin use was associated with a reduced risk of fibrosis progression, decompensated cirrhosis, and mortality. These encouraging findings suggest beneficial liver effects of statins. However, the overall quality of the evidence is low because 9 of the 10 studies included in the meta-analysis were observational. More robust studies, including randomized trials and research on safety in patients with advanced liver disease, are needed before statins can be routinely recommended for prevention of liver-related morbidity and mortality.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Monitoring for statin-associated side effects — CK and liver enzymes: "it is recommended that CK be measured in the case of severe SAMS and in the presence of objective muscle weakness", and "the FDA recommends measuring transaminases… if there are signs or symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity". An "asymptomatic increase in transaminases (> 3 times upper limit of normal) is an infrequent statin-associated side effect" that often resolves with dose adjustment, while "Severe statin-associated hepatotoxicity is rare, and the incidence is not impacted by routine monitoring of transaminases", and evaluation for nonstatin causes "is warranted" if elevations persist. "Statins are not contraindicated in patients with increased ASCVD risk with chronic, stable liver disease", and, overall, "CK and transaminase levels should not be routinely measured".

5.3 Liver Enzymes

In three placebo-controlled, 12-week trials, the incidence of consecutive elevations (≥ 3 X ULN) in serum transaminases was 1.7% overall for patients treated with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet and appeared to be dose-related with an incidence of 2.6% for patients treated with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet 10/80. In controlled long-term (48-week) extensions, which included both newly-treated and previously-treated patients, the incidence of consecutive elevations (≥ 3 X ULN) in serum transaminases was 1.8% overall and 3.6% for patients treated with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet 10/80. These elevations in transaminases were generally asymptomatic, not associated with cholestasis, and returned to baseline after discontinuation of therapy or with continued treatment.

In SHARP, 9270 patients with chronic kidney disease were allocated to receive ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet 10/20 mg daily (n = 4650), or placebo (n = 4620). During a median follow-up period of 4.9 years, the incidence of consecutive elevations of transaminases (> 3 X ULN) was 0.7% for ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet and 0.6% for placebo.

It is recommended that liver function tests be performed before the initiation of treatment with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet, and thereafter when clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including simvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found do not restart ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet. Note that ALT may emanate from muscle, therefore ALT rising with CK may indicate myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet.

5.4 Endocrine Function

Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including simvastatin.

### Who should receive a statin these days? Lessons from recent clinical trials [^116QSDBx]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or statins are the most successful cardiovascular drugs of all time. By interrupting cholesterol synthesis in the liver, they activate hepatocyte low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and produce consistent and predictable reductions in circulating LDL cholesterol with resulting reproducible improvements in cardiovascular risk by retarding or even regressing the march of atherosclerosis in all major arterial trees (coronary, cerebral and peripheral). Clinical trials have demonstrated their capacity not only to extend life, but also to improve its quality by retarding the progression of diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease and by enhancing central and peripheral blood flow. They are amongst the most extensively investigated pharmaceutical agents in current clinical use. In cardiovascular end-point trials they have proven ability to help prevent that first and all important myocardial infarction and to reduce the likelihood of a recurrence in those who do succumb. They are equally effective in men and women of all ages and at all levels of cardiovascular risk, whether caused by hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus or the metabolic syndrome. In addition, they improve the outlook of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia whose LDL receptor function is deficient or defective; and all of this comes at minimal risk to the recipient. Their most important potential side effect is myopathy, which on very rare occasions may lead to rhabdomyolysis. Clinical experience shows that myopathic symptoms with creatine kinase levels raised to more than 10 times the upper limit of normal is seen in < 0.01% of recipients and progression to fatal rhabdomyolysis because of renal failure has been recorded in only 0.15 cases per million prescriptions. Liver function abnormalities are also, rarely, seen. Again, the frequency of raised aspartate or alanine aminotransferase to more than three times the normal limit is encountered in no more than 1–2% of all treated patients and is completely reversible upon withdrawal of treatment. Progression to hepatitis or liver failure does not occur. This constellation of benefits with little side effect penalty has resulted in the comparison of statins with antibiotics in the global battle against cardiovascular disease.

### A prospective study of hepatic safety of statins used in very elderly patients [^117FS89D]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Statins play an important role in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease and have a good safety record in clinical practice. Hepatotoxicity is a barrier that limits the ability of primary care physicians to prescribe statins for patients with elevated liver transaminase values and/or underlying liver disease. However, limited population-based data are available on the use of statin therapy and on the hepatotoxicity of statins in very elderly patients. This prospective study evaluated the liver enzyme elevation during statin therapy in very elderly patients (≥ 80 years old).

Methods

Patients with hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C levels ≥ 3.4 and < 5.7 mmol/L), atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease (CHD), or a CHD-risk equivalent were enrolled and received once-daily statin treatment. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to study the impact of age, gender, hepatitis B infection, fatty liver disease, biliary calculus, other chronic diseases, drug kinds, alcohol abuse, statin variety, and statin dose variables.

Results

A total of 515 consecutive patients ranging from 80 to 98 years old were included in the analysis. These patients were treated with simvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, or atorvastatin. Twenty-four patients (4.7, 95% CI 2.7–6.6) showed an increase in their hepatic aminotransferase levels. No significant difference of hepatic aminotransferase elevation rates was observed in different statin treatment groups. The incidence of mild, moderate, and severe elevation of aminotransferase levels was 62.5% (15/24), 29.2% (7/24), and 8.3% (2/24), respectively. None of the patients developed hepatic failure. Nine patients with moderate or severe aminotransferase elevations discontinued therapy. The time of onset of hepatic aminotransferase elevation ranged from 2 weeks to 6 months after statin treatment. The onset of hepatic aminotransferase elevation was within 1 month for 70.8% of patients. The patients took 2 weeks to 3 months to recover their liver function after statin therapy cessation. Multivariate analysis identified chronic hepatitis B infection and alcohol consumption as independent factors associated with the hepatic response to statins: OR, 12.83; 95% CI (4.36–37.759) and OR, 2.736; 95% CI (1.373–5.454), respectively.

Conclusion

The prevalence of elevated transaminases was higher than published data in very elderly patients. Overall, statin treatment is safe for patients ≥ 80 years old.

### Therapy. statins and liver disease: from concern to' wonder' drugs? [^116udLVk]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Medium credibility.

The benefits of statins go beyond decreasing cholesterol levels; in liver disease, statins reduce the risk of progressive liver fibrosis and provide protection during infections and ischaemia–reperfusion injury. New evidence shows that statins improve response to interferon-based anti-HCV therapy, decrease progression to cirrhosis and likelihood of developing hepatocellular carcinoma.

### The efficacy and safety of statins for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^115NZAix]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is an emerging liver disease in Western countries and the most frequent cause of incidental elevation of serum liver enzymes. Dyslipidaemia is frequently observed in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and treatment of dyslipidaemia plays a critical role in the overall management of these patients. Moreover, coronary artery disease remains the most common cause of death. Statins are effective lipid-lowering agents, associated with a lowering the risk of cardiovascular events in several interventional randomized clinical trials. However, statins are often underused in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and many physicians are concerned about the prescription of statins to patients with unexplained persistent elevation of liver enzymes or active liver disease. Based on currently available data, statin therapy, at low-to-moderate doses, seems to be safe and has low liver toxicity. Treatment of dyslipidaemia in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is recommended and may also improve liver function tests. In these patients, the risks of not taking statins could outweigh the risks of taking the drug. Conversely, the usefulness of statins for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is still a matter of debate and randomized clinical trials of adequate size and duration are required.

### Safety and benefit of discontinuing statin therapy in the setting of advanced, life-limiting illness: a randomized clinical trial [^114h8Jw5]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

The study Stopping statins at the end of life was published by Kutner JS and colleagues in 2015 in the journal JAMA Intern Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Dyslipidemia. In the Stopping statins at the end of life study, the trial question was: what is the role of discontinuation of statin therapy in patients with limited life expectancy? In the Stopping statins at the end of life study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the Stopping statins at the end of life study, the population was: 381 patients (171 female, 210 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with an estimated life expectancy of 1 month to 1 year, statin therapy for ≥ 3 months for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. The key exclusion criteria were active CVD, symptoms of myositis, LFT (AST, ALT, or ALP) or CK levels > 2.5 times the ULN, or other contraindications to continuing statin therapy. In the Stopping statins at the end of life study, the interventions were: n = 189 discontinuation of statins (statin therapy withdrawn) n = 192 continuation of statins (continued to receive statin therapy). In the Stopping statins at the end of life study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in death at 60 days (23.8% vs. 20.3%; RR 1.17, 90% CI -3.5 to 10.5). In the Stopping statins at the end of life study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in total QoL McGill QOL score (7.11 points vs. 6.85 points; AD 0.26 points, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.5) No significant difference in cardiovascular events (6.9 vs. 5.7; RR 1.21, 95% CI -3.67 to 6.09) No significant difference in median time to death (229 days vs. 190 days; MD 39, 95% CI -102.05 to 180.05). In the Stopping statins at the end of life study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with an estimated life expectancy of 1 month to 1 year, statin therapy for ≥ 3 months for primary or secondary prevention of CVD, discontinuation of statins were noninferior to continuation of statins with respect to death at 60 days.

### Safety of high-dose atorvastatin therapy [^111VygWA]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

This article reviews the safety of statins, with emphasis on high-dose atorvastatin (80 mg), the agent with the most efficacy data for clinical outcomes. Although elevated levels of hepatic enzymes were of concern when statins were first introduced, a review of data from large clinical trials shows that elevations in hepatic enzymes are rare and do not lead to clinically significant liver disease. Despite the withdrawal of cerivastatin because of fatal rhabdomyolysis, the risk of this complication with other statins is extremely low. Mild and often transient myalgia is more commonly reported. The safety of high-dose atorvastatin has been evaluated in > 11,000 patients, and rates of clinically significant myopathy and elevated hepatic enzymes were extremely low. Simvastatin at doses up to 40 mg is also associated with low rates of elevated hepatic enzymes and myopathy. However, the 80-mg dose of simvastatin carries a risk of myopathy (muscle symptoms and creatine kinase levels > 10,000 U/L) of approximately 1 in 250. The clinical benefits of preventing vascular events, myocardial infarction, stroke, and need for revascularization outweigh the low rates of adverse events associated with high-dose statin therapy in high- and intermediate-risk patients.

4.2 Drug‐Related Adverse Event

Our analysis suggested that a combination of low/moderate‐intensity statin and ezetimibe carries lower risks of discontinuation due to adverse events and myalgia compared to high‐intensity statin monotherapy. In contrast to our findings, Zhan et al. found no difference in regard to treatment discontinuation due to adverse events by evaluating 10 RCTs. However, their results were mainly based on low‐quality studies, and did not contain more recent publications. Chaiyasothi et al. found no difference in treatment discontinuation due to drug‐related adverse events, but they comprised both moderate and high‐intensity statin in the monotherapy group.

In our study, the risk of elevated liver enzymes was comparable between the two treatment groups. Previous meta‐analyses also demonstrated that there was no significant difference in terms of elevated liver enzymes in both treatment methods. Nevertheless, it's worth noting that these earlier meta‐analyses did not include more recent RCTs with longer treatment durations. It is essential to note that treatment adherence and persistence are crucial for achieving long‐term cardiovascular benefits. The improved tolerability of the combination therapy may lead to better patient compliance and, ultimately, improved clinical outcomes. The comparable risk of elevated liver enzymes between the two treatment groups is also reassuring, as this adverse event is a common concern with statin use.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^113sT2zS]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Statins

There are seven 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methyl‐glutaryl‐coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or "statin" drugs that are used on a daily basis by millions of patients with hyperlipidemia. In general, statins are safe to administer, but myalgias and myopathy may lead to early dose reduction or termination in up to 10% of treated patients. Early on there was concern of self‐limited serum aminotransferase elevations in up to 20% of patient receiving statins, but clinically significant hepatic dysfunction was very uncommon. In the DILIN study, only 22 of 1188 (1.8%) consecutively enrolled patients with DILI were attributed to a statin over an 8‐year period. Both acute cholestatic and hepatocellular injury were observed, as well as fewer patients with autoimmune features. Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated no significant increase in the incidence of persistently elevated serum aminotransferase levels between statin and placebo therapy, including in patients with known chronic liver disease.–In addition, other studies have suggested that statins in patients with compensated chronic liver disease and cirrhosis may even reduce the risk of hepatocellular cancer and decompensation. In 2012, the FDA altered the product labels of available statins so that baseline liver biochemistries be obtained but that on‐treatment liver biochemistry monitoring is not required unless clinically indicated. Therefore, we do not recommend checking liver biochemistries in patients receiving statins unless there are new or unexplained symptoms of hepatitis. However, statins should be avoided in patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to their hepatic metabolism, but low doses can be considered on an individual basis after assessing overall risk versus benefit.

### The value of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in cardiovascular disease risk assessment [^116AtZym]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical implications

Our analysis suggests that the AST/ALT ratio should not be included in current CVD risk prediction tools for the general primary care population. However, in the era of stratified medicine, those with raised AST/ALT ratio may represent a higher risk subgroup that could benefit from closer monitoring, particularly when ALT is raised. Latest UK guidelinesin primary care recommend clinicians to exclude type I diabetic patients in the use of CVD risk assessment tools as the calculated CVD risk may not be reliable, particularly in younger patients. As diabetes is a spectrum of disease which has been simplified as a binary variable in all standard CVD risk tools, a continuous variable such as the AST/ALT ratio may confer additional advantages for further stratification of these higher risk subgroups. Other potential risk factors for liver disease in subgroup populations with high obesity and alcohol usage should also warrant further analysis in which the AST/ALT ratio may confer larger benefits. Emerging evidence (including the findings in this study) showing the utility the AST/ALT ratio in stratifying liver disease and CVD risk in certain subgroups may inform future guideline development as stronger research evidence emerges. Given that the cost of either analyte is relatively cheap, the AST/ALT ratio's utility in predicting future CVD risk in groups such as those with elevated ALT, type II diabetes, and features of metabolic syndrome, alcohol usage or a combination of these factors may be extremely cost-effective. More broadly, the US Preventive Services Task Force, American Heart Association/American College of Cardiologyand the recent Joint British Societiesrecommend now recommend revisiting the value of novel markers in risk prediction tools as more evidence becomes available.

In the context of identifying patients who should not be prescribed statin, the latest NICE lipid modification guidelinesstate that either AST or ALT should be assessed prior to starting statins. The implications of this are that mildly elevated levels will be wrongly seen as a contraindication to the initiation of statins. This study, however, reinforces the concept that liver transaminases, and specifically an elevated AST/ALT ratio, should be seen as identifying those with a greater need for a statin because of increasing CVD risk rather than a contraindication because of the relatively rare occurrence of a statin-induced liver injury.

3.2 Drug‐Related Adverse Events

Discontinuation due to adverse events in both treatment arms was evaluated in 14 studies. The risk of discontinuation due to adverse events was significantly lower in the combination therapy group compared to the monotherapy treatment arm (RR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.51–0.74). The studies showed low heterogeneity (I 2 = 0%, p = 0.61) (Figure 3A). Subgroup analysis based on drug type demonstrated that the observed effect was exclusive to the Rosuvastatin subgroup, whereas no significant differences were observed in others (p = 0.04) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 7B). Interestingly, further subgroup analysis of the included studies demonstrated that the risk of discontinuation due to adverse events was approximately twofold in the monotherapy arm after 12 months of treatment (Supporting Information S1: Figure 7A). Examining other adverse events, the analysis indicated a lower risk of myalgia in the combination therapy group compared to the monotherapy arm (RR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13–0.57) based on the findings of five studies. Conversely, there was no significant difference between the two treatment modalities regarding liver enzyme elevations based on 10 included studies (RR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.37–1.16). No heterogeneity was observed among studies in both parameters (Figure 3B, C). Additionally, no significant publication bias was observed for discontinuation due to adverse events and liver enzyme elevations (Supporting Information S1: Figure 8A, B). Subgroup analyses of the different statins used are presented in Supporting Information S1: Table 5.

Liver enzyme elevation

Twenty-four patients experienced increases in their hepatic aminotransferase levels, and the total rate of persistent elevation in hepatic aminotransferase levels was 4.7% (Tables 2 and 3). For each individual satin, the total rate was: 6.1% (6/98) for simvastatin, 6.9% (8/116) for fluvastatin, 5.0% (4/80) for pravastatin, 1.2% (1/85) for rosuvastatin, and 3.7% (5/136) for atorvastatin (Table 2). The incidence of mild, moderate, and severe aminotransferase elevation was 62.5% (15/24), 29.2% (7/24), and 8.3% (2/24), respectively (Table 3). None of the patients developed hepatic failure. Nine patients with moderate or severe aminotransferase elevations discontinued therapy. The time of onset of hepatic aminotransferase elevation ranged from 2 weeks to 6 months following the initiation of statin treatment (Table 3). The onset of hepatic aminotransferase elevation occurred within 1 month for 70.8% (17/24) of patients (Table 3). Patients required 2 weeks to 3 months to recover from their liver function after cessation of statin therapy (Table 3).

### High-intensity statin reduces the risk of mortality among chronic liver disease patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a population-based cohort study [^116Cq4QB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Lipid‐lowering therapy with statins is a cornerstone for secondary prevention of ASCVD, and substantial evidence suggests higher intensity statins can further lower serum lipid levels. Also, in the PROVE IT‐TIMI 22 or TNT trial, which explored the benefit of statin intensity, high‐intensity statins are more effective at reducing mortality and cardiovascular outcomes compared with moderate‐intensity statins. However, patients with CLD or hepatic dysfunction with elevated liver enzymes were excluded from the study population of the statin landmark trial. Meantime, guidelines recommend using statin in patients with CLD and/or stable liver disease. However, this recommendation is based on post hoc analysis of the trial population, that excluded patients with alcohol and virus‐related CLD. One trial included only patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease with mild elevated liver enzyme, which reported reduced cardiovascular morbidity in statin users (statin user: 3.2 per 100 person‐years versus statin non‐user: 10.0 per 100 person‐years). The other trial showed a protective effect of high‐intensity statin on cardiovascular mortality compared with moderate‐intensity statin (HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.37–0.84]). Yet, because of the characteristic of the baseline liver condition included in the studies, evidence of statin therapy in this high‐risk population still remains unmet needs.

### The safety of statins in clinical practice [^1176of7Z]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Statins are effective cholesterol-lowering drugs that reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease events (heart attacks, strokes, and the need for arterial revascularisation). Adverse effects from some statins on muscle, such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, are rare at standard doses, and on the liver, in increasing levels of transaminases, are unusual. Myopathy — muscle pain or weakness with blood creatine kinase levels more than ten times the upper limit of the normal range — typically occurs in fewer than one in 10,000 patients on standard statin doses. However, this risk varies between statins, and increases with use of higher doses and interacting drugs. Rhabdomyolysis is a rarer and more severe form of myopathy, with myoglobin release into the circulation and risk of renal failure. Stopping statin use reverses these side-effects, usually leading to a full recovery. Asymptomatic increases in concentrations of liver transaminases are recorded with all statins, but are not clearly associated with an increased risk of liver disease. For most people, statins are safe and well-tolerated, and their widespread use has the potential to have a major effect on the global burden of cardiovascular disease.

### Statins and the liver [^111nVVDQ]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Lipid lowering, particularly with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors ("statins"), reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. Patients with chronic liver disease present challenges to the use of lipid medications. In the case of most liver disorders, the concern has been one of safety. There is evidence that most lipid-lowering medications can be used safely in many situations, although large outcomes trials are lacking. This review examines lipid physiology and cardiovascular risk in specific liver diseases and reviews the evidence for lipid lowering and the use of statins in chronic liver disease.

5.2 Liver Enzyme Abnormalities

It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be performed before the initiation of CRESTOR, and if signs or symptoms of liver injury occur.

Increases in serum transaminases [AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT)] have been reported with HMG‑CoA reductase inhibitors, including CRESTOR. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There were two cases of jaundice, for which a relationship to CRESTOR therapy could not be determined, which resolved after discontinuation of therapy. There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials.

In a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials, increases in serum transaminases to > 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 1.1% of patients taking CRESTOR versus 0.5% of patients treated with placebo.

There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including rosuvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with CRESTOR, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart CRESTOR.

CRESTOR should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of chronic liver disease [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Active liver disease, which may include unexplained persistent transaminase elevations, is a contraindication to the use of CRESTOR [see Contraindications (4)].

5.3 Concomitant Coumarin Anticoagulants

Caution should be exercised when anticoagulants are given in conjunction with CRESTOR because of its potentiation of the effect of coumarin-type anticoagulants in prolonging the prothrombin time/INR. In patients taking coumarin anticoagulants and CRESTOR concomitantly, INR should be determined before starting CRESTOR and frequently enough during early therapy to ensure that no significant alteration of INR occurs [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

### Incidence of statin hepatotoxicity in patients with hepatitis C [^112Y9XsY]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Statins are considered contraindicated in patients with chronic liver disease. Our objective was to determine the risk of developing hepatotoxicity from statin therapy in hyperlipidemic patients with hepatitis C.

Methods

Changes in liver biochemistry values within 12 months compared with baseline were determined in 3 cohorts matched for age, sex, and body mass index: (I) 166 anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive hyperlipidemic veterans who were initiated on statin therapy; (II) 332 anti-HCV-positive veterans who had not received statin therapy; and (III) 332 anti-HCV-negative hyperlipidemic veterans who were initiated on statin therapy. An increase in liver biochemistry values was defined as mild-moderate or severe as proposed in a previous study on statin hepatotoxicity in a non-hepatitis C population.

Results

In patients with hepatitis C, statin therapy (cohort I) was associated with a higher incidence of mild-moderate liver biochemistry value increases compared with those not on statin therapy (cohort II) (22.9% vs 13.3%, respectively, P = 0.009), but a lower incidence of severe increases (1.2% vs 6.6%, respectively, P = 0.015). Among patients started on statin therapy (cohorts I and III), the incidence of mild-moderate liver biochemistry value increases (22.9% vs 16.3%, respectively, P = 0.094), severe increases (1.2% vs 1%, respectively, P = 0.874), or discontinuation of statin therapy as a result of hepatotoxicity (21.6% vs 9.2%, respectively, P = 0.147) were similar in hepatitis C-positive and hepatitis C-negative patients.

Conclusions

Statin therapy was not associated with a higher risk of severe hepatotoxicity in patients with chronic hepatitis C and appeared safe.

Discontinue CADUET if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if CADUET is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue CADUET in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the CADUET dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

5.2	Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy

There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persists despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG-CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue CADUET if IMNM is suspected.

5.3	Hepatic Dysfunction

Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of atorvastatin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. Persistent increases to more than three times the ULN in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 0.7% of patients receiving atorvastatin in clinical trials. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin.

Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Consider liver enzyme testing before atorvastatin initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. Atorvastatin is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications (4)]. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue atorvastatin.

5.4	Increased Angina and Myocardial Infarction

Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the dose of amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.

Guidance statements

51 Early detection of DILI is best achieved by educating patients to report untoward symptoms to their providers along with prospective clinical and laboratory monitoring with certain high-risk drugs like the ICIs, isoniazid, and methotrexate.
52 All practitioners are encouraged to voluntarily report instances of suspected DILI to the FDA via the MedWatch system at https://www.fda. gov/safet y/medwatch.
53 Transient elevations of serum liver enzymes can be seen with drugs such as isoniazid that are self-limited despite continued dosing, presumably because of metabolic and immunological adaptation.
54 The FDA and LiverTox websites are a rich resource for information about drug hepatotoxicity and provide informative relevant documents and recommendations for surveillance that may be accessed online, including drug labeling and package inserts.
55 Recommendations for hepatotoxicity monitoring vary in detail, according to the background information available. Often, common sense must be applied and/or experts consulted.
56 Recommended monitoring for isoniazid hepatotoxicity includes patient education to report new symptoms suggestive of hepatitis. Monthly laboratory monitoring has not been shown to reduce the incidence of clinically significant liver injury and can lead to premature discontinuation of therapy in many patients. However, many specialty societies advise baseline and on-treatment laboratory monitoring in high-risk individuals.
57 Annual measurement of liver elastography is recommended as a noninvasive means to monitor the hepatotoxicity of drugs like methotrexate that tend to cause silent fibrosis but is not likely applicable to most other drugs that cause DILI.
58 Predosing liver biochemistries are recommended for all patients initiating statin therapy. However, routine on-treatment monitoring of liver biochemistries is not recommended because of the low risk of hepatotoxicity, including patients with liver disease.
59 Patients with known compensated chronic liver disease and cirrhosis can and should receive statins as clinically indicated. However, use of statins in people with decompensated cirrhosis should be individualized based on assessment of risk versus benefit.
60 Predosing and on-treatment laboratory monitoring is the standard of care for oncology patients receiving ICIs with a series of steps to withhold the drug, increase laboratory monitoring, and use corticosteroids based on the severity of liver injury.

The incidence of all-causality adverse events was similar in all three arms with similar low discontinuation rates. Approximately 24% of patients experienced an adverse event. The majority of events (75.4%) were mild or moderate, and only 4.2% of subjects discontinued due to an adverse event. Peripheral oedema was the only treatment-related adverse event that occurred in > 2% of patients, and this occurred exclusively in those who received amlodipine (6.8% in the monotherapy arm and 10.6% in the combination arm, P = 0.46). There was one case of myalgia reported in each group with no elevation in creatine phosphokinase levels. Transitory elevations in alanine aminotransferase (> 3× upper limit of normal) were observed in 1% of participants (one subject per arm). No hepatic adverse events were reported.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^113FSL2h]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Statin therapy is the cornerstone for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and is generally safe and well tolerated. In randomized, controlled trials (RCTs), adverse event rates (including complaints of muscle pain) are similar in statin and placebo groups, – and compare favourably with event rates for other agents commonly used in CVD prevention, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitorsand beta-blockers. However, statins do cause a rare side-effect known as myositis, defined as muscle symptoms in association with a substantially elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) concentration. Creatine kinase is the enzyme released from damaged muscle cells, and CK elevations > 10× the upper limit of normal (ULN) occur in 1 per 1000 to 1 per 10 000 people per year, depending on the statin, its dose, and the presence of other risk factors. Over the last decade, a series of observational studies have attributed a number of other adverse effects to statins, including musculoskeletal complaints, gastro-intestinal discomfort, fatigue, liver enzyme elevation, peripheral neuropathy, insomnia, and neurocognitive symptoms. In addition, randomized trials have shown a small increase in the risk of incident diabetes. – Muscle symptoms, the most prevalent of these effects, are the focus of this review.

In contrast to RCTs, patient registries, together with clinical experience, indicate that 7–29% of patients complain of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). – These are usually associated with normal or slightly elevated CK concentrations. Statin-associated muscle symptoms likely contribute significantly to the very high discontinuation rates of statin therapy (up to 75%) within 2 years of initiation. Indeed, in 65% of former statin users, the main reason for statin non-adherence or discontinuation was the onset of side effects, predominantly muscle-related effects. Such non-adherence/discontinuation from treatment may have a marked impact on CVD benefit, as suggested by the higher mortality in elderly secondary prevention patients with low vs. high adherence to statin therapy (24% vs. 16%, respectively; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.25; P = 0.001). Similarly, a meta-analysis showed a 15% lower CVD risk in patients who were adherent to statins compared with those with low adherence.

5.3 Liver Dysfunction

Statins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on two or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6%, and 2.3% for 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg, respectively.

One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of atorvastatin.

It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with atorvastatin and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with atorvastatin, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart atorvastatin.

Atorvastatin should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of atorvastatin [see Contraindications (4)].

5.4 Endocrine Function

Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including atorvastatin.

Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal and/or gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

2018 cholesterol clinical practice guidelines — statin safety management: In patients with statin-associated side effects that are not severe, it is recommended to reassess and to rechallenge to achieve a maximal LDL-C lowering by modified dosing regimen, an alternate statin or in combination with nonstatin therapy. In patients with increased diabetes mellitus risk or new-onset diabetes mellitus, it is recommended to continue statin therapy, with added emphasis on adherence, net clinical benefit, and the core principles of regular moderate-intensity physical activity, maintaining a healthy dietary pattern, and sustaining modest weight loss. In patients treated with statins, it is recommended to measure creatine kinase levels in individuals with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms, objective muscle weakness, and to measure liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase) as well as total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (hepatic panel) if there are symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity. In patients at increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk with chronic, stable liver disease (including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) when appropriately indicated, it is reasonable to use statins after obtaining baseline measurements and determining a schedule of monitoring and safety checks. Coenzyme Q10 is not recommended for routine use in patients treated with statins or for the treatment of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), and in patients treated with statins, routine measurements of creatine kinase and transaminase levels are not useful.

### Meta-analysis of drug-induced adverse events associated with intensive-dose statin therapy [^113fkDu5]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized trials evaluating intensive dose statin therapy have found enhanced protection against cardiovascular (CV) events compared with moderate-dose statin therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or stable coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the potential for an increase in the risk of drug-induced adverse events with such therapy has not been quantified.

Objective

This meta-analysis was performed to compare the incremental risks associated with intensive- and moderate-dose statin therapy.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from 1995 to 2006 using the following terms: acute, coronary syndrome, stable coronary artery disease, atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin. Prospective, randomized controlled trials evaluating intensive- and moderate-dose statin therapy for the reduction of CV events were included in the review. The safety end points examined were elevations in creatine kinase (CK) ≥ 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), elevations in alanine or aspartate aminotransferase ≥ 3 times the ULN, rhabdomyolysis, drug-induced adverse events requiring discontinuation of therapy, and any drug-induced events. The efficacy end points examined were all-cause mortality, CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. Each analysis compared the effect of intensive- or moderate-dose statin therapy on statin-induced adverse events and clinical efficacy outcomes. Simple absolute risk, the number needed to treat, and the number needed to harm were also calculated to quantify the incremental benefit or harm associated with intensive-dose statin therapy.

Results

Four trials were included in the analysis. Together, they included 27,548 patients with ACS or stable CAD followed for a mean of 3.4 years, representing 108,049 patient-years of clinical-trial experience. Intensive-dose therapy with atorvastatin or simvastatin 80 mg was associated with a significant increase in the risk for any adverse event (odds ratio [OR] = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.33–1.55; P < 0.001) and adverse events requiring discontinuation of therapy (OR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.18–1.39; P < 0.001). Intensive-dose therapy also was associated with an increased risk for abnormalities on liver function testing (OR = 4.48; 95% Cl, 3.27–6.16; P < 0.001) and elevations in CK (OR = 9.97; 95% CI, 1.28–77.92; P = 0.028). The benefits of intensive-dose statin therapy included reductions in CV death (OR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75–0.99; P = 0.031), MI (OR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76–0.93; P < 0.001), and stroke (OR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.94; P = 0.004).

Conclusions

Although intensive-dose statin therapy was associated with a reduced risk for important CV events, it was also associated with an increased risk for statin-induced adverse events. Therefore, moderate-dose statin therapy may be the most appropriate choice for achieving CV risk reduction in the majority of individuals, whereas intensive-dose statin therapy may be reserved for those at highest risk.

### Safety of statins: focus on clinical pharmacokinetics and drug interactions [^116SgxDu]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Statin monotherapy is generally well tolerated, with a low frequency of adverse events. The most important adverse effects associated with statins are myopathy and an asymptomatic increase in hepatic transaminases, both of which occur infrequently. Because statins are prescribed on a long-term basis, however, possible interactions with other drugs deserve particular attention, as many patients will typically receive pharmacological therapy for concomitant conditions during the course of statin treatment. This review summarizes the pharmacokinetic properties of statins and emphasizes their clinically relevant drug interactions.

### A prospective study of hepatic safety of statins used in very elderly patients [^112bZ82s]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

It is well known that a high blood level of the low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major risk factor that contributes to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Many clinical trials have shown that patients with CVD can benefit from using statins to lower LDL-C levels. Lipid-lowering therapy, specifically statins, has become a cornerstone of treatment for dyslipidemia due to their effects on LDL-C levels. As such, statin therapy is endorsed by various guidelines as the first-line pharmacotherapeutic approach for reducing LDL-C levels and CVD risk when they are not adequately controlled by lifestyle changes such as better diet, weight control, and exercise. As physicians, we often encounter concerns about the potential side effects of cholesterol treatment, including myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and hepatic injury. The risk of hepatic injury caused by statins is reported to be about 1–3%, similar to that of patients taking a placebo. Despite extensive data documenting the safety of statins, primary care physicians harbor significant hepatotoxicity concerns, and these concerns act as a barrier to the utilization of statins especially for elderly patients aged 80 years or older. The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the liver enzyme elevation during statin therapy in these elderly patients.

### Statins: old drugs as new therapy for liver diseases? [^1168VvhX]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

In addition to lowering cholesterol levels, statins have pleiotropic effects, particularly anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, and antifibrotic, that may be beneficial in some chronic inflammatory conditions. Statins have only recently been investigated as a potential treatment option in chronic liver diseases because of concerns related to their safety in patients with impaired liver function. A number of experimental studies in animal models of liver diseases have shown that statins decrease hepatic inflammation, fibrogenesis and portal pressure. In addition, retrospective cohort studies in large populations of patients with cirrhosis and pre-cirrhotic conditions have shown that treatment with statins, with the purpose of decreasing high cholesterol levels, was associated with a reduced risk of disease progression, hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma development, and death. These beneficial effects persisted after adjustment for disease severity and other potential confounders. Finally, a few randomised controlled trials have shown that treatment with simvastatin decreases portal pressure (two studies) and mortality (one study). Statin treatment was generally well tolerated but a few patients developed severe side effects, particularly rhabdomyolysis. Despite these promising beneficial effects, further randomised controlled trials in large series of patients with hard clinical endpoints should be performed before statins can be recommended for use in clinical practice.

### A prospective study of hepatic safety of statins used in very elderly patients [^112xVqk5]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

To date, there has been not enough evidence to indicate that the incidence of hepatotoxicity or elevation of aminotransferase levels is higher in elderly patients receiving statins compared with younger patients. After a year of follow-up of the 515 patients in our study, the data suggest that the total rate of persistent aminotransferase elevation is 4.7% (95% CI 2.7–6.6). There is no correlation between drug-induced liver injury and age, gender, biliary calculus, fatty liver, comorbidity, polypharmacy, or the statin variety. It is safe to use the standard dose of statins in patients aged 80 years or older. Recently, the FDA has recommended the revision of labeling instructions for statins and has suggested that routine monitoring of liver enzymes in patients taking statins is unnecessary. However, in our opinion, monitoring liver function is necessary if the patient has chronic liver disease or a history of alcohol abuse.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114huZ8d]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Common adverse effects of statin therapy — statin-associated muscle symptoms are the most frequent adverse events, with reported occurrence in 5% to 25% of people who receive statins. All statins have been implicated in small increases in both relative and absolute risk of diabetes, with increased risk associated with older age and the presence of ≥ 2 risk factors, such as elevated baseline fasting glucose level, elevated fasting triglycerides, elevated body mass index, or history of hypertension. Pitavastatin has previously been shown to have a neutral effect on glucose levels and in REPRIEVE there was no difference in glucose levels between pitavastatin and placebo groups over follow-up (median levels at Month 84 were 92 mg/dL and 90 mg/dL, respectively), although in REPRIEVE there was a small increase in new-onset diabetes (6.0% in the pitavastatin group; 4.7% in the placebo group). A randomized controlled trial in people with HIV demonstrated increases in insulin resistance and impaired fasting glucose levels with rosuvastatin use. Mild increases in liver enzymes are usually transient without clinical complications, and the overall clinical benefits of statin use outweigh the overall risks of adverse effects, especially for people with greater estimated 10-year ASCVD risk. Data related to any concerns of cognitive decline have been weak or contradictory, and, as such, do not warrant statin avoidance or cessation. Any time statins are initiated, clinicians should perform a comprehensive evaluation of musculoskeletal symptoms, an assessment of risk factors for diabetes, and a clinician–patient shared decision-making discussion focused on indications, benefits, risks, and patient concerns and preferences, and when mild adverse events occur, close clinical follow-up is important.

### Intensive versus moderate lipid lowering with statins after acute coronary syndromes [^1143zpfb]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

The study PROVE IT-TIMI 22 was published by Cannon CP and colleagues in 2004 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Unstable angina. In the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 study, the trial question was: what is the role of intensive therapy in patients who had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days? In the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 study, the population was: 4162 patients (911 female, 3251 male). The inclusion criteria were patients who had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days. The key exclusion criteria were current statin therapy at a dose of 80 mg/day, or current lipid lowering therapy with fibric acid derivatives or niacin, obstructive hepatobiliary disease or other serious hepatic disease. In the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 study, the interventions were: n = 2099 intensive statin therapy (80 mg of atorvastatin daily) n = 2063 standard statin therapy (40 mg of pravastatin daily). In the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death or major cardiovascular events at 2 years (22.4% vs. 26.3%; RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.26). In the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death due to coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or revascularization at 2 years (19.7% vs. 22.3%; RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.27) Borderline significant decrease in death from any cause (2.2% vs. 3.2%; RR 0.28, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.58). In the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events (22.8% vs. 21.4%, p = 0.30). significant differences in liver enzyme elevation (3.3% vs. 1.1%, p < 0.001). In the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 study, the conclusion was: in patients who had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days, intensive statin therapy was superior to standard statin therapy with respect to death or major cardiovascular events at 2 years.

### Niacin and lovastatin (Advicor) [^112CSdtC]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

ADVICOR should not be substituted for equivalent doses of immediate-release (crystalline) niacin. For patients switching from immediate-release niacin to NIASPAN, therapy with NIASPAN should be initiated with low doses (i.e., 500 mg once daily at bedtime) and the NIASPAN dose should then be titrated to the desired therapeutic response (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Liver Dysfunction

Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis, have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin products for immediate-release (crystalline) niacin at equivalent doses.

ADVICOR should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of ADVICOR.

Niacin preparations and lovastatin preparations have been associated with abnormal liver tests. In studies using NIASPAN alone, 0.8% of patients were discontinued for transaminase elevations. In studies using lovastatin alone, 0.2% of patients were discontinued for transaminase elevations.2In three safety and efficacy studies involving titration to final daily ADVICOR doses ranging from 500 mg/10 mg to 2500 mg/40 mg, ten of 1028 patients (1.0%) experienced reversible elevations in AST/ALT to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Three of ten elevations occurred at doses outside the recommended dosing limit of 2000 mg/40 mg; no patient receiving 1000 mg/20 mg had 3-fold elevations in AST/ALT.

In clinical studies with ADVICOR, elevations in transaminases did not appear to be related to treatment duration; elevations in AST and ALT levels did appear to be dose related. Transaminase elevations were reversible upon discontinuation of ADVICOR.

It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with ADVICOR and repeated as clinically indicated.

There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including lovastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with ADVICOR, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found do not restart ADVICOR.

### Statins in liver disease: a molehill, an iceberg, or neither? [^111rJYqv]. Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

A growing number of chronic liver disease patients, especially those with metabolic syndrome-associated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or hepatitis C virus-associated dysmetabolic syndrome, will take statins to prevent cardiovascular disease. As a result, clinicians will weigh complex issues raised by the interaction of statins with liver metabolism in these disorders. In this article, we critically review data concerning statins and liver pathophysiology with an emphasis on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatitis C virus, while also touching on other chronic liver diseases. Basic research interests include statins' mechanism of action and their effects on cholesterol-related cell signaling pathways and angiogenesis. From the clinical standpoint, many chronic liver diseases increase cardiovascular risk and would undeniably benefit from sustained statin use. The false alarms and security accompanying aminotransferase monitoring, however, are disturbing in light of the scarcity of data on statins' long-term effects on liver histology. Although some actions of statins might eventually prove to be particularly useful in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hepatitis C virus, or hepatocellular carcinoma, others may prove harmful. The lack of definitive data makes a fully informed decision impossible. Research using histological endpoints is urgently needed to determine the indications and contraindications of this extraordinary class of agents in patients with chronic liver disease.

High-dose statin safety — evidence summary describes that higher statin doses increase adverse event risk, with Silva et al. (2007) showing high-dose simvastatin and atorvastatin were "associated with more adverse events (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.33–1.55) and more discontinuation due to adverse events (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.18–1.39) than lower dosed statins", and Li et al. (2016) showing "a higher risk for liver transaminase elevation (RR: 4.59, 95% CI: 3.26–6.48) and discontinuation due to adverse events (RR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.17–1.42) versus placebo or lower dose atorvastatin but no increases in CK, myalgia, or rhabdomyolysis". The page also notes "higher statin doses increase the adverse event risk", and that common adverse events are "elevated liver enzymes" and "muscle symptoms with rare reports of rhabdomyolysis".

### Evaluation of short-term safety and efficacy of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in hypercholesterolemic patients with elevated serum alanine transaminase concentrations: PITCH study (PITavastatin versus atorvastatin to evaluate the effect on patients with hypercholesterolemia and mild to moderate hepatic damage) [^115SzGUG]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors atorvastatin and pitavastatin in patients with mild-to-moderate increased levels of hepatic enzymes.

Methods and Results

In this 12-week, prospective, randomized, open-label, active drug-controlled, and dose-titration study, 189 subjects with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (≥ 3.36 mmol/L) and alanine transaminase (ALT; ×1.25 ≥ and ≤ ×2.5 ULN; 50–100 IU/L) concentrations, but nonalcoholic and serologically negative for viral hepatitis markers at screening, were randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with pitavastatin 2–4 mg/day (PITA, n = 97) or atorvastatin 10–20 mg/day (ATOR, n = 92). Pitavastatin and atorvastatin equally reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (-34.6 ± 16.0% and -38.1 ± 16.2%, respectively, P < .0001 each by analysis of variance). Seven (n = 4 PITA, n = 3 ATOR) and 10 (n = 5 PITA, n = 5 ATOR) patients experienced episodes of ALT > 100 IU/L at weeks 4 and 12, respectively, with one patient in each group excluded because of severe ALT elevation > 3× ULN (> 120 IU/L) at week 4. The 135 patients with persistently increased ALT concentrations at screening and randomization showed significant reductions in ALT after 12 weeks of treatment with PITA (n = 68, -8.4%) or ATOR (n = 67, -8.9%; P < .05, analysis of variance). Serial nonenhanced computed tomography in 38 subjects (n = 18 PITA, n = 20 ATOR) showed that both statins reduced the severity of hepatic steatosis, especially in subjects with clear hepatic steatosis at baseline (n = 9 PITA, n = 10 ATOR). Statin treatment of another 38 subjects with spontaneous normalization of ALT at randomization had little effect on ALT levels but did not induce severe ALT elevation (> 100 IU/L).

Conclusions

Conventional doses of pitavastatin and atorvastatin effectively and safely reduce elevated hepatic enzyme concentrations.

### Risks and benefits of continued aggressive statin therapy [^112X4NuX]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, are a well-tolerated, effective class of medications for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol levels. Extensive data from clinical trials demonstrate that these agents reduce fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention patients, including women and the elderly. A threshold value for LDL-C reduction below which there is no further clinical benefit has not yet been identified. In the Heart Protection Study (HPS), significant relative risk reduction occurred even among patients with LDL-C levels < 2.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl). Statin therapy also produced reductions in cardiovascular disease in a wide range of high-risk patients regardless of baseline cholesterol levels. Rhabdomyolysis, typically defined as muscle pain or weakness associated with creatine kinase levels higher than 10 times the upper limit of normal and the presence of myoglobulinuria, is a rare but potentially serious complication of statins. Although dose-dependent transaminase elevations occur in 0.5 to 2% of cases, it has not been determined whether these elevations qualify as true drug-related hepatotoxicity. Management of myopathy and elevated transaminases is addressed in a joint publication from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Because statins have significant potential benefits and a low risk for serious adverse effects, aggressive therapy should be considered in patients at high risk for coronary heart disease.

### Statin safety and associated adverse events: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114Yd2Gq]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2019). Medium credibility.

One in 4 Americans > 40 years of age takes a statin to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and other complications of atherosclerotic disease. The most effective statins produce a mean reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 55% to 60% at the maximum dosage, and 6 of the 7 marketed statins are available in generic form, which makes them affordable for most patients. Primarily using data from randomized controlled trials, supplemented with observational data where necessary, this scientific statement provides a comprehensive review of statin safety and tolerability. The review covers the general patient population, as well as demographic subgroups, including the elderly, children, pregnant women, East Asians, and patients with specific conditions such as chronic disease of the kidney and liver, human immunodeficiency viral infection, and organ transplants. The risk of statin-induced serious muscle injury, including rhabdomyolysis, is < 0.1%, and the risk of serious hepatotoxicity is ≈0.001%. The risk of statin-induced newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus is ≈0.2% per year of treatment, depending on the underlying risk of diabetes mellitus in the population studied. In patients with cerebrovascular disease, statins possibly increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke; however, they clearly produce a greater reduction in the risk of atherothrombotic stroke and thus total stroke, as well as other cardiovascular events. There is no convincing evidence for a causal relationship between statins and cancer, cataracts, cognitive dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, erectile dysfunction, or tendonitis. In US clinical practices, roughly 10% of patients stop taking a statin because of subjective complaints, most commonly muscle symptoms without raised creatine kinase. In contrast, in randomized clinical trials, the difference in the incidence of muscle symptoms without significantly raised creatinine kinase in statin-treated compared with placebo-treated participants is < 1%, and it is even smaller (0.1%) for patients who discontinued treatment because of such muscle symptoms. This suggests that muscle symptoms are usually not caused by pharmacological effects of the statin. Restarting statin therapy in these patients can be challenging, but it is important, especially in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events, for whom prevention of these events is a priority. Overall, in patients for whom statin treatment is recommended by current guidelines, the benefits greatly outweigh the risks.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^112eit57]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Drug and supplement-induced liver injury — medications and supplements are emphasized as common sources: "Prescribed and over-the-counter medications, as well as non-prescribed complementary alternative medicines or dietary supplements, represent a common source for acute and chronic liver injury". Workup demands thorough review, since "Identification of an offending agent is challenging and requires a comprehensive query of the patient, his or her family, and careful review of available medical and pharmacy records and laboratory data (22)". Many drugs can raise enzymes: "Many medications are associated with at least a small risk of elevation of ALT/AST/alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin with or without hepatotoxicity", and for statins "there is an extensive literature on the safety in those with chronic liver disease with only rare cases of hepatotoxicity reported (60,61)". In suspected acetaminophen exposure, clarify use when enzymes are markedly elevated: "In those with high ALT levels (> 1,000IU/l) an accurate history of acetaminophen use either as a single medicine or in combination with analgesic-narcotic combinations is essential". Management often involves withdrawal and monitoring: "Attributing liver injury to a specific agent frequently requires empiric trials of drug discontinuation to observe full recovery of liver chemistries", with substitution or surveillance as needed. Clinicians should ask about supplements — "Specific query for non-prescribed supplements is essential to discovery of associated liver injury" — and be aware that "Common herbal supplements associated with hepatotoxicity include chaparral, ephedra, ji bu huan, germander, green tea extract, and shark cartilage (8,62)". A practical reference is provided: "A helpful resource that is available to clinicians trying to ascertain whether a drug or supplement may be hepatotoxic is the website livertox.nih.gov".

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115eJLE3]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Use of hepatotoxic drugs

A wide variety of drugs are associated with liver disease, and a requirement for the monitoring of liver functions may be documented. In this systematic review the drugs most commonly implicated included: carbamazepine, methyldopa, minocycline, macrolide antibiotics, nitrofurantoin, statins, sulfonamides, terbinafine, chlorpromazine and methotrexate. In addition, drugs can cause fatty liver and steatohepatitis and vascular injury. Methotrexate treatment requires special care, to prevent dose-dependent liver fibrosis, and non-invasive markers of fibrosis should be monitored. Although statins can lead to drug-induced liver injury, this is very rare, with studies demonstrating they are safe in patients with pre-existing abnormal liver enzymes.

On occasions it can be difficult to establish the relative contribution of a drug or drugs alongside possible concomitant liver disease. In this situation clinical judgement needs to be exercised to determine what is the major contributor and the need to discontinue medication. This will be influenced by the pattern of liver blood tests, the timing of medication use with respect to the liver blood abnormality developing and the clinical setting.

Family history of liver diseases

Investigating the relatives of patients with familial diseases, including haemochromatosis or Wilson's disease, would be an indication for the specific relevant tests: ferritin and transferrin saturation, haemochromatosis genotype, caeruloplasmin and urinary copper.

Liver enzymes are a poor guide to the development of progressive liver fibrosis in alcohol-related liver disease, but elevated enzymes, of which GGT is the best predictor of mortality, can be useful aids to behaviour change. The current NICE recommendation is to screen for advanced liver disease using Fibroscan in patients drinking at harmful levels (50 units/week in men and 35 units/week in women), and there is emerging evidence that a diagnosis of liver fibrosis can be an effective stimulus for behaviour change.

Viral hepatitis

Viral hepatitis may be associated with non-specific symptoms, including fatigue, which may be severe, but the majority of patients are symptom free and identified as a result of risk factors, including country of origin or parental exposure. While liver blood tests can give an indication of necro-inflammation or of advanced fibrosis, a key early test is serology for viral hepatitis in high-risk groups, such as people who inject drugs, migrants from high-prevalence areas, prisoners, as liver blood tests can be normal in this setting (Table 2).

### Managing statin myopathy [^1124PhEZ]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Approximately 10% of patients treated with statins experience some form of muscle-related side effects in clinical practice. These can range from asymptomatic creatine kinase (CK) elevation, to muscle pain, weakness, and its most severe form, rhabdomyolysis. Higher risk patients for statin myopathy are those older than 80, with a small body frame, on higher statin doses, on other medications, or with other systemic diseases including hepatic or renal diseases, diabetes mellitus, or hypothyroidism. The cause of statin myopathy is presumed to be the same for its variable presentation but has not been defined. In patients with myopathic symptoms, their symptoms and CK levels determine whether statin therapy can be continued or must be stopped.

### Atorvastatin calcium tablets (atorvastatin calcium) [^111tXx4w]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.3 Liver Dysfunction

Statins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on two or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin calcium in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6%, and 2.3% for 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg, respectively.

One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of atorvastatin calcium.

It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with atorvastatin calcium and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with atorvastatin calcium, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart atorvastatin calcium.

Atorvastatin calcium should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of atorvastatin calcium [see Contraindications (4)].

5.4 Endocrine Function

Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including atorvastatin calcium.

Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal and/or gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin calcium does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine.

### Simvastatin (floLipid) [^115ZGRBR]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2 controlled clinical studies in 1,105 patients, the 12-month incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevation without regard to drug relationship was 0.9% and 2.1% at the 40- and 80-mg dose, respectively. No patients developed persistent liver function abnormalities following the initial 6 months of treatment at a given dose.

It is recommended that liver function tests be performed before the initiation of treatment, and thereafter when clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including simvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with FLOLIPID, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found do not restart FLOLIPID. Note that ALT may emanate from muscle, therefore ALT rising with CK may indicate myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

The drug should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of simvastatin.

Moderate (less than 3X ULN) elevations of serum transaminases have been reported following therapy with simvastatin. These changes appeared soon after initiation of therapy with simvastatin, were often transient, were not accompanied by any symptoms and did not require interruption of treatment.

5.4 Endocrine Function

Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including simvastatin.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^117RH9Ap]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Management of dyslipidemia in diabetes and chronic kidney disease — statin safety monitoring in type 2 diabetes: For patients with type 2 diabetes who are taking statins, routine monitoring of liver function tests or muscle enzymes is not recommended except in specific circumstances (Strong). Safety data note that rates of elevated liver or muscle enzyme levels did not differ between statin and placebo groups, that ongoing large-scale trials have not reported serious adverse events related to liver or muscle function, and that routine monitoring probably is not warranted unless patients have symptoms, have baseline abnormalities of liver function test results or myopathy, or are taking other drugs that interact with statins to increase adverse event risk.

### Atorvastatin calcium, film coated (atorvastatin calcium) [^112tSgbE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Concomitant intake of large quantities, more than 1.2 liters daily, of grapefruit juice is not recommended in patients taking atorvastatin [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Discontinue atorvastatin if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if atorvastatin is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue atorvastatin in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the atorvastatin dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy

There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persists despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue atorvastatin if IMNM is suspected.

5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction

Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of atorvastatin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. Persistent increases to more than three times the ULN in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 0.7% of patients receiving atorvastatin in clinical trials. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin.

Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Consider liver enzyme testing before atorvastatin initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. Atorvastatin is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications (4)]. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue atorvastatin.

Statin use in NAFLD/NASH includes safety context and treatment guidance: Patients with NAFLD and NASH are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, and although elevated aminotransferases are not uncommon in patients receiving statins, serious liver injury from statins is rarely seen in clinical practice; there are no RCTs with histological endpoints which investigated statins to treat NASH. Given the lack of evidence to show that patients with NAFLD and NASH are at increased risk for serious drug induced liver injury from statins, statins can be used to treat dyslipidemia in patients with NAFLD and NASH. (Strength – 1, Quality – B). Until RCTs with histological endpoints prove their efficacy, statins should not be used to specifically treat NASH. (Strength – 1, Quality – B).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Bempedoic acid — indications, dosing, lipid effects, precautions, and interactions: For LDL-C lowering in adults with ASCVD or HeFH as adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy, the dose is 180 mg orally once daily, with or without food, and combination therapy with statin therapy produces a placebo-corrected incremental mean LDL-C reduction of 17%-18%. Contraindications are listed as none, with adverse effects including upper respiratory tract infection, muscle spasms, hyperuricemia, back pain, abdominal pain or discomfort, bronchitis, pain in extremity, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes. Pregnancy guidance states to discontinue when pregnancy is recognized unless the benefits of therapy outweigh the potential risks to the fetus and notes no available data on use in pregnant women to determine a drug-associated risk; drug-drug interactions advise to avoid concomitant simvastatin > 20 mg or pravastatin > 40 mg. Cardiovascular outcomes trials are not completed, with CLEAR Outcomes trial completion expected later in 2022, and other prescribing considerations include cost, pill burden, and prior authorization.

### Safety and efficacy of statin therapy [^116NaGWq]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

The 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines on blood cholesterol management were a major shift in the delineation of the main patient groups that could benefit from statin therapy and emphasized the use of higher-intensity statin therapies. In 2016, an expert consensus panel from the ACC recommended the use of nonstatin therapies (ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors) in addition to maximally tolerated statin therapy in individuals whose LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol levels remained above certain thresholds after statin treatment. Given the substantial benefits of statin therapies in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, their long-term safety has become a concern. The potential harmful effects of statin therapy on muscle and liver have been known for some time, but new concerns have emerged regarding the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus, cognitive impairment and haemorrhagic stroke associated with the use of statins and the risks of achieving very low levels of LDL cholesterol. The increased media attention on the adverse events associated with statins has unfortunately led to statin therapy discontinuation, nonadherence to therapy or concerns about initiating statin therapy. In this Review, we explore the safety of statin therapy in light of the latest evidence and provide clinicians with reassurance about the safety of statins. Overwhelming evidence suggests that the benefits of statin therapy far outweigh any real or perceived risks.

High-dose statin safety: Studies suggest that higher statin doses increase the risk for statin-related adverse events, with elevated liver enzymes and muscle symptoms reported and rare cases of rhabdomyolysis. High-dose simvastatin and atorvastatin were associated with more adverse events (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.33–1.55) and more discontinuation due to adverse events (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.18–1.39) than lower dose statins, with more LFT and CK abnormalities. For high-dose atorvastatin, risks included liver transaminase elevation (RR: 4.59, 95% CI: 3.26–6.48) and discontinuation due to adverse events (RR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.17–1.42) without significant increases in CK, myalgia, or rhabdomyolysis. Although high-dose statins slightly increased rhabdomyolysis risk, this was limited to simvastatin a dose of 80 mg daily, which is no longer recommended by the FDA.

### Statin intolerance in a referral lipid clinic [^115gd5fc]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Statins effectively prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but rates of statin discontinuation after adverse events are high.

Objective

Describe the range and relative frequencies of adverse events potentially attributable to statins in lipid referral practice and assess statin rechallenge outcomes.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of 642 patients with statin-associated adverse events evaluated in a referral lipid clinic between January 1, 2004 and January 27, 2011.

Results

Patients experiencing adverse events by organ system included 92% with musculoskeletal, 8% central nervous system, 10% liver, 8% gastrointestinal, 5% peripheral nervous system, 5% skin, and 3% other events. Overlap of organ system involvement occurred in 22.5%. At least 1 follow-up visit was made by 557 patients, among whom overall median follow-up was 25 months. Among patients treated with a statin in the clinic, 71% remained on a statin at the last follow-up visit. Patients with hepatic transaminase increases by history were numerically more likely than the overall group to resume or remain on statin treatment, whereas those reporting central nervous system or gastrointestinal symptoms trended lower for statin maintenance. Among patients who experienced an adverse event after statin rechallenge, the majority (64%) were being treated with intermittent, nondaily dosing at the time of the adverse event.

Conclusion

Although musculoskeletal symptoms are reported by 90% of patients with statin intolerance, symptoms involving other organ systems may be more frequent than previously supposed. Understanding the range of symptoms, time course, and impact on daily activities informs counseling in patient-centered practice, but assessment of causation by statins remains challenging.

### Guideline review: EASL clinical practice guidelines: drug-induced liver injury (DILI) [^116PpXhr]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

HDS-associated liver toxicity appears to be an emerging determinant of DILI, with wide geographical variability. A prospective study in Iceland purported 16% of DILI related to HDS, while the US Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network reported a similar percentage (16%), with an increase from 7% from 2004 to 2005 to 20% in 2013–2014. Further case–control data suggested rates of 4%–5% in studies in Latin Americaand Germany, respectively.

DILI should be classified according to the dominant pattern of liver enzyme derangement; hepatocellular, cholestatic and mixed injury (figure 1).

Initially, alanine transferase (ALT) activity (patients ALT/upper limit of normal (ULN) of ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (patients ALP/ULN of ALP) is calculated. Then ALT/ALP ratio (R) is determined. Some of the other commonly encountered phenotypes, and characteristic findings and commonly implicated agents are summarised in table 1.

Table 1
Classification of DILI based on liver enzyme derangement

ALT, ALP and bilirubin are the typical indices used to define liver damage, and liver dysfunction in DILI and serial measurements are necessary to portray extent of hepatocellular injury and DILI phase. ALT is sensitive for hepatocyte injury, particularly alongside an elevated bilirubin and this pattern is a reliable biomarker of liver injury in DILI. Elevated aminotransferases do not reflect the extent to which the liver is damaged, particularly in insidious variants of hepatotoxicity such as indolent fibrosis, vascular liver disorders, cirrhosis and microvesicular steatosis secondary to mitochondrial toxicity. Elevated ALP values usually indicate cholestatic damage, which combined with elevated GGT provides evidence the ALP elevation is of hepatic origin. Isolated hyperbilirubinaemia does not qualify as DILI, given possibility of multiple confounding diagnoses. One important consideration is mild transaminase rises that may be apparent in relation to statin therapy, this may simply reflect an adaptive response and does not represent a true DILI. As such, given the benefit of statins in NAFLD(Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) and cardiovascular disease such therapies should be continued where feasible.

### SLCO1B1*5 allele is associated with atorvastatin discontinuation and adverse muscle symptoms in the context of routine care [^1143v4j3]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

The 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG‐CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are among the most commonly prescribed medications in the industrialized world. Statins decrease cardiovascular event rate in the context of both primary and secondary prevention. The combined 2018 American College of Cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce the atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk for adults recommend moderate to high intensity statin therapy for patients at high risk of cardiovascular events. In patients with known cardiovascular disease, each 1 mmol/L reduction in low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowers the annual incidence of major vascular events by 20%. Despite compelling data to support clinical efficacy, statins are still not optimally utilized. Reasons for this discrepancy include provider underprescribing and patient nonadherence.

In general, statins are considered safe and well tolerated. Although they can cause asymptomatic elevation in hepatic transaminases, statin‐induced liver injury is extremely rare. Conversely, muscle pain (myalgias) and muscle damage (myopathy) occur quite often in the context of statin therapy. Statin‐associated musculoskeletal symptoms (SAMSs) frequently lead to patient nonadherence or discontinuation. In observational studies, myalgias have been reported in as many as 10% of patients taking statins. Most of these cases do not have laboratory evidence of muscle damage. Myopathy occurs much less frequently, ranging from 1% to fewer than 0.1%, depending upon the degree to which creatine kinase (CK) levels are elevated in the systemic circulation. Rhabdomyolysis, the most extreme example of this adverse drug reaction (with CK levels exceeding 50 times the upper limit of normal), is rare with an incidence of 1:1,000,000 on statin monotherapy.

### Lipid SIG algorithms [^114RoPh6]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Statin initiation — prior to therapy, complete baseline steps: "Counsel about side effects, potential medication interactions, contraindications, adherence", "Obtain baseline labs: ALT, AST, CK", then "Start statin". Reassess with "Recheck fasting lipids in 4 weeks, LDL-C at goal?"; if yes, evaluate "Signs of toxicity?" with toxicity defined as "Toxicity = AST, ALT > 3x ULN, or CK > 10x ULN (check CK if concern for myopathy)". If toxicity is present, "Stop statin, recheck labs in 2 weeks, if labs and symptoms normalize consider restarting lower dose or with different statin"; if no toxicity, "Continue current therapy, and monitor per page 1, 'Diabetes and lipids' algorithm". If LDL-C is not at goal, "Assess/ensure compliance, titrate statin", then "Recheck fasting lipids in 4 weeks" and "recheck every 4 weeks until at goal LDL-C level"; if still not tolerating, "see 'Beyond Statin' algorithm", and if not at goal on maximal dosing, "consider adding or switching to another agent". Safety notes specify "Side effects: muscle pain/cramp, weakness, myopathy", and interactions: "cyclosporine, niacin, fibric acid derivative, erythromycin, azole antifungal, HIV protease inhibitor". Use is restricted in special populations: "Contraindicated in pregnancy, known teratogen", and "Also contraindicated in nursing mothers, acute liver disease, hypersensitivity to statin". Pediatric labeling states, "Currently statins are approved for children starting age 7 years for hoFH and age 8 years for HeFH". A dosing principle is provided: "2x dose = ↓ 6% LDL-C".

### Insights into statin intolerance [^114KPsy9]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Q: What are your thoughts on the findings of theTask Force on Statin Intolerance?

The NLA Statin Intolerance Task Force has similarly presented a pragmatic definition of statin intolerance: "Adverse symptoms, signs and/or laboratory abnormalities attributed by the patient and/or provider to a statin, and perceived by the patient to interfere with daily life activities". These include predominantly muscle‐related symptoms, with muscle aches being the most common, but also may include other symptoms, liver‐enzyme increases, and isolated muscle‐enzyme increases.

Importantly, the NLA has included the phrase "real or perceived" in further describing these symptoms.

The NLA provides practical, patient‐centered recommendations that serve as an important augmentation to the ACC/AHA Guidelines.

The NLA Task Force concluded that statin intolerance requires a patient‐centered approach in practice; reducing the dose of statin, switching to a different statin, and alternate regimens, such as every‐other‐day dosing, are recommended for patients with statin intolerance. For patients who cannot tolerate a statin using the above strategies, alternate agents alone or in combination may be considered; innovative approaches to research on statin intolerance are needed.

### High-intensity statin reduces the risk of mortality among chronic liver disease patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a population-based cohort study [^117AMgxu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Statin is a well‐tolerated medication with its efficacy and safety established in various populations from multiple randomized clinical trials. However, patients with CLD were often excluded from randomized clinical trials, and concerns about the hepatotoxicity of statins were factors that made it difficult to establish clinical evidence from this vulnerable population. This study filled the research gap by using the nationwide health insurance database with sufficient power to generate real‐world data on the mortality benefit by statin intensity in clinically subpopulations. Moreover, > 30 potential confounders were used to measure PS to minimize confounding between 2 intensity groups, along with a robust methodology and consistent results from multiple sensitivity analyses.

This study also has several limitations. First, as in other nonrandomized studies, the results from this study may have been affected by the residual and unmeasured confounding factors. For example, patients who received high‐intensity statins were at a higher baseline cardiovascular risk compared with patients who received low/moderate‐intensity statins, given that we observed a slight but significantly higher risk of MI from high‐intensity users. Although, several efforts were made to minimize this issue, including the use of IPTW, PS matching, and fully adjusting for covariates including laboratory data in the sensitivity analyses, confounding may not be fully addressed. Second, patients with chronic liver disease, statin may be discontinued for a medical cause, such as increased liver enzyme levels. Therefore, in this study, intention‐to‐treat design was applied to conservatively define drug exposure. In addition, we also conducted on‐treatment design, censoring subjects when they discontinuation of statin or changed in statin intensity. Third, because of the database limitations, this study did not clearly address the status or condition of CLD (eg, Child‐Pugh score or MELD [Model for End‐stage Liver Disease] score). As statin is mostly metabolized through the liver, the effect of statin according to the liver condition may play an important factor in the patient's prognosis. However, to compensate for this limitation, we performed a subgroup analysis for patients with cirrhosis diagnosis within a year before cohort entry, and the effect according to statin intensity was null in this subset. Fourth, this study did not include all patients with ASCVD such as MI, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. However, by including only patients with CLD with revascularization, it is possible to compare measures of effect by statin intensity in a more homogeneous population and these patients may be considered more appropriate for statin indications. Fifth, patients with mild stage nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were also not included. Given the large influence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease on cardiovascular disease and its rapidly increasing prevalence, further studies including this population will be needed.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^111vzbPy]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezetimibe) — discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurs in about 5% of patients and common adverse effects are gastrointestinal with occasional increases in liver enzymes and creatine phosphokinase with muscle symptoms; ezetimibe is administered as a 10 mg tablet once daily; in IMPROVE-IT, ezetimibe with a statin versus a statin alone in 18,144 post-acute coronary syndrome patients produced an additional 16.7 mg/dL (0.4 mmol/L) decrease in LDL-C with on-treatment [1-year] levels of 69.9 and 53.2 mg/dL, respectively, and was associated with a statistically significant 10% reduction in a composite CVD outcome; this reduction aligns with a predicted estimate assuming each 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) LDL-C lowering produces a 22% ASCVD event risk reduction (16.7 mg/dL ÷ 38.7 mg/dL = 0.4; 0.4 × 22% = 8.8%).

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^115pTTu2]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Statins — frequency of liver effects — summarizes that there are seven statins; while generally safe, myalgias and myopathy may lead to early dose reduction or termination in up to 10% of treated patients, and self-limited serum aminotransferase elevations occur in up to 20% of patients though clinically significant hepatic dysfunction was very uncommon. In the DILIN study, only 22 of 1188 (1.8%) DILI cases over an 8-year period were attributed to a statin.

### Resmetirom therapy for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: October 2024 updates to AASLD practice guidance [^113kRxoa]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Practice recommendations — on-treatment monitoring and coadministration: Hepatic function panel testing should be obtained at baseline and at periodic intervals (eg, 3, 6, and 12 months) to determine response and adverse events while on resmetirom therapy, and resmetirom should be discontinued if hepatotoxicity develops as defined by the AASLD drug-induced liver injury practice guidance. There are insufficient data to make a recommendation on monitoring after 12 months of resmetirom treatment but continued monitoring with hepatic function panel testing every 6 months is suggested. Among persons with known thyroid disease, standard laboratory monitoring (eg, TSH and free T4) per established guidelines is recommended while receiving resmetirom therapy. Resmetirom can be used concurrently with statins; however, practitioners should be aware of the maximum recommended daily dosages, including atorvastatin 40 mg/d, pravastatin 40 mg/d, rosuvastatin 20 mg/d, and simvastatin 20 mg/d, and continued attention to comorbidity management including hyperlipidemia is recommended particularly if the statin dose is modified at the outset of resmetirom therapy.

### Statins for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^112KJLAL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are common causes of elevated liver enzymes in the general population. NASH and to some extent NAFLD have been associated with increased liver-related and all-cause mortality. No effective treatment is yet available. Recent reports have shown that the use of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) in patients with elevated plasma aminotransferases may result in normalisation of these liver enzymes. Whether this is a consistent effect or whether it can lead to improved clinical outcomes beyond normalisation of abnormal liver enzymes is not clear.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of statins (that is, lovastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and fluvastatin) on all-cause and liver-related mortality, adverse events, and histological, biochemical, and imaging responses in patients with NAFLD or NASH.

Search Methods

We performed a computerised literature search in the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded up to March 2013. We did fully recursive searches from the reference lists of all retrieved relevant publications to ensure a complete and comprehensive search of the published literature. We did not apply any restrictions regarding language of publication or publication date.

Selection Criteria

All randomised clinical trials using statins as the primary treatment for NAFLD or NASH versus no treatment, placebo, or other hypolipidaemic agents.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted, and risk of bias of each trial was assessed independently by two or more review authors. Meta-analyses were performed whenever possible. Review Manager 5.2 was used.

Main Results

When the described search method was used and the eligibility criteria of the search results were applied, 653 records were found. Only two of these were randomised clinical trials that were considered eligible for inclusion. We assessed both trials as trials with high risk of bias. One of the trials was a pilot trial in which 16 participants with biopsy-proven NASH were randomised to receive simvastatin 40 mg (n = 10) or placebo (n = 6) once daily for 12 months. No statistically significant improvement in the aminotransferase level was seen in the simvastatin group compared with the placebo group. Liver histology was not significantly affected by simvastatin. The other trial had three arms. The trial compared atorvastatin 20 mg daily (n = 63) versus fenofibrate 200 mg daily (n = 62) versus a group treated with a combination of the two interventions (n = 61). There were no statistically significant differences between any of the three intervention groups regarding the week 54 mean activity levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase. The triglyceride levels seemed higher in the fenofibrate group compared with the atorvastatin group. Liver histology was not assessed in this trial. The presence of biochemical and ultrasonographic evidence of NAFLD seemed to be higher in the fenofibrate group compared with the atorvastatin group (58% versus 33%). Three patients discontinued treatment due to myalgia and elevated serum creatine kinase activity; one from the atorvastatin group and two from the combination group. Another patient from the atorvastatin group discontinued treatment due to alanine aminotransferase activity that was over three times the upper normal limit. No data for all-cause mortality and hepatic-related mortality were reported in the included trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the findings of this review, which included two trials with high risk of bias and a small numbers of participants, it seems possible that statins may improve serum aminotransferase levels as well as ultrasound findings. Neither of the trials reported on possible histological changes, liver-related morbidity or mortality. Trials with larger sample sizes and low risk of bias are necessary before we may suggest statins as an effective treatment for patients with NASH. However, as statins can improve the adverse outcomes of other conditions commonly associated with NASH (for example, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome), their use in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis may be justified.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^112YJtcG]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

HIV infection — statin safety monitoring and lipid patterns: Monitoring of statin side effects in the HIV-infected patients is similar to monitoring in the general population, and routine monitoring of creatine kinase is not recommended. Some clinicians order liver function tests approximately 1 month after prescribing statins, although the FDA does not recommend monitoring and suggests liver function be monitored only in patients with pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of liver toxicity. The most common lipid abnormality reported in persons with HIV is high triglycerides (TG) with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and infections are known to increase TG by decreasing clearance of circulating lipoproteins or by stimulating hepatic lipid synthesis or reesterification of fatty acids.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^113Seobx]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Statins (Hydroxymethylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase Inhibitors) — initiation, dosing, and safety in children and adolescents are summarized as follows: Statin therapy is recommended as the initial medication of choice for treating patients with sufficiently elevated LDL–C or non–HDL–C levels. Statin dose should begin with the lowest available dose given once daily, and if LDL–C target levels are not achieved with at least 3 months of compliant use, then the dose may be increased by one increment; pediatric trials of dose escalation reported no additional safety issues. Adverse effects from statins are rare at standard doses but include myopathy and hepatic enzyme elevation, and in the meta-analysis of statin use in children, evidence of hepatic enzyme elevation and muscle toxicity did not differ between statin and placebo groups. Myopathy — muscle pain and weakness with creatine kinase elevations more than 10 times the upper limits of normal range — typically occurs in fewer than 1 in 10,000 adult patients. Rhabdomyolysis, a very rare occurrence in adults on statin therapy reported at 3 per 100,000 person-years, did not occur in any of the pediatric trials.

### Liver safety of statins in prediabetes or T2DM and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: post hoc analysis of a randomized trial [^1113tmFX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease have a high cardiovascular risk, but statins are rarely prescribed because of fear of hepatotoxicity.

Objective

To prospectively assess the long-term safety of statins in patients with prediabetes/type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

Design

Post hoc analysis of statin use during a randomized, controlled trial assessing pioglitazone vs placebo for NASH.

Patients

A total of 101 patients (86 receiving statins) with biopsy-proven NASH and prediabetes/T2DM were followed for up to 36 months.

Interventions

Oral glucose tolerance test and percutaneous liver biopsy (baseline, month 18, and month 36); liver magnetic resonance spectroscopy and euglycemic insulin clamp (baseline and month 18).

Main Outcome Measures

Histologic and biochemical safety of statin use among patients with NASH.

Results

Only 37% of patients were receiving statins at enrollment despite their high cardiovascular risk. Statin nonusers had higher plasma alanine aminotransferase levels but similar histologic severity of liver disease at baseline. In both statin users and nonusers, the same number of patients (n = 4) had a twofold or greater increase in plasma aminotransferases during follow-up. One statin nonuser was discontinued from the study because of this elevation. Values returned to normal without any active measure in all other cases. No changes on liver histology or hepatic insulin resistance were observed in patients with NASH newly started on a statin and receiving placebo during the main study.

Conclusions

Statin therapy is safe in patients with prediabetes/T2DM and NASH. Given their high cardiovascular risk, statin therapy should be encouraged in this population.
