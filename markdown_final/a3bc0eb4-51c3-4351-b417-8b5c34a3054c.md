## Question

How should troponin levels be measured in the setting of pneumonia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how troponin levels should be measured in the setting of pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which pneumonia patients warrant troponin testing. Then, I should select the appropriate assay and thresholds. Next, I will set the timing for serial measurements. After that, I need to interpret results in the pneumonia context, distinguishing type 1 MI from type 2 myocardial injury and other causes. I will then outline when to escalate cardiac evaluation, how to use troponin for risk stratification, and finally consider special populations such as COVID-19, children, and chronic kidney disease, before summarizing a pragmatic protocol, making sure each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm who needs troponin measurement in the setting of pneumonia, and I should not jump to conclusions until I verify the cardiac risk profile and illness severity. Hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia, those with severe pneumonia or early clinical instability, and those with established cardiovascular comorbidity are at increased risk of early cardiac complications, which occur in roughly a quarter to a third of inpatients and often within the first 24 hours, so a low threshold for troponin testing at admission in these groups is justified as part of risk stratification and early detection of cardiac events [^113YXPeM] [^114WqBDo] [^1161XhJC]. Wait, I should also acknowledge that a nontrivial fraction of ED troponin elevations arise from non-cardiac illnesses such as pneumonia and sepsis, reinforcing that testing should be purposeful and interpretation contextual rather than equating any elevation with type 1 MI [^116Bi9LA].

> I need to choose the right assay and thresholds, and hold on, I should verify that I am using assay-specific 99th percentile upper reference limits with sex-specific cutoffs where available rather than a one-size-fits-all number. Contemporary guidance favors high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays with use of the 99th percentile URL to define myocardial injury, applying laboratory- and sex-specific thresholds and integrating results with clinical features and ECG to diagnose myocardial infarction rather than relying on troponin alone [^11231327] [^113GPby9]. Hmm, wait a minute, earlier I almost defaulted to a "standard cutoff" of 0.04 ng/mL for hs-cTnI based on legacy sensitive assay data; that threshold came from a specific study and should not be generalized because different hs-cTn assays have different URLs, so I should correct that and emphasize use of the locally validated, assay-specific 99th percentile and sex-specific values instead [^1175poeD] [^11231327]. I should also keep in mind that in systemic illnesses such as COVID-19, prognostic troponin thresholds associated with mortality can be lower than conventional cardiac thresholds, which matters for risk stratification, not for MI diagnosis per se [^113KjftS].

> Next, I should review timing, and I will now examine whether to use a 0/1-hour, 0/2-hour, or 0/3-hour serial algorithm. ESC guidance recommends 0/1-hour or 0/2-hour hs-cTn algorithms to rapidly rule in or rule out NSTEMI, which I can adapt in pneumonia when MI is on the differential and the lab supports these pathways, whereas AAFP guidance commonly references an initial hs-cTn with repeat at 3 hours when ACS is suspected, and I need to reconcile these by choosing the algorithm supported by my institution's validated assay and workflow [^11231327] [^114W9z4a]. Hold on, let me verify the clinical course in pneumonia; most cardiac complications cluster in the first 24–48 hours, so obtaining a baseline upon admission and repeating within 1–3 hours when MI is a concern, and again at 6–12 hours if initially elevated or symptoms evolve, is reasonable for detection of dynamic change, with consideration of another check at 24–48 hours in patients who deteriorate [^113YXPeM] [^1175poeD].

> I need to ensure that I interpret any elevation in the pneumonia context, and I should double-check that I am distinguishing type 2 myocardial injury from type 1 MI. In pneumonia, troponin elevation most often reflects an acute non-ischemic or secondary ischemic mechanism from hypoxemia, sepsis, tachyarrhythmia, or supply–demand mismatch rather than plaque rupture, but plaque-triggered MI does occur and must be actively excluded with symptoms, ECG, and imaging before attributing to type 2 injury alone [^113GPby9] [^11231327] [^115vBsTj]. Let me consider additional mechanisms such as direct myocardial toxicity and platelet activation in pneumococcal disease, and the possibility of pulmonary embolism or decompensated heart failure as alternative or concomitant drivers of troponin release, which should shape further testing with ECG and echocardiography and, when indicated, imaging for thromboembolism [^115inRYf] [^1161XhJC] [^114WqBDo].

> I should confirm how to weigh magnitude and kinetics, and hold on, let's not jump to conclusions based solely on an absolute value. Small elevations around the URL are common in systemic illness and portend risk, whereas marked elevations, for example greater than five times the URL with a rise and/or fall, increase concern for an acute process requiring urgent evaluation for MI or myocarditis; however, diagnosis still rests on integrated clinical, ECG, and imaging evidence of ischemia per universal definitions and ESC algorithms, emphasizing the need to document a dynamic change when diagnosing myocardial infarction [^11231327] [^113GPby9] [^1134GgZY]. I need to check the prognostic literature as well; even minor increases carry adverse prognostic implications across ages and across cardiac and non-cardiac presentations, which should influence monitoring intensity and disposition decisions in pneumonia admissions [^116ebNz4].

> If troponin is elevated, I will now outline escalation steps, but wait, I should verify that actions are tiered to both troponin pattern and the clinical picture. Immediate acquisition of a 12‑lead ECG and initiation of cardiac monitoring are warranted, with early transthoracic echocardiography within the first day to assess ventricular function and wall motion if there is hemodynamic instability, dynamic biomarker elevation, or ECG abnormalities; cardiology consultation is indicated when there are dynamic rises with significant multiples of the URL, ischemic ECG changes, persistent chest pain, or shock, while management must also optimize oxygenation, perfusion, and sepsis source control to reverse supply–demand imbalance and prevent progression of myocardial injury [^11231327] [^113YXPeM] [^1134GgZY]. Hold on, I should verify that any invasive strategy is reserved for patients with strong evidence of type 1 MI or unstable ischemia, consistent with guideline-algorithmic rule-in pathways for ACS, rather than troponin elevation alone [^11231327].

> If troponin is not elevated at baseline and suspicion for ACS is low, I need to ensure we continue evidence-based pneumonia care and avoid unnecessary testing, while remaining vigilant for new cardiac symptoms; if ECG evolves or symptoms arise, repeating hs‑cTn according to the locally supported algorithm is appropriate, but indiscriminate serial testing without clinical triggers should be avoided to minimize noise and downstream harms [^114NQhP1] [^111GQEke]. Let me reconsider that point: in selected cases with evolving instability despite an initially negative hs‑cTn, a second check at 3–6 hours may still be informative, aligning with chest pain algorithms adapted to the pneumonia context and local assay performance [^114W9z4a] [^11231327].

> Next, I should review troponin as a prognostic tool in pneumonia, and I will now examine how it refines risk stratification. Elevated troponin identifies patients at higher risk for in-hospital and 30‑day mortality and for cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and MI, and this information can guide level of care, telemetry use, early cardiology involvement, and follow-up planning beyond the index admission, especially because cardiovascular risks can extend beyond discharge [^114WqBDo] [^1167vPNV] [^1161XhJC]. I need to ensure that prognostic use does not conflate with diagnostic labeling of MI; troponin should augment, not replace, clinical judgment in triage and disposition decisions [^1134GgZY].

> For patients with COVID‑19 pneumonia, I should double-check that myocardial injury rates are higher and that lower biomarker thresholds may carry prognostic significance. Myocardial injury defined by elevated hs‑cTn is common in COVID‑19 and correlates with short‑ and longer‑term mortality, and early combined elevation of hs‑cTn with natriuretic peptides further enriches risk, so considering lower prognostic cutoffs and ensuring close monitoring and cardiopulmonary assessment is reasonable, while still applying standard MI diagnostic criteria for type 1 events [^113uWGM6] [^1134hP7g] [^113KjftS]. But wait, what if the elevation is modest and nonspecific; in severe COVID‑19, hs‑cTn often functions as an integrated risk marker rather than indicating primary myocardial necrosis, which should temper reflexive invasive testing and refocus on stabilization and targeted imaging when indicated [^111yv1KD] [^1134GgZY].

> In children with pneumonia or chest symptoms, I need to ensure age-appropriate interpretation and avoid over-calling MI. Troponin can aid evaluation when cardiac etiologies such as myocarditis are on the differential, with high negative predictive value when levels are not elevated, but optimal cutoffs are lower in children three months and older and higher in infants, and the test should be integrated with ECG and imaging rather than used as a standalone screen [^113AuDfF] [^111krnQJ] [^111UMfrv]. Hold on, I should verify that serial testing adds limited value if the initial troponin is already elevated, whereas repeating after an initially normal result may help if clinical concern persists, consistent with pediatric cohort data [^113A3dmi].

> For patients with chronic kidney disease, I should confirm that baseline elevations are common and that dynamic change and clinical context carry more diagnostic weight than a single elevated value. In CKD, reliance on deltas and a comprehensive assessment improves specificity for ACS, and elevated troponin still has prognostic value even when MI is not ultimately diagnosed, which should guide cautious interpretation and management planning [^115c98w9].

> To synthesize a practical protocol, I should double-check that each step aligns with evidence and local assay capability. In hospitalized pneumonia with severity markers or cardiovascular risk, obtain baseline hs‑cTn on admission with a 12‑lead ECG, apply your laboratory's validated hs‑cTn algorithm (prefer 0/1‑ or 0/2‑hour if supported, or 0/3‑hour when aligned with institutional practice) for patients in whom MI is a concern, interpret results against sex‑specific 99th percentile URLs and in conjunction with symptoms, ECG, and echocardiography, presume type 2 myocardial injury unless there is evidence of ischemia meeting MI criteria, escalate to cardiology and advanced testing when there are dynamic rises with significant multiples of URL or ischemic findings, and use any elevation to heighten monitoring intensity and discharge planning, especially in COVID‑19 where prognostic thresholds may be lower [^11231327] [^114W9z4a] [^113YXPeM] [^1134GgZY].

> Final thought: I need to ensure we communicate clearly that in pneumonia a troponin elevation is a red flag for risk rather than a synonym for heart attack, and that the safest course is serial measurement coupled with clinical integration and targeted imaging to avoid both under-recognition of true MI and overdiagnosis of type 1 events in secondary myocardial injury [^113GPby9] [^116ebNz4] [^112tkSRk].

Troponin testing in pneumonia is indicated when there are **cardiac symptoms or ECG changes** [^114W9z4a] or in severe cases with hypoxia, shock [^116Bi9LA], or high-risk features [^113YXPeM]. Use **high-sensitivity assays** [^1175poeD] and interpret results with serial measurements (0 and 3–6 hours) [^114W9z4a] to detect dynamic changes [^11231327]. Elevated troponin in pneumonia often reflects type 2 MI [^112LjfVh] or non-ischemic injury from hypoxia, sepsis, or inflammation, and is associated with higher mortality [^114WqBDo] [^116ebNz4] and complications. Manage by treating pneumonia [^114NQhP1], correcting hypoxia [^1161XhJC], and monitoring for cardiac complications [^113YXPeM]; use troponin to guide risk stratification [^1167vPNV] and escalation of care.

## Indications for troponin testing in pneumonia

Troponin testing is not routine in pneumonia [^111GQEke]; perform it when there is **clinical suspicion of cardiac involvement**, such as:

- **Chest pain or ischemic symptoms**: Suggesting possible myocardial ischemia or infarction [^114W9z4a].
- **ECG changes**: New ischemic changes or arrhythmias [^11231327].
- **Severe pneumonia**: Hypoxia, shock, or high-risk features (e.g. PSI class IV/V) [^113YXPeM].
- **Pre-existing cardiovascular disease**: Known CAD, heart failure, or arrhythmias [^114WqBDo].

---

## Recommended troponin assays and timing

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTnI or hs-cTnT) assays are preferred for their **greater sensitivity** and earlier detection of myocardial injury [^1175poeD] [^11231327]. Timing: obtain an **initial measurement** at presentation or when cardiac involvement is suspected [^114W9z4a], then obtain **serial measurements** at 3–6 hours to detect dynamic changes (rise/fall) indicating acute injury [^113GPby9] [^11231327].

---

## Interpretation of elevated troponin levels in pneumonia

Elevated troponin in pneumonia [^113YXPeM] often reflects **type 2 MI** or non-ischemic injury due to hypoxia, sepsis, or inflammation [^114WqBDo] [^112LjfVh]. Key considerations include:

- **Magnitude and dynamics**: Small, stable elevations suggest chronic or mild injury; dynamic rise/fall suggests acute injury [^11231327].
- **Clinical context**: Correlate with symptoms, ECG, and imaging to distinguish type 1 MI from type 2 or non-ischemic injury [^113GPby9].
- **Prognostic significance**: Elevated troponin is linked to higher mortality [^114WqBDo] [^116ebNz4], heart failure, and arrhythmias.

---

## Clinical management based on troponin results

Elevated troponin in pneumonia should prompt **targeted management**, including:

- **Treat underlying pneumonia**: Appropriate antibiotics and supportive care [^114NQhP1].
- **Correct hypoxia and hemodynamics**: Oxygen, ventilation, and hemodynamic support as needed [^1161XhJC].
- **Monitor for cardiac complications**: ECG, echocardiography, and clinical monitoring for heart failure, arrhythmias, or MI [^113YXPeM].
- **Risk stratification and escalation**: Use troponin to guide ICU transfer or cardiology consultation [^1167vPNV].

## Summary table: troponin testing in pneumonia

| **Clinical scenario** | **Troponin testing** | **Interpretation** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Chest pain or ECG changes | Yes | Type 1 or 2 MI | ACS protocol or supportive care |
| Severe pneumonia (hypoxia, shock) | Yes | Type 2 MI or non-ischemic injury | - Supportive care <br/> - Monitor complications |
| Mild pneumonia, no cardiac symptoms | No | Not indicated | Routine pneumonia care |

---

Troponin testing in pneumonia is indicated when **cardiac involvement is suspected** [^111GQEke] or disease is severe [^113YXPeM]. Use high-sensitivity assays [^1175poeD] with serial measurements [^114W9z4a], interpret results in clinical context [^113GPby9], and manage by treating pneumonia, correcting hypoxia, and monitoring for complications.

### Sensitive troponin I assay in early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction [^1175poeD]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). High credibility.

Cardiac troponin testing is central to the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. We evaluated a sensitive troponin I assay for the early diagnosis and risk stratification of myocardial infarction.

- **Methods**: In a multicenter study, we determined levels of troponin I as assessed by a sensitive assay, troponin T, and traditional myocardial necrosis markers in 1818 consecutive patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction at admission, 3 hours, and 6 hours after admission.

- **Results**: For samples obtained on admission, the diagnostic accuracy was highest with the sensitive troponin I assay (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve [AUC], 0.96) compared to the troponin T assay (AUC, 0.85) and traditional myocardial necrosis markers. Using the sensitive troponin I assay (cutoff value, 0.04 ng per milliliter) on admission, the clinical sensitivity was 90.7%, and the specificity was 90.2%. The diagnostic accuracy was virtually identical in baseline and serial samples, regardless of the time of chest-pain onset. In patients presenting within 3 hours after chest-pain onset, a single sensitive troponin I assay had a negative predictive value of 84.1% and a positive predictive value of 86.7%; these findings predicted a 30% rise in the troponin I level within 6 hours. A troponin I level of more than 0.04 ng per milliliter was independently associated with an increased risk of an adverse outcome at 30 days (hazard ratio, 1.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.27 to 3.05; P = 0.003).

- **Conclusions**: The use of a sensitive assay for troponin I improved the early diagnosis and risk stratification in acute myocardial infarction, particularly within 3 hours of chest-pain onset.

### The etiology and prognostic significance of cardiac troponin I elevation in unselected emergency department patients [^116Bi9LA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponin elevations are associated not only with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) but also with multiple other cardiac and non-cardiac conditions.

- **Study objectives**: To investigate the etiology and clinical significance of cardiac troponin I elevations in an unselected Emergency Department (ED) patient cohort.

- **Methods**: The study population consisted of 991 consecutive troponin-positive patients admitted to the ED of a university hospital with ACS as the presumptive diagnosis. Cardiac troponin I was measured on admission, and a follow-up sample was obtained at 6–12 hours. Clinical diagnosis was ascertained retrospectively using all the available information, including electrocardiogram, clinical data, laboratory tests, and available coronary angiograms.

- **Results**: At admission, 805 (81.2%) patients were already troponin positive; of these, the troponin elevation was related to myocardial infarction (MI) in 654 (81.2%) patients. Finally, 83.0% of the troponin elevations were due to MI, 7.9% were related to other cardiac causes, and 9.1% to non-cardiac diseases. The leading non-cardiac causes were pulmonary embolism, renal failure, pneumonia, and sepsis. Non-cardiac patients with elevated troponin I at admission showed significantly higher in-hospital mortality (26.7% vs. 13.4%, p = 0.002) compared to cardiac patients.

- **Conclusion**: Elevated troponin levels for reasons other than MI are common in the ED and are a marker of poor in-hospital prognosis.

### Cardiac complications in patients with community-acquired pneumonia: Incidence, timing, risk factors, and association with short-term mortality [^113YXPeM]. Circulation (2012). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) affects more than 5 million adults each year in the United States. Although incident cardiac complications occur in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, their incidence, timing, risk factors, and associations with short-term mortality are not well understood.

- **Methods and results**: A total of 1,343 inpatients and 944 outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia were followed up prospectively for 30 days after presentation. Incident cardiac complications (new or worsening heart failure, new or worsening arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction) were diagnosed in 358 inpatients (26.7%) and 20 outpatients (2.1%). Although most events (89.1% in inpatients, 75% in outpatients) were diagnosed within the first week, more than half of them were recognized in the first 24 hours.

Factors associated with their diagnosis included older age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.04), nursing home residence (OR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2–2.9), history of heart failure (OR = 4.3; 95% CI, 3.0–6.3), prior cardiac arrhythmias (OR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2–2.7), previously diagnosed coronary artery disease (OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.04–2.0), arterial hypertension (OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.1), respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths per minute (OR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1–2.3), blood pH < 7.35 (OR = 3.2; 95% CI, 1.8–5.7), blood urea nitrogen ≥ 30 mg/dL (OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.2), serum sodium < 130 mmol/L (OR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.02–3.1), hematocrit < 30% (OR = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3–3.2), pleural effusion on presenting chest x-ray (OR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1–2.4), and inpatient care (OR = 4.8).

### Cardiovascular complications and short-term mortality risk in community-acquired pneumonia [^114WqBDo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Previous reports suggest that community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with an enhanced risk of cardiovascular complications. However, a contemporary and comprehensive characterization of this association is lacking.

- **Methods**: In this multicenter study, 1,182 patients hospitalized for CAP were prospectively followed for up to 30 days after their hospitalization for this infection. Study endpoints included myocardial infarction, new or worsening heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, deep venous thrombosis, cardiovascular death, and total mortality.

- **Results**: Three hundred eighty (32.2%) patients experienced intrahospital cardiovascular events (CVEs), including 281 (23.8%) with heart failure, 109 (9.2%) with atrial fibrillation, 89 (8%) with myocardial infarction, 11 (0.9%) with ischemic stroke, and 1 (0.1%) with deep venous thrombosis; 28 patients (2.4%) died for cardiovascular causes. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that intrahospital Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) class (hazard ratio [HR], 2.45, P = 0.027; HR, 4.23, P < .001; HR, 5.96, P < .001, for classes III, IV, and V vs II, respectively), age (HR, 1.02, P = 0.001), and preexisting heart failure (HR, 1.85, P < .001) independently predicted CVEs. One hundred three (8.7%) patients died by day 30 postadmission. Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in patients who developed CVEs compared with those who did not (17.6% vs 4.5%, P < .001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that intrahospital CVEs (HR, 5.49, P < .001) independently predicted 30-day mortality.

### Value of troponin testing for detection of heart disease in previously healthy children [^113AuDfF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Troponin levels are frequently obtained in pediatric patients, but the benefit remains unclear. This retrospective study included 1993 patients aged 0 to 21 years without a history of cardiac disease in whom troponin levels were obtained during clinical evaluation of both cardiac and noncardiac presentations. Troponin was elevated (≥ 0.1 ng/mL) in 182 patients (9%). A cardiac diagnosis was made in 109 (60%) of those with elevated troponin and in 208 (12%) of those without (P < 0.001).

- **Predictive value**: The positive predictive value of elevated troponin for a cardiac diagnosis was 60% for the entire cohort and 85% for patients with a cardiac presentation. The negative predictive value of nonelevated troponin was 89% for the entire cohort and 96% in patients without a cardiac presentation. Serial testing did not improve these predictive values. However, among 404 patients with initially nonelevated levels who had serial measurements, subsequent elevation was found in 80 (20%), of whom 15 (19%) had a cardiac diagnosis.

- **Optimal cutoff value**: The optimal troponin cutoff value to differentiate cardiac from noncardiac diagnosis was higher in children aged < 3 months (0.045 ng/mL) compared with those aged ≥ 3 months (0.005 ng/mL).

In conclusion, troponin can be a useful adjunctive test in the evaluation of children when the differential diagnosis includes cardiac etiologies. Serial measurement was not helpful when troponin was elevated at presentation but may merit consideration when the initial level is not elevated and there is ongoing concern about cardiac involvement.

### Screening for blunt cardiac injury: An Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma practice management guideline [^112H7tZW]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for blunt chest trauma, more specifically concerning evaluation for cardiac injury (cardiac biomarkers), the EAST 2012 guidelines recommend routinely obtaining troponin I level measurements in patients with suspected blunt cardiac injury. Patients should be admitted to a monitored setting, and serial laboratory monitoring should be conducted if the troponin I level is elevated.

### Admission cardiac diagnostic testing with electrocardiography and troponin measurement prognosticates increased 30-day mortality in COVID-19 [^115zLw8o]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

A total of 1258 patients had positive SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR tests during the study period. Of these 1258 patients, 887 had ECGs performed within 2 days of presentation or diagnosis of COVID‐19 and were included in the final study cohort. Of these 887 patients, 556 (63%) were living and never required mechanical ventilation, 123 (14%) patients were living and required mechanical ventilation, and 208 (23%) had expired at the time of data abstraction. Clinical characteristics, outcomes, and comorbidities are summarized in Table 1.

- **Patient outcomes**: This diagram demonstrates patient outcomes. One thousand two hundred and fifty‐eight patients were diagnosed with COVID‐19 from March 1 to April 3, 2020, in the study with a minimum of 30 days of follow‐up. Of those patients, 887 had an ECG performed within 2 days of presentation, after excluding 371 patients who did not have an ECG within 2 days. Of those 887 patients, 556 were living without requiring mechanical ventilation (of whom 501 had been discharged and 55 remained admitted).

123 patients were living and had required mechanical ventilation, of whom 94 remained intubated, 17 had been extubated but remained hospitalized, and 12 had been extubated and discharged from the hospital. A total of 208 patients had expired by 30 days of follow‐up. COVID‐19 indicates coronavirus disease 2019; and ED, emergency department.

### Value of troponin testing for detection of heart disease in previously healthy children [^111WxavP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Serial troponin levels were not obtained systematically. However, among 404 patients with initially non-elevated levels who had serial measurements, subsequent elevation was found in 80 (20%). Of these, 15 (19%) had a cardiac diagnosis at discharge, including cardiomyopathy in 4, probable myocarditis in 4, arrhythmia in 3, coronary anomaly in 2, other congenital heart disease in 1, and Kawasaki disease without coronary aneurysm in 1. For the entire cohort, the predictive value of elevated troponin level at any time during hospital stay (PPV, 56%; negative predictive value, 89%) was not superior to that of the level at initial presentation (PPV, 60%; negative predictive value, 89%).

Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified an optimal cutoff of 0.005 ng/mL with an area under the curve of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.67–0.75) to differentiate cardiac from non-cardiac disease in this pediatric cohort. With subgroup analysis by age, the optimal troponin cutoff value to differentiate cardiac from non-cardiac diagnosis was higher in children aged < 3 months (0.045 ng/mL) compared with children aged ≥ 3 months (0.005 ng/mL). Using this new age-based cutoff value for troponin level, the C statistic of the model to differentiate cardiac from non-cardiac diagnosis was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84–0.90).

### Implementation of a high sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay and risk of myocardial infarction or death at five years: Observational analysis of a stepped wedge, cluster randomised controlled trial [^1134GgZY]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

In practice, myocardial infarction is differentiated from other mechanisms of myocardial injury by the presence of symptoms or signs of myocardial ischaemia, or by definitive cardiac imaging. Patients with an adjudicated diagnosis of myocardial infarction who were reclassified by the high sensitivity assay in standard care, but with the results concealed, may already have been recognised as being at increased risk or in need of further assessment owing to symptoms or electrocardiographic findings. As such, there was perhaps less to gain from recognising these patients as having elevated cardiac troponin levels after high sensitivity testing, unlike those with non-ischaemic myocardial injury that may be silent and only identified by troponin testing.

Cardiac troponin is now widely recognised as a powerful independent prognostic marker in patients without type 1 myocardial infarction across a diverse range of acute cardiac and non-cardiac conditions, such as sepsis, renal failure, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, after surgical interventions, and, more recently, in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. As such, clinicians are perhaps more likely to admit patients with an elevated cardiac troponin level even after the identification of an alternative explanation for their presentation. Consistent with this, we observed that the duration of stay doubled in patients reclassified by the high sensitivity assay. Multiple studies have shown that elevated cardiac troponin concentrations are common in cardiac conditions such as chronic heart failure and more.

### Pathogenesis and management of myocardial injury in coronavirus disease 2019 [^112egwVx]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

In December 2019, a virus-associated disease, predominately characterized by pneumonia, emerged and quickly spread around the world. The disease outbreak triggered a major health crisis in many countries and is now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization. The pathogen causing COVID-19 has been attributed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS-CoV-2 is the third member of the coronavirus family known to cause life-threatening disease, following SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The morbidity and mortality rates vary in patients with COVID-19, largely depending upon underlying conditions. Elderly patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are particularly vulnerable. Globally, as of 7 July 2020, there have been 11,590,195 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 537,429 deaths, far exceeding those in previous coronavirus-related outbreaks.

SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the respiratory system and is clinically characterized by rapidly progressive pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. While much focus has been on pulmonary manifestations, it is essential to be aware of cardiovascular complications, which increase the severity and mortality of COVID-19.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes [^11231327]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to cardiac troponin, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend using an ESC algorithmic approach with serial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin measurements (0 hour/1 hour or 0 hour/2 hours) to rule in and rule out NSTEMI.

### Cardiovascular disease as a complication of community-acquired pneumonia [^112CkNpS]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Here, we review the incidence, prognosis, potential mechanisms, and therapeutic implications of cardiovascular disease in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Recent evidence suggests that a large proportion of deaths from CAP are attributable to cardiovascular disease, including sudden cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction (MI), arrhythmias, and cardiac failure. Up to one-third of patients with CAP may experience cardiovascular complications within 30 days of hospital admission, while data also suggest that CAP managed in the community is associated with an increased risk of acute MI. The risk is maximal within a few days of hospitalization with CAP and reduces over time. Most studies suggest that risk is still increased at 1 year, and some suggest risk continues to be increased at 10 years post-CAP. This clearly contributes to the well-recognized increased long-term mortality associated with CAP.

The mechanism is not entirely clear, but recent published data have better defined the impact of the host response, including systemic inflammation and platelet activation. The contribution of Streptococcus pneumoniae has also been recently investigated, with animal studies suggesting a direct effect of S. pneumoniae on the myocardium, forming microlesions that heal with resulting myocardial fibrosis. Several studies suggest a key role for the pore-forming toxin pneumolysin in S. pneumoniae-induced cardiac toxicity.

Several therapies have been shown to improve the outcomes in cardiovascular disease, but whether these would be effective…

### Association of troponin level and age with mortality in 250 000 patients: Cohort study across five UK acute care centres [^116ebNz4]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

This study examines the implications of a raised troponin level in a large sample of patients undergoing troponin testing for any clinical reason across a wide range of ages. A raised troponin level is highly clinically meaningful, regardless of age, even if only slightly above normal. The inclusion of more than 250,000 patients in this study allowed for the assessment of the prognostic power of troponin across a wide range of levels and ages.

We found that even minor increases in troponin had major prognostic implications in patients both with and without acute coronary syndromes (ACS). An unexpected inverted U-shaped relation was found between troponin level and mortality in those patients admitted to the hospital. For patients without ACS, multivariable adjustment led to a reversion to the expected direct positive relation between troponin level and mortality. In the group with ACS, the inverted U-shaped relation was present after multivariable adjustment in patients who were managed invasively, but it reverted to a direct positive relation between troponin level and mortality in patients managed non-invasively.

Interpretation of troponin results in real-life clinical practice, outside the confines of clinical trials, is often challenging. Troponin levels are measured in patients presenting to the emergency department for various reasons, not only chest pain but also a wide variety of other presentations. Consequently, sometimes the troponin test is positive in isolation, with no other indication to suggest myocardial ischaemia but with clear evidence of another condition.

### Usefulness of elevated troponin to predict death in patients with COVID-19 and myocardial injury [^1147u5me]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Elevations in troponin levels have been shown to predict mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The role of inflammation in myocardial injury remains unclear. This study sought to determine the association of elevated troponin with mortality in a large, ethnically diverse population of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Additionally, it aimed to determine the association of elevated inflammatory markers with increased troponin levels.

The study reviewed patients admitted to our health system with COVID-19 from March 1 to April 27, 2020, who had a troponin assessment within 48 hours of admission. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for mortality during hospitalization, controlling for demographics, co-morbidities, and markers of inflammation. Out of 11,159 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 6,247 had a troponin assessment within 48 hours. Of these, 4,426 (71%) patients had normal troponin levels, 919 (15%) had mildly elevated levels, and 902 (14%) had severely elevated levels.

- **Elevated inflammatory markers**: Acute phase and inflammatory markers were significantly elevated in patients with mildly and severely elevated troponin compared with normal troponin levels.

- **Increased odds of death**: Patients with elevated troponin had significantly increased odds of death for mildly elevated compared to normal troponin (adjusted OR, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.68 to 2.53; p < 0.001) and for severely elevated compared to normal troponin (OR, 4.51; 95% confidence interval, 3.66 to 5.54; p < 0.001), independently of elevation in inflammatory markers.

In conclusion, patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and elevated troponin had markedly increased mortality.

### BTS clinical statement on aspiration pneumonia [^116LA4nu]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

For community-acquired pneumonia, particularly concerning patients with aspiration pneumonia, including those receiving supportive and palliative care, the BTS 2023 guidelines recommend ensuring early access to physiotherapy. This step is suggested to reduce the risk of sputum retention or atelectasis in patients with aspiration pneumonia. It is advised to make early referrals to general, respiratory, or neurorehabilitation services as appropriate.

### Relationship between myocardial injury during index hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection and longer-term outcomes [^113uWGM6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

Myocardial injury in patients with COVID‐19 is associated with increased mortality during index hospitalization; however, the relationship to long‐term sequelae of SARS‐CoV‐2 is unknown. This study assessed the relationship between myocardial injury (high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin T level) during index hospitalization for COVID‐19 and longer‐term outcomes.

- **Methods and results**: This is a prospective cohort of patients who were hospitalized at a single center between March and May 2020 with SARS‐CoV‐2. Cardiac biomarkers were systematically collected. Outcomes were adjudicated and stratified on the basis of myocardial injury. The study cohort includes 483 patients who had high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin T data during their index hospitalization. During index hospitalization, 91 (18.8%) died, 70 (14.4%) had thrombotic complications, and 126 (25.6%) had cardiovascular complications. By 12 months, 107 (22.2%) died.

	- During index hospitalization, 301 (62.3%) had cardiac injury (high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin T ≧ 14 ng/L); these patients had 28.6%, 32.2%, and 33.2% mortality during index hospitalization, at 6 months, and at 12 months, respectively, compared with 4.1%, 4.9%, and 4.9% mortality for those with low‐level positive troponin and 0%, 0%, and 0% for those with undetectable troponin. Of 392 (81.2%) patients who survived the index hospitalization, 94 (24%) had at least 1 readmission within 12 months, of whom 61 (65%) had myocardial injury during the index hospitalization.

### Covid-19: An update and cardiac involvement [^112kVn5p]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, leading to coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related pneumonia and causing acute cardiac injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. The purpose of this review is primarily to examine COVID-19, including its pathogen, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment, with particular attention to cardiovascular involvement based on the evidence.

COVID-19 remains a threat to global public health. The associated extra-pulmonary manifestations and their prolonged consequences are frequently overlooked. Pre-existing cardiovascular disease or acute cardiac complications may contribute to adverse early clinical outcomes. At the moment, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19, but multiple randomized controlled trials (RCT) are being conducted. New supportive therapies are being evaluated with promising results.

### Redefining cardiac biomarkers in predicting mortality of inpatients with COVID-19 [^113KjftS]. Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

The prognostic power of circulating cardiac biomarkers, as well as their utility and pattern of release in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, has not been clearly defined. In this multicenter retrospective study, we enrolled 3,219 patients with diagnosed COVID-19 admitted to nine hospitals from December 31, 2019, to March 4, 2020, to estimate the associations and prognostic power of circulating cardiac injury markers with poor outcomes of COVID-19.

In the mixed-effects Cox model, after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, the adjusted hazard ratio of 28-day mortality for hs-cTnI (high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I) was 7.12 [95% CI, 4.60–11.03; P < 0.001], (NT-pro)BNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide or brain natriuretic peptide) was 5.11 [95% CI, 3.50–7.47; P < 0.001], CK (creatine phosphokinase)-MB was 4.86 [95% CI, 3.33–7.09; P < 0.001], MYO (myoglobin) was 4.50 [95% CI, 3.18–6.36; P < 0.001], and CK was 3.56 [95% CI, 2.53–5.02; P < 0.001]. The cutoffs of these cardiac biomarkers for effective prognosis of 28-day mortality of COVID-19 were found to be much lower than for regular heart disease, at about 19%-50% of the currently recommended thresholds.

Patients with elevated cardiac injury markers above the newly established cutoffs were associated with a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 death. In conclusion, cardiac biomarker elevations are significantly associated with 28-day death in patients with COVID-19. The prognostic cutoff values of these biomarkers might be much lower than the reference standards. These findings can assist in better understanding the risk evaluation for COVID-19 patients based on cardiac biomarker levels.

### Value of troponin testing for detection of heart disease in previously healthy children [^111krnQJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

During the study period, 1,993 patients met the study criteria, with a mean age of 8.4 ± 5.8 years. Among these, the presenting signs or symptoms were classified as respiratory in 611 (31%), cardiac in 561 (28%), febrile in 273 (14%), gastrointestinal in 109 (6%), and other in 439 (22%).

Troponin levels were first measured at the time of initial evaluation in 1,693 (85%) patients and during the hospital stay (more than 24 hours after admission) in 300 (15%). Troponin was elevated (≥ 0.1 ng/mL) at presentation in 182 patients and not elevated in 1,811.

- **Cardiac testing and diagnosis**: Cardiac testing performed in patients with and without elevated troponin levels is described in Table 1. A cardiac diagnosis was made in 109 (60%) of those with elevated troponin and in 208 (12%) of those without, with a significance of P < 0.001. Elevated troponin was the strongest predictor of a cardiac diagnosis at discharge in both univariate and multivariable analyses.

- **Other predictive factors**:
	- **Cardiac presentation and abnormal ECG**: Independently associated with an increased risk of cardiac diagnosis at discharge.
	- **Respiratory and febrile presentations**: Associated with a lower risk of cardiac diagnosis.

Although age was a significant predictor of cardiac diagnosis on univariate analysis, it did not remain significant after accounting for potential confounding variables. The positive predictive value (PPV) of initial elevated troponin for cardiac diagnosis was 60% for the entire cohort and 85% in patients with a cardiac presentation. The PPV of a cardiac presentation independent of troponin level was 41%. The negative predictive value of non-elevated troponin was 89%.

### Clinical characteristics and risk factors of cardiac involvement in COVID-19 [^116dHkYT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The widespread outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, previously known as 2019-nCoV) presents a significant challenge for public health and medical care. Since its first emergence in late December 2019, COVID-19 has spread to over 150 countries and territories. As of July 10, 2020, there were 12,015,193 confirmed cases worldwide, with 54,247 fatalities; the World Health Organization had declared the outbreak a pandemic. At the time of writing, several studies had reported on the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). These studies covered signs, symptoms, laboratory test results, imaging features, therapeutic strategies, effects, and multiple organ dysfunction.

Notably, acute cardiac injury — defined in literature as "TNT-HSST (hypersensitive troponin T) serum levels > 99th percentile upper reference limit (> 28 pg/mL), or new abnormalities shown in electrocardiography or echocardiography" — coupled with the European Society of Cardiology guidelines' definition of myocardial infarction, was observed in approximately 7.2% to 27.8% of COVID-19 patients in previous studies. Furthermore, both severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have been linked to acute myocarditis, acute myocardial injury, and rapid-onset heart failure. Reportedly, nearly 40% of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 have underlying comorbidities such as cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. Recently, a meta-analysis of eight studies illustrated that cardiovascular involvement is a significant concern.

### Risk of heart failure after community acquired pneumonia: Prospective controlled study with 10 years of follow-up [^113qUrXC]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Community acquired pneumonia is a common condition associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, irrespective of age. It remains the seventh leading cause of death in the United States and accounts for an estimated $9 billion (£7 billion; €8 billion) in direct healthcare costs and 600,000 admissions to the hospital each year. Although community acquired pneumonia is often considered an acute event, the long-term associated risks are substantial, with over 50% mortality over five years and a nearly twofold higher risk of subsequent pneumonia than in controls without pneumonia. Moreover, despite major advances in risk stratification and management, downstream sequelae in survivors of pneumonia have not substantively improved over the past decade.

Attention is increasingly focused on the link between pneumonia and subsequent cardiovascular diseases. Several studies have reported a clinically significant short-term risk of major cardiovascular disease after acute respiratory tract infections, although the longer-term impact of pneumonia on cardiovascular disease is less certain. Heart failure is one cardiovascular complication that seems to be highly prevalent in patients with community acquired pneumonia. The mechanism by which pneumonia may influence heart failure is multidimensional. Acute infections can result in reduced myocardial function (e.g. septic shock), increased oxygen consumption, tachycardia, and circulatory problems, which may all lead to increased cardiac workload and risk of heart failure.

### Approach to acute cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 infection [^1148ajY4]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019, otherwise known as COVID-19, is a global pandemic with primary respiratory manifestations in those who are symptomatic. It has spread to more than 187 countries with a rapidly growing number of affected patients. Underlying cardiovascular disease is associated with more severe manifestations of COVID-19 and higher rates of mortality. COVID-19 can have both primary (arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and myocarditis) and secondary (myocardial injury/biomarker elevation and heart failure) cardiac involvement. In severe cases, profound circulatory failure can result.

This review discusses the presentation and management of patients with severe cardiac complications of COVID-19 disease, with an emphasis on a heart-lung team approach in patient management. Furthermore, it focuses on the use of and indications for acute mechanical circulatory support in cardiogenic and/or mixed shock.

### Role of troponin in patients with chronic kidney disease and suspected acute coronary syndrome: A systematic review [^115c98w9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a high prevalence of elevated serum troponin levels, which makes the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) challenging.

- **Purpose**: To evaluate the utility of troponin in ACS diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis among patients with CKD.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through May 2014.

- **Study selection**: Studies examining elevated versus normal troponin levels in terms of their diagnostic performance in the detection of ACS, effect on ACS management strategies, and prognostic value for mortality or cardiovascular events after ACS among patients with CKD.

- **Data extraction**: Paired reviewers selected articles for inclusion, extracted data, and graded the strength of evidence (SOE).

- **Data synthesis**: Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria. The sensitivity of troponin T for ACS diagnosis ranged from 71% to 100%, and specificity ranged from 31% to 86%. The sensitivity and specificity of troponin I ranged from 43% to 94% and from 48% to 100%, respectively (8 studies; low SOE). No studies examined how troponin levels affect management strategies. Twelve studies analyzed prognostic value. Elevated levels of troponin I or troponin T were associated with higher risk for short-term death and cardiac events (low SOE). A similar trend was observed for long-term mortality with troponin I (low SOE), but less evidence was found for long-term cardiac events for troponin I and long-term outcomes for troponin T (insufficient SOE).

Patients with advanced CKD tended to have worse outcomes, although the text appears incomplete and cuts off abruptly.

### Interpreting troponin elevations: Do we need multiple diagnoses [^112LjfVh]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Our example patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with shortness of breath due to acute pneumonia complicating severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A transient elevation of troponin to a level three times the upper limits of normal occurred following a period of hypotension and hypoxia while he was septic. He had constant diffuse chest pains since he first felt ill, and his ECG showed atrial fibrillation with lateral T wave inversion, unchanged from prior ECGs. His shortness of breath was attributed to his pulmonary disease, and no coronary intervention was performed. He recovered to the point where he could be discharged, and further cardiac evaluation was deferred to the discretion of his primary care provider following further recovery from his acute illness. The problem is how best to describe the episode for purposes of documentation and subsequent follow-up.

There is no ICD-9 code to document myocardial injury (as evidenced by transient elevations in cardiac biomarkers) that occurs because of severe extra-cardiac problems such as sepsis, but according to the new Universal Definition of MI, this can be called a TYPE 2 MI. Having this diagnosis available is a definitive improvement compared with the 2000 ESC/ACC consensus on the redefinition of MI. The 2000 document stated that "any amount of myocardial necrosis caused by ischaemia should be labeled as MI". This statement implied that a typical rise and fall of troponin alone was adequate to make the diagnosis of acute, evolving, or recent MI.

### Esaic focused guideline for the use of cardiac biomarkers in perioperative risk evaluation [^112Lamsk]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for perioperative cardiac risk management in non-cardiac surgery, the ESAIC 2023 guidelines recommend a routine postoperative measurement of cardiac troponins. This practice helps evaluate the risk of certain adverse outcomes, particularly in predicting 30-day all-cause mortality after non-cardiac surgery (NCS). The guidelines advise considering the measurement of cardiac troponins in addition to clinical risk scores for a more comprehensive prediction of certain postoperative events.

### Value of troponin testing for detection of heart disease in previously healthy children [^113A3dmi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Troponin levels are frequently obtained in pediatric patients, but the benefit remains unclear.

- **Methods and results**: This retrospective study included 1,993 patients aged 0 to 21 years without a history of cardiac disease, in whom troponin levels were obtained during clinical evaluation of cardiac and non-cardiac presentations. Troponin was elevated (≥ 0.1 ng/mL) in 182 patients (9%). A cardiac diagnosis was made in 109 (60%) of those with elevated troponin and in 208 (12%) of those without elevated troponin (P < 0.001). The positive predictive value of elevated troponin for a cardiac diagnosis was 60% for the entire cohort and 85% for patients with a cardiac presentation. The negative predictive value of non-elevated troponin was 89% for the entire cohort and 96% in patients without a cardiac presentation.

	- Serial testing did not improve these predictive values. However, among 404 patients with initially non-elevated levels who had serial measurements, subsequent elevation was found in 80 (20%), of whom 15 (19%) had a cardiac diagnosis. The optimal troponin cutoff value to differentiate cardiac from non-cardiac diagnosis was higher in children aged less than 3 months (0.045 ng/mL) compared with those aged 3 months or older (0.005 ng/mL).

- **Conclusions**: Troponin can be a useful adjunctive test in the evaluation of children when the differential diagnosis includes cardiac etiologies. Serial measurement was not helpful when troponin was elevated at presentation but may merit consideration when the initial level is not elevated and there is ongoing concern about cardiac involvement. Lower reference values may be useful in such evaluations.

### Accuracy of routine laboratory tests to predict mortality and deterioration to severe or critical COVID-19 in people with SARS-CoV-2 [^1164WuYp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

- **Cardiac markers**: Troponin increase

Troponin I was assessed for mortality (Figure 16). The cut-off values ranged from 0.13 to 300 pg/mL across four studies. One study defined troponin I increase as values above the sex-specific 99th percentile upper reference limit. Sensitivity ranged from 12% to 98%, and specificity from 13% to 97%. At fixed specificities of 57% (Q1), 78% (median), and 88% (Q3), meta-analysis found sensitivities of 84% (95% CI 65% to 93%), 64% (95% CI 47% to 78%), and 42% (95% CI 28% to 58%), respectively.

Troponin was assessed for deterioration in four studies, which did not differentiate between troponin I or T. The cut-off values ranged from 0.35 to 20 ng/mL. One study defined troponin increase as values above the sex-specific 99th percentile upper reference limit. Sensitivity ranged from 8% to 40%, while specificity ranged from 74% to 100%. At fixed specificities of 75% (Q1), 76% (median), and 83% (Q3), meta-analysis found sensitivities of 34% (95% CI 22% to 50%), 34% (95% CI 22% to 49%), and 30% (95% CI 18% to 45%), respectively.

### Troponin and other biomarker levels and outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19: Derivation and validation of the HATCOVID-19 mortality risk score [^116Pimj9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Since its description in late 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-novel coronavirus 2 infection has evolved into a pandemic, infecting over 29 million people and resulting in more than 900,000 deaths as of September 15, 2020. Severe COVID-19 is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome as well as systemic manifestations, which include myocardial injury, cytokine storm, and coagulopathy. Myocardial injury, as defined by troponin elevation, has been described in 7.2% to 36% of patients with COVID-19 and has been associated with increased mortality. Furthermore, elevation of inflammatory markers has been associated with severe COVID-19. However, the specificity of biomarker elevation for predicting outcomes, such as arrhythmias and mortality, is not well characterized.

Using a multicenter registry, we sought to characterize the distribution of biomarker levels among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, determine the independent association between biomarker elevation and outcomes of arrhythmias and mortality, and develop a novel score that incorporates biomarker levels for estimating the risk of 30-day in-hospital mortality.

### Association of troponin level and age with mortality in 250 000 patients: Cohort study across five UK acute care centres [^111KSpCG]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

A total of 257,948 patients had troponin levels measured during the study period (2010–2017). Among these, 156,410 (60.6%) patients were admitted to the hospital with ICD-10 diagnostic codes, and 14,468 had a recorded diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

- **Flow of the study cohort**: Patients were eligible for inclusion based on the first troponin measurement during the study period, with the ICD-10 representing the international classification of diseases (10th revision).

For patients without a diagnosis of ACS, the top 10% of ICD-10 codes (i.e. most frequently recorded) were reviewed and classified into diagnostic groups (supplementary table S4). Among these patients, the coded diagnosis was cardiovascular in 20.2%, non-cardiovascular in 37.7%, and a broad range of undiagnosed multisystem symptoms in the remaining patients. The most common cardiovascular diagnoses among all patients without ACS were chronic ischaemic heart disease (4.1%), atrial fibrillation or flutter (2.6%), and heart failure (2.4%). Pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection (6.5%), gastrointestinal disorders (4.2%), and malignancy (3.7%) were the most common non-cardiovascular diagnoses in this cohort without ACS.

The median age was 65 years (interquartile range 50–79 years), and 142,718 (55.3%) of patients were men. The age distribution of the 257,948 patients in the cohort was compared with that of the general population using WHO population estimates for the UK in 2015.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114NQhP1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend empiric antibiotic therapy in the outpatient setting for patients with comorbidities. It is advised to administer combination therapy of a β-lactam (such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) and a macrolide. Options for macrolides include azithromycin 500 mg PO on the first day followed by 250 mg PO daily thereafter, clarithromycin 500 mg PO BID, or clarithromycin extended-release 1,000 mg PO once daily. Alternatively, monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone is recommended, such as levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily, moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily, or gemifloxacin 320 mg PO daily. This is advised for outpatients with CAP who have comorbidities like chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, malignancy, or asplenia.

### Troponin and other biomarker levels and outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19: Derivation and validation of the HATCOVID-19 mortality risk score [^115Wti7w]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Elevated levels of troponin and other biomarkers are common in patients hospitalized with COVID‐19. High biomarker levels are associated with hospital complications such as intensive care unit admission, respiratory failure, arrhythmias, and death. Importantly, high troponin levels are a particularly potent predictor of 30‐day in‐hospital mortality. The use of a simple risk score, which incorporates troponin levels, age, and the presence of hypoxia on presentation, can help stratify patients at risk for in‐hospital mortality associated with COVID‐19.

### Cardiac injury patterns and inpatient outcomes among patients admitted with COVID-19 [^116wKFjX]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Although certain risk factors have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients admitted with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the impact of cardiac injury and high-sensitivity troponin-I (hs-cTnI) concentrations are not well described. In this large retrospective longitudinal cohort study, we analyzed the cases of 1,044 consecutively admitted patients with COVID-19 from March 9 until April 15. Cardiac injury was defined by hs-cTnI concentration > 99th percentile.

Patient characteristics, laboratory data, and outcomes were described in patients with cardiac injury and different hs-cTnI cut-offs. The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcomes were length of stay, need for intensive care unit care or mechanical ventilation, and their different composites. The final analyzed cohort included 1,020 patients.

The median age was 63 years, 511 (50%) patients were female, and 403 (40%) were white. 390 (38%) patients had cardiac injury on presentation. These patients were older (median age 70 years) and had a higher cardiovascular disease burden, in addition to higher serum concentrations of inflammatory markers. They also exhibited an increased risk for our primary and secondary outcomes, with the risk increasing with higher hs-cTnI concentrations.

Peak hs-cTnI concentrations continued to be significantly associated with mortality after multivariate regression controlling for comorbid conditions, inflammatory markers, acute kidney injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Within the same multivariate regression model, presenting hs-cTnI co.

### A novel biochemical marker for community-acquired pneumonia: Ischemia-modified albumin [^112djuuS]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a frequent cause of hospitalization and a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early diagnosis and the initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential to reduce pneumonia-related morbidity and mortality. CRP is a well-established biomarker in many clinical settings, but it has been traditionally considered not specific enough to be a useful guide in the diagnostic process of pneumonia. There is still a need for more specific and practical markers in CAP for diagnosis. This study investigated the diagnostic value of ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) levels in the diagnosis of CAP in the Emergency Department.

- **Methods**: The study included 81 patients admitted with CAP and 81 control patients. Initial hour levels of IMA and CRP were measured. The IMA mean levels were compared between the study and control group. Correlation analyses were performed to investigate the association of serum IMA levels with CRP.

- **Results**: Mean levels of IMA were 0.532 ± 0.117 IU/ml in the study group and 0.345 ± 0.082 IU/ml in the control group. IMA levels were significantly higher in the study group compared to the control group. The IMA level of 0.442 IU/ml had a sensitivity of 75.3% and specificity of 91.3% and was positively correlated with CRP levels (r = 0.506; p < 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: Blood IMA levels significantly increase in adult patients presenting with CAP. IMA may be considered as a novel biomarker in the diagnosis of CAP.

An increase in CK levels in the blood can indicate muscle or heart damage. For deterioration (8 studies), the cut-off values ranged from 92.5 to 308 U/L. Sensitivity ranged from 19% to 87% and specificity ranged from 66% to 91%. At a fixed specificity of 78% (Q1), 86% (median), and 87% (Q3), meta-analysis found a sensitivity of 61% (95% CI 29% to 86%), 38% (95% CI 14% to 70%), and 35% (95% CI 12% to 68%), respectively.

- **Comparisons between tests**: For the target condition of mortality, we found five tests with median specificity and corresponding summary sensitivity, including their 95% CI, above 50%. These were CRP increase, d-dimer increase, LDH increase, lymphocyte count decrease, and NLR increase. For deterioration, we found the same five tests with median specificity and corresponding summary sensitivity, including their 95% CI, above 50%. For the combined outcome, we found two tests with median specificity and corresponding summary sensitivity, including their 95% CI, above 50%. The tests were d-dimer increase and LDH increase. The test accuracies of these index tests were compared with a direct, head-to-head comparison (i.e. assessed two of the biomarkers in the same participants) and an indirect comparison, in which all studies reporting on these tests were included.

### Reduced cardiac function is associated with cardiac injury and mortality risk in hospitalized COVID-19 patients [^113ZtByn]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

COVID-19 is caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of October 1, 2020, more than 34 million people worldwide have been infected, and over 1 million have died. The complex pathophysiology of COVID-19, which includes cell death due to intracellular multiplication of the virus, hypercoagulability, and cytokine storm, contributes to a wide array of complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, as well as complex cardiac injury.

Many cardiac features have been reported, including a high prevalence of cardiac troponin elevation due to myocarditis or acute coronary syndrome, pericardial effusion, and cardiac thromboembolism. Troponin elevation in COVID-19 patients has been linked to adverse clinical outcomes. Additionally, abnormal cardiac function by echocardiography has been reported and is associated with biomarkers of cardiac injury. It remains largely unknown if reduced cardiac function is associated with biomarkers of cardiac injury and with adverse clinical outcomes.

In this retrospective study, we aim to examine cardiac function by echocardiography in hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with and without cardiac injury, and associations with mortality.

### Troponin and other biomarker levels and outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19: Derivation and validation of the HATCOVID-19 mortality risk score [^112JX3JC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

The distribution of maximum biomarker levels among study patients is depicted in Figure 1.

Troponin I (TnI) levels are shown using a logarithmic scale to depict the distribution between 0 and 1.0 ng/mL. A dotted line marks the TnI level at 0.50 ng/mL. B-type Natriuretic Protein (BNP) levels are shown where patients with BNP ≥ 2000 pg/mL are grouped together. C-reactive Protein (CRP) levels are depicted, grouping patients with CRP ≥ 200 mg/dL. Ferritin values show patients with ferritin ≥ 2000 ng/mL grouped together. Lastly, D-dimer levels are demonstrated. BNP represents B-type natriuretic protein, CRP is C-reactive protein, and TnI indicates troponin I.

- **Biomarker elevation and imaging diagnostics and treatment**: The radiographic and echocardiographic findings of patients stratified by the presence of severe biomarker elevation are summarized in Table 2. Compared with patients without severe ferritin level elevation, those with ferritin levels ≥ 200 ng/mL showed increased prevalence of abnormal chest radiographs and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Among patients who received echocardiograms, those with BNP ≥ 300 pg/nL had lower left ventricular ejection fractions and a higher prevalence of right ventricular dysfunction than patients with BNP < 300 pg/nL. There was no significant difference in left ventricular ejection fraction or right ventricular function between patients with or without severe elevation of the other biomarkers. A comparison of antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapy administered to patients with or without severe biomarker elevation is summarized in Table 3.

### Use of troponin as a screen for chest pain in the pediatric emergency department [^111UMfrv]. Pediatric Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Troponin levels are commonly employed in the assessment of adults presenting with chest pain or concern for coronary ischemia. However, the utility of troponin measurements in children is not well defined. The purpose of this study was to review the use and clinical yield of serum troponin assay in a large pediatric emergency department (ED). We identified all patients under 22 years of age, not previously known to have cardiac disease, who presented with chest pain and whose troponin levels were evaluated in our pediatric ED during a 7-year period. Test results were correlated to patient factors, such as chief complaint, cardiac history, diagnostic workup, and discharge diagnoses.

Of the 212 study patients who presented with chest pain, troponin levels were increased (≥ 0.1 ng/ml) in 37 (17%) subjects. The disposition for these 37 subjects included: transfer to an adult facility (n = 6), admission to our pediatric inpatient service (n = 27), and discharge to home from the ED (n = 10). Only one subject had an acute myocardial infarction. For those with increased troponin levels, 18 of 37 (48%) cases were attributed to a primary cardiac diagnosis, with the most common discharge diagnosis being myocarditis or pericarditis.

In the pediatric ED setting, selective use of the troponin assay may be a useful test in the management of patients with chest pain. Most cases of increased troponin level related to chest pain represent myocarditis, which is often mild and self-resolving. Given the low likelihood that acute coronary syndrome is the etiology of chest pain, immediate transfer to an adult facility for further management is generally unnecessary.

### Acute pneumonia and the cardiovascular system [^1161XhJC]. Lancet (2013). Low credibility.

Although traditionally regarded as a disease confined to the lungs, acute pneumonia has important effects on the cardiovascular system at all severities of infection. Pneumonia tends to affect individuals who are also at high cardiovascular risk. Results of recent studies show that about a quarter of adults admitted to hospital with pneumonia develop a major acute cardiac complication during their hospital stay, which is associated with a 60% increase in short-term mortality. These findings suggest that outcomes of patients with pneumonia can be improved by prevention of the development and progression of associated cardiac complications. Before this hypothesis can be tested, however, an adequate mechanistic understanding of the cardiovascular changes that occur during pneumonia, and their role in the trigger of various cardiac complications, is needed. In this review, we summarize knowledge about the burden of cardiac complications in adults with acute pneumonia, the cardiovascular response to this infection, the potential effects of commonly used cardiovascular and anti-infective drugs on these associations, and possible directions for future research.

### Management of acute compartment syndrome [^117WhovW]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute compartment syndrome, specifically concerning serum biomarkers, the AAOS 2020 guidelines recommend considering measuring troponin levels to assist in diagnosing ACS in patients with traumatic lower extremity injury.

### Diagnosing the cause of chest pain [^117TdBEW]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Chest pain presents a diagnostic challenge in outpatient family medicine. Noncardiac causes are common, but it is important not to overlook serious conditions such as an acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, or pneumonia. In addition to a thorough history and physical examination, most patients should have a chest radiograph and an electrocardiogram. Patients with chest pain that is predictably exertional, with electrocardiogram abnormalities, or with cardiac risk factors should be evaluated further with measurement of troponin levels and cardiac stress testing.

- **Risk assessment**: Risk of pulmonary embolism can be determined with a simple prediction rule, and a D-dimer assay can help determine whether further evaluation with helical computed tomography or venous ultrasound is needed.

- **Pneumonia indicators**: Fever, egophony, and dullness to percussion suggest pneumonia, which can be confirmed with chest radiograph.

Although some patients with chest pain have heart failure, this is unlikely in the absence of dyspnea; a brain natriuretic peptide level measurement can clarify the diagnosis. Pain reproducible by palpation is more likely to be musculoskeletal than ischemic. Chest pain also may be associated with panic disorder, for which patients can be screened with a two-item questionnaire. Clinical prediction rules can help clarify many of these diagnoses.

### Extrapulmonary clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients [^113mPueP]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

There are positive correlations between the levels of cardiac biomarkers and the severity of COVID-19 infection, which indicate the prognostic value of these biomarkers. As the National Health Commission (NHC) of China announced, cardiovascular manifestations are even more tangible among patients than other clinical manifestations. It has been reported that 11.8% of COVID-19 patients without a history of cardiovascular disease present heart damage with elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest during hospitalization. A study on 75 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV infection revealed that 40% of fatalities occurred following a myocardial infarction. Huang et al. demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2–associated myocardial injury occurred in five of 41 patients and was manifested as an increase in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test (hs-cTnI) levels (> 28 pg/mL). Among these five patients, ICU management was required in four, indicating the severe nature of the myocardial injury presented by COVID-19 patients.

According to a study on 187 COVID-19 patients by Guo et al. it was demonstrated that the level of troponin was elevated in 27.8% of cases. During hospitalization, patients with elevated troponin T (TnT) levels developed complications more frequently, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (57.7% versus 11.9%), malignant ventricular arrhythmias (11.5% versus 5.2%), acute coagulopathy (65.8% versus 20.0%), and acute kidney injury (AKI) (36.8% versus 4.7%) than patients with normal TnT levels.

### Acute myocardial infarction in hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^115vBsTj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

An epidemiological link between respiratory infection and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been suggested, and recent data indicate that there is an association between AMI and pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospitalized patients. The objective of this study was to investigate the association of AMI with the severity of pneumonia at hospitalization and clinical failure during hospitalization among patients with CAP.

- **Methods**: An observational, retrospective study involving consecutive patients hospitalized with CAP was performed at the Veterans Hospital of Louisville, Kentucky. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit were defined as having severe CAP. Clinical failure was defined as the development of respiratory failure or shock. AMI was diagnosed on the basis of abnormal troponin levels and electrocardiogram findings. Propensity-adjusted models that controlled for clinical and nonclinical factors were used to investigate the association between AMI and pneumonia severity index and between AMI and clinical failure.

- **Results**: Data for a total of 500 patients were studied. At hospital admission, AMI was present in 13 (15%) of 86 patients with severe CAP. During hospitalization, AMI was present in 13 (20%) of 65 patients who experienced clinical failure. Following risk adjustment, significant associations were discovered between AMI and the pneumonia severity index score (modeled with a restricted cubic spline) (P = 0.05) and between AMI and clinical failure (P = 0.04).

- **Conclusions**: A combined diagnosis of CAP and AMI is common among hospitalized patients, indicating a significant clinical concern.

### Elevated troponin in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: Possible mechanisms [^112FuShy]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2020). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that has affected more than 1.8 million people worldwide, overwhelming health care systems due to the high proportion of critical presentations, and resulting in more than 100,000 deaths. Since the initial data analyses in China, elevated cardiac troponin levels have been observed in a substantial proportion of patients, indicating myocardial injury as a possible pathogenic mechanism contributing to severe illness and mortality. High troponin levels are associated with increased mortality in patients with COVID-19. This brief review explores the available evidence regarding the association between COVID-19 and myocardial injury.

### Interpreting troponin elevations: Do we need multiple diagnoses [^112tkSRk]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

A descriptive term such as 'secondary MI' would have several advantages over type 2 MI. New, clinically relevant myocardial dysfunction is often not evident, and the term secondary myocardial injury does not imply significant scarring as does the term MI. Thus, our COPD/pneumonia patient need not be told he had a 'heart attack' as a complication of his pneumonia. Rather, he could be told that his blood tests indicated his heart was under severe stress when he was sick, and (if clinically indicated) follow-up tests may be warranted. In essence, the findings could be treated as a positive cardiac stress test.

Adopting a descriptive approach to the new diagnostic scheme might also help in describing the other proposed categories of MI. As noted by the task force, problems exist when interpreting troponin elevations in other specific clinical settings apart from those patients acutely ill from non-cardiac diseases. Surgical patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, or patients having elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), can have some biomarker elevation even with a very successful procedure. For example, due to micro-emboli in the case of PCI or direct needle damage to the myocardium in the case of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Damage (usually more severe) can also occur due to dissection of a coronary artery (PCI), graft occlusion (CABG), or other coronary event. As such, criteria are needed to differentiate between relatively minor injuries that could be expected even with a successful procedure, and damage indicative of what should clearly be considered as more severe.

### Community-acquired pneumonia patients at risk for early and long-term cardiovascular events are identified by cardiac biomarkers [^1167vPNV]. Chest (2019). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) increases the risk of cardiovascular complications during and following the episode. The goal of this study was to determine the usefulness of cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarkers for assessing the risk of early (within 30 days) or long-term (1-year follow-up) cardiovascular events.

- **Methods**: A total of 730 hospitalized patients with CAP were prospectively followed up during 1 year. Cardiovascular (proadrenomedullin [proADM], pro-B-type natriuretic peptide [proBNP], proendothelin-1, and troponin T) and inflammatory (interleukin 6 [IL-6], C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin) biomarkers were measured on day 1, at day 4/5, and at day 30.

- **Results**: Ninety-two patients developed an early event, and 67 developed a long-term event. Significantly higher initial levels of proADM, proendothelin-1, troponin, proBNP, and IL-6 were recorded in patients who developed cardiovascular events. Despite a decrease at day 4/5, levels remained steady until day 30 in those who developed late events. Biomarkers (days 1 and 30) independently predicted cardiovascular events adjusted for age, previous cardiac disease, Pao2/Fio2 < 250 mm Hg, and sepsis. The odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for early events were: proendothelin-1, 2.25 (1.34–3.79); proADM, 2.53 (1.53–4.20); proBNP, 2.67 (1.59–4.49); and troponin T, 2.70 (1.62–4.49). For late events, the ORs (95% CIs) were: proendothelin-1, 3.13 (1.41–7.80); proADM, 2.29 (1.01–5.19); and proBNP, 2.34 (1.01–5.56). Addition of IL-6 levels at day 30 to proendothelin-1 or proADM increased the ORs to 3.53 and 2.80, respectively.

### Cardiac biomarker-based risk stratification algorithm in patients with severe COVID-19 [^116YkQ6E]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Low credibility.

Cardiac biomarkers like cardiac troponins and natriuretic peptides are elevated in a substantial proportion of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We propose an algorithmic approach using cardiac biomarkers to triage, risk-stratify, and prognosticate patients with severe COVID-19.

- **Methods**: We systematically searched the PubMed and Google Scholar databases until May 31, 2020, and accessed the available data on the role of cardiac biomarkers in patients with COVID-19.

- **Results**: COVID-19 is associated with acute cardiac injury in around 7–28% of patients, significantly increasing its associated complications and mortality. Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are more prone to develop acute cardiac injury as a result of COVID-19. The use of cardiac biomarkers may aid in differentiating the cardiac cause of dyspnea in patients with severe COVID-19. Cardiac biomarkers may also aid in triaging, risk-stratification, clinical decision-making, and prognostication of patients with COVID-19. However, there are concerns that routine testing in all patients with COVID-19, irrespective of severity, may result in unnecessary downstream investigations which may be misleading. In this brief review, using an algorithmic approach, we have tried to rationalize the use of cardiac biomarkers among patients with severe COVID-19. This approach is also likely to lessen the infection exposure risk to the cardiovascular team attending to patients with severe COVID-19.

- **Conclusion**: It appears beneficial to triage, risk-stratify, and prognosticate patients with severe COVID-19 using cardiac biomarkers.

### Troponin: Think before you request one [^111GQEke]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Measurement of cardiac troponin (cTn) has revolutionized the evaluation and management of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Recent consensus statements endorse the use of cTnI or cTnT as the biomarker of choice for such application. Elevated cTn values outside of ACS are not uncommon and reflect cardiomyocyte necrosis from a wide array of cardiac, pulmonary, and systemic diseases. A clinician must be familiar with the broad differential diagnosis of an elevated cTn to avoid false attribution of "acute myocardial infarction" (MI) in a patient without an ACS, thus reducing the burden of unnecessary work and admission rates for the hospital.

Another aspect of the problem is the financial impact of haphazardly testing in hospitals that are part of an NHS, which is already struggling to keep up with its demands and supplies at present. Under observation, it was noted that in most cases, a troponin request was just a routine "tick box" practice that led to a lot of unnecessary processing. This then led to requesting these tests even before the patient was assessed by a clinician.

It was also identified that troponin was often being used as a differentiating tool with the aim of providing a conclusion in the absence of an appropriate clinical history or examination that should be the mainstay in any clinical scenario. An improvement project specifically focusing on such potentially avoidable and otherwise quite useful investigations can be of great value for the hospital trust, as well as allowing the NHS to keep up with its aim of better quality with low resource utilization.

### Impact and determinants of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin-T concentration in patients with COVID-19 admitted to critical care [^111yv1KD]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Cardiac Troponin (hs-TnT) elevation has been reported in unselected patients hospitalized with COVID-19; however, the mechanism and relationship with mortality remain unclear. Consecutive patients admitted to a high-volume intensive care unit (ICU) in London with severe COVID-19 pneumonitis were included if the hs-TnT concentration at admission was known. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed, with cohorts classified a priori by multiples of the upper limit of normal (ULN). During a 7-week period in 2020, 277 patients were admitted; 176 were included (90% received invasive ventilation). The hs-TnT at admission was 16.5 (9.0 to 49.3) ng/L, with 56% having concentrations > ULN. Fifty-six patients (31.8%) died during the index admission. Admission hs-TnT level was lower in survivors (12.0 [8.0–27.8] vs. 28.5 [14.0 to 81.0] ng/L, p = 0.001).

- **Univariate predictors of mortality**: Age, APACHE-II Score, and admission hs-TnT (HR 1.73, p = 0.007).
- **Multivariate regression**: Only age was significant (HR 1.33, CI: 1.16 to 1.51, p ULN [log-rank p-value < 0.001]).

Peak hs-TnT was higher in those who died but was not predictive of death after adjustment for other factors. In conclusion, in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis, the hs-TnT level at admission is a powerful independent predictor of the likelihood of surviving to discharge from ICU. In most cases, hs-TnT elevation does not represent major myocardial injury but acts as a sensitive integrated biomarker of global risk.

### Platelet activation is associated with myocardial infarction in patients with pneumonia [^115inRYf]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Troponins may be elevated in patients with pneumonia, but associations with myocardial infarction (MI) and with platelet activation are still undefined. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between troponin elevation and in vivo markers of platelet activation in the early phase of hospitalization of patients affected by community-acquired pneumonia.

A total of 278 consecutive patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia, who were followed up until discharge, were included. At admission, platelet activation markers such as plasma soluble P-selectin, soluble CD40 ligand, and serum thromboxane B2 (TxB2) were measured. Serum high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels and electrocardiograms were obtained every 12 and 24 hours, respectively.

Among 144 patients with elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, 31 had signs of MI and 113 did not. Baseline plasma levels of soluble P-selectin and soluble CD40 ligand and serum TxB2 were significantly higher in patients who developed signs of MI. Logistic regression analysis showed plasma soluble CD40 ligand (p < 0.001), soluble P-selectin (p < 0.001), serum TxB2 (p = 0.030), mean platelet volume (p = 0.037), Pneumonia Severity Index score (p = 0.030), and ejection fraction (p = 0.001) to be independent predictors of MI. There were no significant differences in MI rate between the 123 patients (45%) taking aspirin (100 mg/day) and those who were not aspirin-treated (12% vs. 10%; p = 0.649). Aspirin-treated patients with MIs had higher serum TxB2 compared with non-aspirin-treated patients.

### Early detection of elevated cardiac biomarkers to optimise risk stratification in patients with COVID-19 [^1134hP7g]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

Risk stratification is crucial to optimize treatment strategies in patients with COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the impact on mortality of an early assessment of cardiac biomarkers in patients with COVID-19. Humanitas Clinical and Research Hospital in Rozzano, Milan, Lombardy, Italy, is a tertiary center converted for the management of COVID-19. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were entered into a dedicated database for cohort observational analyses.

Outcomes were stratified according to elevated levels, i.e. above the upper level of normal, of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-TnI), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), or both, measured within 24 hours after hospital admission. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality.

A total of 397 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were included up to 1 April 2020. At the time of hospital admission, 208 patients (52.4%) had normal values for cardiac biomarkers, 90 (22.7%) had elevated levels of both hs-TnI and BNP, 59 (14.9%) had elevated levels of only BNP, and 40 (10.1%) had elevated levels of only hs-TnI. The rate of mortality was higher in patients with elevated hs-TnI (22.5%, OR 4.35, 95%CI 1.72 to 11.04), BNP (33.9%, OR 7.37, 95%CI 3.53 to 16.75), or both (55.6%, OR 18.75, 95%CI 9.32 to 37.71) compared with those without elevated cardiac biomarkers (6.25%). A multivariate analysis identified the concomitant elevation of both hs-TnI and BNP as a strong independent predictor of all-cause mortality (OR 3.24, 95%CI 1.06 to 9.93).

In conclusion, early detection of elevated hs-TnI and BNP predicts mortality in patients with COVID-19.

### Cardiac diseases complicating community-acquired pneumonia [^1134ueDP]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The aim is to evaluate basic mechanisms, prevalence, risk factors, outcomes, and potential treatments of cardiovascular events (CVEs) in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

- **Recent findings**: In this review, we present a new model to evaluate the pathophysiology of cardiac disease in patients with pneumonia based on plaque-related events, such as acute myocardial infarction, versus plaque-unrelated events, such as arrhythmias and heart failure. CAP increases the risk for both plaque-related and plaque-unrelated events, with an absolute rate of CVE across different cohorts that varies broadly from 10% to 30%. These complications may occur among both ambulatory patients and inpatients, either on admission or during hospitalization, and/or after discharge. CVEs represent a major cause for increased mortality in CAP patients, contributing to more than 30% of deaths at long-term follow-up.

From a clinical perspective, especially during the first 24 hours after hospitalization, CAP patients should be tested for the probability of having or developing a cardiac event during hospitalization. From a research point of view, there is an urgent need to prospectively evaluate cardioprotective interventions.

### Relationship between myocardial injury during index hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection and longer-term outcomes [^112Xrv92]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

Myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19 is associated with increased mortality during index hospitalization; however, the relationship to long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. This study assessed the relationship between myocardial injury (high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T level) during index hospitalization for COVID-19 and longer-term outcomes.

- **Methods and results**: This is a prospective cohort of patients who were hospitalized at a single center between March and May 2020 with SARS-CoV-2. Cardiac biomarkers were systematically collected. Outcomes were adjudicated and stratified on the basis of myocardial injury. The study cohort includes 483 patients who had high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T data during their index hospitalization.

During index hospitalization, 91 (18.8%) died, 70 (14.4%) had thrombotic complications, and 126 (25.6%) had cardiovascular complications. By 12 months, 107 (22.2%) died.

During index hospitalization, 301 (62.3%) had cardiac injury (high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T≧14 ng/L); these patients had 28.6%, 32.2%, and 33.2% mortality during index hospitalization, at 6 months, and at 12 months, respectively, compared with 4.1%, 4.9%, and 4.9% mortality for those with low-level positive troponin and 0%, 0%, and 0% for those with undetectable troponin. Of 392 (81.2%) patients who survived the index hospitalization, 94 (24%) had at least 1 readmission within 12 months, of whom 61 (65%) had myocardial injury during the index hospitalization.

### Usefulness of procalcitonin levels in community-acquired pneumonia according to the patients outcome research team pneumonia severity index [^114rdp4x]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

To evaluate the usefulness of procalcitonin serum levels as a predictor of etiology and prognosis in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), the study stratified patients according to severity. This was designed as a one-year, population-based, prospective study conducted at a university teaching hospital. The study included all adult patients diagnosed with CAP throughout the study period.

An extensive noninvasive microbiological workup was performed. In patients who provided informed consent, a blood sample was collected at the time of CAP diagnosis to measure biological markers. Procalcitonin levels were measured using a commercially available monoclonal immunoluminometric assay with a detection limit of 0.1 μg/L. Patients were classified by microbial diagnosis, Patients Outcome Research Team pneumonia severity index (PSI), and outcome measures, and procalcitonin levels were compared among groups.

Of the 240 patients diagnosed with CAP during the study period, procalcitonin concentrations were measured in 185 patients (77.1%). Levels were higher in patients with high-severity risk classes (PSI classes III-V) [p = 0.01] and in those with complications [p = 0.03] or death. A procalcitonin level of ≥ 0.15 μg/L was more frequently found in patients with bacterial pneumonia than in those with nonbacterial pneumonia.

### Serial troponin for early detection of nivolumab cardiotoxicity in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients [^114EAkMa]. The Oncologist (2018). Low credibility.

Rare cases of severe myocarditis are reported during treatment with nivolumab. Troponin, a biomarker of cardiac damage, is a key component of the diagnostic workup of many cardiac disorders, including myocarditis. This study investigates the role of troponin to assess cardiac involvement during nivolumab therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

- **Materials and methods**: We evaluated 59 NSCLC patients, analyzing serum samples collected within a translational research study. Troponin above the upper normal limit (0.046 ng/mL) was defined as Tn+, whereas normal but detectable troponin (0.015–0.045 ng/mL) was defined as Tn det. Troponin alterations were interpreted based on the following elements: peak values and time curve, cardiac comorbidities, signs and symptoms coincident with troponin elevation, ECG, echocardiography, and disease progression.

- **Results**: No patient had cardiovascular events. Among 362 available blood samples, Tn+ (max 0.317 ng/mL) was found in 13 determinations belonging to 6 patients. Seven other patients had isolated Tn det. In five patients, Tn+ was attributed to cardiac comorbidities, disease progression, or worsening clinical status. One patient without cardiac history and in good clinical condition had a sustained troponin increase soon after the start of therapy; after careful evaluation of all relevant elements, it was interpreted as a marker of nivolumab-related subclinical myocarditis.

- **Conclusion**: Tn+ may occur in NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab, but in most cases it does not indicate nivolumab cardiotoxicity.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: Evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^113GPby9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

While the new assays can provide more accurate, rapid detection of myocardial necrosis, they do not indicate the cause of cell death. Improved assay performance will have to be accompanied by improved clinical evaluation of patients to effectively interpret the results and apply them in clinical practice. The universal definition of myocardial infarction was a broad consensus developed by representatives from the American College of Cardiology Foundation, European Society of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and World Heart Federation that provided increased structure and clarity around the diagnosis of myocardial infarction in the era of a troponin gold standard. Importantly, it firmly established the importance of clinical symptoms in conjunction with elevated troponin levels occurring with a characteristic rise and/or fall to establish type 1 myocardial infarction. It also allowed for diagnosis in the setting of sudden cardiac death, as well as enhanced categorization for periprocedural myocardial infarctions.

As the sensitivity and precision of troponin assays have improved, false-positive results due to assay imprecision are becoming less of a problem. However, the pressure on clinical perspective in the interpretation of positive troponin results has increased, given that there is a large differential diagnosis generated by a positive troponin assay.
