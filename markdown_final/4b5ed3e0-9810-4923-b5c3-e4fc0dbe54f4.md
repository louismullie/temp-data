## Question

What laboratory tests are part of an iron panel?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what laboratory tests are part of an "iron panel". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether an "iron panel" is standardized across settings. Then, I should define the core direct iron studies. Next, I will consider essential hematologic context tests. After that, I need to review context-specific extensions for CKD, hemochromatosis, and heart failure. Finally, I will synthesize a practical hierarchy of panels and deliver a concise answer tailored to clinical use cases.

> Let me first confirm whether "iron panel" is a fixed bundle or a flexible construct. At first glance, I might assume it is universally standardized, but wait, let me verify — guidelines and lab practice vary by indication and institution, so an "iron panel" often refers to a set of complementary tests assessing iron stores, transport, and functional availability rather than a rigid order set, which means composition should be tailored to clinical context such as anemia workup, CKD management, or hemochromatosis screening [^114N2wZa] [^112sp2gt] [^114Mor4a] [^116Lx6Vz].

> I will now examine the core direct iron studies. I need to ensure I prioritize serum ferritin correctly because multiple guidelines identify it as the primary marker of iron stores, with very low ferritin levels being highly specific for deficiency, though it is confounded by inflammation, so CRP context matters; this aligns with BSG 2021 and is reinforced by high-quality evidence showing ferritin's strong diagnostic value despite acute-phase behavior, so I should state ferritin as foundational while emphasizing inflammatory confounding and the need for adjunct markers when inflammation is present [^114N2wZa] [^1157g8j4] [^115WFgXM].

> Next, I should review transferrin saturation and its components. Hold on, I should verify calculation and role: TSAT equals serum iron divided by TIBC (or derived from transferrin), multiplied by 100, and together with ferritin forms the first-line biochemical assessment in suspected iron overload and many anemia algorithms; serum iron is variable diurnally and by inflammation, but measuring iron plus TIBC or transferrin enables TSAT, which several guidelines use as a key discriminator for iron availability or overload risk, particularly in hemochromatosis and RLS evaluations [^116VTxiw] [^114Mor4a] [^113hLU7z].

> Let me consider essential hematologic context. I should confirm that a complete blood count with indices is routinely paired with iron studies to define anemia and characterize microcytosis and hypochromia; importantly, MCH may be more reliable than MCV for iron deficiency, and both lose specificity in chronic disease or hemoglobinopathy, so interpretation must be cautious; reticulocyte parameters, especially reticulocyte hemoglobin, help assess real-time iron delivery to erythropoiesis and are prioritized in CKD where inflammation inflates ferritin, with absolute reticulocyte count informing marrow response [^116Ln8KB] [^112sp2gt].

> Wait, let me verify CKD-specific functional tests and inflammatory context. The UKKA 2025 update emphasizes reticulocyte hemoglobin or percentage of hypochromic red cells as preferred functional markers when feasible, with CRP recommended to contextualize ferritin in inflammatory states; if functional markers are unavailable or contraindicated (e.g., thalassemia), a combination of TSAT and ferritin is acceptable, which means my panel composition in CKD should deliberately shift toward functional indices and inflammation assessment [^112sp2gt].

> Next, I should review supplementary tests for diagnostic uncertainty. I need to check that soluble transferrin receptor and the sTfR/log ferritin index increase specificity in mixed or inflammatory states, though availability is often limited; red cell zinc protoporphyrin rises when iron is unavailable for heme synthesis; and when microcytosis persists with normal iron studies, hemoglobin electrophoresis should be considered to exclude thalassemia, thereby preventing unnecessary GI investigations; these are key "extended" elements for equivocal cases [^113DECq2] [^116Ln8KB].

> I will now examine the hemochromatosis use case to ensure alignment. For suspected hereditary hemochromatosis, first-line testing is ferritin plus transferrin saturation — often fasting in earlier guidance — with HFE genetic testing pursued after biochemical confirmation; in confirmed C282Y homozygotes, ancillary assessments such as CBC and LFTs are recommended, while biopsy or MRI is reserved for staging rather than initial diagnosis in contemporary practice; so in this context, the "iron panel" is intentionally focused on ferritin and TSAT, with targeted follow-on testing [^113LCxUQ] [^114Mor4a] [^115gFMow].

> But wait, what about heart failure populations where iron deficiency has prognostic impact independent of anemia? I should confirm that ESC 2021 advises periodic screening with CBC, ferritin, and TSAT in all HF patients, which operationally defines a minimal iron panel for this group and underscores why interpretation must consider both hematologic and functional iron status in chronic disease [^116Lx6Vz].

> Hold on, let me synthesize a practical hierarchy without overcomplicating. A basic panel for initial screening can consist of ferritin plus TSAT (calculated from iron and TIBC or transferrin); a standard diagnostic panel adds a CBC with indices to define anemia and red cell morphology; a comprehensive panel further includes reticulocyte parameters and CRP to capture functional iron restriction and inflammatory confounding; and an extended panel, used when results are equivocal or mixed etiologies are suspected, incorporates sTfR, the sTfR/log ferritin index, zinc protoporphyrin, and, when indicated, hemoglobin electrophoresis for thalassemia evaluation, with context-driven tailoring for CKD, HF, or hemochromatosis [^114N2wZa] [^112sp2gt] [^114Mor4a] [^116Lx6Vz] [^116Ln8KB] [^113DECq2].

> Final answer: I should double-check that I clearly name the tests. A standard "iron panel" centers on serum ferritin, transferrin saturation derived from serum iron and total iron-binding capacity or transferrin, serum iron, and TIBC or transferrin, interpreted alongside a complete blood count with hemoglobin, MCH, and MCV; many clinical scenarios benefit from reticulocyte count and reticulocyte hemoglobin, with CRP to interpret ferritin in inflammatory states, and, in CKD, percentage of hypochromic red cells when available; extended evaluations may include soluble transferrin receptor with the sTfR/log ferritin index, red cell zinc protoporphyrin, and hemoglobin electrophoresis when microcytosis persists despite normal iron studies; for hemochromatosis screening, ferritin and TSAT are the first step, followed by HFE testing if indicated; for heart failure, routine CBC, ferritin, and TSAT are recommended, so the exact composition should be tailored to the clinical question and comorbidity profile [^114N2wZa] [^116VTxiw] [^112sp2gt] [^114Mor4a] [^113LCxUQ] [^116Lx6Vz] [^116Ln8KB] [^113DECq2].

The core iron studies panel includes **serum iron, ferritin, transferrin or TIBC, and transferrin saturation (TSAT)** [^114CUyEC] [^114Mor4a], with ferritin the most specific marker of iron stores [^114N2wZa] and TSAT the key indicator of iron availability [^116ANoLV]. CBC with red cell indices (MCV, MCH) [^116Ln8KB] is essential to assess **anemia type and severity** [^114CUyEC]; **reticulocyte hemoglobin (Ret-He)** [^112rkjre] or the **percentage of hypochromic red cells** [^112sp2gt] can detect early iron-restricted erythropoiesis. Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) helps distinguish iron deficiency from anemia of chronic disease [^113DECq2], and CRP or ESR should be checked to interpret ferritin in inflammatory states [^114N2wZa] [^1157g8j4]. Hepcidin is an emerging test for complex cases [^115NUJby], and genetic testing (e.g. HFE) is indicated when hereditary hemochromatosis is suspected [^114Mor4a] [^112SQPtX].

## Core iron studies panel

The **core iron studies panel** includes the following tests:

| **Test** | **Description** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Serum iron | Measures circulating iron bound to transferrin | Low in iron deficiency; high in iron overload |
| Ferritin | Reflects body iron stores | Low in iron deficiency; high in iron overload or inflammation |
| Transferrin or TIBC | Measures iron-binding capacity | High in iron deficiency; low in iron overload |
| Transferrin saturation (TSAT) | Percentage of transferrin saturated with iron | Low in iron deficiency; high in iron overload |

---

Ferritin is the most specific marker of iron stores [^114CUyEC] [^114N2wZa], and **TSAT** is the key indicator of **iron availability** [^114Mor4a] [^116ANoLV].

---

## Complete blood count (CBC) and red cell indices

CBC and red cell indices are essential to the evaluation, providing information on **anemia type and severity**:

- **Hemoglobin (Hb)**: Low in iron deficiency anemia (IDA) [^114CUyEC].
- **Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)**: Low in IDA (microcytic anemia) [^116Ln8KB].
- **Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH)**: Low in IDA (hypochromic anemia) [^116Ln8KB].
- **Red cell distribution width (RDW)**: Elevated in IDA due to anisocytosis [^111sFJG3].

---

## Additional laboratory tests

Additional tests may be included to provide a more **comprehensive assessment**:

| **Test** | **Description** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) | Reflects cellular iron demand | Elevated in iron deficiency; normal in anemia of chronic disease [^113DECq2] |
| Reticulocyte hemoglobin (Ret-He) | Measures hemoglobin content in reticulocytes | Low in early iron deficiency [^112rkjre] [^113DECq2] |
| Percentage hypochromic red cells | Indicates iron-restricted erythropoiesis | Elevated in iron deficiency [^112sp2gt] |
| C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) | Markers of inflammation | Elevated in inflammatory states, affecting ferritin interpretation [^1157g8j4] [^114N2wZa] |
| Hepcidin | Hormone regulating iron homeostasis | Low in iron deficiency; high in inflammation or iron overload [^115NUJby] |

---

## Interpretation of iron studies

Interpretation of iron studies **requires consideration of the clinical context**, including inflammation and chronic disease:

- **Iron deficiency anemia (IDA)**: Low ferritin, low TSAT, high TIBC, low serum iron, elevated sTfR, low Ret-He [^114CUyEC] [^116Ln8KB].
- **Anemia of chronic disease (ACD)**: Normal or elevated ferritin, low TSAT, low serum iron, normal sTfR, normal Ret-He.
- **Iron overload (e.g. hemochromatosis)**: High ferritin, high TSAT, low TIBC, high serum iron [^114Mor4a] [^113LCxUQ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the **importance of iron studies** for diagnosing and managing iron deficiency and overload:

- **Ferritin** [^114CUyEC] is the most useful initial test for diagnosing iron deficiency [^114N2wZa].
- **TSAT and serum iron** [^114Mor4a] provide additional information, especially in suspected false-normal ferritin [^1118Xv1A].
- **Genetic testing** (e.g. HFE gene) [^114Mor4a] is recommended in suspected hereditary hemochromatosis [^112SQPtX].

---

Iron studies include serum iron, ferritin, transferrin or TIBC, TSAT, and CBC with red cell indices, with additional tests such as sTfR, Ret-He, and CRP/ESR as needed [^1148eZV9] [^116ANoLV]. Interpretation requires **clinical context**, including inflammation and chronic disease considerations [^1157g8j4].

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hereditary hemochromatosis, and more specifically with respect to genetic testing, the EASL 2010 guidelines recommend considering the genetic testing of other hemochromatosis genes (TFR2, SLC40A1, HAMP, HJV) in patients with increased iron stores after exclusion of C282Y homozygosity. This should be done if iron excess has been proven by direct assessment, such as MRI or liver biopsy, and other hepatic and hematological disorders have been ruled out.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, specifically related to initial evaluation, the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining the following tests in the laboratory evaluation of patients with anemia associated with CKD:

- **CBC (including MCH, MCV, platelet count)**: In addition to the hemoglobin concentration.

- **Absolute reticulocyte count**: To assess bone marrow responsiveness, if indicated.

- **Assessment of iron status**: Percentage of hypochromic RBCs, but only if processing of blood sample is possible within six hours, or reticulocyte hemoglobin count or equivalent tests such as reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent. Alternatively, a combination of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin is recommended if the previous tests are not available or the patient has thalassemia or thalassemia trait.

- **Serum ferritin**: To assess iron stores.

- **Serum CRP**: To assess possible inflammation.

### Implementing reticulocyte hemoglobin into current hematology algorithms [^112rkjre]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Low credibility.

This systematic review investigates reticulocyte hemoglobin's capabilities in screening for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia, both with and without comorbidities.

- **Methods**: Participant background and laboratory characteristics were extracted from 14 unique studies between 2015 and 2022. Hemoglobin, reticulocyte hemoglobin, and mean cell volume (MCV) values were utilized in a meta-analysis for iron-deficiency anemia without secondary conditions. Mean laboratory values for each patient population were calculated and then used to determine sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia. The ferritin and reticulocyte hemoglobin ranges were calculated using the mean values.

- **Results**: The meta-analysis demonstrates that hemoglobin and MCV values do not significantly differ between studies, unlike reticulocyte hemoglobin values. The reticulocyte hemoglobin range is smaller than ferritin for the controls, iron deficiency, and iron-deficiency anemia. Reticulocyte hemoglobin values less than 26 pg can distinguish iron-deficiency anemia, while values of 26 to 31.5 pg can identify iron deficiency, with an AUC of 0.889. The sensitivity and specificity are 92.3% and 100% for iron-deficiency anemia, 100% and 81.5% for iron deficiency, and 94.4% and 71.4% for both, respectively (reference range, < 31.5 pg).

- **Conclusions**: Reticulocyte hemoglobin is potentially a quick screening test for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia.

Automated cell counters provide measurements of the changes in red cells that accompany iron deficiency, including reduced mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) — hypochromia, and reduced mean cell volume (MCV) — microcytosis. MCH is probably a more reliable marker of iron deficiency as it is less dependent on storage and the counting machine used. A reduction is seen in both absolute and functional iron deficiency (FID). MCH may also be more sensitive for iron deficiency than MCV. Both microcytosis and hypochromia lose sensitivity for iron deficiency in the presence of chronic disease, thalassemia, or vitamin B12/folate deficiency.

The specificity of MCV and MCH for iron deficiency is limited, as microcytosis and hypochromia also occur in many hemoglobinopathies (such as thalassemia, when the MCV is typically reduced out of proportion to the level of anemia), in sideroblastic anemia, and in some cases of anemia of chronic disease. To prevent unnecessary gastrointestinal investigation, hemoglobin electrophoresis is recommended in those with microcytosis and normal iron studies, particularly if there is an appropriate ethnic background.

Serum markers of iron deficiency include low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, low iron, raised total iron-binding capacity, raised red cell zinc protoporphyrin, increased serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), low reticulocyte hemoglobin (Retic-Hb), and raised percentage of hypochromic red cells. Serum ferritin (SF) is the most specific test for iron deficiency in the absence of inflammation. An SF level of < 15 µg/L is indicative of absent iron stores.

### Best but not perfect: Indirect measure of low iron stores [^115WFgXM]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

Making an accurate diagnosis of iron deficiency is crucial for patient care. However, using indirect markers obtained through routine phlebotomy presents several challenges. Low serum iron, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are indicative of iron deficiency but can also result from inflammation. In addition, hemoglobin and MCV may be low due to genetic factors; hemoglobin levels can also vary diurnally rather than indicate iron deficiency.

Transferrin concentrations typically increase with iron deficiency and decrease with inflammation. In contrast, transferrin receptor levels rise in both iron deficiency and inflammation situations. Serum ferritin, meanwhile, is an appealing marker. A very low serum ferritin level (< 10 μg/L) is diagnostic of iron deficiency, as shown by absent stainable iron in a bone marrow aspirate. However, serum ferritin can appear normal or even elevated when iron deficiency is verified by absent bone marrow stainable iron.

A recent Cochrane review of 512 adults from various institutions found a serum ferritin < 30 μg/L had 98% specificity and 79% sensitivity for diagnosing iron deficiency, as confirmed by missing bone marrow iron. Lahtiharju et al. contribute significantly by assessing the relationship of indirect measures of iron status to bone marrow iron stain in 6,610 patients. Their evidence suggests that ferritin is the most reliable single biomarker for predicting reduced iron stores. This finding aligns with decades-old studies that established ferritin as a vital standalone indicator of iron status.

In this issue of Kidney International, the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study reports that hemodialysis patients receiving monthly intravenous iron supplementation of 300–399 mg or ⩾400 mg had a 13% or 18% higher risk of dying, respectively, compared with those receiving 100–199 mg per month, with no obvious differences in cause-specific mortalities. This study supports that randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to identify optimized iron supplementation strategies for anemic dialysis patients.

### Assessment of haemoglobin and serum markers of iron deficiency in people with cardiovascular disease [^114RFgwc]. Heart (2023). Low credibility.

This analysis also throws further doubt on the utility of serum ferritin for diagnosing iron deficiency in patients with cardiovascular disease. Most patients had values of 30 µg/L, and low values of ferritin were associated with a good prognosis. Serum iron and TSAT were less often measured but were usually low in patients with moderate or severe anaemia, although often low even when haemoglobin was normal. However, unlike serum ferritin, low serum iron and TSAT were associated with a worse prognosis. Ultimately, bone marrow histology for iron deposits and the clinical response to correction of iron deficiency are the most reliable ways of defining which test should be used to identify iron deficiency.

Iron deficiency — due to medications predisposing to bleeding (antiplatelets) and/or malabsorption of iron (PPIs), reduced dietary intake, or the failure to use appropriate body iron stores (e.g. due to inflammation) — is a common cause of anaemia in patients with cardiovascular disease. In patients with heart failure, iron deficiency, with or without anaemia, is associated with worse symptoms, quality of life, and greater mortality. Regular testing of iron indices in all patients with heart failure, regardless of their haemoglobin concentration, is suggested by European guidelines. However, in our cohort, testing for iron deficiency was driven primarily by the severity of anaemia. In contemporary data for patients with heart failure, the rate of testing of iron indices may be as low as 1%–2% or as high as…

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^115bHVQo]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

The executive summary of recommendations and practice statements outlines crucial guidance for handling iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), which is prevalent and significantly impacts global health (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). IDA can be attributed to various gastrointestinal pathologies, including cancer; hence, urgent gastrointestinal investigation is advised for adults with a new IDA diagnosis without an apparent cause (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

- **Background**: Iron deficiency anaemia is common and poses a major health concern worldwide. IDA necessitates careful consideration regarding potential underlying gastrointestinal issues, particularly in the absence of evident causation.

- **Definitions**:
	- Anaemia should be defined based on a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration that falls below the population-specific and laboratory-specific lower limit of normal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
	- Iron deficiency confirmation should precede investigation, with serum ferritin serving as the primary marker, although additional tests like transferrin saturation may be useful when a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

	- A marked improvement in Hb levels (increase ≥ 10 g/L within two weeks) following iron therapy strongly indicates absolute iron deficiency, even when iron study results are inconclusive (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^113DECq2]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

In summary, an SF < 15 µg/L is highly specific for iron deficiency (specificity 0.99). A cut-off of 45 µg/L provides a respectable specificity of 0.92, and figures below this may warrant consideration of GI investigation, especially in the context of a chronic inflammatory process with anaemia.

The sTfR concentration is a good marker of iron deficiency in otherwise healthy subjects, but it can also be raised where there is increased erythropoietic drive such as with haemolytic anaemias, thalassaemias, and Hb E — and most UK hospitals do not provide this test. The [sTfR/log 10 ferritin] ratio may provide superior discrimination to either test on its own, particularly in chronic disease.

A therapeutic trial of oral iron replacement therapy (IRT) for 2–4 weeks may aid with the diagnosis of IDA but is dependent on compliance. A ≥ 10 g/L rise in Hb over a 2-week period is highly sensitive for absolute iron deficiency. While further tests to confirm iron deficiency are occasionally necessary, estimation of iron concentration in bone marrow is invasive, often subjective, and difficult to justify in most cases.

After excluding thalassaemia carriage, low Retic-Hb provides evidence of iron restriction and should be considered in the laboratory work-up of anaemia, particularly where there is chronic renal impairment. Retic-Hb is reported to be a more reliable marker of iron restriction than sTfR in healthy blood donors. An early indicator of response to iron therapy in IDA is provided by a rising Retic-Hb on day 4, similar to the observation of a falling percentage of hypochromic red cells.

### Iron absorption from oral iron supplements given on consecutive versus alternate days and as single morning doses versus twice-daily split dosing in iron-depleted women: two open-label, randomised controlled trials [^113wixRU]. The Lancet Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Guidelines to treat iron deficiency recommend daily provision of ferrous iron divided throughout the day to increase absorption. However, daily dosing and split dosing might increase serum hepcidin and decrease iron absorption from subsequent doses. Our study aimed to compare iron absorption from oral iron supplements given on consecutive versus alternate days and given as single morning doses versus twice-daily split dosing.

- **Methods**: We conducted two prospective, open-label, randomised controlled trials assessing iron absorption using (54 Fe)-labelled, (57 Fe)-labelled, or (58 Fe)-labelled ferrous sulfate in iron-depleted (serum ferritin ≤ 25 μg/L) women aged 18–40 years recruited from ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich, Switzerland.

	- **In study 1, women were randomly assigned (1**:1) to two groups. One group received 60 mg iron at 0800 h (± 1 h) on consecutive days for 14 days, and the other group received the same doses on alternate days for 28 days.

	- In study 2, women were assigned to two groups, stratified by serum ferritin so that two groups with similar iron statuses could be formed. One group received 120 mg iron at 0800 h (± 1 h) and the other received the dose split into two divided doses of 60 mg at 0800 h (± 1 h) and 1700 h (± 1 h) for three consecutive days. Fourteen days after the final dose, the groups were each crossed over to the other regimen, allowing for within-individual comparisons.

The co-primary outcomes in both studies were iron bioavailability (total and fractional iron absorption), assessed by measuring the isotopic label abundance in erythrocytes.

### The origin of ferritin reference intervals: A systematic review [^116CTNtA]. The Lancet Haematology (2024). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is a highly prevalent condition that contributes to unnecessary morbidity, mortality, and health inequity. A serum ferritin concentration of less than 30 μg/L has a high specificity and sensitivity for diagnosing iron deficiency in adults, but the laboratory-reported lower limit of normal (LLN) is typically lower. These LLNs might not be rooted in rigorous scientific evidence and could contribute to the structural underdiagnosis of iron deficiency.

A systematic review was conducted per systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines using medical literature databases from the inception of each database to November 30, 2021. The goal was to identify studies that determined ferritin reference intervals in healthy adults, as well as to perform a grey literature search for the five most common ferritin assays (registration number CRD42022268844). The objectives were to systematically summarize the ferritin reference intervals and to carry out a methodological quality assessment of the included studies.

A total of 2306 studies were screened, with 61 full texts included. Out of these, 37 studies were eligible for analysis of the ferritin LLN in the general population. The sample population comprised 21,882 female and 23,650 male participants. In females, the ferritin LLN was a median of 8 μg/L (IQR 5–15) and a mean of 9 μg/L (SD 11). In males, it was a median of 25 μg/L (IQR 16–44) and a mean of 25 μg/L (SD 29). Notably, 30 (49%) of the 61 studies did not explicitly screen for patients at risk of iron deficiency, and 32 (52%) did not refer to a reference interval establishment guideline.

### Screening characteristics of hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume for detection of iron deficiency in pregnancy [^112onirs]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Low credibility.

Our results demonstrate that hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are insensitive predictors of iron deficiency in the first trimester and throughout pregnancy. Based on the testing characteristics observed in our cohort, if we screen for first-trimester iron deficiency using microcytosis or anemia, 59 of 100 patients with iron deficiency will go undetected. This screening failure becomes even more concerning as pregnancy progresses and iron deficiency becomes more prevalent.

Given the retrospective study design, iron deficiency could only be accurately determined for the patients with ferritin results in our healthcare system, meaning that the true prevalence across our population might be obscured by selection bias. However, because sensitivity is an intrinsic test characteristic unaffected by prevalence, our primary hypothesis that hemoglobin and MCV are poor screening tools to detect iron deficiency in pregnancy should remain relatively unaffected by this selection bias.

The 2021 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' practice guidance document for anemia in pregnancy recommends a first-trimester screening CBC but does not recommend evaluating iron status (ferritin) directly in the absence of anemia or microcytosis. However, our study demonstrates that hemoglobin (anemia) and MCV (microcytosis) are poor predictors of iron deficiency throughout pregnancy. Therefore, our institution's iron deficiency screening policy for pregnant women now aligns with the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics recommendations.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for HFE hemochromatosis [^113LCxUQ]. Journal of Hepatology (2010). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hereditary hemochromatosis, particularly concerning the iron panel, the EASL 2010 guidelines recommend measuring fasting transferrin saturation and serum ferritin in patients with suspected iron overload.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^1172SQqC]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

The introduction of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) for trace quantities of blood in the stool has provided a major step forward in risk stratification for those presenting with clinical features that are potentially due to colorectal cancer (CRC). Its value has been demonstrated in a series of large observational studies. FIT is currently recommended by NICE for determining whether IDA in the under-60 age group warrants fast-track referral. While this suggestion is logical, the evidence base is limited.

The place of FIT in risk stratification for the IDA population as a whole — either as a stand-alone or in conjunction with established tools — remains to be established. There are reasons for caution about a FIT-based triage system for IDA. First, CRC accounts for only a minority of the pathology found on the investigation of IDA, particularly in those under 60. Second, data from six recently published studies of real-world experience confirm that even at the low detection threshold of 10 µg/g, the sensitivity of FIT for CRC ranges from 83% to 91%. Furthermore, although numbers are small, there is the suspicion that IDA may be over-represented in the FIT negative CRC subgroup, accounting for 32 (40%) of the 81 pooled cases. This conclusion is supported by a meta-analysis of the few IDA-specific studies in the published literature, which yielded a sensitivity of 83% of FIT for CRC, with concerns that this may be an over-estimate due to publication bias.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^116ANoLV]. KDIGO (2012). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, specifically the management of anemia through iron therapy, the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend guiding subsequent iron administration in patients with CKD based on several factors. These include hemoglobin responses to recent iron therapy, ongoing blood losses, iron status tests (such as transferrin saturation and ferritin), hemoglobin concentration, ESA (erythropoiesis-stimulating agent) responsiveness, and ESA dose in patients treated with ESA. Additionally, the trends in each parameter and the patient's clinical status should be considered.

### Iron quantification with susceptibility [^113WdDaw]. NMR in Biomedicine (2017). Low credibility.

Iron is an essential trace element involved in a variety of biological mechanisms in the human body. Disturbances of iron homeostasis have been observed in several inflammatory and degenerative diseases, raising strong interest in non-invasive iron mapping techniques. Numerous MRI techniques have been proposed, mostly based on the field changes induced by the magnetic properties of iron. Each approach has specific sensitivity for iron and its microstructural environment.

Quantitative susceptibility mapping is the latest development and provides a direct measure of bulk susceptibility. However, field changes induced by iron are not always directly related to the concentration of iron; rather, they reflect the structure of iron compounds and their cellular distribution. This review provides an overview of the most relevant iron compounds in the human body, their magnetic properties, and their cellular distribution. In addition, MRI methods based on direct or indirect susceptibility changes are presented and discussed with respect to technical aspects and clinical applicability.

### Intravenous iron therapy for non-anaemic, iron-deficient adults [^115Y5XQc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies and has several physiological manifestations. Early or non-anaemic iron deficiency can result in fatigue and diminished exercise capacity. Oral iron preparations often have a high incidence of intolerable side effects and are ineffective in certain forms of iron deficiency. Consequently, intravenous iron preparations are increasingly used in treating non-anaemic iron deficiency. The newer, more stable iron preparations, in particular, purport to have a lower incidence of side effects and are now used across a range of different patient populations.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of intravenous iron therapy in the treatment of adults with non-anaemic iron deficiency.

- **Search methods**: On 18 October 2019, we electronically searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two further databases, and two trial registries. We hand-searched the references of full-text extracted studies and contacted relevant study authors for additional data.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials that compared any intravenous iron preparation to placebo in adults. We excluded other forms of comparison such as oral iron versus placebo, intramuscular iron versus placebo, or intravenous iron studies where other iron preparations were used as the comparator. We also excluded studies involving erythropoietin therapy or obstetric populations.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors screened references for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We resolved differences in opinion.

### Iron deficiency resolution and time to resolution in an American health system [^113YGVzf]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

Within the Clinical and Translational Science Institute clinical data repository, patients aged ≥ 18 years who had a laboratory diagnosis of iron deficiency (ID), with or without anemia, within the MHFV system since 2010 were eligible for inclusion. We sought to construct a cohort of patients with:

- **Laboratory evidence of ID**: We defined ID as a ferritin value of ≤ 25 ng/mL. A ferritin value in this range is highly predictive of ID. Although there is disagreement about the ferritin level that can be considered diagnostic of ID, we chose 25 ng/mL as a conservative threshold with a physiologic basis, currently accepted in clinical practice.

- **Regular care in the MHFV system**: We included patients with at least two ferritin values: one initial value of ≤ 25 ng/mL and at least one subsequent value measured in the MHFV system. The second value was required to occur at least two months after the initial value and no later than three years after the initial value. These criteria signify ongoing engagement with the MHFV system, suggesting opportunities for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up on treatment efficacy. It also indicates that providers caring for a patient considered the diagnosis of ID multiple times in a three-year period.

- **Sufficient follow-up time for documented resolution**: Patients were required to have three years of follow-up data available after diagnosis.

### Screening of iron deficiency anaemia in early childhood [^111SUTaK]. BMC Pediatrics (2021).

As an invasive blood test for population-based screening in children is unlikely to be accepted, the UK NSC review aimed to identify studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive or minimally invasive screening tests, such as urinary hepcidin, against a valid reference standard for identifying IDA, such as serum haemoglobin, haematocrit, serum ferritin, or transferrin saturation levels. Review authors aimed to include studies that assessed screening tests in a non-selected sample representative of the general UK population. However, no studies were identified that fulfilled their inclusion criteria.

A public consultation on IDA was conducted during the three months following the UK NSC publication of their updated recommendations in 2017. A German university replied to inform about a new non-invasive technique developed for the detection of erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin by an optical measurement on the lower lip. According to this source, applying this technique to children under five years of age is feasible, with a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 93% against soluble transferrin receptor, for a threshold at 50 μmol/mol heme.

- **Potential harms of screening children under five years of age for IDA**: Potential harms of screening include false positive results, leading to parents' anxiety and additional costs. The 2015 USPSTF review found no studies that evaluated the direct harms derived from routine IDA screening on child health outcomes and inadequate evidence on the harms of treatment of IDA in children between 6 and 24 months of age.

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^114Acp5z]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining a complete blood count (CBC), serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) for laboratory screening of anemia. These measurements should be obtained every 6 to 12 months in patients who are in remission or have mild disease, and at least every 3 months in outpatients with active disease.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: A call to action [^11189XPC]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is frequent in chronic conditions. Until very recently, iron deficiency (ID) was considered only in the context of iron-deficiency anemia. In the last 10–15 years, ID has been regarded as an autonomous pathological entity in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs. Therefore, early ID detection and treatment have become important goals, as iron is essential for the functioning of all organs.

The biological definition of ID is debated and inconsistently defined by authors in different studies, which may have contributed to preventing the recognition of ID as an independent condition. An international multidisciplinary group of experts recently proposed a more comprehensive definition of ID: "Iron deficiency is a health-related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia". This definition is important because it indicates that ID may have specific symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment, even in the absence of anemia. Furthermore, ID is associated with poor prognosis in many diseases, highlighting the importance of its diagnosis.

Depending on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, two types of ID can be distinguished, with identical clinical symptoms: absolute ID, which is the consequence of a quantitative decrease in iron stores, and functional ID, due to the sequestration of iron in otherwise quantitatively normal or abundant stores. These two types of ID are not mutually exclusive.

### Ferritin outperforms other biomarkers in predicting bone marrow iron stores in patients with hematologic disorders [^111nbrx1]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

One-fourth of the world's population currently experiences anemia. The World Health Organization defines anemia as a hemoglobin concentration of < 130 g/L for males, 120 g/L for nonpregnant females, and 110 g/L for pregnant females. The most common cause of anemia is iron deficiency, contributing to approximately half of the cases in females worldwide and more than half in high-income regions. Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Reliable detection of iron deficiency is clinically important because it may indicate other diseases, such as gastrointestinal cancer.

Given that iron is stored in the bone marrow, bone marrow aspiration has been considered the gold standard for diagnosing iron deficiency, but it is invasive and costly. More commonly, surrogate plasma or serum biomarkers are used to assess anemia and iron stores, including ferritin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), hemoglobin, and erythrocyte mean cell volume (MCV). These biomarkers have high diagnostic accuracy in the healthy adult population for diagnosing IDA. However, the interpretation of these laboratory tests is not always straightforward due to multiple confounding factors, including patient-specific, preanalytical, and analytical laboratory assay considerations. For example, inflammation can increase ferritin concentrations and decrease TSAT, while erythropoietic activity affects sTfR levels. Cutoffs depend on the reference population and laboratory methods, with no consensus on their use in patients.

### Intravenous iron reactions: Insights from an allergy and immunology perspective [^116VkRhp]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis and management of intravenous iron reactions is often challenging, as skin testing has unproven utility, and most reactions are non-IgE-mediated.

- **Objective**: We aimed to identify clinical patterns and tolerability predictors in patients with reactions to intravenous iron.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with reactions to intravenous iron who were referred to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Drug Allergy Clinic from April 2014 through January 2025. We administered a follow-up survey via RedCap to evaluate patient outcomes with future intravenous iron administration.

- **Results**: Of the 51 patients presenting with adverse reactions to intravenous iron, 48 had skin testing performed. The skin testing results were deemed negative in all 48 cases (100%). Notable laboratory test results within one year of reaction included low vitamin D level (47%), high parathyroid hormone level (46%), and low phosphorus level (10%). Many patients (56%) were dermatographic, and their drug alert labels included opioids (31%), fluoroquinolones (14%), and radiocontrast dye (8%). Following assessment, 31 patients received intravenous iron (61%) using formulations that were the same as (n = 15 [48%]) and/or different from (n = 17 [55%]) the formulation initially implicated, with various modifications including antihistamines, slower infusion rate, and intravenous fluid pretreatment. Of these 31 patients, 27 (87%) tolerated the infusions. Following evaluation, the patients were surveyed regarding subsequent intravenous iron administration.

### Iron supplementation, response in iron-deficiency anemia: Analysis of five trials [^1163DhwD]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Oral iron-replacement therapy is the mainstay of treatment for iron-deficiency anemia, but it is often poorly tolerated or ineffective. Hemoglobin response at day 14 of oral iron may be useful in assessing whether and when to transition patients from oral to intravenous (IV) iron.

- **Methods**: Pooled data from five randomized trials were analyzed to compare oral and IV iron-replacement therapy for iron-deficiency anemia. Treatment criteria and assignment to oral versus IV iron were defined per protocol; this analysis included only subjects receiving oral iron. Responders were subjects with ≥ 1.0-g/dL increases in hemoglobin at day 14, and nonresponders were those with smaller increases. Demographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated for association with hemoglobin response at multiple timepoints.

- **Results**: Most subjects (72.8%) were classified as responders. The proportion of subjects with hemoglobin increases ≥ 1.0, ≥ 2.0, and ≥ 3.0 g/dL was greatest among those with postpartum anemia, intermediate among those with heavy uterine bleeding or gastrointestinal-related causes of anemia, and lowest among those with other causes. This proportion was also significantly greater among responders than nonresponders. A ≥ 1.0-g/dL increase in hemoglobin on day 14 most accurately predicted satisfactory overall hemoglobin response to oral iron on day 42/56 (sensitivity 90.1%; specificity 79.3%; positive and negative predictive values of 92.9% and 72.7%, respectively). Iron-replacement therapy improved quality of life and reduced fatigue.

Conclusion

Hemoglobin responses < 1.0

### Interpretation of ferritin concentrations in the dermatology clinic [^116Gd8nd]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Ferritin measurement is a common laboratory test in dermatology. Ferritin is a marker of iron storage in the human body but can be elevated in inflammatory states. Therefore, changes in ferritin are nonspecific, and correlation of specific clinical findings and risk factors with ferritin concentration and other biomarkers, such as iron studies or C-reactive protein tests, is recommended. This article discusses iron metabolism, the indications for ferritin measurement in dermatology, and how to interpret the laboratory results.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^1149wkcb]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

- **Definitions**: We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test. The evidence quality is medium, the consensus is 100%, and the statement strength is strong. We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), but other blood tests, such as transferrin saturation, can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected. The evidence quality is medium, the consensus is 92%, and the statement strength is strong. We recommend that a good response to iron therapy, indicated by a haemoglobin rise of ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe in anaemic patients, is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal. The evidence quality is medium, the consensus is 100%, and the statement strength is strong.

- **Anaemia**: The World Health Organization (WHO) defines anaemia as a haemoglobin concentration below 130 g/L in men over 15 years of age, below 120 g/L in non-pregnant women over 15 years of age, and below 110 g/L in pregnant women in the second and third trimester. The diagnostic criteria for anaemia in IDA vary between published studies. The normal range for haemoglobin also varies between different populations in the UK. It is reasonable to use the lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test to define anaemia, but these should be aligned with the WHO-defined lower limits. There is little consensus as to the level of anaemia that requires investigation.

### Physiologically based serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency in women of reproductive age who are blood donors [^115E9d7Z]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

The criteria for selecting apparently healthy populations, the laboratory methods, and the sample sizes and model explained variance differed between the REDS-RISE and NHANES studies. Volunteer blood donors are a healthy, altruistic, specially selected subset of the general population. After applying 38 required donor exclusion criteria, only an estimated 62.6% of the total US population, aged 18 years or older, is eligible to donate blood.

In the REDS-RISE study, participants were not screened for biochemical evidence of inflammation or liver disease but did undergo an additional clinical screening and donated successfully. In contrast, NHANES study participants were a subset of a stratified multistage probability sample of the US population, which was no longer nationally representative after exclusions for missing values and for common causes of anemia at the population level that are independent of iron deficiency. The laboratory methods in the two studies were not identical but were of high quality. The number of participants in the two study populations differ by an order of magnitude. Despite these differences, the serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency in the two independent studies do not differ significantly and are nearly identical.

International validation of the physiologically based method is needed. Nonetheless, the results of the REDS-RISE study add to evidence that, in women of reproductive age, iron-deficient erythropoiesis begins well before the WHO guideline of a serum ferritin of 15 µg/L. A higher serum ferritin threshold would increase the proportion of women…

### Iron status in patients with burn anaemia [^115WvYLa]. Burns (2023). Low credibility.

The iron status of burn patients is poorly understood, often limited by the difficulty in interpreting conventional iron studies in the context of the acute phase response triggered by critical illness. The aim of this study was to evaluate the iron status of patients with burn anaemia using recent post-operative guidelines.

- **Methodology**: This retrospective cohort study utilized data collected from records for adult patients admitted to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital with burns covering at least 15% of total body surface area (TBSA). Rates of iron deficiency were defined as ferritin levels below 100 µg/L, or ferritin levels between 100–300 µg/L with transferrin saturation below 20%. Low iron availability was defined as transferrin saturation below 20%.

- **Results**: Out of 60 included patients (90% male), 16 (27%) underwent iron studies. Eleven (18%) were treated with intravenous iron. Iron studies revealed that five (31%) patients had evidence of iron deficiency, and ten out of twelve (83%) had evidence of reduced iron availability. Two patients (40%) with evidence of iron deficiency were not treated with intravenous iron.

- **Conclusion**: The application of recent guidelines for the interpretation of conventional iron studies in patients with inflammatory states may improve the identification of iron deficiency in burn patients. Iron deficiency might be an under-recognized and under-treated contributor to burn anaemia.

### A 5-step root cause analysis model for test overutilization: A study on its application to plasma transferrin testing [^112QwLgq]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Low credibility.

Laboratory test overutilization is characterized by the ordering of tests for which the results are either irrelevant or not beneficial to patient care. A meta-analysis discovered that overutilization constituted approximately 20% of all tests. This issue poses a significant challenge in medicine, as it can lead to additional costs and indirectly influence patient care, such as patient anxiety, unnecessary blood collection, competition with necessary tests, and misdiagnosis. From a laboratory perspective, this problem is called a "pre-preanalytical laboratory error", and it is the most prevalent type of laboratory error in real-world practice.

Comparable to other laboratories, the central laboratory of the Department of Clinical Pathology at the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital encounters test overutilization issues, one of which involves plasma transferrin. A recent study demonstrated that plasma transferrin does not provide supplementary information when co-ordered with iron studies, such as serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin tests, in anemic patients. Furthermore, transferrin levels exhibit low accuracy in diagnosing and treating iron deficiency anemia. As a result, plasma transferrin is considered redundant and overused in the context of iron deficiency anemia.

The growing awareness of laboratory test overuse within the healthcare community has led to the development of numerous methods to address this issue. In the context of quality improvement management, these methods are referred to as laboratory utilization management (LUM) or demand.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^115oD9GG]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

Ferrous sulfate and other ferrous salts remain the mainstay of oral iron supplementation. Their high efficacy is offset by poor tolerability and reduced compliance, which has sparked the development of alternative oral iron supplements. Recent studies with ferrous sulfate have provided new insights on optimal dosage and frequency. Additional adequately powered RCTs are required to address open questions on efficacy, side effects, and the optimal dosage and frequency of different types of oral iron supplements for selected groups of patients. Since none of the old or new oral iron formulations have shown non-inferiority versus intravenous iron, comparisons against the gold standard (ferrous sulfate) would be more informative. The effects of oral iron supplements on hepcidin should also be investigated in animal models and clinical studies. Based on current knowledge, the choice between iron formulations should depend on the individual's iron status, tolerance, absorption capacity, and specific therapeutic goals.

### Shortcomings in infant iron deficiency screening methods [^112uZxpo]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Screening for iron deficiency anemia is a well-established practice in pediatrics, but numerous challenges surrounding recommendations raise questions about the effectiveness of this strategy.

- **Objective**: To evaluate iron deficiency anemia screening approaches by assessing rates of follow-up testing and resolution among patients meeting screening criteria in a primary care setting.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was performed. We extracted electronic medical record data on complete blood counts for infants who received primary care in our clinics in the past 10 years. We calculated rates of positive screening results with 9 different measurement criteria and determined rates of follow-up testing and of documented correction of iron deficiency among those who screened positive.

- **Results**: Our cohort consisted of 4,984 children who were screened at 9 to 15 months of age, between 1994 and 2004. There was a wide distribution of positive detection rates (range: 1.5–14.5%) among the 9 screening criteria. Follow-up testing rates were low. No more than 25% of infants who screened positive by any criterion underwent a repeat complete blood count within 6 months; moreover, no more than 11.6% (range: 4.4–11.6%) had documented correction of their laboratory abnormalities.

- **Conclusions**: Significant shortcomings exist in iron deficiency anemia screening practices. A widely agreed-on, specific, and inexpensive screening criterion, with increased emphasis on systems-based approaches to iron deficiency screening, is needed.

### Physiologically based serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency among women and children from Africa, Asia, Europe, and Central America: A multinational comparative study [^111tZ19f]. The Lancet Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis of iron deficiency commonly relies on measurement of serum ferritin concentrations. WHO guidelines identify serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency among healthy individuals of less than 15 μg/L for women and less than 12 μg/L for children under 5 years, based on expert opinion. We report thresholds for iron deficiency for apparently healthy non-pregnant women and young children based on physiological indicators.

- **Methods**: We performed secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from women (aged 15–49 years) and children (aged 6–59 months) from 12 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Central America from available surveys (2007–19). Using haemoglobin and soluble transferrin receptor concentrations as individual-level indicators of iron deficiency, we identified country-specific serum ferritin thresholds. We conducted multivariate meta-analysis using individual participant data to assess multinational heterogeneity and intercountry consistency.

- **Findings**: Data were collected from July 2007 to March 2019. A total of 18,251 individuals (13,864 women and 4,387 children) were included in the final analysis. The thresholds of pooled serum ferritin levels corresponding to the starting point of decline in circulating haemoglobin concentrations were 24.8 μg/L (95% CI 24.4–25.2) for women and 22.1 μg/L (20.8–23.4) for children based on the national survey data from 12 countries. The thresholds were consistent among countries (p heterogeneity: women = 0.73, children = 0.43), but median serum ferritin concentrations and lower 5% reference ranges differed.

### Case studies: iron [^111tENc1]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Iron biomarkers were developed to define the size of iron stores and the adequacy of the iron supply required to meet functional needs. Approximately 80% of the iron delivered to tissues through the circulating plasma pool will be incorporated into hemoglobin. Consequently, with the exception of serum ferritin, iron biomarkers are measures of iron sufficiency for erythrocyte production. They have proven to be very valuable in determining the cause of anemia in clinical settings where additional information about factors affecting the patient's health is available.

However, all biomarkers are affected by factors other than iron status, which limits their utility for determining the prevalence of iron deficiency in some populations, particularly in developing countries. Furthermore, relations between iron status and functional outcomes, such as neonatal and infant mortality, motor, cognitive, and emotional development in infants, and severe morbidity from malaria in young children, are inadequately characterized.

There is a need to identify and standardize biomarkers that have the highest predictive value for specific functional outcomes in each setting. The most appropriate biomarkers may vary with the setting and be influenced by age, sex, gestational stage of pregnancy, and environmental factors, such as repeated or chronic infections. There is also an urgent need for improved technology to permit the use of specific biomarkers in field studies in resource-poor regions. Finally, more research is required to define these biomarkers and improve their applicability.

### Characterization of iron status biomarkers and hematological indices among young adults of East Asian or Northern European ancestry: A cross-sectional analysis from the Iron Genes in East Asian and Northern European Adults Study (FeGenes) [^112boi6U]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Excess body iron (Fe) accrual is linked to chronic diseases. East Asian (EA) adults (median age 50 years) were reported to have higher Fe stores compared to other populations despite lacking the mutation that causes Fe overload in Northern European (NE) adults. It is unknown if these differences are evident in a healthy population under 50 years of age.

- **Objectives**: This cross-sectional study aims to compare Fe-related markers in young adults of EA and NE ancestry and identify determinants of Fe status.

- **Methods**: Participants were healthy United States males and premenopausal/nonpregnant females of genetically confirmed EA (n = 251) or NE (n = 253) ancestry, aged 18–50 years and without obesity. A complete blood count was obtained. Serum ferritin (SF; μg/L), C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 were measured by immunoassay, and serum soluble transferrin receptor (mg/L) and transferrin by quantitative immunoturbidimetry. Total body Fe (mg/kg) was calculated. Elevated Fe stores were defined as SF > 200 (females) or > 300 (males) and C-reactive protein < 5 mg/L. Results are shown as the geometric mean 95% confidence interval (CI) or mean ± standard deviation.

- **Results**: The mean age of the population was 26.3 years (25.6, 26.9 years), with 69.2% of participants aged under 30 years. SF was higher in EA (172; 152, 194) compared with NE (85.3; 76.8, 94.8) males (P < 0.001), and in EA (42.6; 36.7, 49.5) compared with NE (31.9; 27.8, 36.5) females (P = 0.004). The prevalence of elevated Fe stores was 16.7% in EA compared with 0.8% in NE males (P < 0.001) and 1.6% in EA compared with 0% in NE females.

### Data-driven physiologic thresholds for iron deficiency associated with hematologic decline [^111vFXg5]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency contributes to approximately 50% of the anemia prevalence worldwide, but reference intervals for iron status tests are not optimized for anemia diagnosis. To address this limitation, we identified the serum ferritin (SF) thresholds associated with hematologic decline in iron-deficient patients, and the SF thresholds from which an SF increase was associated with hematologic improvement.

Paired red blood cell and SF measurements were analyzed from two adult cohorts at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), from 2008–2011 (N = 48,409) and 2016–2018 (N = 10,042). Inter-patient measurements in the first cohort were used to define optimal SF thresholds based on the physiologic relationship between SF and red cell measurements. Intra-patient measurements, taken 1 to 26 weeks apart in the second cohort, were used to identify SF thresholds from which an SF increase was associated with an increase in red cell measurements.

The identified optimal SF thresholds varied with age, sex, and red cell measure. Thresholds associated with approximately 5% decline in red cell index were typically in the range of 10–25 ng/mL. Thresholds for younger women (18–45 years) were approximately 5 ng/mL lower than for older women (60–95 years), and approximately 10 ng/mL lower than for men.

Thresholds from which a subsequent increase in SF was associated with a concomitant increase in red cell measure showed similar patterns: younger women had lower thresholds (approximately 15 ng/mL) than older women (approximately 25 ng/mL), or men (approximately 35 ng/mL). These results suggest that diagnostic accuracy may be improved by setting different SF thresholds for younger women, older women, and men.

### Iron metabolism and iron disorders revisited in the hepcidin era [^115NUJby]. Haematologica (2020). High credibility.

Research advances in understanding the biological functions and homeostasis of iron have clarified its role in physiology and disease. Iron, essential for hemoglobin synthesis, is indispensable to all cells for the production of heme and iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters, which are components of proteins and enzymes involved in vital biological processes such as respiration, nucleic acid replication and repair, metabolic reactions, and host defense. While essential for life, excess iron is toxic. The ability to accept and release electrons explains the propensity of iron to damage cell components and is the reason why body iron must be tightly regulated.

The two-faced nature of iron is also evident in its disorders, which span from iron excess to iron deficiency and maldistribution, where some tissues are iron-loaded and others are iron-deficient.

In the new millennium, studies of genetic and acquired iron disorders and the development of their corresponding murine models have identified novel iron genes, proteins, and pathways, unveiling the central role of the hepcidin-ferroportin axis in systemic iron homeostasis. This review summarizes recent advances in the understanding of iron trafficking, utilization, and regulation, emphasizing the implications for iron disorders of hematologic interest. For further insights, readers are directed to specific reviews.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the correlation between maternal and neonatal iron status and haematologic indices [^114VgVBx]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

- **Risk of bias of included studies**: The risk of bias for individual studies is summarized in Figures 2 and 3. Seven studies demonstrated a low risk of bias, 28 studies showed a moderate risk, and 30 studies exhibited a high risk. Overall, cross-sectional studies had a high risk of bias in the two comparability domains, a moderate risk in domains related to the representativeness of the exposed cohort and selection of the non-exposed cohort, and a low risk in domains concerning the ascertainment of exposure and demonstration that the outcome of interest was not present at the start of the study.

Conversely, cohort studies had a high risk of bias in domains related to comparability bias, specifically regarding whether studies controlled for important factors. They had a moderate risk of bias in domains assessing the selection of non-exposed cohort and a loss of cohort to follow-up. Finally, cohort studies showed a low risk of bias in domains assessing the representativeness of the exposed cohort, ascertainment of exposure, demonstration that the outcome of interest was not present at study start, independent blind assessment of outcomes, and whether the follow-up time was sufficient for the outcome to occur. Overall, the quality of evidence to support the association between maternal and neonatal iron status and haematologic indices was very low (see Supplementary Table 2 for a summary of the GRADE evidence profile).

### Screening and routine supplementation for iron deficiency anemia: A systematic review [^1177MwVK]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Supplementation and screening for iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in young children may improve growth and developmental outcomes. The goal of this study was to review the evidence regarding the benefits and harms of screening and routine supplementation for IDA for the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Methods included searching Medline and Cochrane databases between 1996 and August 2014, as well as referencing lists of relevant systematic reviews. Trials and controlled observational studies on the effectiveness and harms of routine iron supplementation and screening in children aged 6 to 24 months conducted in developed countries were included. One author extracted data, which were checked for accuracy by a second author, and dual quality assessment was performed.

No studies of iron supplementation in young children reported on the diagnosis of neurodevelopmental delay. Five of six trials sparsely reporting various growth outcomes found no clear benefit of supplementation. After 3 to 12 months, Bayley Scales of Infant Development scores were not significantly different in two trials. Ten trials assessing iron supplementation in children reported inconsistent findings for hematologic measures. Evidence regarding the harms of supplementation was limited but did not indicate significant differences. No studies assessed the benefits or harms of screening or the association between improvement in impaired iron status and clinical outcomes. Studies may have been underpowered, and control factors varied, potentially confounding results.

### Brain iron concentration in childhood ADHD: A systematic review of neuroimaging studies [^116gdKKr]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency may play a role in the pathophysiology of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Due to its significant function in monoamine catecholamine and myelin synthesis, brain iron concentration is of primary interest in investigating iron dysregulation in ADHD. This study reviewed evidence of brain iron abnormalities in children and adolescents with ADHD using magnetic resonance imaging methods, such as relaxometry and quantitative susceptibility mapping, to assess brain iron estimates. The study was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

A literature search was performed for studies published between January 1, 2008, and July 7, 2023, in Medline, Scopus, and ProQuest. Regions of interest, brain iron index values, and phenotypical information were extracted from the relevant studies. The risk of bias was assessed using a modified version of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute quality assessment tool. Seven cross-sectional studies comparing brain iron estimates in children with ADHD to neurotypical children were included. Significantly reduced brain iron content in medication-naïve children with ADHD was a consistent finding. Two studies found that psychostimulant use may increase and normalize brain iron concentration in children with ADHD. The findings were consistent across the studies despite differing methodologies and may lay the early foundation for recognizing a potential biomarker in ADHD, although longitudinal prospective neuroimaging studies using advanced techniques are needed to further substantiate these findings.

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^111sFJG3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on iron deficiency anemia:

- **Definition**: IDA is a form of anemia that results from an inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis and is defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal, with evidence of low body iron stores.

- **Pathophysiology**: IDA can be caused by increased iron demand (pregnancy, infancy), insufficient iron intake, decreased iron absorption (inflammatory bowel disease, gastrectomy), chronic blood loss (menorrhagia, systemic bleeding, hookworm infection), drugs (NSAIDs, corticosteroids), genetics (iron-refractory IDA), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (chronic kidney disease).

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of iron deficiency ranges from 4.5% to 18.0%, while the prevalence of IDA is estimated at 2.9%.

- **Disease course**: IDA typically presents with hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes. Clinical manifestations are related to the severity of the anemia and may additionally include restless leg syndrome, decreased quality of life, and increased maternal and newborn mortality.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Iron deficiency is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. It is also a risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease. IDA is associated with morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.

### Serum or plasma ferritin concentration as an index of iron deficiency and overload [^1157g8j4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Reference standard indices of iron deficiency and iron overload are generally invasive, expensive, and can be unpleasant or occasionally risky. Ferritin is an iron storage protein, and its concentration in the plasma or serum reflects iron stores; low ferritin indicates iron deficiency, while elevated ferritin indicates a risk of iron overload. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase protein, and its levels are elevated in inflammation and infection. The use of ferritin as a diagnostic test for iron deficiency and overload is a common clinical practice.

- **Objectives**: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ferritin concentrations (serum or plasma) for detecting iron deficiency and the risk of iron overload in primary and secondary iron-loading syndromes.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases (as of 10 June 2020): DARE (Cochrane Library) Issue 2 of 4, 2015; HTA (Cochrane Library) Issue 4 of 4, 2016; CENTRAL (Cochrane Library) Issue 6 of 12, 2020; MEDLINE (OVID) 1946 to 9 June 2020; Embase (OVID) 1947 to week 23, 2020; CINAHL (Ebsco) 1982 to June 2020; Web of Science (ISI) SCI, SSCI, CPCI-exp & CPCI-SSH to June 2020; POPLINE 16/8/18; Open Grey (10/6/20); TRoPHI (10/6/20); Bibliomap (10/6/20); IBECS (10/6/20); SCIELO (10/6/20); Global Index Medicus (10/6/20) AIM, IMSEAR, WPRIM, IMEMR, LILACS (10/6/20); PAHO (10/6/20); WHOLIS (10/6/20); IndMED (16/8/18); and Native Health Research Database (10/6/20). We also searched two trials registers and contacted relevant organizations for unpublished studies.

### Harmonization of blood-based indicators of iron status: Making the hard work matter [^117FwaKj]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). High credibility.

Blood-based indicators that are used in the assessment of iron status are assumed to be accurate. In practice, inaccuracies in these measurements exist and stem from bias and variability. For example, the analytic variability of serum ferritin measurements across laboratories is very high (> 15%), which increases the rate of misclassification in clinical and epidemiologic studies. The procedures that are used in laboratory medicine to minimize bias and variability could be used effectively in clinical research studies, particularly in the evaluation of iron deficiency and its associated anemia in pregnancy and early childhood and in characterizing states of iron repletion and excess.

The harmonization and standardization of traditional and novel bioindicators of iron status will allow results from clinical studies to be more meaningfully translated into clinical practice by providing a firm foundation for clinical laboratories to set appropriate cutoffs. In addition, proficiency testing monitors the performance of the methods over time. It is important that measures of iron status be evaluated, validated, and performed in a manner that is consistent with standard procedures in laboratory medicine.

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^114k8Tww]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, particularly concerning patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the management of recurrence, the ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend initiating re-treatment with intravenous (IV) iron as soon as serum ferritin drops below 100 mcg/L or hemoglobin falls below 12–13 g/dL (depending on gender) after the successful treatment of IDA with IV iron.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116VTxiw]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis is based on documentation of increased iron stores, demonstrated by elevated serum ferritin levels, which reflects an increase in hepatic iron content. Hemochromatosis can be further defined genotypically by the familial occurrence of iron overload associated with C282Y homozygosity or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity. Serologic iron markers, such as transferrin saturation (TS) and ferritin, are widely available, and the majority of patients with hemochromatosis are now identified while still asymptomatic and without evidence of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis.

Certain high-risk groups should be targeted for evaluation, including those with a family history of hemochromatosis, those with suspected organ involvement, and individuals with incidental detection of biochemical and/or radiological abnormalities suggestive of iron overload. It is recommended that all patients with abnormal liver function have iron studies conducted during their evaluation. An algorithm, modified from the version used in the previous American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines, provides further direction regarding testing and treatment for hemochromatosis.

The initial approach to diagnosis involves indirect markers of iron stores, specifically transferrin saturation (TS) or unsaturated iron-binding capacity, along with serum ferritin. TS is calculated from the ratio of serum iron to total iron-binding capacity.

### Microcytosis and possible early iron deficiency in paediatric inpatients: A retrospective audit [^112Fo2C9]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

The practice in our haematology lab is to report paediatric results as abnormal when compared against adult ranges only. This might lead to potentially abnormal results being missed by clinicians who do not then make the effort to check the abnormal results against the age-corrected ranges or who are not familiar with them. A change in haematology lab practice, whereby results from patients under the age of 16 were reported against standardized age-specific ranges based on their date of birth, would avoid this.

For our audit, we were able to track all FBC results ordered from our ward for the relevant time periods through the computerised haematology results system. We are therefore confident that we included every paediatric inpatient in the age range specified with a low MCV result. Information was incomplete for only one patient from the second audit period whose notes were unobtainable. Our results are applicable only to hospital paediatric inpatients and are not representative of the incidence, treatment, and follow-up of microcytosis and iron deficiency in the community setting.

The age-specific MCV limits that were used were taken from an American textbook of paediatric haematology since no age-specific limits have been formulated by our local haematology laboratory for our population. It would have been better to use local norms. Our audit relied upon the subjective classification of illnesses in order to categorise MCV results by explicability and hence was subject to operator bias. However, this was minimized by only having two analysers who both use the same criteria.

### Guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia [^117GJGKa]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) occurs in 2–5% of adult men and postmenopausal women in the developed world and is a common cause of referral to gastroenterologists. Gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss from colonic cancer or gastric cancer, as well as malabsorption in coeliac disease, are the most important causes that need to be considered.

- **Defining iron deficiency anaemia**: The lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test should be used to define anaemia (B). Any level of anaemia should be investigated in the presence of iron deficiency (B). The lower the haemoglobin, the more likely there is to be serious underlying pathology, and the more urgent is the need for investigation (B). Red cell indices provide a sensitive indication of iron deficiency in the absence of chronic disease or haemoglobinopathy (A). Haemoglobin electrophoresis is recommended when microcytosis and hypochromia are present in patients of appropriate ethnic background to prevent unnecessary GI investigation (C). Serum ferritin is the most powerful test for iron deficiency (A).

- **Investigations**: Upper and lower GI investigations should be considered in all postmenopausal female and male patients where IDA has been confirmed, unless there is a history of significant overt non-GI blood loss (A). All patients should be screened for coeliac disease (B). If oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) is performed as the initial GI investigation, only the presence of advanced gastric cancer or coeliac disease should deter lower GI investigation (B). In patients aged over 50 or with marked anaemia, it is essential to prioritise comprehensive diagnostic procedures.

### Monoferric [^115wwb21]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Monoferric for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) were evaluated in two randomized, open-label, actively controlled clinical trials conducted on a total of 3,050 patients with IDA of different etiologies.

- **Iron deficiency anemia in patients with intolerance or unsatisfactory response to oral iron**:
	- In Trial 1 (NCT02940886), 1,512 adult patients with IDA caused by different etiologies, who had documented intolerance or lacked a response to oral iron, or had a screening hemoglobin (Hb) measurement low enough to require the repletion of iron stores, were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive Monoferric or iron sucrose. Eligibility criteria included adult patients aged ≥ 18 years with baseline Hb ≤ 11 g/dL, transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20%, and serum ferritin < 100 ng/mL. The median age of patients was 44 years (range 18–91), and 89% were women. The efficacy of Monoferric was established based upon the change in Hb from baseline to week 8. Non-inferiority was demonstrated for this change.

- **Iron deficiency anemia in patients with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease**:
	- Trial 2 included patients with IDA who had non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD). In these two 8-week trials, patients were randomized 2:1 to treatment with Monoferric or iron sucrose, with Monoferric being intravenously administered as a single dose of 1,000 mg.

### Screening of iron deficiency anaemia in early childhood [^113kgfmx]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Two systematic reviews were recently commissioned by the USPSTF and the UK NSC to update their 2006 and 2012 recommendations, respectively, based on the latest available evidence.

The USPSTF review included trials and controlled observational studies assessing screening in children between six and 24 months of age conducted in developed countries, as well as the effectiveness and harms of routine iron supplementation, and the association between a change in iron status and improvement in child health outcomes. Studies conducted in resource-poor populations were excluded. Notably, the focus was on studies that involved iron supplementation and treatment regimens commonly used in clinical practice in the US. The literature search was conducted up to August 2014 with the aim to identify new studies and update the previous USPSTF systematic reviews. Review authors identified ten new studies addressing routine iron supplementation (beyond the scope of this summary) and no new study addressing any of the key questions established on screening for IDA. An update of the search was conducted in June 2018 and identified one study, but this study did not address the key questions on IDA screening. For each key question below, we therefore summarized the available evidence from studies identified from the previous USPSTF systematic reviews.

The UK NSC structured the review in four key questions to examine the evidence supporting IDA screening in children under five years of age. The review authors included different types of studies for each.

### Serum ferritin as an indicator of iron status: What do we need to know [^111C8V5M]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017).

Determining iron status in pregnancy and young children is essential for both clinical and public health practices. Clinical diagnosis of iron deficiency (ID) through sampling of bone marrow to identify the absence of body iron stores is impractical in most cases. Serum ferritin (SF) concentrations are the most commonly used indicator for determining ID, and low SF concentrations reflect a state of iron depletion. However, there is considerable variation in SF cutoffs recommended by different expert groups to diagnose ID. Moreover, the cutoffs used in different clinical laboratories are heterogeneous.

Few studies have assessed the diagnostic test accuracy to establish the sensitivity and specificity of SF compared with key gold standards, such as absent bone marrow iron stores, increased intestinal iron absorption, and hemoglobin response to SF, among non-inflamed outpatient populations. The limited data available suggest the commonly recommended SF cutoff from 30 years ago does not reflect ethnic or geographic diversity and was established in an era when laboratory methods did not reflect present practices. Future studies to define appropriate SF cutoffs are urgently needed and would also provide an opportunity to compare this indicator with other established and emerging iron indexes. Furthermore, future work would benefit from focusing on elucidating cutoffs and indexes.

### Iron deficiency resolution and time to resolution in an American health system [^11589t2f]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) is a global health problem with consequences independent of anemia, including impaired cognition and exercise tolerance. The time from laboratory diagnosis to resolution of ID has not been defined. In a retrospective review of electronic medical record data from a Minnesota statewide health system, we identified patients with ID (ferritin level ≤ 25 ng/mL). Patients with at least one follow-up ferritin level within three years were included. Patients with a subsequent ferritin of ≥ 50 ng/mL were classified as having resolved ID. Descriptive statistics and time-to-event analyses were used to determine the proportion of ID resolution and time to resolution and to evaluate characteristics predictive of resolution.

We identified 13,084 patients with ID between 2010 and 2020. We found that 5,485 (41.9%) had resolution within three years of diagnosis, whereas 7,599 (58.1%) had no documented resolution. The median time to resolution was 1.9 years (interquartile range, 0.8–3.9). Factors associated with a greater likelihood of resolution included age of ≥ 60 years (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.44–1.69), male sex (aHR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.48–1.70), and treatment with intravenous iron (aHR, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.66–3.30). Black race was associated with a lower likelihood of resolution (aHR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66–0.80). We observed a high proportion of persistent ID and prolonged time to resolution overall, with a greater risk of lack of resolution among females and Black individuals. Targeted knowledge translation interventions are required to facilitate improvements in outcomes.
