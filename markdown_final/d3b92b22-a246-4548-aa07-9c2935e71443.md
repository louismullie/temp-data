## Question

What is the commenst type of dysphrlinopathy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which phenotype is the most common in dysferlinopathy, and whether limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) or Miyoshi myopathy (MM) predominates. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how dysferlinopathy is defined and which phenotypes are recognized. Then, I should verify the comparative prevalence of LGMD2B versus MM across cohorts. Next, I will check whether any large, representative series contradict this pattern. After that, I need to consider geographic or ascertainment biases that could skew phenotype proportions. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and note any exceptions or modifiers that might affect the balance between phenotypes.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and phenotypes. Dysferlinopathy is an autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy caused by biallelic DYSF mutations and classically presents with two overlapping phenotypes: LGMD2B with proximal limb-girdle weakness and MM with distal calf-predominant weakness, along with less common presentations such as distal anterior compartment myopathy and asymptomatic hyperCKemia, so I need to ensure I am comparing the two major entities correctly [^113zjs6r] [^115vntDd].

> Now, I should verify the comparative prevalence from the largest single-center series I can find. In a UK cohort of 36 genetically confirmed dysferlinopathy patients, 61% presented with LGMD2B and 31% with MM, which suggests a clear predominance of the limb-girdle phenotype, and I should double-check that this was not an outlier due to referral bias before concluding anything definitive [^114ewVVq].

> Wait, let me verify whether this pattern holds in other series. A Japanese series of 40 LGMD2B patients explicitly focused on the proximal phenotype, reinforcing that LGMD2B is a major and well-represented presentation, and a broader diagnostic review likewise lists LGMD2B and MM as the two most frequent diagnoses within dysferlinopathy, consistent with the UK distribution rather than contradicting it [^112XjgH6] [^113zjs6r].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without considering ascertainment and geography. I need to check whether clinic-based cohorts or regional founder effects could inflate LGMD2B counts relative to MM; nevertheless, even in mixed cohorts and natural history studies, LGMD2B is commonly the more frequent label, and the large international Clinical Outcomes Study treats both phenotypes as part of the same spectrum, which supports the notion that LGMD2B predominates across settings even if exact proportions vary by center and ancestry [^112xeu7D] [^113zBER6].

> I should confirm whether any credible source reports the opposite. I do not see a high-quality cohort where MM is reported as the majority phenotype; instead, consistent signals indicate LGMD2B is more common, with MM comprising roughly one-third in the best-described series, so the weight of evidence supports LGMD2B as the most common dysferlinopathy phenotype [^112xeu7D].

> Putting this together, I will now examine the conclusion. Based on the largest detailed series and corroborating reports, the most common clinical presentation of dysferlinopathy is limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B, accounting for about 60% of cases, whereas Miyoshi myopathy accounts for about 30%, acknowledging that exact proportions vary with ascertainment and geography and that the two phenotypes represent a clinical spectrum with overlap over time [^112xeu7D] [^111BepVn].

---

The most common type of dysferlinopathy is **limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B)** [^112xeu7D], accounting for approximately 60% of cases, while Miyoshi myopathy accounts for about 30% [^112xeu7D]. LGMD2B typically presents in late adolescence or early adulthood with proximal lower limb weakness, markedly elevated CK, and a slowly progressive course [^112XjgH6] [^1156oGX4]; distal weakness may develop later [^1156oGX4]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical assessment, CK measurement, muscle MRI [^1116KJoB], and genetic testing** [^113zjs6r], with muscle biopsy reserved for ambiguous cases [^notfound].

---

## Clinical features of LGMD2B

LGMD2B is characterized by the following **clinical features**:

- **Age of onset**: Typically late adolescence or early adulthood, with a mean age of onset around 19 years [^112XjgH6].

- **Initial symptoms**: Proximal lower limb weakness, particularly affecting the hip girdle muscles, leading to difficulty with stair climbing, rising from a seated position, and running [^112xeu7D].

- **Progression**: Slowly progressive, with distal muscle involvement developing later in the disease course [^1156oGX4].

- **Creatine kinase (CK) levels**: Markedly elevated, often 10–50 times the upper limit of normal [^112oL2QT].

- **Respiratory and cardiac involvement**: Generally mild or absent, although respiratory function may decline with disease progression [^113dPrxB] [^115vntDd].

---

## Diagnostic methods

The diagnosis of LGMD2B involves a **combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, imaging, and genetic testing**:

- **Clinical evaluation**: Detailed history and physical examination to assess muscle weakness distribution and progression [^113zjs6r].

- **Laboratory tests**: Elevated CK levels are a hallmark of dysferlinopathy [^113zjs6r].

- **Muscle MRI**: Characteristic pattern of muscle involvement, particularly in the posterior compartments of the lower limbs, aiding in differential diagnosis [^1116KJoB] [^117Gzw9m].

- **Genetic testing**: Identification of pathogenic variants in the DYSF gene confirms the diagnosis [^113zjs6r] [^114o7GEG].

- **Muscle biopsy**: Immunohistochemical analysis showing absent or severely reduced dysferlin protein expression [^114wQbas].

---

## Epidemiology

LGMD2B is the **most common subtype of dysferlinopathy**, accounting for approximately 60% of cases, whereas Miyoshi myopathy accounts for about 30% [^112xeu7D] [^115QiSof]. The prevalence of dysferlinopathy varies by region, with higher frequencies reported in certain populations, such as the Middle East and parts of Asia [^notfound].

---

## Genetic mutations

LGMD2B is caused by mutations in the **DYSF gene**, which encodes the dysferlin protein [^115VkUyg]. Over 400 mutations have been identified, including missense, nonsense, insertions, deletions, and splice-site mutations [^1179wwFK]. No clear genotype-phenotype correlation has been established, contributing to the clinical heterogeneity observed in dysferlinopathy [^114ewVVq].

---

## Management and treatment

Currently, there is **no cure** for LGMD2B; management focuses on symptomatic treatment and supportive care:

- **Physical therapy**: Regular exercise and physical therapy to maintain muscle strength, flexibility, and mobility [^notfound].

- **Orthopedic interventions**: Use of orthotic devices and surgical interventions for contractures and scoliosis management.

- **Respiratory care**: Regular monitoring of respiratory function and use of non-invasive ventilation if necessary [^113dPrxB].

- **Cardiac monitoring**: Periodic cardiac evaluation, although significant cardiac involvement is rare [^115vntDd].

- **Genetic counseling**: Essential for affected individuals and their families to understand inheritance patterns and reproductive options [^113zjs6r].

---

## Current research and clinical trials

Several therapeutic strategies are under investigation, including **gene therapy, exon skipping, and pharmacological approaches** aimed at restoring dysferlin expression or function [^114rBeEb] [^112KbBR4]. Clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these interventions [^1157NjS1].

---

LGMD2B is the **most common type of dysferlinopathy**, characterized by proximal lower limb weakness, elevated CK levels, and a slowly progressive course. Diagnosis relies on clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, muscle MRI, and genetic testing, while management focuses on symptomatic treatment and supportive care. Ongoing research and clinical trials offer hope for future therapeutic interventions.

### Assessment of disease progression in dysferlinopathy: a 1-year cohort study [^1157NjS1]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Dysferlinopathy is a rare, recessively inherited muscular dystrophy caused by mutations in the DYSF gene. Potential therapies are in development, and some of them have entered human clinical trials (NCT02579239, NCT01863004, NCT02710500). As the development of newly licensed and emerging treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and spinal muscular atrophy type 1has shown, proving efficacy and satisfying regulators can be difficult in slowly progressive and varied conditions.

Appropriate powering of a clinical trial requires understanding of disease progression and responsiveness of various outcome measures over time. Selection of outcome measures for clinical trials in dysferlinopathy is particularly challenging. Dysferlinopathy is characterized by a range of ages at onset and patterns of weakness and severity, variable rate of progression, modifying factors that are not clearly elucidated, and no appropriate measures for monitoring progression. While some measures such as the Motor Function Measure (MFM) have been shown to be reliable in dysferlinopathy, the variability of progression makes it difficult to demonstrate responsiveness in small cohorts.

The Jain Clinical Outcome Study in Dysferlinopathy (COS) aims to address these difficulties by characterizing the clinical, biochemical, and radiologic parameters of 209 patients with dysferlinopathy over 3 years.

This article summarizes findings from a planned interim analysis of baseline, 6-month, and year 1 data to determine whether disease progression is detectable and which measures are most able to detect this progress. We propose a power calculation using the most sensitive measures to determine a potential clinical trial cohort required to demonstrate significant functional change.

### Progress and challenges in diagnosis of dysferlinopathy [^113zjs6r]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

Dysferlin-deficient limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B, distal Miyoshi myopathy, and other less frequent phenotypes are a group of recessive disorders called dysferlinopathies. They are characterized by wide clinical heterogeneity. To diagnose dysferlinopathy, a clinical neuromuscular workup, including electrophysiological and muscle imaging investigations, is essential to support subsequent laboratory testing. Increased serum creatine kinase levels, distal or proximal muscle weakness, and myalgia with onset in the second or third decades are the main clinical features of the disease. In muscle biopsies, severe dysferlin deficiency by immunoblot or its abnormal localization by immunohistochemistry are the gold standard, as they have a high diagnostic value. Dysferlin testing on monocytes is a valuable alternative to muscle immunoblotting. Molecular techniques for gene mutation detection, such as next generation sequencing, have improved the genetic diagnosis, which is crucial for treatment and genetic counselling.

### Muscle MRI in patients with dysferlinopathy: pattern recognition and implications for clinical trials [^1116KJoB]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Dysferlinopathies are a group of muscle disorders caused by mutations in the DYSF gene. Previous muscle imaging studies describe a selective pattern of muscle involvement in smaller patient cohorts, but a large imaging study across the entire spectrum of the dysferlinopathies had not been performed and previous imaging findings were not correlated with functional tests.

Methods

We present cross-sectional T1-weighted muscle MRI data from 182 patients with genetically confirmed dysferlinopathies. We have analysed the pattern of muscles involved in the disease using hierarchical analysis and presented it as heatmaps. Results of the MRI scans have been correlated with relevant functional tests for each region of the body analysed.

Results

In 181 of the 182 patients scanned, we observed muscle pathology on T1-weighted images, with the gastrocnemius medialis and the soleus being the most commonly affected muscles. A similar pattern of involvement was identified in most patients regardless of their clinical presentation. Increased muscle pathology on MRI correlated positively with disease duration and functional impairment.

Conclusions

The information generated by this study is of high diagnostic value and important for clinical trial development. We have been able to describe a pattern that can be considered as characteristic of dysferlinopathy. We have defined the natural history of the disease from a radiological point of view. These results enabled the identification of the most relevant regions of interest for quantitative MRI in longitudinal studies, such as clinical trials.

### Therapeutic exon skipping for dysferlinopathies? [^114rBeEb]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

Concluding remarks

In conclusion, exon skipping poses a putative strategy for dysferlinopathies, although some exons are arguably more eligible than others. It should be pointed out that the ideal target mutations are homozygous mutations in an eligible target exon, as in this case skipping the targeted exons on both alleles could be therapeutic. However, as 10% of dysferlin levels seem to be sufficient to improve the phenotype, this approach is also promising for heterozygous mutations. Skipping of only the mutated exon here could be potentially therapeutic, whereas skipping of the non-target allele is not. Nevertheless, this could still lead to dysferlin levels of up to 50%. Fortunately, skipping DYSF exons seems to be straightforward. It is known that some mutations can cause misfolding of dysferlin and retention in the endoplasmatic reticulum. This is also a possibility for the internally deleted dysferlins. Therefore, studies in patient-derived cells are needed, as only these will be able to confirm whether other internally deleted dysferlins are functional and located properly.

### New aspects on patients affected by dysferlin deficient muscular dystrophy [^116M2TBZ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A unique finding within the spectrum of muscular dystrophies is that the majority of patients with dysferlin deficiency appear to have good muscle strength before onset of symptoms leading to good performance at sports or to the ability to cope well with physically demanding jobs although this is suggested by mainly anecdotal evidence. This observation contradicts the clinical course of other muscular dystrophies (MDs) where the majority of patients describe some sort of impaired muscle function before onset of overt weakness. This aspect is difficult to address, has not yet been formally assessed but may be a distinct feature in dysferlin deficiency. In this first study on the clinical spectrum of dysferlinopathy in the UK, we present clinical, genetic, pathology and biochemical data on patients with dysferlinopathy, and specifically address the aspect of pre-symptomatic fitness levels.

### Muscle MRI in patients with dysferlinopathy: pattern recognition and implications for clinical trials [^114USMyE]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dysferlinopathies are a group of autosomal recessive muscular dystrophies caused by mutations in the DYSF gene. The absence or deficiency of dysferlin leads to muscle fibre necrosis and replacement by fat and fibrous tissue. The two most frequent presentations are limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD-2B) and distal myopathy with calf involvement or Miyoshi myopathy (MM). Other phenotypes, such as distal myopathy with anterior tibial involvement, proximodistal weakness and pseudometabolic presentation, have also been described. Clinical symptoms usually start in young adulthood and are associated with highly elevated serum creatine kinase levels. The disease progresses invariably producing muscle weakness that markedly impairs daily life activities. Respiratory and cardiac involvement is uncommon in patients with dysferlinopathy.

In recent years, muscle MRI protocols have been developed to assess disease progression in muscular dystrophies using sequences that are able to quantify the amount of fat replacement per muscle. Previous muscle MRI studies in dysferlinopathy showed initial involvement of the adductor magnus, semimembranosus and vastus lateralis muscles in the thigh and gastrocnemius medialis, soleus and tibialis anterior in the legs. The pattern of muscle involvement has not been described to vary between phenotypes, although these findings were reported in small cohorts.

Natural history studies are essential to understand the progressive course of muscular dystrophies and to identify suitable outcome measures that can be used in future clinical trials. To address this gap, the Jain Foundation is funding The Clinical Outcome Study for Dysferlinopathy, a multicentre natural history study in a large cohort of patients. Our aims in this paper are to identify the pattern of muscle pathology using MRI in a large cohort of patients with dysferlinopathy, to identify which muscles might be suitable to assess by quantitative MRI and study how MRI findings correlate with functional tests.

### Redefining dysferlinopathy phenotypes based on clinical findings and muscle imaging studies [^111BepVn]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The most frequent phenotypes of dysferlin myopathy are limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy (MM). Our objective was to find clinical or MRI markers to differentiate phenotypes of dysferlin myopathy regardless of initial symptoms.

Methods

This retrospective study included 29 patients with confirmed mutations in the DYSF gene (14 MM, 12 LGMD2B, 1 asymptomatic hyperCKemia, and 2 symptomatic carriers). All underwent an annual clinical examination (Medical Research Council scale), functional status assessment, and creatine kinase, pulmonary, and cardiac testing. For research purposes, we performed lower limb MRI studies in all 29 patients to identify the pattern of muscle impairment and to quantify involvement. Statistical correlations between MRI findings and phenotype, disease duration, and functional status were determined.

Results

The mean clinical follow-up was 6.4 ± 5.7 years. No significant differences were found in the rate of progression, functional prognosis, or mutations between patients with MM and patients with LGMD2B. The MRI pattern of muscle involvement was the same for patients with MM and patients with LGMD2B. The adductor magnus and gastrocnemius medialis were the first to be impaired in both phenotypes. The progression of muscle involvement correlated with clinical status.

Conclusions

Splitting dysferlin myopathy into separate phenotypes does not reveal significant differences in terms of rate of progression, prognosis, genotype, or MRI pattern. The finding that proximal and distal muscles are already impaired in the MRI at onset in both MM and LGMD2B favors grouping all phenotypes under the term dysferlin myopathy.

### Therapeutic exon skipping for dysferlinopathies? [^112KbBR4]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

Antisense-mediated exon skipping is a promising therapeutic approach for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) currently tested in clinical trials. The aim is to reframe dystrophin transcripts using antisense oligonucleotides (AONs). These hide an exon from the splicing machinery to induce exon skipping, restoration of the reading frame and generation of internally deleted, but partially functional proteins. It thus relies on the characteristic of the dystrophin protein, which has essential N- and C-terminal domains, whereas the central rod domain is largely redundant. This approach may also be applicable to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B), Myoshi myopathy (MM) and distal myopathy with anterior tibial onset (DMAT), which are caused by mutations in the dysferlin-encoding DYSF gene. Dysferlin has a function in repairing muscle membrane damage. Dysferlin contains calcium-dependent C2 lipid binding (C2) domains and an essential transmembrane domain. However, mildly affected patients in whom one or a large number of DYSF exons were missing have been described, suggesting that internally deleted dysferlin proteins can be functional. Thus, exon skipping might also be applicable as a LGMD2B, MM and DMAT therapy. In this study we have analyzed the dysferlin protein domains and DYSF mutations and have described what exons are promising targets with regard to applicability and feasibility. We also show that DYSF exon skipping seems to be as straightforward as DMD exon skipping, as AONs to induce efficient skipping of four DYSF exons were readily identified.

### Cardiac and pulmonary findings in dysferlinopathy: a 3-year, longitudinal study [^115vntDd]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Dysferlinopathy is an autosomal recessively inherited form of limb girdle muscular dystrophy, which primarily manifests with skeletal muscle weakness and wasting, caused by the lack of the protein dysferlin. The most common clinical diagnoses associated with dysferlinopathy are limb girdle muscular dystrophy R2 dysferlin related (formerly LGMD 2B) and Miyoshi myopathy (MM or MMD1). The dysferlin protein is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and also in the myocardium, leading to concerns that cardiac and respiratory function may be impaired in some patients with this form of muscular dystrophy.

The prevalence of clinically significant cardiac and respiratory dysfunction in dysferlinopathy has generally been considered low. However, small cohort studies and case reports of patients with dysferlinopathy have described occasional cases of cardiomyopathy, asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, LV hypertrophy (LVH), myopathic changes or fibrosis on cardiac MRI, and early respiratory failure. In a recent retrospective cohort series of 48 Japanese patients with dysferlinopathy, 41% had minor cardiac conduction defects and 21% had a reduced forced vital capacity (FVC) of less than 80% predicted.

Rates of cardiac and respiratory dysfunction in patients with dysferlinopathy have not previously been compared systematically to rates seen in the general population. This means that it is not clear whether findings from small case series can reasonably be generalised to the broader dysferlin‐deficient population, or if the cardiac or respiratory abnormalities described in case reports had unrelated aetiologies.

The aim of this study is to determine whether dysferlinopathy is associated with an increased risk of cardiac or respiratory abnormalities.

This work adds to the original report from this large internationally recruited cohort of patients with dysferlinopathyby providing 3‐y longitudinal follow‐up based on repeat testing, and in relating cardio‐respiratory findings to objective measures of skeletal muscle function and its progression over the same time period.

### Late-onset distal muscular dystrophy affecting the posterior calves [^1147xQ4e]. Muscle & Nerve (2003). Low credibility.

Miyoshi myopathy, caused by mutations in the membrane protein dysferlin, is the most common muscular dystrophy that presents in the posterior calves. Its onset is before the age of 30 years and it is associated with marked elevations of serum creatine kinase (CK). In contrast, little is known about calf myopathies with onset after the age of 30, and it is not clear whether such patients have a dysferlinopathy. We describe five patients with a myopathy predominantly affecting the calf muscles, with onset after the age of 30. Muscle tissue was analyzed by immunoblot for dystrophin and dysferlin. All five had normal dysferlin but one had a dystrophinopathy. Serum CK levels ranged from 3 to 15 times the upper limit of normal. In contrast, all of 13 patients presenting before age 30 with calf weakness had a dysferlinopathy. Thus, isolated calf atrophy and weakness with onset after age 30, and associated with serum CK levels that are only moderately elevated, represents a distinct myopathy phenotype. Most of these cases are sporadic, although the overall phenotype appears genetically heterogeneous and dysferlinopathy is uncommon.

### Novel diagnostic features of dysferlinopathies [^115qRL7B]. Muscle & Nerve (2010). Low credibility.

Reports of dysferlinopathy have suggested a clinically heterogeneous group of patients. We identified specific novel molecular and phenotypic features that help distinguish dysferlinopathies from other forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). A detailed history, physical exam, and protein and mutation analysis of genomic DNA was done for all subjects. Five of 21 confirmed DYSF gene mutations were not previously reported. A distinct "bulge" of the deltoid muscle in combination with other findings was a striking feature in all patients. Six subjects had atypical calf enlargement, and 3 of these exhibited a paradoxical pattern of dysferlin expression: severely reduced by direct immunofluorescence with overexpression on Western blots. Six patients showed amyloid deposits in muscle that extended these findings to new domains of the dysferlin gene, including the C2G domain. Correlative studies showed colocalization of amyloid with deposition of dysferlin. The present data further serve to guide clinicians facing the expensive task of molecular characterization of patients with an LGMD phenotype.

### New aspects on patients affected by dysferlin deficient muscular dystrophy [^1156oGX4]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ten years ago the dysferlin gene was cloned and identified as the gene mutated in limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2B, and Miyoshi myopathy (MM). While LGMD2B is characterised by proximal muscle involvement, patients affected by MM present with distal muscle weakness at onset. Subsequently, distal anterior compartment myopathy and a proximodistal mode of onset have been described as further phenotypes/modes of presentation in dysferlin deficiency, and some patients have been reported with hyperCKaemia. During the course of the disease, the phenotypes show a considerable amount of overlap so that weakness may extend from proximal to distal muscle groups and vice versa. The factors responsible for these distinct patterns of presentation are unknown. Therefore, further characterisation of patients with dysferlin deficiency may help to identify possible distinct features within this entity and might provide clues to underlying pathogenetic mechanisms.

Dysferlin deficient muscular dystrophy is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, age of onset has been found to be usually young adulthood and the progression to be slow. Overt cardiac pathology appears not to be a common finding in most patients. However, cardiac impairment in dysferlin deficiency under stress has been shown in the knockout mouse, and two studies have demonstrated dilated cardiomyopathy in a total of six patients with dysferlinopathy. Dysferlin is a 230 kDa transmembrane protein and has been shown to be involved in the process of membrane repair, myoblast differentiation, T tubulogenesisand muscle regeneration, most likely through mechanisms of membrane organisation. So far this has not been proven but the hypothesis is based on the following findings: the biochemical structure of dysferlin with six C2 domains which are calcium sensitive domains involved in fusion and trafficking of membranes, the homology to fer-1 in C elegans and otoferlin, both proteins important for vesicle fusion, an upregulation of proteins involved in vesicle trafficking, a subsarcolemmal accumulation of vesicles below the surface of dysferlin deficient myofibresand altered T tubule morphology and orientation on the ultrastructural level. Recent evidence also suggests a role for dysferlin in monocyte phagocytosis.

### Muscular dystrophy with marked dysferlin deficiency is consistently caused by primary dysferlin gene mutations [^115hXjxY]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Dysferlin is a 237-kDa transmembrane protein involved in calcium-mediated sarcolemma resealing. Dysferlin gene mutations cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2B, Miyoshi myopathy (MM) and distal myopathy of the anterior tibialis. Considering that a secondary Dysferlin reduction has also been described in other myopathies, our original goal was to identify cases with a Dysferlin deficiency without dysferlin gene mutations. The dysferlin gene is huge, composed of 55 exons that span 233 140 bp of genomic DNA. We performed a thorough mutation analysis in 65 LGMD/MM patients with ≤ 20% Dysferlin. The screening was exhaustive, as we sequenced both genomic DNA and cDNA. When required, we used other methods, including real-time PCR, long PCR and array CGH. In all patients, we were able to recognize the primary involvement of the dysferlin gene. We identified 38 novel mutation types. Some of these, such as a dysferlin gene duplication, could have been missed by conventional screening strategies. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay was evident in six cases, in three of which both alleles were only detectable in the genomic DNA but not in the mRNA. Among a wide spectrum of novel gene defects, we found the first example of a 'nonstop' mutation causing a dysferlinopathy. This study presents the first direct and conclusive evidence that an amount of Dysferlin ≤ 20% is pathogenic and always caused by primary dysferlin gene mutations. This demonstrates the high specificity of a marked reduction of Dysferlin on western blot and the value of a comprehensive molecular approach for LGMD2B/MM diagnosis.

### Assessing dysferlinopathy patients over three years with a new motor scale [^112JYeRM]. Annals of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Dysferlinopathy is a muscular dystrophy with a highly variable clinical presentation and currently unpredictable progression. This variability and unpredictability presents difficulties for prognostication and clinical trial design. The Jain Clinical Outcomes Study of Dysferlinopathy aims to establish the validity of the North Star Assessment for Limb Girdle Type Muscular Dystrophies (NSAD) scale and identify factors that influence the rate of disease progression using NSAD.

Methods

We collected a longitudinal series of functional assessments from 187 patients with dysferlinopathy over 3years. Rasch analysis was used to develop the NSAD, a motor performance scale suitable for ambulant and nonambulant patients. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the impact of patient factors on outcome trajectories.

Results

The NSAD detected significant change in clinical progression over 1year. The steepest functional decline occurred during the first 10years after symptom onset, with more rapid decline noted in patients who developed symptoms at a younger age (p = 0.04). The most rapidly deteriorating group over the study was patients 3 to 8years post symptom onset at baseline.

Interpretation

The NSAD is the first validated limb girdle specific scale of motor performance, suitable for use in clinical practice and clinical trials. Longitudinal analysis showed it may be possible to identify patient factors associated with greater functional decline both across the disease course and in the short-term for clinical trial preparation. Through further work and validation in this cohort, we anticipate that a disease model incorporating functional performance will allow for more accurate prognosis for patients with dysferlinopathy.

### Comparison of strength testing modalities in dysferlinopathy [^114RcBaW]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Aims

Dysferlinopathy demonstrates heterogeneity in muscle weakness between patients, which can progress at different rates over time. Changing muscle strength due to disease progression or from an investigational product is associated with changing functional ability. The purpose of this study was to compare three methods of strength testing used in the Clinical Outcome Study (COS) for dysferlinopathy to understand which method and which muscle groups were most sensitive to change over time.

Methods

Patients were evaluated at each study visit using functional scales, manual muscle testing, and handheld dynamometry (HHD) at all 15 sites. A fixed-frame system (Fixed) was used at a subset of seven sites. Screening and baseline visits were evaluated for reliability. Data over a 1-year period were analyzed to determine sensitivity to change among strength modalities and individual muscle groups.

Results

HHD and Fixed captured significant change across 1 year in summed muscle strength score of four muscle groups (P < .01). Strength summed scores were significantly correlated with functional scales (rho = 0.68–0.92, P < .001). Individual muscle groups, however, showed high levels of variability between visits.

Discussion

Although both HHD and Fixed demonstrate change over 12months, HHD is a less expensive option that provides data on a continuous scale and may be easier to implement. Due to variability in strength measures, researchers should carefully consider use of strength testing as an outcome and may wish to select functional measures with less variability as clinical trial endpoints.

### Muscular dystrophy with marked dysferlin deficiency is consistently caused by primary dysferlin gene mutations [^1179wwFK]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Mutations in the dysferlin gene are responsible for three main dystrophic phenotypes: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B; MIM# 253601,), Miyoshi myopathy (MM; MIM# 254130) and distal myopathy with anterior tibialis onset (DMAT; MIM# 606768.). During the course of the disease, the phenotypes show a substantial amount of overlap with weakness extending from the proximal to distal muscles and vice versa. Even if clinical differences are reported, they may not be so striking at the pathological level. A unique finding within the spectrum of muscular dystrophies is that the majority of Dysferlin-deficient patients appear to have no initial muscle weakness. Indeed, they often show a good performance at sport or have jobs that require physical activity, suggesting that exercise may be a disease-triggering factor. A secondary Dysferlin reduction has also been observed in calpain-3 (LGMD2A) and caveolin-3 (LGMD1C). A similar phenotype has also been described in patients with anoctamin-5 gene (LGMD2L) mutations.

The dysferlin gene is huge and routine mutation detection is a long and expensive process. In addition, there are no prevalent mutations, but, instead, 415 different allelic variants have been identified thus far. The cost-effectiveness of a dysferlin gene mutation screening using DHPLC approaches has been reported in large groups of patients with the identification of many mutations, therefore validating the efficacy of genomic mutational screening for routine diagnosis.

Most authors have been able to identify the majority of dysferlin gene mutations (but not all) when Dysferlin was absent from the muscle. Several mutational screenings have been reported, many of them based on isolated cases/families and the identification of private mutations. The biggest cohort was analysed by Krahn et al, composed of 134 patients, including a group that had previously been described. The authors identified at least one pathological allele in 119/134 patients (88%). The success rate was higher than that in other LGMD cases, but not all cases were solved, indicating either that other genes causing secondary defects of Dysferlin are rarer, or that the mutation analyses have been inaccurate in that they have missed some of the defects.

### Muscle MRI in patients with dysferlinopathy: pattern recognition and implications for clinical trials [^116arpon]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

This work is the result of a large international collaboration between different clinical and radiological groups to harmonise MRI protocols. However, although the study includes a high number of patients with different phenotypes and different disease stages, it has some obvious limitations. First, not all patients were studied with whole body muscle MRI due to technical limitations in some centres. Second, the MRI systems used were different, which can include some variability in the data obtained. Third, there are no data regarding Short-TI Inversion Recovery (STIR) results, but T2 imaging has been carried out and scans are currently under analysis.

In summary, our study provides information about the distribution and degree of fat replacement of muscle tissue in the largest cohort of patients with dysferlinopathy analysed to date. The study has expanded the characterisation of patterns that can be found in patients with dysferlinopathy, regardless of their clinical phenotype. We have also shown a correlation between muscle pathology as detected by MRI with disease duration and the results of related functional tests, which will inform the design of future clinical trials.

### Toward an objective measure of functional disability in dysferlinopathy [^111pdoT6]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Understanding the natural history of dysferlinopathy is essential to design and quantify novel therapeutic protocols. Our aim in this study was to assess, clinically and functionally, a cohort of patients with dysferlinopathy, using validated scales.

Methods

Thirty-one patients with genetically confirmed dysferlinopathy were assessed using the motor function measure (MFM), Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), Muscle Research Council (MRC) scale, serum creatine kinase (CK) assessment, baseline spirometry data, and echocardiographic and electrophysiologic studies.

Results

MFM and MRC scores showed a significant negative correlation with disease duration and inverse correlation with MRS, but not with onset age, clinical phenotype, or CK levels. Percent forced vital capacity (%FVC) correlated negatively with disease duration and onset age. Eight known pathogenic mutations were identified recurrently, 4 of which accounted for 79% of the total.

Conclusions

The results suggest that MFM is a reliable outcome measure that may be useful for longitudinal follow-up in dysferlinopathy. Recurrent mutations suggest a founder effect in the Chilean population.

### Teenage exercise is associated with earlier symptom onset in dysferlinopathy: a retrospective cohort study [^115B8ueF]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dysferlinopathy, an autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy caused by DYSF mutations, demonstrates a variable phenotype and progression rate, with symptom onset ranging from first to eighth decade and some patients requiring wheelchairs for mobility within 10 years, with others remaining minimally affected.

Dysferlinopathy populations have previously been described as having an unusually high level of presymptomatic sporting ability. We hypothesised that this activity could be related to subsequent disease progression and investigated the hypothesis using data from the Jain Foundation's Clinical Outcomes Study (COS) of 202 patients with dysferlinopathy.

### Diagnostic overview of blood-based dysferlin protein assay for dysferlinopathies [^111ueje7]. Muscle & Nerve (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dysferlin deficiency causes dysferlinopathies. Among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the dysferlin protein is expressed specifically in CD14⁺ monocytes.

Methods

We quantified dysferlin protein levels in PBMC lysates of 77 individuals suspected clinically of having a dysferlinopathy to screen for true positives. Subsequent molecular confirmation was done by Sanger sequencing and comparative genomic hybridization arrays to establish diagnosis.

Results

Of the 44 individuals who had significantly reduced dysferlin levels (≤ 10%), 41 underwent molecular testing. We identified at least 1 mutation in 85% (35 of 41), and 2 mutations, establishing a dysferlinopathy diagnosis, in 61% (25 of 41) of these individuals. Among those with dysferlin protein levels of > 10% (33 of 77), only 1 individual (of 14 who underwent molecular testing) had a detectable mutation.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that dysferlin protein levels of ≤ 10% in PBMCs, are highly indicative of primary dysferlinopathies. However, this assay may not distinguish carriers from those with secondary dysferlin reduction.

### Dysferlinopathy presenting as rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure [^114baWpE]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Dysferlinopathies are a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive muscle disorders resulting from defects or deficiencies in dysferlin. Reported phenotypes range from isolated hyperCKemia to muscular dystrophy. We present a 15-year-old male adolescent who was diagnosed with a dysferlinopathy after presenting with acute renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis.

### Distal myopathies [^115b35gK]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Distal myopathies are frequently encountered in the Nordic countries, and are now being increasingly recognized elsewhere. Three new descriptions of distal myopathy phenotypes have been published in the past year. At the same time there has been considerable progress in molecular genetics and in understanding the molecular pathophysiology underlying distal myopathies. Membrane-associated dysferlin, which was the first gene in which mutations were identified, is shown to cause a distal phenotype. The ability to make a molecular diagnosis has increased awareness of dysferlinopathy - Miyoshi myopathy. Since most entities have been linked to specific chromosomal loci, it is likely that other distal myopathies will soon be better recognized by their molecular genetic definitions.

### Assessment of disease progression in dysferlinopathy: a 1-year cohort study [^1175qMua]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was completed with SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Mean and median change scores were calculated for each test between baseline and 6 months, 6 months and year 1, and baseline and year 1. Data from some visits were excluded if the visit occurred ± 2 months outside the scheduled appointment date. A majority of functional outcome measures were not normally distributed; thus, comparisons between baseline and follow-up time points were conducted with the Wilcoxon signed rank-sum test and standardized response mean (SRM). A comparison was made between the performance of patients with the most common clinical diagnoses of limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy with Kruskal-Wallis test with Steel-Dwass-Critchlow-Fligner correction for multiple comparisons.

Nonambulant patients (unable to walk 10 meters with usual orthotics and walking aids) were compared to 3 categories of ambulant patients: ambulation affected severely, moderately, or mildly. Using patients' a-NSAA scores at baseline, we defined ambulant severity categories based on a clinical impression of disease severity and binomial distribution of a-NSAA scores, with cut points of 0 to 10 (severe disease severity), 11 to 40 (moderate disease severity), and 41+ (mild disease severity). The lower cut point was based on the end of the first a-NSAA peak, and the high cut point was placed at the start of the second peak, with the wide spread in between representing a plateau between peaks. Significance was defined as p ≤ 0.05. Results are expressed as median change (range) and p value.

### Muscular dystrophy with marked dysferlin deficiency is consistently caused by primary dysferlin gene mutations [^1169z3vY]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Our original aim was to focus on LGMD cases with a marked Dysferlin reduction and no mutation. To achieve this objective, we performed a complete mutation analysis of the dysferlin gene in a group of 65 LGMD/MM patients with a marked reduction or absence of the protein detected by western blot. We used all available screening methods starting from genomic DNA and mRNA. Here we show the high specificity of the absence or marked reduction of dysferlin expression on muscle biopsy and the high specificity and sensitivity of a comprehensive molecular approach in the diagnosis of LGMD2B/MM.

### New aspects on patients affected by dysferlin deficient muscular dystrophy [^112xeu7D]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Mutations in the dysferlin gene lead to limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B, Miyoshi myopathy and distal anterior compartment myopathy. A cohort of 36 patients affected by dysferlinopathy is described, in the first UK study of clinical, genetic, pathological and biochemical data. The diagnosis was established by reduction of dysferlin in the muscle biopsy and subsequent mutational analysis of the dysferlin gene. Seventeen mutations were novel; the majority of mutations were small deletions/insertions, and no mutational hotspots were identified. Sixty-one per cent of patients (22 patients) initially presented with limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B, 31% (11 patients) with a Miyoshi phenotype, one patient with proximodistal mode of onset, one patient with muscle stiffness after exercise and one patient as a symptomatic carrier. A wider range of age of onset was noted than previously reported, with 25% of patients having first symptoms before the age of 13 years. Independent of the initial mode of presentation, in our cohort of patients the gastrocnemius muscle was the most severely affected muscle leading to an inability to stand on tiptoes, and lower limbs were affected more severely than upper limbs. As previous anecdotal evidence on patients affected by dysferlinopathy suggests good muscle prowess before onset of symptoms, we also investigated pre-symptomatic fitness levels of the patients. Fifty-three per cent of the patients were very active and sporty before the onset of symptoms which makes the clinical course of dysferlinopathy unusual within the different forms of muscular dystrophy and provides a challenge to understanding the underlying pathomechanisms in this disease.

### Cryo-EM structures of the membrane repair protein dysferlin [^115b1hhm]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 5
Proposed mechanism of dysferlin recruitment to sites of membrane damage.

Upon membrane damage and Ca²⁺ influx, dysferlin containing vesicles are transported to the sites of membrane repair. These vesicles dock to the membrane. Dysferlin then accumulates in the form of dimers and larger oligomers at the sites of membrane damage, where it, together with binding partners, facilitates repair. The precise structural and molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between dysferlin, and its binding partners are largely unknown. Schematic not drawn to scale. MG53: Mitsugumin 53, also known as TRIM72; A1: Annexin A1; A2: Annexin A2.

Membrane damage is a common feature of many diseases including muscular dystrophies, heart failure, and neurodegeneration. Given the significance of understanding the structural mechanisms underlying dysferlinopathies, we also examined the location of clinically relevant mutations in DYSF. The presence of deleterious missense mutations in key domains for monomer stability and the maintenance of the dimer interface explains the reported loss of function and dysferlin instability in dysferlinopathies. Finally, the dysferlin structure can be considered a prototype of the ferlin protein family. It is conceivable that type-1 ferlins myoferlin and Fer1L5 may adopt similar monomer and possibly dimer structures given their structural conservation and domain organization (Supplementary Fig. 5a). The absence of a DysF and C2A in some type-2 ferlins implies broader structural alterations in their architecture compared to dysferlin (Supplementary Fig. 5a).

In conclusion, we describe the overall architecture of the dysferlin monomer and homodimer that define their structural mechanisms. Owing to the key function of dysferlin in Ca²⁺-mediated membrane repair in striated muscles, our structures provide a framework for a more comprehensive exploration of the functional roles, the characterization of dysferlinopathy-associated mutations, and the assessment of the therapeutic potential of dysferlin and likely other members of the ferlin protein family.

### Muscle MRI in patients with dysferlinopathy: pattern recognition and implications for clinical trials [^116CGTmv]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The pattern of muscle involvement reported here can be considered characteristic for dysferlinopathy and contributes to differential diagnosis between other muscle diseases with limb girdle weakness. Patients with Becker muscular dystrophy tend to have early fatty replacement of the glutei medius and maximus while in contrast the adductor longus tends to be preserved until later stages. Muscle MRI scans of patients with LGMD-1B show no involvement of the vasti until later stages although the rectus femoris tends not to be affected and is often hypertrophic. Patients with LGMD-2A tend to have more severe involvement of the glutei and the vasti are less involved than the posterior muscles of the thighs. This pattern is similar in patients with LGMD-2I. Patients with sarcoglycanopathy, in whom there is usually no involvement of muscles of the lower legs before loss of ambulation, are easy to distinguish. Patients with adult-onset Pompe, which presents frequently with limb girdle weakness, have a muscle MRI pattern characterised by early involvement of axial, abdominal, gluteal and posterior thigh muscles, with the muscles of the lower legs not commonly involved. Patients with mutation in ANO5 (LGMD-2L) have a similar pattern of muscle involvement compared with patients with dysferlinopathy, with predominant involvement of the posterior muscles of the lower legs associated with involvement of posterior and anterior muscles of the thighs without involvement of the glutei. However, some differences can be found: the gluteus minimus and medius seem more commonly involved in LGMD-2L than in LGMD-2B and asymmetric involvement is more pronounced in LGMD-2L than dysferlinopathy.

### Muscle MRI in patients with dysferlinopathy: pattern recognition and implications for clinical trials [^117LvL3B]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have characterised muscle involvement on MRI in a large and clinically heterogeneous cohort of patients with dysferlinopathy. This large cross-sectional cohort has permitted better characterisation of the pattern of muscle involvement in dysferlinopathy and improved our understanding of disease progression. This information will support both diagnostics and clinical trial development.

We have defined a characteristic pattern of muscle involvement for dysferlinopathy, independent of the clinical phenotype. An early combination of fat replacement in distal posterior muscles of the lower limbs (gastrocnemius medialis and soleus) together with involvement of posterior muscles of the thighs (semimembranosus, semitendinosus, adductor major), pelvic muscles (tensor fascia latae and obturator externus), paraspinal muscles (multifidus, iliocostalis) and the scapular muscles (subscapularis and latissimus dorsi) can be helpful for differential diagnosis of patients with a muscle dystrophy and lead to an early diagnosis of dysferlinopathy. Moreover, some muscles are not involved until very late in the disease such as the levator scapulae, the rhomboideus the posterior muscles of the forearms, the gluteus maximus and medius muscles and the gracilis. This pattern of muscle involvement and sparing could be helpful for differential diagnosis by MRI in severely affected patients, in whom obtaining a muscle biopsy may be challenging.

We confirmed that there are no differences in the pattern of muscle involvement between patients with LGMD-2B, MM or other phenotypic presentations. This suggests that these subtypes of dysferlinopathy are not truly different and that a unifying pathophysiology is likely, similar to findings in other muscle diseases, such as the laminopathies, where different mutations result in similar patterns of selective muscle pathology. Extensive MRI investigations, rather than clinical descriptions, are therefore more likely to be helpful in understanding the pathophysiology of disease or the role of genetic modifiers. As previously mentioned, some muscles were more involved in women than men. Although we do not have a clear explanation to explain this issue, it is well known that testosterone and estrogens influence skeletal muscle homeostasis and metabolism and probably have an effect on muscle wasting in muscle dystrophies. Exercise has been shown to be important for muscle size and metabolism, which may be a factor rather than gender here.

### Exome sequencing as a second-tier diagnostic approach for clinically suspected dysferlinopathy patients [^116tuvp2]. Muscle & Nerve (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Autosomal recessive muscular dystrophies are heterogeneous genetic disorders, with 39 genes currently implicated. Genetic diagnosis using targeted single-gene analysis by Sanger sequencing yields negative results in 10–20% of samples, warranting clinical re-evaluation and time-consuming testing of additional genes. This applies to dysferlinopathies caused by mutations in the gene encoding dysferlin (DYSF), which presents mainly as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) or distal myopathy.

Methods

We evaluated exome sequencing associated with data filtering for selected genes as a second-tier approach for genetic diagnosis in a cohort of 37 patients with an initial negative result on targeted DYSF analysis.

Results

Exome sequencing allowed for establishing (16%) or suggesting (8%) the molecular diagnosis by implicating other known LGMD or distal myopathy genes or by revealing DYSF mutations previously missed using mutation-screening techniques with incomplete detection yields.

Conclusions

Exome sequencing associated with data filtering constitutes an efficient second-tier analysis for genes implicated in LGMD or distal myopathies.

### Assessment of disease progression in dysferlinopathy: a 1-year cohort study [^111in9qA]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Power analyses to support a hypothetical future clinical trial were conducted to estimate the sample size required to detect significant statistical differences in progression over the course of 1 year with PASS 14 software. Because change scores were normally distributed, calculations used mean change scores and SDs of the functional measure that demonstrated most change over time. For this analysis, the a-NSAA was used, which limited estimates to ambulant patients only. Sample sizes needed to evaluate a variety of expected drug effects were calculated for reference, including halting of disease progression (i.e. assuming mean progression estimates from the current sample among untreated and no progression among treated patients), reflective of potential protein-restoring genetic therapies. An α level of 0.05, 80% power, and a treated-to-untreated ratio of 1:1 were assumed. For comparison with a widely used measure in muscular dystrophy, sample sizes were also calculated on the basis of the 6MWT.

Data availability statement

Deidentified cohort level data can be requested. All protocol assessments are in the public domain apart from the a-NSAA, which can be requested from the steering group (publication in draft). The statistical plan is detailed above. All data for this natural history study will be stored for at least 5 years after the end of the study. Data can be requested by all interested stakeholders for clinical research and trial planning. Data requests are reviewed by the Jain COS Steering Committee, who can be contacted via the corresponding author.

### Assessment of disease progression in dysferlinopathy: a 1-year cohort study [^116JHHfh]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This analysis supports the use of specified physical and patient-reported outcome measures in the assessment of dysferlinopathy by demonstrating clinically detectable deterioration in muscle strength and function and self-reported deterioration over 6 months and 1 year in a large cohort of patients.

Defining a set of disease specific tests is useful in coordinating further research and patient follow-up and developing clinical trial outcome measures. The most sensitive assessments for monitoring progression in dysferlinopathy that were identified in this study are the a-NSAA, MFM-20, timed 10-meter walk, and Timed Up and Go; they demonstrated consistent change over both 6 months and 1 year with a relatively high SRM. Other tests such as the Brooke and some MMT assessments showed change over 1 year but not 6 months, suggesting that they are less sensitive scales. This was also true for D3 (distal function) of the MFM, consistent with other published cross-sectional data on its poor suitability for this population. Some tests such as the 6MWT and MFM D2 domain changed over one 6-month window but not the other. This poor repeatability of demonstrable change makes these measures less reliable in assessing the dysferlinopathy patient cohort as a whole.

### Assessment of disease progression in dysferlinopathy: a 1-year cohort study [^1172zN73]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Estimated sample size for trials

Estimated clinical trial sample size is highly dependent on the expected treatment effect; the smaller the effect size, the larger the sample required (table 4). For example, with the inclusion of ambulant patients of all disease severities, a total of 328 patients (164 in both the treatment and placebo groups) would be needed to detect a 50% reduction in disease progression (i.e. half the deterioration seen in the current sample) over 1 year compared to 90 patients (45 in each group) needed to detect halting in progression. The a-NSAA was chosen for its capability to detect change as demonstrated by the highest overall SRM in the current analysis. Limiting a clinical trial to a subset of patients in the moderate severity group at baseline, who showed the greatest changes in a-NSAA scores over 1 year, would reduce the total sample size to 176 for a 50% reduction in progression and 46 to detect a halt in progression. A treatment that is anticipated to improve muscle function, producing a greater effect size than simply halting progression, would require even fewer patients.

Table 4
Sample size estimates for a placebo-controlled clinical trial

The 6MWT would require 216 ambulant patients to detect a halting of progression. However, as reflected by the high SRM in the severe-ambulant population, if trials were limited to the severe-ambulant subgroup of patients, 42 patients would be needed to detect a halting in progression with the 6MWT.

### Dysferlinopathy in iran: clinical and genetic report [^114rHD9B]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Dysferlinopathy is caused by a very wide range of autosomal recessively inherited mutations of the Dysferlin gene. It causes a spectrum of muscle diseases including limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2B and Miyoshi myopathy (MM). We describe the clinical course and mutational analyses of 15 Iranian patients with dysferlinopathy from 9 different families.

Methods

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and 55 exons and flanking intronic boundaries of the dysferlin gene (DYSF; NM_003494.2) were screened for mutations and analyzed.

Results

From 15 studied patients in 9 families, 5 patients were male. Seven families had consanguineous marriage. Median age of onset was 16.8; and the median age of diagnosis was 26.6. The onset was clearly distal in 7 patients, and proximal in 6 patients. Three patients had partial biceps atrophy and 13 showed prominent calf muscle wasting. Foot plantar flexors, deep finger flexors and hip adductors were predominantly involved. Genetic testing showed homozygous mutation of dysferlin gene in 9 probands, 5 of which were not previously reported.

Conclusion

This work, in fact, may help shed some light on the pattern of this morbidity in Iran, an effort that may have not been attempted so far.

### Deep phenotyping of an international series of patients with late-onset dysferlinopathy [^114enPFT]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

To describe the clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics of late-onset (LO) dysferlinopathy patients.

Methods

Retrospective series of patients with LO dysferlinopathy, defined by an age at onset of symptoms ≥ 30 years, from neuromuscular centers in France and the International Clinical Outcome Study for dysferlinopathy (COS). Patients with early-onset (EO) dysferlinopathy (< 30 years) were randomly selected from the COS study as a control group, and the North Star Assessment for Dysferlinopathy (NSAD) and Activity Limitation (ACTIVLIM) scores were used to assess functionality. Muscle biopsies obtained from 11 LO and 11 EO patients were revisited.

Results

Forty-eight patients with LO dysferlinopathy were included (28 females). Median age at onset of symptoms was 37 (range 30–57) years and most patients showed a limb-girdle (n = 26) or distal (n = 10) phenotype. However, compared with EO dysferlinopathy patients (n = 48), LO patients more frequently showed atypical phenotypes (7 vs. 1; p = 0.014), including camptocormia, lower creatine kinase levels (2855 vs. 4394 U/L; p = 0.01), and higher NSAD (p = 0.008) and ACTIVLIM scores (p = 0.016). Loss of ambulation in LO patients tended to occur later (23 ± 4.4 years after disease onset vs. 16.3 ± 6.8 years; p = 0.064). Muscle biopsy of LO patients more frequently showed an atypical pattern (unspecific myopathic changes) as well as significantly less necrosis regeneration and inflammation. Although LO patients more frequently showed missense variants (39.8% vs. 23.9%; p = 0.021), no differences in dysferlin protein expression were found on Western blot.

Conclusions

Late-onset dysferlinopathy patients show a higher frequency of atypical presentations, are less severely affected, and show milder dystrophic changes in muscle biopsy.

### Broadening the imaging phenotype of dysferlinopathy at different disease stages [^114gKY3C]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

MRI characterization of dysferlinopathy has been mostly limited to the lower limbs. We aimed to broaden the MRI description of dysferlinopathy and to correlate it with objective measures of motor dysfunction.

Methods

Sequential whole-body axial MRI was performed in 27 patients with genetically confirmed dysferlinopathy classified according to disease duration. Spearman correlations of fatty infiltration scores versus Motor Function Measure (MFM) were calculated.

Results

Significant fatty infiltration was symmetrically present in early stages mainly in the posterior compartments of legs and thighs, thigh adductors, pelvic girdle, and some paravertebral muscles and the subscapularis. Later, fatty infiltration involved leg and thigh anterior compartments, arms and forearms, paravertebral, and trunk muscles. MRI infiltration score correlated positively with disease duration and negatively with MFM scale.

Conclusions

We expand MRI characterization of dysferlinopathy and provide evidence for use of MRI scoring combined with motor functional scales to assess the natural course of disease. Muscle Nerve, 2016 Muscle Nerve 54: 203–210, 2016.

Arm muscles

Arm involvement was analysed in 35 patients. Hierarchical analysis identified two more commonly and severely involved muscles (online supplementary figure 1A): the biceps brachii (57.1%) and the anterior muscles of the forearm (53.8%). Commonly observed patterns included:
The biceps brachii was equally or more severely involved than the triceps or the brachialis muscles (figure 1I, J, online supplementary figure 1 and table 2).
The anterior muscles of the forearm were equally or more severely involved than the posterior muscles of the forearm (figure 1K and online supplementary figure 1).

### Retrospective analysis and reclassification of DYSF variants in a large French series of dysferlinopathy patients [^114vqXse]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Recent evolution of sequencing technologies and the development of international standards in variant interpretation have profoundly changed the diagnostic approaches in clinical genetics. As a consequence, many variants that were initially claimed to be disease-causing can be now reclassified as benign or uncertain in light of the new data available. Unfortunately, the misclassified variants are still present in the scientific literature and variant databases, greatly interfering with interpretation of diagnostic sequencing results. Despite the urgent need, large-scale efforts to update the classifications of these variants are still not sufficient.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 176 DYSF gene variants that were identified in dysferlinopathy patients referred to the Marseille Medical Genetics Department for diagnostic sequencing since 2001.

Results

We reclassified all variants into five-tier American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) pathogenicity classes, revealing changed pathogenicity for 17 variants. We then updated the information for the variants that have been previously published in the variant database and submitted 46 additional DYSF variants.

Conclusion

Besides direct benefit for dysferlinopathy diagnostics, our study contributes to the much needed effort to reanalyze variants from previously published cohorts and to work with curators of variant databases to update the entries for erroneously classified variants.

### Muscle MRI in patients with dysferlinopathy: pattern recognition and implications for clinical trials [^115hG4nR]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Previous similar radiological studies in dysferlinopathy have been performed in lower limbs only and involved small cohorts. Although these studies describe some of the features found here, we have expanded the range of patients analysed, using data from patients of different ethnic origins at many different stages of the disease.

We presented the pathology scores from T1-weighted images as heatmaps, as has been recently described for other muscle disorders. This is a new approach to display large amount of data, which simplifies the analysis of several variables. Following this method, we identified a clear correlation between disease duration and the degree of muscle involvement. This analysis raises interesting questions about factors affecting the rate of muscle degeneration. We showed that some muscles were involved early, while others were not involved until much later. In addition, while a group of muscles could become involved at the same time, the progression of fat replacement between muscles in a group could also vary. For example, in most patients, the gastrocnemius medialis becomes completely replaced by fat in less than 10 years from symptom onset, while the biceps femoris long head, while also involved in the first 10 years, remains minimally affected for longer. It is tempting to hypothesise that muscles with a slower progression could express proteins that protect them from rapid degeneration. Despite previous attempts to investigate this in dysferlinopathy, it is still not clear why muscle degeneration shows a different rate of progression. The clear understanding of the pattern of severely involved and spared muscles demonstrated here should allow for more focused investigations in the future.

T1-weighted muscle MRI has traditionally been used for differential diagnosis of muscle diseases or to select a suitable muscle to biopsy. As the development of novel therapeutics for many muscular dystrophies progresses, there is a growing need for reliable biomarkers to follow-up patients. We have shown that muscle MRI findings correlate with the results of most functional tests that may be included in clinical trials (table 1), adding weight to its use as a biomarker. However, as dysferlinopathy is a slowly progressive disorder, changes from 1 year to the next are probably not significant enough to be detectable using semiquantitative T1w imaging. Quantitative sequences such as 3-point Dixon or T2-mapping should be more useful for patient follow-up in short-term longitudinal studies. However, the present study can inform longitudinal quantitative MRI studies regards which muscles to monitor at different stages of disease.

### Muscular dystrophy with marked dysferlin deficiency is consistently caused by primary dysferlin gene mutations [^115SyNVH]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Results

To select patients with a Dysferlin deficiency from a heterogeneous population of patients affected with an unclassified form of LGMD or MM, we previously analysed muscle samples by a multiple WB. A group of 65 patients who showed a marked reduction or absence of Dysferlin were included in the study (Figures 1a and b). We excluded cases having more than 20% Dysferlin, using a quantitative WB assay. The average Dysferlin level was 5% ± 5. We combined different screening methods to identify the causative alleles (Figure 1c).

Despite the incomplete DHPLC sensitivity and the noise of the variants and polymorphisms, this first step was chosen for its cost-effectiveness. We screened by DHPLC and targeted a sequencing of all the 55 exons and flanking introns from the genomic DNA. DHPLC analysis was performed on a first group of 52 patients. We identified 47 causative mutations, 28 of which were new (Supplementary Table S3). A full molecular diagnosis (both alleles) was provided for 35 out of 52 patients (67%).

### Assessment of disease progression in dysferlinopathy: a 1-year cohort study [^115whcF8]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

The COS study

The COS study is an international collaborative study of patients with a genetic and/or protein assay–confirmed diagnosis of dysferlinopathy. Screening, baseline, 6-month, and 1-year visits took place between October 2012 and March 2016. One hundred ninety-seven of the original 209 recruited patients completed a baseline visit. Of the original 209 patients, 7 did not meet inclusion criteria, and 5 chose not to continue past the screening visit (figure 1). Full inclusion and exclusion criteria, the study protocol, and patient demographics have been described previously.

### Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy in the United States [^115QiSof]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) has been linked to 15 chromosomal loci, 7 autosomal-dominant (LGMD1A to E) and 10 autosomal-recessive (LGMD2A to J). To determine the distribution of subtypes among patients in the United States, 6 medical centers evaluated patients with a referral diagnosis of LGMD. Muscle biopsies provided histopathology and immunodiagnostic testing, and their protein abnormalities along with clinical parameters directed mutation screening. The diagnosis in 23 patients was a disorder other than LGMD. Of the remaining 289 unrelated patients, 266 had muscle biopsies sufficient for complete microscopic evaluation; 121 also underwent Western blotting. From this combined evaluation, the distribution of immunophenotypes is 12% calpainopathy, 18% dysferlinopathy, 15% sarcoglycanopathy, 15% dystroglycanopathy, and 1.5% caveolinopathy. Genotypes distributed among 2 dominant and 7 recessive subtypes have been determined for 83 patients. This study of a large racially and ethnically diverse population of patients with LGMD indicates that establishing a putative subtype is possible more than half the time using available diagnostic testing. An efficient approach to genotypic diagnosis is muscle biopsy immunophenotyping followed by directed mutational analysis. The most common LGMDs in the United States are calpainopathies, dysferlinopathies, sarcoglycanopathies, and dystroglycanopathies.

### Heterogeneous characteristics of MRI changes of thigh muscles in patients with dysferlinopathy [^116FFyNv]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of thigh muscle MRI changes in a large cohort of patients with dysferlinopathy.

Methods

MRI of the thigh was performed in 60 patients. We correlated the scale of muscle involvement on MRI with the modified Gardner-Medwin and Walton (GM-W) scale and disease duration. We also analyzed the relationship between muscle changes and genetic mutations.

Results

Fatty infiltration and edema were observed in 95.50% and 86.67% of patients, respectively. The hamstring muscles had the highest frequency and mean score of fatty infiltration, although a posterior-dominant pattern was found in only 56%. Edema most commonly and severely affected the quadriceps and adductor magnus muscles. Fatty infiltration score correlated positively with disease duration and GM-W scale.

Conclusions

The pattern of fatty infiltration was heterogeneous in dysferlinopathy patients. Muscle edema was common. Fatty infiltration can be used to assess disease progression. Muscle Nerve 54: 1072–1079, 2016.

### The earliest pathologic alterations in dysferlinopathy [^111Vesz4]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Dysferlinopathies are associated with proximal or distal muscular dystrophy. Dysferlin immunolocalizes to the muscle fiber periphery but does not associate with the dystrophin — glycoprotein complex; its function in humans, and the mechanism by which it causes muscle fiber injury, are not known. The authors therefore searched for pathogenetic clues by examining early abnormalities in nonnecrotic muscle fibers in dysferlinopathy. Five dysferlin-deficient patients were investigated. Weakness was distal in two, proximal in one, and both proximal and distal in two. Patient 5 was only mildly affected.

Methods

Immunoblot analysis, membrane attack complex (MAC) immunolocalization, and quantitative electron microscopy.

Results

In Patients 1 through 4, but not in 5, part or the entire surface of isolated nonnecrotic muscle fibers immunostained for MAC. Quantitative electron microscopy of 175 nonnecrotic muscle fibers revealed one or more of the following: 1) small (0.11 to 1.8 microm) plasmalemmal defects in 64% of fibers; 2) thickened basal lamina over some defects; 3) replacement of the plasma membrane by one to multiple layers of small vesicles in 57% of fibers; 4) papillary projections, frequently disintegrating, in 24 to 36% of fibers in Patients 1 through 4 but absent in fibers of Patient 5; 5) small subsarcolemmal vacuoles, some undergoing exocytosis, in 57% of fibers; and 6) infrequent subsarcolemmal regions containing rough endoplasmic reticulum and abundant free ribosomes.

Conclusions

Dysferlin is likely required for maintaining the structural integrity of the muscle fiber plasma membrane, and plasma membrane injury is an early event in the pathogenesis of dysferlinopathy. MAC activation can participate in but is not an initial or primary event causing muscle fiber injury.

### Teenage exercise is associated with earlier symptom onset in dysferlinopathy: a retrospective cohort study [^113MEiCY]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, patients recalling greater teenage exercise levels demonstrated increased risk for earlier symptom onset and wheelchair requirement. Teenage exercise level was chosen as this is typically before symptom onset in dysferlinopathy, yet old enough for significant exercise regimens to have started. Although an association between exercise and subsequent disease progression has previously been suggested by Angelini et al Klinge et al reported no significant effect of exercise on age of symptom onset in 36, mostly LGMD2B, patients. These studies all rely on patient recall, introducing potential question and recall bias. We tried to mitigate for this using a scoring system based on METs rather than Klinge's use of patient-reported sporting level. However, our approach still does not produce uniform exercise categories, requiring grouping of different types and frequencies of exercise, which may not have equitable physiological impact. Unfortunately, this is the nature of a retrospective study, which is necessary while so few patients are diagnosed presymptomatically.

Exercise is usually considered beneficial in muscular dystrophies, and so this finding in dysferlinopathy may suggest a unique underlying pathological mechanism. Investigation of this was not within the scope of this study. However, previous work has suggested that dysferlinopathy may increase aptitude for training early in life, but the more a patient exercises vigorously, the more muscle damage occurs, which is then inadequately repaired — accelerating both disease onset and symptom progression.

This study raises implications for patients and families. If intensive exercise causes earlier onset and faster progression, asymptomatic patients should consider limiting their exercise and affected siblings should be identified to allow for early disease-modifying advice. However, as the HRs are small, this needs to be balanced against the loss of other lifestyle benefits of exercise. As we did not look at the effects of exercise once symptoms began, we would not advocate that symptomatic patients stop exercising.

This letter describes an association of intensive exercise during the teenage years with earlier disease onset and faster rate of disease progression in patients with dysferlinopathy.

### Cryo-EM structures of the membrane repair protein dysferlin [^113NAEra]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Plasma membrane repair in response to damage is essential for cell viability. The ferlin family protein dysferlin plays a key role in Ca²⁺-dependent membrane repair in striated muscles. Mutations in dysferlin lead to a spectrum of diseases known as dysferlinopathies. The lack of a structure of dysferlin and other ferlin family members has impeded a mechanistic understanding of membrane repair mechanisms and the development of therapies. Here, we present the cryo-EM structures of the full-length human dysferlin monomer and homodimer at 2.96Å and 4.65Å resolution. These structures define the architecture of dysferlin, ferlin family-specific domains, and homodimerization mechanisms essential to function. Furthermore, biophysical and cell biology studies revealed how missense mutations in dysferlin contribute to disease mechanisms. In summary, our study provides a framework for the molecular mechanisms of dysferlin and the broader ferlin family, offering a foundation for the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at treating dysferlinopathies.

### Diagnosis of dysferlinopathy masked by a superimposed hypothyroid myopathy [^1127XnEF]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

We report a woman in her 30s with dysferlinopathy whose diagnosis was masked by superimposed hypothyroidism. Laboratory studies revealed Hashimoto's thyroiditis and markedly raised serum creatine kinase (CK of 6255U/L; reference range 0–170U/L). Electromyography, nerve conduction studies and MRI of the hip and thigh were consistent with a diagnosis of hypothyroid myopathy, but thyroxine failed to resolve her clinical presentation or normalise the CK level. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of right vastus lateralis muscle biopsy revealed the selective absence of dysferlin leading to a diagnosis of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type IIB. Dysferlinopathy is a challenging diagnosis due to a varied clinical picture and low incidence. Misdiagnosis is common even in uncomplicated presentations, and this case outlines the need for routine inclusion of IHC and a low threshold for genetic testing, in the workup of complex myopathy.

### Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B masquerading as inflammatory myopathy: case report [^112oL2QT]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Muscle pain is a common presenting symptom to paediatric rheumatology clinics. The overlap between differential diagnoses can sometimes make such cases challenging. Limb girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD) are a rare group of conditions, the predominant feature of which is weakness of lower and upper limbs, although symptoms may predominate in one muscle group. The typical presenting symptom is difficulty climbing stairs. LGMD type 2B is an autosomal recessive condition due to homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the dysferlin gene (DYSF) on 2p12–14, leading to a deficiency or absence of the protein, dysferlin. This protein is primarily found in skeletal muscle but can also be found in cardiac muscle. The onset age of LGMD type 2 is usually 12–39 years, typically presenting with pelvic girdle weakness. Pain is not a typical feature however, if present, is usually mild, transient and follows exertion. Creatine kinase (CK) levels are markedly raised and can be 10–72 times normal values. At times, genetically inherited myopathies can mimic inflammatory myopathy. Pimentel et al. (2008) describe an adult case of LGMD type 2 subject to misdiagnosis of polymyositis, despite having consanguinous parents and also two siblings with similar symptoms of muscle weakness.

Although disease caused by a reduction/absence in dysferlin typically demonstrates a slow indolent course, in some cases symptoms may be highly debilitating. Nyugen et al. (2007) describe a patient with a dysferlinopathy who had complete loss of ambulation just five years after symptom onset. Given the wide spectrum of disease severity with dysferlinopathies, it is vital that healthcare professionals are aware of atypical presentations of the condition. A high index of suspicion is needed in order for an accurate diagnosis to ensure adequate and timely treatment in order to help minimize progression.

Here we report an atypical case of LGMD type 2B presenting at the age of ten years with significant, non-transient knee pain which was worst in the morning.

### New aspects on patients affected by dysferlin deficient muscular dystrophy [^114ewVVq]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Although the same mutation may lead to initial presentation as MM or LGMD2B even within the same family, we did not observe this degree of intrafamilial variability in our cohort of patients. In contrast with a recent study, most of our patients did present with either proximal or distal onset and only one patient displayed proximal and distal involvement simultaneously, although with disease progression we noted as have others that it was difficult to distinguish those who had initially presented with proximal or distal involvement. The larger number of patients with proximal presentation in our study may also reflect a referral bias as our diagnostic service is primarily orientated towards the LGMDs. We did not identify any patient presenting with distal anterior involvement, similar to the observation by Nguyen et al, suggesting that this appears to be a rare presentation of dysferlinopathy.

The muscle most severely affected in our group of patients was the gastrocnemius muscle leading to an inability to stand on tiptoes also in patients initially presenting with a limb girdle phenotype. This has to take into account that the median disease duration at muscle assessment was 9 years (range 2.5–42 years). Overall weakness appears to be more pronounced in the lower than the upper limbs.

Two patients developed symptoms shortly after delivery of their first child, and one patient after delivery of her third child which to our knowledge has not been reported in dysferlin deficiency so far. This may suggest that pregnancy could possibly trigger onset of symptoms.

Mutations were spread along the entire gene, corroborating the findings that no mutational hot spots exist in the dysferlin gene (figure 1). In addition, our findings are in line with most previous reports in that we did not find any genotype–phenotype correlation either with regard to the nature of the mutation and severity or with the phenotype and age at presentation. In agreement with most data published so far but in contrast with a recently published study, we could not find a correlation between residual amounts of dysferlin on western blotting or immunohistochemistry and the resulting phenotype.

### The limb-girdle muscular dystrophies [^116bsiPT]. Neurologic Clinics (2014). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on limb-girdle and distal dystrophies:

- **Definition**: Limb-girdle and distal dystrophies are rare genetic neuromuscular disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of these disorders involves genetic mutations that lead to the dysfunction of key proteins in muscle cells. In limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, the genetic defects responsible for over 30 subtypes have been identified, with the causative mutations mostly found in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-associated genes.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of limb-girdle and distal dystrophies in the United Kingdom is estimated at 0.18 per 100,000 population.
- **Risk factors**: The primary risk factor for limb-girdle and distal dystrophies is the genetic predisposition due to familial inheritance.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, limb-girdle and distal dystrophies usually manifest in the proximal muscles of the hip and shoulder girdles. The disease progression is typically characterized by progressive muscular dystrophy, which can be exacerbated by exercise. Distal muscular dystrophy, on the other hand, is characterized by weakness and atrophy in the distal muscles, such as those in the hands and feet. The clinical presentation of distal muscular dystrophy can vary, but it often includes juvenile or early adult onset of muscle weakness.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of these disorders is generally poor due to their progressive nature. While no curative therapies exist, the clinical severity can vary, with the order of decreasing clinical severity being: sarcoglycanopathy, calpainopathy, dysferlinopathy, and caveolinopathy.

### Ultrastructural changes in dysferlinopathy support defective membrane repair mechanism [^116Z59NW]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The dysferlin gene has recently been shown to be involved in limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and its allelic disease, Miyoshi myopathy, both of which are characterised by an active muscle degeneration and regeneration process. Dysferlin is known to play an essential role in skeletal muscle fibre repair, but the process underlying the pathogenetic mechanism of dysferlinopathy is not completely understood.

Aims

To define both specific alterations of muscle fibres and a possible sequential mechanism of myopathy development.

Methods

A histological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural analysis of 10 muscle biopsies from patients with molecularly diagnosed dysferlinopathy.

Results

An inflammatory response was seen in most of the muscle biopsies. The immunohistochemical pattern demonstrated active regeneration and inflammation. Non-necrotic fibres showed alterations at different submicroscopic levels, namely: the sarcolemma and basal lamina, subsarcolemmal region, and sarcoplasmic compartment. In the subsarcolemmal region there were prominent aggregations of small vesicles, probably derived from the Golgi apparatus, which consisted of empty, swollen cisternae. In the sarcolemma there were many gaps and microvilli-like projections, whereas the basal lamina was multilayered.

Conclusions

The histopathological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural data show that dysferlinopathy is characterised by a very active inflammatory/degenerative process, possibly associated with an inefficient repair and regenerative system. The presence of many crowded vesicles just beneath the sarcolemma provides submicroscopical proof of a defective resealing mechanism, which fails to repair the sarcolemma.

### Clinical features and a mutation with late onset of limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B [^114o7GEG]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dysferlinopathies are autosomal recessive muscular dystrophies caused by mutations in the dysferlin gene (DYSF, MIM# 603009). Dysferlin deficiency leads to two main phenotypes: limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2B and Miyoshi myopathy (MM). Dysferlin is located on the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle and is deficient in patients with MM and LGMD2B. However, atypical immunostaining in muscle from patients with dysferlin mutations occurs, and dysferlin expression is not normal in sarcoglycanopathy, dystrophinopathy, caveolinopathyor calpainopathymuscles. Therefore, the final diagnosis of dysferlinopathy requires identification of mutations in the dysferlin gene. We first reported dysferlin mutations in Japanese patients with MMand in a patient from a non-European ethnic group with distal anterior compartment myopathy (DACM), a relatively new phenotype of dysferlinopathy. Furthermore, we revealed that, in MM, four mutations (c.1566C > G, c.2997G > T, c.3373delG and c.4497delT) were relatively more prevalent in the Japanese population and the c.2997G > T mutation was associated with late onset. Although mutation analysis of the dysferlin gene is a time consuming task because of the large size of the gene, large series of patients with dysferlin gene mutations have been studied. However, few detailed analyses of the clinical features of LGMD2B, especially in relation to various types of mutations, have been reported. Here we report the clinical features of a series of 40 patients in 36 families with LGMD2B in whom dysferlin mutations were confirmed, and cardiac and respiratory functions were involved. In particular, we took into account the duration that had elapsed since onset when the clinical data were examined.

### Functional muscle hypertrophy by increased insulin-like growth factor 1 does not require dysferlin [^116k64An]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Loss‐of‐function mutations in the dysferlin gene (Dysf) in humans results in a spectrum of muscular dystrophies known as dysferlinopathies. 1 The dysferlinopathies manifest as distal anterior compartment myopathy, 2 limb‐girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B), 3 and Miyoshi myopathy. 4 The primary pathological consequences include defective membrane repair and intracellular vesicle accumulation. 5 The clinical problem associated with dysferlin loss is progressive muscle weakening, which begins in proximal muscles in LGMD2B and in distal muscles in Miyoshi myopathy. 6

Dysferlin is a 230‐kDa type II transmembrane protein 7 localized at the sarcolemma of mature skeletal muscle but also at transverse tubules in developing myotubes. 8 Dysferlin contains seven C2 domains 9 and a transmembrane domain. 10 The first C2 domain (C2A) can bind several phospholipids in a calcium‐dependent manner. 11 There is a plethora of evidence that implicates dysferlin as an essential regulator of vesicle fusion at the sarcolemma and an important player in muscle membrane repair. 12 However, dysferlin is not limited to sarcolemma repair but is also involved in muscle regeneration, 13 focal adhesion formation, 14 adenosine triphosphate‐dependent intercellular signaling, 15 and insulin‐like growth factor 1 (IGF‐1) receptor recycling. 16

### Cryo-EM structures of the membrane repair protein dysferlin [^112ZuATi]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Plasma membrane repair in response to damage is a fundamental and conserved cellular mechanism in eukaryotes. Skeletal and cardiac muscle cells are highly susceptible to membrane damage owing to their exposure to repetitive mechanical stress –. Muscle cells possess a conserved protein machinery that actively repairs damaged membranes within seconds to prevent cell death. Disruption of this machinery leads to chronic muscle fiber loss, inflammation, and fibrosis and can cause muscle diseases –. Dysferlin is a member of the ferlin family of vesicle fusion proteins and was originally identified as the first protein implicated in membrane repair mechanisms in striated muscles. Dysferlin mediates the Ca²⁺-dependent vesicle recruitment and fusion during membrane repair to ensure proper muscle function. Further, a role for dysferlin in stabilizing voltage-induced Ca²⁺ transients in skeletal muscle has been reported. While the precise mechanisms remain to be established, muscles from patients with dysferlin deficiency and dysferlin-null mice show impaired membrane repair that leads to the accumulation of unfused vesicles and muscular dystrophy. Overexpression of DYSF can rescue the muscular dystrophy phenotype in a Dysf -null mouse model. Loss-of-function mutations in DYSF cause a loss or reduction of dysferlin and render cells more susceptible to plasma membrane damage and compromise repair mechanisms. This results in progressive forms of dysferlinopathies which include muscular dystrophies such as Limb-Girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B), Miyoshi myopathy (MMD1), and other myopathies. Various pre-clinical strategies, including the use of a miniaturized dysferlin, are currently being explored to restore membrane repair in dysferlinopathies.

Table 1
Comparison of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies and muscular dystrophies

* Muscular dystrophies are genetically and phenotypically very heterogeneous, but with multiple subtypes; this table generalises the muscular dystrophy features.

Dysferlin deficiency on muscle immunostaining is the most pertinent feature for diagnosis of dysferlinopathies and the final confirmation is with genetic analysis of DYSF. However, loss of dysferlin staining is well recognised secondary phenomena in other limb girdle muscular dystrophies, most well characterised in mutations in caveolin-3 (LGMD 1C). Sequencing of this gene is challenging as it contains 55 coding exons, spans 150kb of genomic DNA and mutational hotspots do not appear to exist.

### Muscle MRI in patients with dysferlinopathy: pattern recognition and implications for clinical trials [^116KxZTJ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Lower leg muscles

Lower leg involvement was analysed in 182 patients. Hierarchical analysis identified three more commonly and more severely involved muscles (figure 4C): the soleus (99.45%), gastrocnemius medialis (99.45%) and the gastrocnemius lateralis (94.7%).

Figure 4
Heatmap of the muscle involvement of the lower leg muscles. Patients and muscles are ordered according to hierarchical clustering with increasing grading in fat replacement severity from the bottom to the top (patients — rows) and from the left to the right (muscles — columns). The score of a muscle in a patient is indicated by the colour of the square. Grey squares means that data is not available. A column in the far left contains information related to the phenotype of the patient at onset of the disease (Yellow: LGMD-2B; red: Miyoshi). We have also included a column with information about the time from onset of symptoms to the MRI (years symptomatic) in blue. We found a statistically significant correlation between the median value of the Mercuri score per patient and the years symptomatic. LGMD-2B, limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B.

Commonly observed patterns included:
All symptomatic patients had involvement of at least one posterior muscle of the lower legs (figure 1T–W and figure 4).
Peroneus equally or more involved than the tibialis anterior (figure 1T–W and figure 4).
Patients with advanced disease could have involvement of all lower leg muscles, including the tibialis posterior (figure 1T–W and figure 4).

Influence of demographic and clinical features on muscle involvement

There were gender differences in the degree of muscle fatty involvement in some muscles. The rectus abdominis, rectus femoris, vastus intermedius, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, peroneus longus, peroneus brevis, gastrocnemius lateralis, gastrocnemius medialis and soleus were more severely involved in women (Mann Whitney U test, p < 0.05). Ethnicity did not appear to influence the degree of involvement. Neither the type of mutation nor the phenotype at onset correlated with the pattern or severity of the fat replacement on MRI.

### Assessment of disease progression in dysferlinopathy: a 1-year cohort study [^115qo7v6]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

When assessed by severity subgroup, for ambulant patients, the a-NSAA was the most sensitive test in the mildly (SRM 0.44) and moderately (SRM 0.89) affected groups, while the 6MWT was most sensitive in the severely affected ambulant group (SRM 0.9). The 10-meter walk was the only test showing significant change in all ambulant subgroups. For nonambulant patients, the most sensitive test was the MMT for wrist flexion (SRM 0.69), while the most sensitive combined measure was the distal domain of the MFM (SRM 0.46). Table e-1 (available from Dryad) shows SRM values for all assessments by severity subgroup. Change in functional test scores (MFM and a-NSAA) did not differ between the 2 most common clinical diagnoses of LGMD2B and Miyoshi myopathy (table 3).

### Dysferlin-deficient muscular dystrophy features amyloidosis [^113npqKJ]. Annals of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Dysferlin (DYSF) gene mutations cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and Miyoshi's myopathy. The consequences of DYSF mutations on protein structure are poorly understood.

Methods

The gene encoding dysferlin was sequenced in patients with suspected dysferlin-deficient muscular dystrophy. Muscle biopsy specimens were analyzed by histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Antibodies against N-terminal dysferlin-peptides were raised.

Results

We found three families with muscular dystrophy caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous DYSF mutations featuring sarcolemmal and interstitial amyloid deposits. These mutations were all located in the N-terminal region of the protein. Dysferlin was a constituent of the amyloid deposits.

Interpretation

Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B is the first muscular dystrophy associated with amyloidosis. Molecular treatment strategies will necessarily have to consider the presence of amyloidogenesis.

### Calpain-3 and dysferlin protein screening in patients with limb-girdle dystrophy and myopathy [^114MzhgX]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Mutations in the genes encoding for calpain-3 and dysferlin are responsible for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) type 2A and 2B, the most common forms of autosomal recessive LGMD.

Objective

To identify calpain-3 or dysferlin deficiency in a large cohort of patients with as yet unclassified LGMD and myopathy through candidate protein analysis.

Methods

The authors' muscle biopsy database search identified 407 candidate muscle biopsies with normal dystrophin and sarcoglycan. Calpain-3 and dysferlin were studied by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry.

Results

Combined calpain-3 and dysferlin Western blot analysis identified calpain-3 deficiency in 66 (16%) muscle biopsies. In 31 cases (47%), the protein was absent, and in 35 (53%), it was severely reduced in amount (3 to 50% of control). Dysferlin deficiency was found in 26 (6.5%) muscle biopsies. In 9, the protein was absent (35%), and in 17 (65%), it was severely reduced in amount (traces to 20% of control). Twenty-eight percent (53/191) of patients with LGMD phenotype had calpain-3 deficiency. Sixty percent (21/35) of patients with distal myopathy had dysferlin deficiency. Dysferlin immunohistochemistry showed, in the completely dysferlin-deficient patients, absent reaction at the sarcolemma but positive nuclear membrane labeling and, in the partially dysferlin-deficient patients, scattered granular positive cytoplasmic areas and diffuse reaction in regenerating fibers.

Conclusion

About 25% of previously unclassified dystrophy/myopathy cases are due to calpain-3 or dysferlin protein deficiency. These results suggest that immunoblot analysis may be used to define patients for calpain-3 and dysferlin gene mutation studies.

### Clarifying the boundaries between the inflammatory and dystrophic myopathies: insights from molecular diagnostics and microarrays [^115EQzi2]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Clinical and histopathologic overlaps between the muscular dystrophies and inflammatory myopathies are being increasingly recognized. Most patients with a muscular dystrophy show improvement with prednisone treatment, although they will not be cured; many patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are cured. Dysferlin-deficiency was recently recognized as a cause of late-onset dystrophy with substantial inflammation in muscle. Corticosteroid usage by these patients may result in nonrecoverable loss of strength. Therefore, it is important to rule out dysferlin-deficiency before initiating a course of corticosteroids. Newly emerging, genome-wide transcriptional profiling technology allows the identification of the interacting pathways that are active in the muscle of patients with inflammatory myopathies or dystrophies. There are several, complex molecular pathways; however, the comparison of expression profiles in patients with different muscle disorders permits the delineation of disease-specific patterns. It is hoped that novel approaches for treating the inflammatory myopathies and dystrophies can be derived from intimate knowledge of the pathways involved in each disease, and the key molecules that provide cross-talk between pathways.

### Muscular dystrophy with marked dysferlin deficiency is consistently caused by primary dysferlin gene mutations [^113aHpFx]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Many groups have questioned the value of protein analysis in carrying out a correct diagnosis. Fanin et al observed that the levels of Dysferlin were reduced to 50% of those of the controls in the carriers of LGMD2B. They showed that a reduction of 50% indicated both familial and isolated LGMD2B heterozygotes, and suggested the use of Dysferlin protein testing to select muscle biopsies from suspected carriers for a subsequent mutation analysis.

Our data support the dysferlin gene as the unique cause of Dysferlin deficiency between 0 and 20% by WB analysis. Although for three patients (3484, 4132 and X147) the second allele was not identified, this was only because of incomplete testing for insufficient DNA. However, this does not affect the main conclusions of the study, because these patients show sure causative alleles (frameshift/duplication) that cannot be coincidental.

This marked reduction is necessary to affect muscle membrane repair. We cannot exclude the presence of other functional mutations, but a direct proof of pathogenicity is always required, as the dysferlin gene shows a large number of variants and polymorphisms that can be misleading. In these cases, the possible lack of mutations in the dysferlin gene may be because of incomplete genetic testing.

The results obtained in this present paper have an immediate diagnostic application: a Dysferlin reduction to 20% (which can also be measured from blood monocytes,) can be used to identify LGMD2B with 100% accuracy. In the case of LGMD2B this observation is noteworthy. When a rapid Dysferlin blood testing will be available, important decisions will derive, such as to avoid steroids (that are ineffective/deleterious in LGMD2B in contrast with other forms of muscular dystrophy) and any distressing sport in children.

Although it is generally agreed that an extensive molecular analysis has a high cost, a precise determination of the dysferlin gene is, however, particularly important from a diagnostic/counselling perspective and in view of the development of a future therapeutic strategy. A successful recognition of all the mutations demonstrates the power of a combined diagnostic strategy. More importantly, a complete genetic testing should be applied to all other LGMD cases.

Muscle MRI: acquisition

One hundred and eighty-two patients underwent a baseline muscle MRI scan, of which 84 patients had whole body and 98 patients lower limb scans. The core protocol consisted of T1-weighted, Dixon, B1 map and T2-weighted sequences. Here, we report the findings using anatomical T1-weighted sequences. The manufacturer, models and axial T1-weighted parameters are detailed in online supplementary file 2. The quality of the MRI studies was analysed by the study radiologists.

Muscle MRI: Semiquantitative assessment

A blinded neurologist (RF-T) and radiologist (JL), both with experience in muscle MRI in neuromuscular disorders, independently evaluated axial T1-weighted sequences with the semiquantitative Mercuri visual scale, modified by Fischer, described in online supplementary file 2. The observers agreed on the scoring of 96% of muscles. Inter-rater agreement kappa was 0.93 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.96). For the remaining 4%, observers reviewed the muscles together and agreed a final score.

Genotype-MRI correlation

We divided the cohort into two groups depending on mutation type: (1) patients in whom absent dysferlin expression was predicted (harbouring homozygous or compound heterozygous truncating mutations) and (2) patients in whom reduced dysferlin expression was predicted (two missense mutations or one missense mutation and one truncating mutation). We compared median value of muscle fatty replacement between groups using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.

Statistics

We used the Shapiro-Wilk test to confirm that none of our variables were normally distributed. As such, non-parametric statistic tests were used for the analysis.

The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare quantitative variables and the χ² test to compare qualitative variables. Due to the high number of comparisons studied, Bonferroni correction was used as posthoc analysis. To investigate correlations between muscle function tests and MRI findings, Spearman's rank correlation was used (coefficient reported as ρ). The correlation was considered significant if p value was less than 0.05 and ρ was 0.6 or higher. Hierarchical analysis and graphical representation as a heatmap was performed using R software, V.3.1.3. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, V.21 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA).

Standard protocol approvals, registrations and patient consents

All participants provided informed consent. The study was approved by ethical review boards at each centre and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01676077).

Thigh muscles

Thigh involvement was analysed in 182 patients. Hierarchical analysis identified four muscles that were more commonly and more severely involved (figure 3): the semimembranosus (95.4%), semitendinosus (90.2%), biceps femoris long head (93.5%) and adductor magnus (94.1%).

Figure 3
Heatmap of the muscle involvement of the thigh muscles. Patients and muscles are ordered according to hierarchical clustering with increasing grading in severity of fat replacement from the bottom to the top (patients — rows) and from the left to the right (muscles — columns). The score of a muscle in a patient is indicated by the colour of the square. Grey squares means that data is not available. A column in the far left contains information related to the phenotype of the patient at onset of the disease (Yellow: LGMD-2B; red: Miyoshi). We have also included a column with information about the time from onset of symptoms to the MRI (years symptomatic) in blue and a column on the far right with the results of the Timed Up & Go and Time to Climb 4 Stairs tests in red: the darker the square the more time from onset (blue) or the worse the result of the Time to Up & Go (red). We found a statistically significant correlation between the median value of the Mercuri score per patient, the years symptomatic and the results of the time to Up & Go test. LGMD-2B, limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2; MMT, manual muscle testing.

Commonly observed patterns included:
The biceps femoris long head was equally or more involved than the biceps femoris short head (figure 1P–S and figure 3).
The adductor magnus equally or more severely involved than the adductor longus (figure 1P–S and figure 3).
Rectus femoris was not spared when the vasti muscles were involved (Mercuri 2, 3 or 4) (figure 1P–S and figure 3).
The sartorius and gracilis were not involved until late stages, but even then were not commonly completely replaced by fat (figure 1P–S and figure 3).

Figure 1
Axial T1-weighted muscle MRI in dysferlinopathy. The cranial muscles (A–B) more commonly replaced by fat are the tongue (T) and the cervical paraspinal muscles (CPs). Levator scapulae (LS) is generally not involved until later stages of the disease (C, no involvement; D, involvement). In the scapular region (E–H) the subscapularis (Sc) is involved at the early stages; other muscles such as deltoid (De), infraspinatus (Is) or supraspinatus (SS) become progressively involved. Rhomboideus (R) tends to be not involved until later stages of the disease (E–G, no involvement; H, involvement in an advanced case). Biceps brachii (Bi), triceps brachii (Tr) and the anterior muscles of the forearm (FA) are commonly involved (I–K), while the posterior muscles of the forearm (FP) are not involved even in later stages of the disease. Latissimus dorsi (LD) tends to be involved before serratus anterior (SA) in most of the patients (I–J). Paraspinal muscles including the multifidus (M), the longissimus (L) and the iliocostalis (Ic) are affected in most of the patients at symptom onset, while abdominal muscles, such as rectus abdominis (RA) are more resistant and become affected only in latter stages (K). Gluteus minor (GMi) is more severely involved than gluteus medius (GMe) and maximus (GMa) (L–M). Pelvic floor muscles are transformed by fat in patients with dysferlinopathy, with the tensor fascia latae (TFL), obturatorius externus (OE) and internus (OI) being the muscles more commonly involved (N–O). The posterior muscles of the thighs (semimembranosus (Sm), biceps femoris long head (BLH), biceps femoris short head (BSH) or adductor major (AM)) are commonly involved in most of the patients (P–S). BSH tend to be less involved than BLH in early and mid-stage patients (Q). Vasti muscles are commonly involved even in early stages of the diseases (vastus intermedius (VI) in R). In contrast Sartorius (Sa) and gracilis (Gr) are not involved until late stages of the disease (Q and S). Analysis of the lower legs (T–W) shows initial involvement of gastrocnemius medialis (GM) and lateralis (GL) and soleus (So). Peroneus muscles (Pe) are also involved in most of the patients (U). Later in the progression of the disease tibialis anterior (TA) and posterior (TP) become transformed by fat (V–W).

### Disease duration and disability in dysfeRlinopathy can be described by muscle imaging using heatmaps and random forests [^115cs9y1]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The manner in which imaging patterns change over the disease course and with increasing disability in dysferlinopathy is not fully understood.

Methods

Fibroadipose infiltration of 61 muscles was scored based on whole-body MRI of 33 patients with dysferlinopathy and represented in a heatmap. We trained random forests to predict disease duration, Motor Function Measure dimension 1 (MFM-D1), and modified Rankin scale (MRS) score based on muscle scoring and selected the most important muscle for predictions.

Results

The heatmap delineated positive and negative fingerprints in dysferlinopathy. Disease duration was related to infiltration of infraspinatus, teres major-minor, and supraspinatus muscles. MFM-D1 decreased with higher infiltration of teres major-minor, triceps, and sartorius. MRS related to infiltration of vastus medialis, gracilis, infraspinatus, and sartorius.

Discussion

Dysferlinopathy shows a recognizable muscle MRI pattern. Fibroadipose infiltration in specific muscles of the thigh and the upper limb appears to be an important marker for disease progression. Muscle Nerve 59:436–444, 2019.

### Muscle MRI in patients with dysferlinopathy: pattern recognition and implications for clinical trials [^113zBER6]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Study set-up and subjects

Two hundred and one patients with dysferlinopathy from 15 sites (Newcastle, Barcelona, Seville, Munich, Berlin, Padua, Marseille, Paris, Saint Louis, Columbus, Charlotte, Washington DC, Stanford, Tokyo and Sydney) were enrolled in the study. One hundred and eighty-two patients had an MRI scan (clinical and genetic details are described in online supplementary file 1). Inclusion criteria were ≥ 2 pathogenic mutations in DYSF or 1 pathogenic mutation plus either absent dysferlin expression on skeletal muscle immunoblot or ≤ 20% blood dysferlin monocyte expression. Truncating mutations and splice site mutations affecting the +1/–1 or +2/–2 positions were deemed pathogenic. Pathogenicity of other splice site mutations and missense mutations was defined according to the UMD Predictor.

Demographic data were collected for ethnicity, gender, age, ambulatory status and disease duration. Patients were stratified according to the pattern of weakness at disease onset: (1) LGMD-2B, (2) MM, (3) proximodistal weakness, (4) other (pseudometabolic weakness). Those patients with no weakness at baseline examination but hyperCKemia were considered as (5) asymptomatic hyperCKemia. Disease duration was based on the time from onset of muscle weakness in symptomatic patients and time from first abnormal blood analysis result in patients with isolated hyperCKemia.

Functional status and physiotherapy assessment

Ambulation status was determined by the ability to walk 10 m with shoes and usual walking aids or orthotics. Physiotherapists assessed muscle strength in upper and lower limbs by manual muscle testing (MMT) using an Medical Research Council 11-point scale (0 = no movement, 1, 2, 3–, 3, 3+, 4–, 4, 4+, 5–, 5 = no weakness). A dysferlinopathy-adapted 22-item scale based on the original 17-item North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) scale used in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and the Motor Function Measure were used to assess motor performance. Timed tests (6 min walk test, rise from floor, 10 m walk/run, time to climb and descend four steps and timed up and go tests) were performed in ambulant patients. The Brooke scale was performed to evaluate upper limb functional status and the ACTIVLIM as a patient-reported outcome measure.

### Identification and characterisation of human dysferlin transcript variants: implications for dysferlin mutational screening and isoforms [^112SLoUg]. Human Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

In conducting dysferlin mutational screening using blood mRNA instead of genomic DNA, we identified the occurrence of alternative splicing involving novel dysferlin exons, i.e. exons 5a and 40a, in addition to previously reported alternative splicing of exon 17. Further study employing long range RT-PCR and subcloning revealed a total of fourteen dysferlin transcripts with maintained dysferlin reading frame. The study also characterised the differences in relative frequencies of the dysferlin transcripts in skeletal muscle and blood. The findings have potential implications for molecular diagnosis of dysferlinopathy and the identification of dysferlin isoforms.

### A case of dysferlinopathy presenting choreic movements [^114bcbaG]. Movement Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Mutations in the dysferlin gene cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B). The involvement of the central nervous system in dysferlinopathy has not been described. We describe the clinical features of a patient with LGMD2B associated with dysferlin mutations (homozygous G3370T) who presented progressive choreic movements. The patient had no evidence of other causes of chorea. It is suggested that the chorea may be associated with the altered expression of the brain isoform of dysferlin.

### Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies [^111LHQTP]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this review is to provide an up-to-date analysis of current knowledge about limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs).

Recent Findings

Over the last few years, new and interesting studies have been published on LGMD. New LGMD genes have been discovered and the clinical and genetic heterogeneity in this group of muscular dystrophies has been further enlarged by the description of new forms of LGMD. Several studies have demonstrated involvement of genes causing posttranslational modifications of alpha-dystroglycan in the pathogenesis of autosomal recessive LGMD. This has highlighted an important overlap in pathogenesis between LGMD and congenital muscular dystrophies, prompting further research. Moreover, new pathogenic mechanisms and pathways are emerging for LGMD, in particular calpainopathies, dysferlinopathies and titinopathies. Such new findings may suggest novel therapeutic approaches and future clinical trials.

Summary

The increased understanding of the genes and pathogenic mechanism of the LGMDs will improve diagnostic processes and prognostic accuracy, and promote therapeutic strategies. European and global LGMD patient registries will increase current knowledge on natural history and facilitate translational research.

Scapular muscles

Scapular involvement was analysed in 78 patients. Hierarchical analysis identified four muscles as more commonly and severely involved (figure 2): the subscapularis (80.8%), latissimus dorsi (75.3%), infraspinatus (73.8%) and supraspinatus (72.8%).

Figure 2

The score of a muscle in a patient is indicated by the colour of the square. Grey squares mean that data are not available. The column in the top left contains information related to the phenotype of the patient at onset of the disease (legend in the bottom left). We have also included a column with information about the time from onset of symptoms to the MRI (years symptomatic) in blue and a column to the far right with the results of the Brooke and ACTIVLIM scales (see legends for these scales at the bottom of the figure): the darker the square, the more time from onset (blue) or the worse the result of the Brooke (orange) or ACTIVLIM scales. We found a statistically significant correlation between the median value of the Mercuri score per patient, the years symptomatic and the results of the Brooke and ACTIVLIM scale. LGMD-2B, limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B.

Commonly observed patterns included:
The s ubscapularis could be involved in patients even without symptoms of proximal upper limb muscle dysfunction as measured by the Brooke or MMT (figure 1E and figure 2).
The supraspinatus and infraspinatus were equally or more severely involved than the rhomboideus (figure 1F–H and figure 2).
The latissimus dorsi was equally or more severely involved than the serratus anterior (figure 1I, J and figure 2).
If levator scapulae and rhomboideus were affected, subscapularis, supraspinatus and infraspinatus were severely involved (Mercuri 3–4) (figure 1C–H and figure 2).

### Developmental and tissue-specific regulation of a novel dysferlin isoform [^114eCuFC]. Muscle & Nerve (2004). Low credibility.

Dysferlin plays an essential role in the muscle repair machinery, and its deficiency is associated with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and with two different distal myopathies (Miyoshi myopathy and distal anterior compartment myopathy). Our aims were to characterize the pattern of dysferlin expression during myogenic cell differentiation and to assess possible differentially spliced isoforms of the DYSF gene. Human primary myogenic cells express a splice variant of dysferlin mRNA lacking exon 17 (Delta17), together with full-length dysferlin mRNA. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of human myoblasts, myotubes, and normal skeletal muscle showed that Delta17 expression inversely correlates with muscle differentiation. Indeed, Delta17 is progressively replaced by the wild type as myoblast fusion proceeds, and it disappears in adult skeletal muscle. Conversely, Delta17 is the predominant dysferlin variant in mature peripheral nerve. Our findings suggest that the two proteins play different roles in myogenic cell differentiation and that dysferlin function in peripheral nerve might be accomplished by this novel isoform.

### Identical dysferlin mutation in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and distal myopathy [^115rtncm]. Neurology (2000). Low credibility.

Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy (MM) are autosomal recessive disorders caused by mutations in the dysferlin gene on chromosome 2p13. The authors studied a large Russian family with both LGMD2B and MM. All affected individuals, as well as one preclinical boy with dystrophic changes on muscle biopsy, were found to be homozygous for a novel dysferlin mutation, TG573/574AT (Val67Asp). This finding supports the view that additional factors (e.g., modifier genes) contribute to the phenotypic expression of causative mutations in dysferlinopathies.

Hierarchical analysis identified six more commonly and more severely involved muscles (online supplementary figure 2): the tensor fascia latae (95%), gluteus minimus (90.8%), obturator externus (86%), iliocostalis (93.1%), longissimus (86.2%) and multifidus (88.5%).

Commonly observed patterns included:
Paraspinal muscles were equally or more involved than abdominal muscles (figure 1J, K and online supplementary figure 2).
The gluteus minimus was more severely involved than gluteus medius and gluteus maximus (figure 1L, M and online supplementary figure 2).
The obturator externus was equally or more severely involved than the gluteus maximus (figure 1L–O and online supplementary figure 2).

### New aspects on patients affected by dysferlin deficient muscular dystrophy [^114wQbas]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Results

Muscle immunoanalysis findings

Immunohistochemistry

Dysferlin was either severely reduced or absent on tissue sections with no apparent correlation to the clinical presentation or underlying mutation. β-dystroglycan was reduced in 17% of samples, and caveolin-3 showed reduced sarcolemmal labelling in 25% of cases. No correlation was found between the residual labelling and the phenotype of the patient.

Western blot

Dysferlin bands were reduced or absent in all patients. Neither the type of mutation nor the phenotype at presentation showed a correlation to the amount of dysferlin detectable on blots. Similar to previously reported data, we found a secondary reduction of calpain 3 in the majority of patients (77% exon 1, 82% exon 8) and a more variable reduction of caveolin-3 (67% in 12 blots probed with anti-Cav-3).

Correlation of phenotype (MM vs LGMD) with inflammation in the muscle biopsy

There was no correlation between the phenotype and the level of inflammation in the muscle biopsy identified by haematoxylin–eosin staining.

Mutation analysis

Molecular diagnosis was established in all patients with 89% (32 patients) harbouring two mutations in the dysferlin gene: 14 patients were homozygous (including one patient with an additional heterozygous mutation) and 18 patients were compound heterozygous. One of the latter patients had three mutations (patient No 13). In 11% (four patients), only one mutation was detected, including one patient who is likely to be a symptomatic carrier. The patients with one mutation only were included on the basis of dysferlin depletion in the muscle biopsy. A summary of the mutations found in our patient cohort, the percentage of different mutations and their location within the dysferlin gene are depicted in table 1 and figure 1. As previously reported, no mutational hot spots were evident, and mutations were spread widely throughout the gene.

### Recurrent, non-traumatic, non-exertional rhabdomyolysis after immunologic stimuli in a healthy adolescent female: a case report [^117XWjXY]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Dysferlinopathy refers to a heterogenous group of autosomal recessive disorders that are caused by mutations in DYSF gene that encodes a skeletal muscle protein, dysferlin. With more than 300 sequence variations including both deleterious and nonpathogenic polymorphisms, diagnosis usually involves a detailed history and physical to elicit a clinical phenotype, along with muscle biopsy, Western blot, and imaging. Conditions with distinct phenotypic presentations that have been associated with DYSF gene mutations include limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B), Miyoshi myopathy (MM), asymptomatic hyperCKemia, and distal myopathy with anterior tibial onset (DMAT). While there have been reports of symptomatic heterozygote carriers of dysferlinopathies, to our knowledge none have been associated with recurrent rhabdomyolysis after immunogenic stimuli.

### Clinical, morphological and immunological evaluation of six patients with dysferlin deficiency [^111ucsch]. Acta Neuropathologica (2003). Low credibility.

Limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) type 2B and distal Miyoshi myopathy (MM) are caused by mutations in a recently discovered mammalian gene coding for a skeletal muscle protein called dysferlin. The protein is normally expressed at the skeletal muscle level and absent or reduced in affected patients. We selected a clinically heterogeneous population of Italian myopathic patients with clinical evidence of myopathy and/or hyperCKemia, EMG myopathic pattern, and no alterations of the dystrophin-sarcoglycan complex. Calpain, merosin, emerin and caveolin were also tested and found normal in all patients. Dysferlin immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses allowed us to identify six patients with dysferlin deficiency: one with distal myopathy, four with limb girdle myopathy and one with hyperCKemia. No apoptosis was found in any of the six muscle specimens, although expression of the pro-apoptotic Fas antigen was mildly increased in two cases. Inflammatory reactions were present in two of the six cases, but we found no evidence of immune-mediated processes.

### Clinical features and a mutation with late onset of limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B [^112XjgH6]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective and Methods

Dysferlin encoded by DYSF deficiency leads to two main phenotypes, limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2B and Miyoshi myopathy. To reveal in detail the mutational and clinical features of LGMD2B in Japan, we observed 40 Japanese patients in 36 families with LGMD2B in whom dysferlin mutations were confirmed.

Results and Conclusions

Three mutations (c.1566C > G, c.2997G > T and c.4497delT) were relatively more prevalent. The c.2997G > T mutation was associated with late onset, proximal dominant forms of dysferlinopathy, a high probability that muscle weakness started in an upper limb and lower serum creatine kinase (CK) levels. The clinical features of LGMD2B are as follows: (1) onset in the late teens or early adulthood, except patients homozygous for the c.2997G > T mutation; (2) lower limb weakness at onset; (3) distal change of lower limbs on muscle CT at an early stage; (4) impairment of lumbar erector spinal muscles on muscle CT at an early stage; (5) predominant involvement of proximal upper limbs; (6) preservation of function of the hands at late stage; (7) preservation of strength in neck muscles at late stage; (8) lack of facial weakness or dysphagia; (9) avoidance of scoliosis; (10) hyper-Ckaemia; (11) preservation of cardiac function; and (12) a tendency for respiratory function to decline with disease duration. It is important that the late onset phenotype is found with prevalent mutations.

### Muscle MRI in patients with dysferlinopathy: pattern recognition and implications for clinical trials [^116E5mLn]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Patients

We included 182 patients (91 women, mean age at MRI 38 ± 12.6 years) from whom we have obtained muscle MRI scans. Demographic, clinical and genetic data are summarised in online supplementary file 3.

Muscle MRI involvement: general features

Signal abnormalities in T1-weighted images were detected in all but one patient (181 out of 182 patients). Asymmetric involvement, judged as a score difference of at least 2 points in at least one muscle, was found in 77 patients (41.8%) although in 51/77 patients the asymmetry was found in one muscle only. Asymmetry in two or more muscles was found in 26/77 patients. Muscles that had asymmetric involvement were variable.

Cranial muscles

Cranial involvement was analysed in 73 patients and fatty replacement was detected in 25 (34.2%). The tongue (34.2%) and the cervical paraspinal muscles (24.6%) were most commonly involved (figure 1A–D). In contrast, temporalis, masseter and sternocleidomastoideus muscles were least commonly affected (only in 1, 2 and 3 patients, respectively). The degree of fat replacement of the cervical paraspinal and sternocleidomastoideus muscles had a statistically significant correlation with item 1 'lifts head from supine', from the NSAA-a, although the correlation coefficient was poor (ρ = 0.46) (table 1).

Influence of disease duration on the degree of muscle pathology: a natural history approach

Disease duration (defined here as time since onset of muscle weakness) correlated with the degree of fat replacement in all anatomical regions (Spearman's test, p < 0.0001). To investigate the sequence of muscle involvement as the disease progressed, we classified the patients into six groups depending on the time to MRI from onset and calculated the median value of fat replacement of muscle tissue. The heatmaps obtained revealed a pattern of disease progression (figure 5). The muscles involved in the earliest stages of the disease were predominantly in the lower limbs, pelvis or trunk, although the s ubscapularis and the latissimus dorsi could also be involved early (figure 5). The rate at which fatty replacement progressed varied between muscles, for example, the soleu s, gastrocnemius medialis and semimembranosus were usually completely involved after 10 years, while the adductor magnus or vastus lateralis were only completely involved when disease duration approached 25 years.

Patients were divided into six groups for the analysis of the progression of muscle involvement. Muscles (columns) are ordered according to hierarchical clustering with increasing grading of muscle fatty replacement in T1-W imaging from the left to the right. The score of a muscle per every group is indicated by the colour of the square. We obtained a pattern of the progression of the disease related to the time from onset of symptoms to the MRI showing the natural history of the disease.

### Dysferlin aggregation in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B / miyoshi myopathy necessitates mutational screen for diagnosis [^114PEYcU]. Muscle & Nerve (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diagnosis of the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) has been facilitated by the use of immunofluorescence microscopy, Western blot analysis, and rapid genetic testing.

Methods

We identified 7 patients with LGMD2B or Miyoshi myopathy (MM) phenotypes and performed detailed history, physical examination, and mutation analyses of genomic DNA.

Results

Ten disease-causing variants of the dysferlin gene (DYSF) were detected, 4 of which were novel and predicted to be pathogenic (IVS33+9G > T, c.1343T > C, c.4747T > G, and c.5066dupC). Two of these mutations (c.1343T > C and IVS33+9G > T) were associated with a reduction in sarcolemmal dysferlin expression, despite increased total mRNA and protein in mixed muscle homogenates, due to a pathological retention of the mutated polypeptide in the cytoplasm.

Conclusions

Considering that protein-based assays may yield false negative test results and that dysferlin aggregation may be present in other LGMDs, mutational screening is necessary for specific diagnosis in primary dysferlinopathy patients exhibiting this phenotype.

The allelic muscle disorders known as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B), Miyoshi myopathy and distal anterior compartment myopathy result from defects in dysferlin-a sarcolemma-associated protein involved in membrane repair. Mutation screening in the dysferlin gene (DYSF) enabled the identification of seven Portuguese patients presenting the variant c.5492G > A, which was observed to promote skipping of exon 49 (p. Gly1802ValfsX17). Several residually expressed products of alternative splicing also involving exons 50 and 51 were detected in the leukocytes and muscle of both patients and normal controls. Quantitative transcript analysis confirmed these results and revealed that Delta49/Delta50 transcripts were predominant in blood. Although the patients were apparently unrelated, the c.5492G > A mutation was found in linkage disequilibrium with a particularly rare haplotype in the population, corroborating the hypothesis of a common origin. Despite the presence of the same mutation on the same haplotype background, onset of the disease was heterogeneous, with either proximal or distal muscle involvement.

### Genomic organization of the dysferlin gene and novel mutations in miyoshi myopathy [^115VkUyg]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Mutations in the skeletal muscle gene dysferlin cause two autosomal recessive forms of muscular dystrophy: Miyoshi myopathy (MM) and limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B). The purpose of this study was to define the genomic organization of the dysferlin gene and conduct mutational screening and a survey of clinical features in 21 patients with defined molecular defects in the dysferlin gene.

Methods

Genomic organization of the gene was determined by comparing the dysferlin cDNA and genomic sequence in P1-derived artificial chromosomes (PACs) containing the gene. Mutational screening entailed conformational analysis and sequencing of genomic DNA and cDNA. Clinical records of patients with defined dysferlin gene defects were reviewed retrospectively.

Results

The dysferlin gene encompasses 55 exons spanning over 150 kb of genomic DNA. Mutational screening revealed nine novel mutations associated with MM. The range of onset in this patient group was narrow with a mean of 19.0 ± 3.9 years.

Conclusion

This study confirms that the dysferlin gene is mutated in MM and LGMD2B and extends understanding of the timing of onset of the disease. Knowledge of the genomic organization of the gene will facilitate mutation detection and investigations of the molecular biologic properties of the dysferlin gene.

### New aspects on patients affected by dysferlin deficient muscular dystrophy [^111a238x]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Pulmonary and cardiac function

Respiratory vital capacity was not reduced to a clinically relevant level in any of the patients nor did any of the patients report symptoms compatible with nocturnal hypoventilation. Although not formally assessed, none of the patients has presented with clinically overt cardiovascular symptoms so far, with the longest disease duration being 42 years.

Pre-symptomatic muscle function

As anecdotal evidence has previously suggested good muscle prowess before onset of symptoms in patients affected by dysferlin deficiency, a detailed history was taken in all patients on their sporting and physical activities and capabilities prior to onset of symptoms. Fifty-three per cent of dysferlin deficient patients reported a high degree of activity and were remarkably sporty. No statistically significant difference was noted regarding age of onset between the group of patients with marked sportiness in comparison with those who were average or not good at sports (p = 0.77). It is difficult to provide a direct comparison with another diagnostic groups on this point. However, when we addressed the same question in a group of 22 LGMD2A patients, only 9% reported good muscle prowess before onset of symptoms. No statistically significant difference between MM and LGMD2B was found with respect to pre-symptomatic fitness levels, suggesting that this parameter is not associated with a specific phenotype of dysferlin deficiency at presentation.

### Dysferlin mutation analysis in a group of Italian patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and miyoshi myopathy [^112hBo2y]. European Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Mutations in the dysferlin gene (DYSF) on chromosome 2p13 cause distinct phenotypes of muscular dystrophy: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B), Miyoshi myopathy (MM), and distal anterior compartment myopathy, which are known by the term 'dysferlinopathy'. We performed mutation analyses of DYSF in 14 Italian patients from 10 unrelated families with a deficiency of dysferlin protein below 20% of the value in normal controls by immunoblotting analysis. We identified 11 different mutations, including eight missense and three deletion mutations. Nine of them were novel mutations. We also identified a unique 6-bp insertion polymorphism within the coding region of DYSF in 15% of Italian population, which was not observed in East Asian populations. The correlation between clinical phenotype and the gene mutations was unclear, which suggested the role of additional genetic and epigenetic factors in modifying clinical symptoms.

### Abnormal expression of dysferlin in skeletal muscle and monocytes supports primary dysferlinopathy in patients with one mutated allele [^1174Rqqs]. European Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In some cases, a definitive confirmation of dysferlinopathy cannot be achieved by DNA test, because the mutation is detected in one allele only.

Patients and Methods

DYSFERLIN expression in skeletal muscle and peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) was studied by Western blot in two unrelated adult patients. The comparative C(T) method (ΔΔC(T)) was used to calculate relative changes in dysferlin mRNA determined from real-time quantitative PCR experiments. The dysferlin gene was studied by direct sequencing of cDNA and genomic DNA and by Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) analysis.

Results

A comparable severe reduction in dysferlin was demonstrated in both skeletal muscle and PBM. The expression of dysferlin mRNA was significantly reduced. A novel mutation in exon 47 (c.5289G > C) of the dysferlin gene in the heterozygous state, causing an amino acid change (p. Glu1763Asp), was detected in both patients. The MLPA analysis did not reveal any deletion or duplication.

Conclusions

Dysferlin and/or dysferlin mRNA abnormalities are diagnostic for dysferlinopathy when mutational analysis detects a mutation in one allele only. Analysis of dysferlin mRNA can be helpful for distinguishing symptomatic heterozygotes from such patients.

### Variable reduction of caveolin-3 in patients with LGMD2B / MM [^111jVwKj]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Mutations in the human dysferlin gene (DYSF) cause autosomal recessive muscular dystrophies characterized by degeneration and weakness of proximal and/or distal muscles: limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy (MM). Recently, an interaction between caveolin-3 and dysferlin in normal and dystrophic muscle (primary caveolin-3 deficiency; LGMD1C) was shown. In this study, clinical, morphological and genetic analysis was carried out in four independent LGMD2B/MM patients. All patients presented with an adult-onset, slowly progressive muscular dystrophy with variable involvement of proximal and distal muscles. We found complete lack of dysferlin in the four LGMD2B/MM patients. Secondary reduction of caveolin-3 was detected in three out of the four patients. Regular caveolae were detected along the basal lamina in two patients by electron microscopy. We provide further evidence that dysferlin and caveolin-3 interact in human skeletal muscle. It remains to be elucidated whether the loss of this interaction contributes to pathogenic events in muscular dystrophy.

DNA resequencing

All exon and flanking intron resequencing was used to confirm all the mutations. We identified three additional mutations, the diagnosis being completed in 58/65 patients (Table 1). Surprisingly, six apparently homozygous alleles were not confirmed by the DNA analysis. These alleles were heterozygous, and for three out of six patients a second nonsense mutation was identified in other regions of the gene. This can be explained by the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of the mRNA.(Figure 2e). For the other three patients with NMD, the promoter region was not mutated.

Array CGH, real-time PCR and long PCR

In all cases with an incomplete gene testing (0 or 1 mutated allele), we performed a CGH array to identify possible heterozygous intragenic rearrangements, such as deletions or duplications(Table 1). We used a minimum of three probes per exon plus promoter probes covering a genomic region of 220 kb using a total of 196 probes. We identified a heterozygous duplication involving the 5′ end of the gene from exon 1 to 22 (3484), and a heterozygous deletion (X583). In addition, we performed a long PCR on the mRNA and/or gDNA using primers located at distant positions in the transcript in order to confirm the alterations.

Mutation spectrum

The exhaustive molecular analysis of the dysferlin gene led to the identification of 65 different mutations, 38 of which (60%) had not previously been described (Supplementary Table S3 and Figure 3). Thirty-one patients showed homozygous alleles (47.7%), most confirmed by segregation studies. Mutation scanning methods used in our study led to the identification of 19 additional novel non-pathological variants (Supplementary Table S4). The present study confirmed the absence of a mutational hot-spot region as well as the spreading of mutations along the entire gene. We detected 9 (14%) nonsense mutations, 28 (43%) missense mutations, 5 (8%) splicing mutations, 20 (30.5%) frame-shift mutations, 1 (1.5%) non-stop mutation and 2 (3%) large genomic rearrangements (Table 2).

For the novel mutations, their absence was demonstrated in > 1000 control chromosomes from healthy individuals of matched ethnic origin. In all 10 patients with 10–20% of Dysferlin, we always found at least one missense mutation (100%), whereas among 24 patients with 0% Dysferlin a missense mutation was only found in 7 cases (29%).

### Respiratory and cardiac function in Japanese patients with dysferlinopathy [^113dPrxB]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

We retrospectively reviewed respiratory and cardiac function in patients with dysferlinopathy, including 2 autopsy cases with respiratory dysfunction.

Methods

Subjects included 48 patients who underwent respiratory evaluation (n = 47), electrocardiography (n = 46), and echocardiography (n = 23).

Results

Of the 47 patients, 10 had reduced percent forced vital capacity (%FVC), and 4 required non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. %FVC was significantly correlated with disease duration, and mean %FVC was significantly lower in non-ambulatory patients, as well as in those aged ≥ 65 years with normal creatine kinase levels. On electrocardiography, QRS complex duration was prolonged in 19 patients, although no significant association with age, disease duration, or respiratory function was found. Echocardiography indicated no left ventricular dysfunction in any patient. Histopathology of autopsied cases revealed mild cardiomyopathy and moderate diaphragm involvement.

Conclusion

Patients with dysferlinopathy may develop severe respiratory failure and latent cardiac dysfunction. Both respiratory and cardiac function should be monitored diligently.

Symptoms at onset

Proximal lower limb weakness in the LGMD2B phenotype and difficulty in toe walking in MM were present in 100% of patients in those groups. Most patients were characterised by a slowly progressive onset of weakness (86% in LGMD2B and 64% in MM). Three women became symptomatic shortly after pregnancy (two with LGMD2B and one with MM), presenting with a more acute onset of weakness. This is a novel finding as we are not aware of any reported patients in whom a possible 'trigger' might have influenced the initial presentation of the disease (table 2).

Table 2
Description of symptoms at initial presentation of the disease

Clinical onset of the disease was similar within the same family with respect to age of onset and presenting phenotype. We did not observe different phenotypes within one family. However, the number of families studied compared with sporadic cases was small (four familial cases).

Muscle function

A detailed assessment of skeletal muscle function was available in 21 patients (figure 3). Median length of disease duration at assessment was 9 years (range 2.5–42 years). The findings reflect disease progression with an overlap of proximal and distal weakness at the time of assessment corroborating that although the diseases may initially present as distinct phenotypes, they largely overlap in later stages. Plantar flexion, hip adduction and hip extension were the weakest muscle groups tested. Hand muscles were relatively well preserved, and scapular winging and contractures were not common features. Asymmetric muscle involvement/wasting was noted in three MM patients but not in LGMD2B. A highly statistically significant finding was a more pronounced involvement of the lower limbs in comparison with the upper limbs (p = 0.00007) in our patients. Comparison of upper and lower limb muscle groups revealed that power was decreased to 76% (± 4%) in the upper limbs compared with 49% (± 5%) in the lower limbs in our patient cohort enabling relatively preserved muscle function in the arms and hands. Five patients were wheelchair dependent and one patient required intermittent wheelchair use (table 3). Four of these patients initially presented with an LGMD2B and two patients with an MM phenotype.

### Muscle MRI in patients with dysferlinopathy: pattern recognition and implications for clinical trials [^113nKEjU]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Correlation between functional tests and the muscle Mercuri score

The degree of fatty replacement on semiquantitative muscle MRI was correlated with the Brooke scale for the upper limbs, the 6 min walking test (6MWT) for the lower limbs and the NSAA, MMT and timed tests (table 1).

For the scapular muscles, we classified the patients into five groups according to the Brooke scale (the two least able scores were grouped together and indicated by the number 5) and calculated the median value of fat per muscle in every group of patients. The heatmap obtained (online supplementary figure 3) showed that the subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, infraspinatus and supraspinatus were involved in all patients, even if they were in the most functional group (ie, score of 1), while the levator scapulae or rhomboideus were only mildly involved, even in the least able patients (score 4 and 5).

For the lower limbs, we classified patients into groups depending on distance covered in the 6MWT and calculated the median value of fat replacement for each muscle (figure 6). Using this approach, we suggest which muscles would be useful to follow longitudinally with muscle MRI according to the result of the 6MWT. For example, in the case of patients walking 600–700 m, the soleus, gastrocnemius medialis and the peroneus group were already involved, though to a mild degree. In contrast, these four muscles were completely transformed in patients walking 300–400 m and would therefore not be suitable for follow-up once function has decreased to this level. At this point, the graphic shows that the tibialis anterior, vastus intermedius or even the vastus medialis would be more useful for follow-up. In non-ambulant patients, the muscles useful for follow-up included the gracilis, the gluteus medius or the piriformis.

Figure 6
Heatmap showing the progression of the muscle involvement related to the distance covered in the 6MWT. Patients were divided into eight groups depending on the distance covered in the 6MWT for the analysis of the progression of muscle involvement. Muscles (columns) are ordered according to hierarchical clustering with increasing grading of muscle fatty transformation in T1-W imaging from the left to the right. The score of a muscle per group is indicated by the colour of the square. We obtained a pattern of the progression of the disease in muscles of the pelvis, thighs and lower legs related to the functional test 6MWT.

### A novel compound heterozygous dysferlin mutation in miyoshi myopathy siblings responding to dantrolene [^111spsf6]. European Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Miyoshi myopathy (MM) is an autosomal recessive distal muscular dystrophy characterized by mutations of the dysferlin gene. Although several pairs of homozygous/heterozygous mutations have been reported, few effective treatments of MM are available. We had observed the decreased serum creatine kinase (CK) before and after administration of dantrolene in the elder brother and the increased serum CK before and after discontinuance of the drug on suspicion of drug-induced hepatopathy in the younger sister. We report a novel pair of heterozygous mutations in the 3'-splicing site of exon 26 and the translation site of exon 28 of the dysferlin gene in two siblings, and effective treatment of their MM with dantrolene.
