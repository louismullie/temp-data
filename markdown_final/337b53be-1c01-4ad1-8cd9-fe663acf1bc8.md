## Question

mixed hyperlipidemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of mixed hyperlipidemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining mixed hyperlipidemia and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the initial risk assessment and treatment goals. Next, I will outline foundational lifestyle therapy, followed by first-line pharmacotherapy with statins. After that, I need to check when and how to escalate to combination therapy, including statin plus ezetimibe, statin plus fenofibrate, and statin plus omega-3 fatty acids, and I should review the role of niacin carefully. I will then consider PCSK9 inhibitors and other advanced therapies, special populations such as diabetes, CKD, and statin intolerance, and finally synthesize a practical algorithm and monitoring plan with safety checks and a concise conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology so I don't anchor on an imprecise concept. Mixed hyperlipidemia denotes concurrent elevations in triglycerides and LDL-C, often with low HDL-C and an excess of atherogenic particles, including small dense LDL and remnants; familial combined hyperlipidemia is the most common genetic cause, and when triglycerides exceed roughly 300–400 mg/dL, impaired VLDL-to-LDL conversion can paradoxically raise LDL-C as triglycerides fall, which I should keep in mind when interpreting treatment responses [^116Qcsi5].

> Next, I should review risk stratification and treatment targets, but wait, let me verify guideline nuances because ACC/AHA 2013 moved away from LDL-C targets while ESC/EAS retained them. For very high-risk patients, an LDL-C goal less than 55 mg/dL and at least a 50% reduction from baseline are reasonable anchors; for high risk, less than 70 mg/dL and at least a 50% reduction; and for moderate risk, less than 100 mg/dL, with non–HDL-C and ApoB as secondary targets when triglycerides are elevated, which better reflect atherogenic particle burden in mixed dyslipidemia [^116NJinJ] [^11179jnJ] [^112LYAnR].

> I will now examine foundational lifestyle therapy because I need to ensure nonpharmacologic measures are optimized before escalating drugs. Dietary patterns emphasizing reduced saturated fat, refined carbohydrates, and alcohol, with increased soluble fiber and fatty fish, plus at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity and weight loss of 5–10% when overweight, are core; in diabetes, improving glycemic control often meaningfully lowers triglycerides and can obviate the need for additional pharmacotherapy in some cases [^115DtLXC] [^1157txDr].

> Hold on, I should verify first-line pharmacotherapy. Statins remain the cornerstone to lower LDL-C and reduce ASCVD events; atorvastatin and rosuvastatin provide robust LDL-C lowering across doses, with pitavastatin offering noninferior LDL-C efficacy and a favorable interaction profile, so choosing among them should balance potency needs, comorbidities, and drug–drug interactions; I initially thought simvastatin 40 mg would be high intensity, but wait, I should correct that — simvastatin 40 mg is only moderate intensity, and high-intensity regimens are typically atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg, with pitavastatin 4 mg approximating moderate potency [^114aPG1C] [^113mnzmN] [^114mZBAo].

> Next, I should review when to escalate therapy and which combinations to choose, and I need to ensure I prioritize options with outcome data. If LDL-C remains above goal on maximally tolerated statin, adding ezetimibe provides an additional roughly 20–25% LDL-C reduction and is supported by IMPROVE-IT for incremental event reduction; low-intensity statin plus ezetimibe can outperform moderate-intensity statin monotherapy for LDL-C lowering while potentially improving tolerability, which is useful when high-intensity statins are not tolerated [^114qnsoK] [^116ehrQt] [^115EAQgm].

> Let me consider triglyceride-driven residual risk next, and I should double-check the fibrate data. Fenofibrate or fenofibric acid added to a statin improves triglycerides, HDL-C, and non–HDL-C, but large outcome trials have not shown overall cardiovascular benefit, though a subgroup with triglycerides ≥ 204 mg/dL and HDL-C ≤ 34 mg/dL did experience fewer events; importantly, fenofibrate is preferred over gemfibrozil when combined with statins due to a lower myopathy risk, and I should monitor liver enzymes, creatinine, and CK during combination therapy [^115iNd1y] [^114QPd75] [^112fNy9j].

> I should confirm the role of omega-3 fatty acids, especially for severe hypertriglyceridemia. Prescription omega-3s at 2–4 g/day lower triglycerides by about 30–45% and can modestly increase LDL-C, so I need to interpret non–HDL-C rather than LDL-C when assessing response; they are appropriate when triglycerides remain ≥ 200 mg/dL despite lifestyle and statin therapy, and REDUCE-IT supports cardiovascular risk reduction with high-dose EPA, whereas STRENGTH was neutral, so I should individualize based on baseline triglycerides and overall risk [^116NJinJ].

> But wait, what about niacin; I should be cautious not to overstate its role. Although niacin improves HDL-C and lowers triglycerides, contemporary outcome data have not shown cardiovascular benefit when added to statins, and flushing and hepatotoxicity limit adherence; thus, niacin is generally not first-line in the statin era and should be reserved for rare, refractory cases after other options fail or are contraindicated [^112P6BbD].

> Next, I should review PCSK9 inhibitors for patients with persistent LDL-C elevation despite statin plus ezetimibe or for statin intolerance. Evolocumab and alirocumab typically reduce LDL-C by about 60–75% and substantially lower non–HDL-C, ApoB, and Lp(a), with sustained effects over years; ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA specifically enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidemia, supporting their use in this phenotype when goals are unmet [^116oACdb] [^112LYAnR] [^11187jNq].

> I will now examine emerging therapies, and I need to ensure I distinguish mechanistic promise from proven outcomes. Agents targeting ANGPTL3/8 or APOC3 enhance lipoprotein lipase activity and can markedly reduce triglycerides, remnants, LDL-C, and non–HDL-C while raising HDL-C; however, cardiovascular outcome data are pending, so these should be considered investigational or reserved for highly selected, refractory cases in specialized settings [^1174sYvH] [^116m88F5].

> Let me think about special populations, starting with diabetes and metabolic syndrome, because the lipid phenotype often includes high triglycerides, low HDL-C, and normal or mildly elevated LDL-C with increased small dense LDL and remnants. Non–HDL-C is a better risk marker here, and achieving non–HDL-C less than 100–130 mg/dL depending on risk is important; fenofibrate may be considered when triglycerides remain ≥ 200 mg/dL despite statins, particularly if HDL-C is low, and I should screen for secondary causes such as hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, and medications that worsen dyslipidemia [^116NJinJ] [^116dswK5] [^115DtLXC].

> For chronic kidney disease, I should confirm dosing constraints. Fibrates require dose reduction and are generally avoided in advanced CKD due to accumulation and myopathy risk; ezetimibe is safe across CKD stages, and PCSK9 inhibitors are appropriate when LDL-C goals are unmet, with no dose adjustment required for renal impairment [^114QPd75].

> In statin intolerance, I need to ensure I verify true intolerance versus misattributed symptoms. Bempedoic acid provides about 18% LDL-C reduction and is a reasonable oral alternative; PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies are highly effective in statin-intolerant patients, and ongericimab has demonstrated large LDL-C reductions in Chinese statin-intolerant populations, supporting this pathway when available [^114NJGhp] [^1155eWzj] [^111B4uoQ].

> I should double-check safety monitoring and drug–drug interactions before finalizing combinations. For statin–fibrate combinations, I will check baseline liver enzymes, creatinine, and CK, counsel patients on myopathy symptoms, and avoid gemfibrozil with statins; for omega-3s, I will monitor for gastrointestinal effects and bleeding risk if anticoagulated; for PCSK9 inhibitors, injection-site reactions and rare neurocognitive or ophthalmic signals warrant routine follow-up and lipid panels every 3–6 months initially [^112fNy9j] [^116oACdb].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, but I will keep verifying each step against the evidence. Start with lifestyle therapy and treat secondary causes; initiate a statin and titrate to maximally tolerated intensity; if LDL-C remains above goal, add ezetimibe; if triglycerides remain ≥ 200 mg/dL despite statin, add fenofibrate or prescription omega-3s based on risk and tolerance; if LDL-C is still above goal on statin plus ezetimibe, add a PCSK9 inhibitor; reserve niacin for rare refractory cases; and consider emerging LPL pathway therapies in specialized centers for severe hypertriglyceridemia or refractory mixed dyslipidemia [^116Qcsi5] [^114qnsoK] [^114QPd75] [^1174sYvH].

> Finally, I need to ensure the monitoring plan is explicit and aligned with guidelines. Recheck a fasting lipid panel 4–12 weeks after initiation or dose change, then every 3–12 months depending on stability; track adherence and adverse effects at each visit; and adjust therapy iteratively to achieve LDL-C, non–HDL-C, and ApoB goals while balancing tolerability and patient preferences, recognizing that real-world undertreatment remains common and requires proactive follow-through [^113tgunW] [^115BjMEf].

Mixed hyperlipidemia is defined by **concurrent elevations in LDL-C and triglycerides** (≥ 150 mg/dL) [^116Qcsi5], often with low HDL-C, and is commonly linked to metabolic syndrome, diabetes, or familial combined hyperlipidemia [^1119bsBi] [^116Qcsi5]. It confers **high cardiovascular risk** due to atherogenic lipoproteins and small, dense LDL [^115G7ESL] [^116NJinJ]. First-line therapy is **high-intensity statin** to lower LDL-C and non–HDL-C; if targets are not met, add ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor [^116oACdb] [^114qnsoK]. For persistent triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL despite statins, add fenofibrate or omega-3 fatty acids; avoid gemfibrozil with statins due to myopathy risk [^114QPd75] [^114zvnq2]. Lifestyle measures (diet, weight loss, exercise, alcohol limitation) are essential, and therapy is individualized to cardiovascular risk and tolerability [^116Qcsi5] [^113tgunW].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Mixed hyperlipidemia is characterized by **elevated LDL-C and triglycerides** (≥ 150 mg/dL) [^113BVTfR], often with low HDL-C [^1119bsBi]. It is commonly associated with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and familial combined hyperlipidemia [^115DtLXC].

---

## Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology involves **increased hepatic VLDL synthesis** from dietary fats and carbohydrates, especially in insulin resistance [^notfound]; impaired clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins due to reduced lipoprotein lipase activity; and formation of small, dense LDL particles that are highly atherogenic [^114Np4Kb].

---

## Clinical significance and cardiovascular risk

Mixed hyperlipidemia confers **high cardiovascular risk** because of the presence of multiple atherogenic lipoproteins, including LDL, VLDL, and small, dense LDL particles [^114Np4Kb]. It is associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, and peripheral arterial disease [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle modifications are foundational and include a diet low in saturated fats, trans fats, and refined carbohydrates; weight loss to achieve a BMI of 18.5–24.9 kg/m²; at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise; and alcohol limitation to ≤ 1 drink/day for women and ≤ 2 drinks/day for men [^115DtLXC] [^113tgunW].

---

### Pharmacological therapy

#### First-line therapy

High-intensity statins (atorvastatin 40–80 mg, rosuvastatin 20–40 mg) are **first-line** to lower LDL-C and non–HDL-C [^114aPG1C] [^113mnzmN].

---

#### Second-line therapy

If LDL-C or non–HDL-C targets are not achieved, add **ezetimibe** or a **PCSK9 inhibitor** (evolocumab, alirocumab) [^116oACdb] [^114qnsoK].

---

#### Triglyceride-lowering therapy

For persistent triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL despite statins, add **fenofibrate** or **omega-3 fatty acids** (EPA/DHA 2–4 g/day) [^114QPd75] [^114zvnq2]. Avoid **gemfibrozil** with statins due to increased myopathy risk [^114QPd75].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring of **lipid profiles** (every 3–6 months initially, then annually) and liver enzymes, creatine kinase, and renal function is recommended. Adjust therapy based on lipid targets, tolerability, and cardiovascular risk [^116NJinJ].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies include **ANGPTL3/8 inhibitors**, which reduce triglycerides, LDL-C, and non–HDL-C and increase HDL-C, and **RNA-based therapies** targeting apoC3 and ANGPTL3, which show promising triglyceride and LDL-C reductions [^1174sYvH] [^116m88F5].

---

## Special considerations

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Non–HDL-C is a better risk marker than LDL-C; consider fenofibrate or omega-3s for persistent hypertriglyceridemia [^116dswK5].
- **Statin intolerance**: Use ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, or bempedoic acid [^114NJGhp].
- **Severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 500 mg/dL)**: Prioritize triglyceride lowering to prevent pancreatitis [^111NjNRB].

---

Mixed hyperlipidemia is defined by **elevated LDL-C and triglycerides**, conferring high cardiovascular risk. Management centers on lifestyle changes and statin therapy, with escalation to ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, fenofibrate, or omega-3s as needed, tailored to risk and tolerability [^114Np4Kb].

### Treating mixed hyperlipidemia and the atherogenic lipid phenotype for prevention of cardiovascular events [^114GqdEb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Statins reduce cardiovascular events and cardiovascular and total mortality in persons at risk for and with coronary disease, but there remains a significant residual event rate, particularly in those with the atherogenic lipid phenotype that is characterized by a low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and increase in non-HDL cholesterol. Large outcome trials designed to assess the value of combining statins with other agents to target HDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol will not be completed for a few years, but there is ample evidence for the clinician to consider combination therapy. The choices for therapies to supplement statins include niacin, fibrates, and omega-3 fatty acids. We present the argument that after therapeutic lifestyle changes, the first priority should be the maximally tolerated effective dose of a potent statin. Evidence supports the addition of niacin as the second agent. In some situations, high-dose omega-3 fatty acid therapy could be the first agent added to statins. Although fibrate monotherapy alone or in combination with non-statin low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering agents can be effective in mixed hyperlipidemia when statins are not tolerated, the combination of statin+fibrate should be considered second-line therapy until the efficacy and safety are established.

### Treating mixed dyslipidemias: why and how [^113yVCci]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Patients with only mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values but low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and/or high triglyceride levels are at high risk for cardiovascular disease. 3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (also known as statins) have been shown to slow coronary heart disease (CHD) progression, reduce CHD events in patients with low HDL-C levels, and raise HDL-C concentrations in patients with mixed dyslipidemias. Some, but not all trials of fibrates have shown benefit in patients with low HDL-C levels. Combination therapy with a statin plus either a fibrate or niacin is effective in improving the entire lipid profile, but may increase cost and side effects.

### Nonpharmacologic management of mixed dyslipidemia associated with diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome: a review of the evidence [^115DtLXC]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome typically exhibit atherogenic mixed dyslipidemia characterized by low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, and an increase in small, dense low-density lipoprotein particles. Treatment guidelines recognize lifestyle intervention as a first step in the management of dyslipidemia in these patients. The aim of this article is to review evidence to support this approach. To achieve all recommended lipid goals in clinical practice, lifestyle intervention is likely to be adjunctive to pharmacotherapy.

### A review of the current status of the management of mixed dyslipidemia associated with diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome [^1119bsBi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Current treatment guidelines recommend lowering elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with a statin as the primary lipid-modifying intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome. However, even with high-dose statin therapy or the combination of statin plus ezetimibe, many patients remain at substantial risk of a cardiovascular event. Increasingly, there is recognition of the importance of treating all components of the atherogenic dyslipidemic profile associated with both conditions, specifically low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated triglyceride levels, in addition to lowering LDL cholesterol. Both niacin (nicotinic acid) and fibrates are recommended as options for combination with a statin in this setting. Data from ongoing prospective outcomes studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these combinations.

### Lipid therapy utilization rates in a managed-care mixed dyslipidemia population [^115BjMEf]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

National clinical treatment guidelines recommend pharmacologic treatment in addition to therapeutic lifestyle modifications in patients with mixed dyslipidemia and multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD).

Objectives

To evaluate real-world pharmacologic treatment of mixed dyslipidemia patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.

Methods

Commercial health plan members in a large, United States managed-care database with complete lipid panel results (ie, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], total cholesterol [TC], triglycerides [TG]) between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2006 were included. Mixed dyslipidemia was defined as any two nonoptimal lipid parameters (LDL-C, HDL-C, TG) according to National Cholesterol Education Program/Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Subjects were observed for 182 days pre-index to determine CVD risk factors (ie, male aged 45+ years, female 55+ years, CHD history, hypertension, diabetes mellitus). Lipid treatment status 6 months pre- and post-index dates was determined using pharmacy claims for any lipid monotherapy (statin, fibrate, niacin, "other"), or combination therapy (statin + fenofibrate; statin + niacin; statin + other).

Results

Lipid treatment increased post-index for all mixed dyslipidemia groups and by total number of risk factors. The increased LDL-C and low HDL-C group had the lowest treatment rates; the group with low HDL-C and elevated TG had the highest. In the latter group, when treated, primarily statin monotherapy (51%) was used post-index; only 26% received niacin or fibrate therapy targeting HDL-C or TG abnormalities. Across all mixed dyslipidemia patients, > 30% with three to four CVD risk factors were not treated ≥ 6 months post-index.

Conclusions

In real-world clinical practice, pharmacologic treatment rates increased upon assessment of multiple lipid abnormalities and by total risk factors for CHD. However, mixed dyslipidemia remained undertreated with low rates of niacin and fibrate usage.

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: a randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^115rfmgz]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Dyslipidemia is an important and modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. In particular, elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels, are strongly associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular events. According to the meta‐analysis, the lowering of LDL‐C by about 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) with statin regimens safely reduced the major coronary events about a 23%. Consequently, lipid‐lowering therapies are key components in the prevention and treatment of CVD.

Hydroxymethylglutaryl‐coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are widely prescribed for their effectiveness in reducing LDL‐C levels and improving cardiovascular outcomes. Importantly, aggressive LDL‐C lowering has been shown to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques, reduce inflammation, and ultimately prevent clinical events. However, despite the proven efficacy of statins, some patients do not achieve their target LDL‐C levels or experience side effects associated with higher doses. The most common adverse effects of high‐intensity statins include myopathy, an increased risk of hepatotoxicity, and new‐onset diabetes.

### Combination therapy in the management of mixed dyslipidaemia [^113hwVvS]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Whilst statin monotherapy is often sufficient to reach LDL-C goals, treatment may not reach all lipid goals in individuals with mixed dyslipidaemia typically associated with metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes. Double or triple combination therapy, which provides the opportunity to address multiple lipid abnormalities simultaneously, may be required to achieve targets in some patients. Addition of fenofibrate or niacin (nicotinic acid) to statin therapy is likely to be the first option, as recommended by national treatment guidelines; omega-3 fatty acids may also be useful. Careful monitoring is required when adding additional agents given the increased potential for drug interactions and side effects.

---

### Statins as the cornerstone of drug therapy for dyslipidemia: monotherapy and combination therapy options [^111G8mpH]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction with statin treatment remains the cornerstone of lipid-lowering therapy to reduce risk of coronary heart disease. Combination therapy with a statin poses advantages in certain settings and may allow use of lower doses of multiple drugs rather than maximum doses of a single drug. Bile-acid sequestrants or the cholesterol-absorption inhibitor ezetimibe can be added to a statin to achieve greater LDL cholesterol reductions. Niacin or fenofibrate can be added to a statin for treatment of mixed dyslipidemia. Differences in statin efficacy in reducing LDL cholesterol and meeting recommended LDL cholesterol targets as well as differences among these agents in beneficial effects on other lipid parameters can affect whether and how these agents are prescribed in monotherapy and combination therapy.

### Management of mixed dyslipidemia in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease: a role for combination fibrate therapy [^115iNd1y]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the primary focus of the management of dyslipidemia in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease. However, use of a statin alone may be insufficient for the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia, which is characterized by low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated levels of triglycerides, with or without elevated levels of LDL-C.

Objective

This report reviews the evidence for the efficacy and tolerability of different combination treatments for the management of mixed dyslipidemia, as supported by clinical-trial data and recommended by national guidelines.

Methods

Using the terms lipid-modifying therapy, combination therapy, combination statin-fibrate therapy, and mixed dyslipidemia, a search of PubMed was conducted (completed in April 2007, updated to October 2007) to identify English-language publications and pertinent studies of fibrate combination therapy in patients with mixed dyslipidemia, including those with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome.

Results

National guidelines recommend the addition of either niacin (nicotinic acid) or a fibrate to statin therapy in patients with mixed dyslipidemia to achieve better overall lipid control. Fibrates do not have detrimental effects on uric acid levels or glycemic control in patients with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. Based on data from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System indicating that gemfibrozil plus a statin was associated with a 15-fold higher risk of rhabdomyolysis than fenofibrate plus a statin, fenofibrate may be the fi-brate of choice for use in combination with a statin. As reported by the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes study, fenofibrate treatment has also been associated with microvascular benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes, which is consistent with preliminary evidence from the Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study.

Conclusion

The addition of fenofibrate to statin therapy may be a useful strategy for the management of mixed dyslipidemia in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease.

### The rationale for combination therapy [^113U8NeW]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

The use of combination lipid-altering therapy for dyslipidemia is becoming increasingly important for effective management of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). In accordance with the Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, the primary target of therapy is lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Studies have demonstrated the benefit of LDL cholesterol reduction in decreasing CHD event rates and all-cause mortality. However, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol remains a significant predictor of CHD events. In addition, lipid-lowering therapy targeting aberrant lipoprotein subclass and triglyceride levels afford additional benefit for patients with mixed dyslipidemias. Aggressive lipid-altering therapy often requires the use of combination therapy involving statins in conjunction with niacin, fibric-acid derivatives, or bile acid resins or intestinal inhibitors of active cholesterol transport. This article reviews the rationale for the use of combination therapy in the treatment of dyslipidemia, highlighting management strategies.

### Nutrition interventions for adults with dyslipidemia: a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^116Qcsi5]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

Mixed dyslipidemia — defined pattern and triglyceride threshold effects are described: The term denotes concurrent elevations in triglycerides (TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and familial combined hyperlipidemia is the most common type. When the TG concentration exceeds ~300–400 mg/dL, conversion of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) to LDL in circulation is typically impaired; when TG is lowered in such patients, LDL-C commonly rises due to a shift from VLDL-C to LDL-C as VLDL to LDL conversion increases.

### Effectiveness of high doses of simvastatin as monotherapy in mixed hyperlipidemia [^117NQgUR]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Twenty subjects with mixed hyperlipidemia participated in a 3-arm crossover trial to evaluate the effectiveness of high-dose simvastatin as monotherapy. Significant reductions were observed in atherogenic lipids and lipoproteins. The highest dose of simvastatin also resulted in significant increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (21%) with a comparable increase in large, protective high-density lipoprotein particles.

### Fenofibric acid (trilipix) [^1157txDr]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

1.1 Co-administration Therapy with Statins for the Treatment of Mixed Dyslipidemia

Trilipix is indicated as an adjunct to diet in combination with a statin to reduce TG and increase HDL-C in patients with mixed dyslipidemia and CHD or a CHD risk equivalent who are on optimal statin therapy to achieve their LDL-C goal.

CHD risk equivalents comprise:

Other clinical forms of atherosclerotic disease (peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and symptomatic carotid artery disease);
Diabetes;
Multiple risk factors that confer a 10-year risk for CHD > 20%

1.2 Treatment of Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

Trilipix is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce TG in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually obviate the need for pharmacological intervention. Markedly elevated levels of serum triglycerides (e.g. > 2,000 mg/dL) may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis. The effect of Trilipix therapy on reducing this risk has not been adequately studied.

1.3 Treatment of Primary Hyperlipidemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia

Trilipix is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated LDL-C, Total-C, TG, and Apo B, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia.

1.4 Important Limitations of Use

No incremental benefit of Trilipix on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for statin monotherapy has been established. Fenofibrate at a dose equivalent to 135 mg of Trilipix was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in 2 large, randomized controlled trials of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

1.5 General Considerations for Treatment

Laboratory studies should be performed to establish that lipid levels are abnormal before instituting Trilipix therapy.

Every reasonable attempt should be made to control serum lipids with non-drug methods including appropriate diet, exercise, weight loss in obese patients, and control of any medical problems such as diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism that may be contributing to the lipid abnormalities. Medications known to exacerbate hypertriglyceridemia (beta-blockers, thiazides, estrogens) should be discontinued or changed if possible, and excessive alcohol intake should be addressed before triglyceride-lowering drug therapy is considered. If the decision is made to use lipid-altering drugs, the patient should be instructed that this does not reduce the importance of adhering to diet.

Drug therapy is not indicated for patients who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma triglycerides, but who have normal levels of VLDL.

### Effectiveness of combined statin plus omega-3 fatty acid therapy for mixed dyslipidemia [^114zvnq2]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Combination therapy for the treatment of dyslipidemia and reduction of cardiovascular risk has been demonstrated to beneficially modify the lipid profile in multiple randomized clinical trials. As reported in the updated National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol remains the primary treatment target, although the comprehensive management of dyslipidemia in high-risk patients includes the modification of secondary lipid parameters such as triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although statin therapy is the standard intervention for lowering LDL cholesterol, combination therapy has demonstrated added benefits on secondary lipid parameters and enhances statin-mediated reductions in LDL cholesterol. The benefits of modifying these secondary targets on all-cause or cardiovascular event-related mortality are currently under investigation in several clinical trials. Prescription omega-3 fatty acid (Lovaza) is a formulation of 2 highly purified omega-3-acid ethyl esters, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. The recently completed Combination of Prescription Omega-3 With Simvastatin (COMBOS) study confirmed that prescription omega-3 fatty acid administered in combination with simvastatin achieves statistically significant improvements across a range of lipid indicators beyond the LDL primary target, including triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and lipoprotein particle size. In conclusion, several classes of drugs, including omega-3 fatty acids, can be used in combination with statins to achieve more global improvements in lipid profiles.

### Efficacy and safety of statin and fibrate combination therapy in lipid management [^1121QxYx]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

Adequate control of hyperlipidemia is of paramount importance for prevention of vascular events. Statins and fibrates are well established treatments for hyperlipidemia. Combination therapy with a statin and fibrate offers significant therapeutic advantage for the treatment of severe or refractory mixed hyperlipidemia. Although such a combination does increase the risk of myopathy, with an incidence of approximately 0.12%, this small risk of myopathy rarely outweighs the established morbidity and mortality benefits of achieving lipid goals. Nevertheless, a higher incidence of myopathy has been reported with statin monotherapy. Statin+fibrate therapy should be considered if monotherapy or adding other drugs (e.g. cholesterol absorption inhibitors, omega-3 fatty acids or nicotinic acid) did not achieve lipid targets or is impractical.

### Comparison of the lipid-lowering effects of pitavastatin 4 mg versus pravastatin 40 mg in adults with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed (combined) dyslipidemia: a phase IV, prospective, US, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, superiority trial [^111LYbxb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Results from a Phase III, European, non-inferiority trial in elderly (age ≥ 65 years) patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed (combined) dyslipidemia demonstrated significantly greater reductions in LDL-C for pitavastatin versus pravastatin across 3 pair-wise dose comparisons (1 mg vs 10 mg, 2 mg vs 20 mg, and 4 mg vs 40 mg, respectively). The present study investigated whether pitavastatin 4 mg is superior to pravastatin 40 mg in LDL-C reduction in adults (18–80 years old) with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed (combined) dyslipidemia.

Methods

This was a Phase IV, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-control superiority study conducted in the United States. Patients with baseline LDL-C levels of 130 to 220 mg/dL (inclusive) and triglyceride levels ≤ 400 mg/dL after a 6-week washout/dietary stabilization period were randomized to 12 weeks of once-daily treatment with either pitavastatin 4 mg or pravastatin 40 mg.

Findings

A total of 328 subjects (164 per treatment arm) were randomized (mean age, 57.9 years [76% were aged < 65 years]; 49.4% women; mean body mass index, 30.2 kg/m(2)) to treatment. The median percent change in LDL-C from baseline to the week 12 endpoint was -38.1% for pitavastatin 4 mg and -26.4% for pravastatin 40 mg; the difference in median percent change between treatments was -12.5% (P < 0.001). Differences between treatments in median percent reductions from baseline for apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol, and non-HDL-C were also significant in favor of pitavastatin (P < 0.001). Both treatments significantly (P < 0.001) increased HDL-C and decreased triglycerides, but the differences between treatments were not statistically significant. The overall rate of treatment-emergent adverse events was 47.6% (78 of 164) for pitavastatin and 44.5% (73 of 164) for pravastatin. Myalgia was reported by 3 patients (1.8%) in the pitavastatin group and by 4 patients (2.4%) in the pravastatin group. There were no reports of myositis or rhabdomyolysis.

Implications

Pitavastatin 4 mg demonstrated superior LDL-C reductions compared with pravastatin 40 mg after 12 weeks of therapy in adults with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed (combined) dyslipidemia. There were no new safety findings in the trial. Clinical Trials.gov identifier: NCT01256476.

### Mixed dementia: emerging concepts and therapeutic implications [^115NTXAg]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

The prevalence of mixed dementia, defined as the coexistence of Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD), is likely to increase as the population ages.

Objectives

To provide an overview of the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and interaction of AD and VaD in mixed dementia, and to provide a systematic literature review of the current evidence for the pharmacologic therapy of mixed dementia.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched using the keyword dementia. MEDLINE was searched for English-language articles published within the last 10 years using the keywords mixed dementia, the combination of keywords Alzheimer disease, cerebrovascular disorders, and drug therapy, and the combination of keywords vascular dementia and drug therapy.

Evidence Synthesis

Dementia is more likely to be present when vascular and AD lesions coexist, a situation that is especially common with increasing age. The measured benefits in clinical trials for the treatment of mixed dementia are best described as statistically significant differences in cognitive test scores and clinician and caregiver impressions of change. In these studies, the control groups' scores typically decline while the treatment groups improve slightly or decline to a lesser degree over the study period. Nevertheless, even the patients who experience treatment benefits eventually decline. Cholinesterase inhibitor (ChI) therapy for mixed dementia shows modest clinical benefits that are similar to those found for ChI treatment of AD. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist memantine also shows modest clinical benefits for the treatment of moderate to severe AD and mild to moderate VaD, but it has not been studied specifically in mixed dementia. The treatment of cardiovascular risk factors, especially hypertension, may be a more effective way to protect brain function as primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention for mixed dementia.

Conclusions

Currently available medications provide only modest clinical benefits once a patient has developed mixed dementia. Cardiovascular risk factor control, especially for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, as well as other interventions to prevent recurrent stroke, likely represent important strategies for preventing or slowing the progression of mixed dementia. Additional research is needed to define better what individuals and families hope to achieve from dementia treatment and to determine the most appropriate use of medication to achieve these goals.

### Management of cardiovascular risk: the importance of meeting lipid targets [^111wNdmE]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention focus on optimization of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Since the 2004 update of the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines, developments in the field of preventive cardiology have included new guidelines for women and for familial hypercholesterolemia; a risk assessment algorithm incorporating the inflammatory marker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP); and clinical trial data confirming the efficacy of aggressive lipid management. Within secondary prevention in particular, there is a need for more widespread use of intensive statin therapy to achieve low LDL cholesterol levels to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients at high risk for recurrent events. Within primary prevention, individuals with diabetes mellitus, mixed dyslipidemia, or elevated hsCRP also are at increased risk and may warrant treatment with aggressive lipid-modifying therapy. In this article, we provide an update on recent guidelines, risk algorithms, and trials related to the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease.

### Systematic review and network meta-analysis on the efficacy of evolocumab and other therapies for the management of lipid levels in hyperlipidemia [^114qnsoK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Lowering low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels with statins reduces the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 The IMPROVE‐IT trial 7 substantiates that LDL‐C reduction with nonstatin therapy further reduces risk of CVD, although the absolute reduction in cardiovascular events was small because of modest LDL‐C lowering with ezetimibe on top of a statin. 8 There remains, however, a population of high‐risk patients who have elevated LDL‐C despite statin therapy and who have residual risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. 9 As a result, there is an unmet need for new therapies to provide this high‐risk population with incremental LDL‐C reduction beyond that which can be achieved by statins and other oral lipid‐lowering therapies. Moreover, there is evidence that the lower LDL‐C achieved provides further risk reduction. 10, 11

Produced mostly in the liver, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) in plasma binds to hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface and targets them for degradation, thereby decreasing the number of LDL receptors and increasing LDL‐C levels. PCSK9 was identified as a target when people with variants that upregulated or downregulated this protein led to, respectively, greater and lesser risk of cardiovascular events. 6 The PCSK9 inhibitors evolocumab and alirocumab were recently approved for LDL‐C reduction when added to maximally tolerated statin therapy.

To date there are no head‐to‐head studies comparing the LDL‐C–lowering capacity of PCSK9 inhibitors to each other. In the absence of such trials indirect treatment comparisons and network meta‐analyses based on a robust systematic literature review can inform evidence‐based healthcare decision making. 12 Within network meta‐analyses, indirect treatment comparison allows the comparison of 2 therapies that share a common comparator, 13 whereas mixed treatment comparison allows a combination of direct and indirect evidence. 14, 15

### The ACC / AHA 2013 guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults: the good the bad and the uncertain: a comparison with ESC / EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias 2011 [^11179jnJ]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the most important public health problem of our time in both Europe and the rest of the world, accounting for the greatest expenditure in most healthcare budgets. Achieving consistency of clinical care, incorporating new evidence and their synthesis into practical recommendations for clinicians is the task of various guideline committees throughout the world. Any change in a set of guidelines therefore can have far reaching consequences, particularly if they appear to be at variance with the existing guidelines. The present article discusses the recent American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines 2013 on the control of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults. When compared with the ESC/EAS guidelines on lipid modification in 2011, the ACC/AHA guidelines of 2013 differ markedly. Specifically, (i) the scope is limited to randomized trials only, which excludes a significant body of data and promotes essentially a statin centric approach only; (ii) the abolition of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets in favour of specific statin regimens that produce a 30–50% reduction in LDL-C we believe will confuse many physicians and miss the opportunity for medication adherence and patient engagement in self-management; (iii) the absence of target LDL-C levels in very high-risk patients with high absolute risk or residual risk factors will discourage clinicians to consider the addition of lipid modification treatments and individualize patient care; (iv) a reduction in the threshold for treatment in primary prevention will result in a greater number of patients being prescribed statin therapy, which is potentially good in young patients with high life time risk, but will result in a very large number of older patients offered therapy; and (v) the mixed pool risk calculator used to asses CVD risk in the guidelines for primary prevention has not been fully evaluated. This article discusses the potential implications of adopting the ACC/AHA guidelines on patient care in Europe and beyond and concludes with the opinion that the ESC/EAS guidelines from 2011 seem to be the most wide ranging, pragmatic and appropriate choice for European countries.

### Efficacy and safety of ongericimab in Chinese patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia [^111B4uoQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A phase 3 trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ongericimab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, as an add‐on treatment to optimized lipid‐lowering therapy in Chinese patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia.

Methods and Results

A total of 806 patients who were receiving stable and optimized lipid‐lowering therapy but did not achieve their low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) targets were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 2:1:2:1 ratio to receive either ongericimab 150 mg or matching placebo every 2 weeks, or ongericimab 300 mg or matching placebo every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. Efficacy and safety were evaluated in 802 patients who received at least 1 dose of ongericimab or placebo. The primary end point was the percentage change in LDL‐C from baseline to week 24. Our findings demonstrated that the least‐squares mean difference of percentage change in LDL‐C from baseline to week 24 was −67.7% (95% CI, −72.5% to −63.0%; P < 0.0001) in the ongericimab 150 mg every 2 weeks group compared with the placebo every 2 weeks group, and −61.2% (95% CI, −67.1% to −55.2%; P < 0.0001) in the ongericimab 300 mg every 4 weeks group compared with the placebo every 4 weeks group. These reductions were sustained up to week 52. Furthermore, treatment with ongericimab favorably altered other lipid parameters. A similar incidence of adverse events was observed in the ongericimab and placebo groups.

Conclusions

Ongericimab, as an add‐on treatment to optimized lipid‐lowering therapy, significantly reduced LDL‐C and was well‐tolerated in Chinese patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia who did not achieve their LDL‐C targets.

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: a randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^116ehrQt]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

6 Conclusion

The combination of low‐intensity atorvastatin (5 mg) and ezetimibe (10 mg) is significantly more effective in reducing LDL‐C levels than low‐intensity atorvastatin (5 mg), ezetimibe (10 mg), or moderate‐intensity atorvastatin (10 mg) monotherapy in patients with dyslipidemia. The combination therapy also shows good efficacy in improving other lipid levels, including non‐HDL‐C and Apo B levels, and the Apo B/Apo AI ratio, with a rapid onset of the effect observed within the first 4 weeks of treatment. This approach offers a viable alternative for patients who are intolerant to high‐intensity statins or who are unable to use or afford PCSK9 inhibitors.

### Efficacy and safety of the coadministration of ezetimibe / simvastatin with fenofibrate in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia [^115o9Bmt]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Mixed hyperlipidemia is characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), and TG-rich lipoprotein levels.

Methods

In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm trial, eligible patients were 18 to 79 years of age, with mixed hyperlipidemia (LDL-C 130–220 mg/dL, TG 150–500 mg/dL). Patients with type 2 diabetes were limited to those with LDL-C of 100 to 180 mg/dL. Patients (N = 611) were randomized in a 3:3:3:1 ratio to one of 4 treatment arms for 12 weeks: ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20 mg (EZE/SIMVA) + fenofibrate 160 mg (FENO), EZE/SIMVA 10/20 mg, FENO 160 mg, or placebo. The primary objective was to evaluate the LDL-C-lowering efficacy of EZE/SIMVA + FENO versus FENO monotherapy.

Results

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was significantly (P < .05) reduced with EZE/SIMVA + FENO (-45.8%) compared with FENO (-15.7%) or placebo (-3.5%), but not when compared with EZE/SIMVA (-47.1%). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels were significantly increased with EZE/SIMVA + FENO (18.7% and 11.1%, respectively) treatment compared with EZE/SIMVA (9.3% and 6.6%) or placebo (1.1% and 1.6%), but not when compared with FENO (18.2% and 10.8%). Triglyceride, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels were significantly reduced with EZE/SIMVA + FENO (-50.0%, -50.5%, and -44.7%, respectively) versus all other treatments. Treatment with EZE/SIMVA + FENO was generally well tolerated with a safety profile similar to the EZE/SIMVA and FENO therapies.

Conclusions

Coadministration of EZE/SIMVA + FENO effectively improved the overall atherogenic lipid profile of patients with mixed hyperlipidemia. Clinical trial registry number: NCT 00093899 (http://www. ClinicalTrials.gov).

### Assessment of the role of niacin in managing cardiovascular disease outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112P6BbD]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Our systematic review found that most clinical trials conducted over the last 60 years to assess the effectiveness of niacin in cardiovascular prevention settings evaluated changes in surrogate measures, mainly HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglyceride levels. Among trials qualifying for the meta-analysis, niacin was not associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for all patients, with similar results among the subgroup of statin-treated patients. These findings are consistent with quantitative syntheses from previous meta-analyses. By contrast, pooled estimates of the trials performed on the subgroup of patients without concurrent statin therapy indicated an association of niacin with 3 clinical outcomes, often reported as secondary end points: a reduced risk for acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and revascularization procedures.

Prescription extended-release niacin has FDA-approved indications as monotherapy for treating primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. While many trials have been conducted in patients with dyslipidemia, showing favorable changes in lipid profiles, few reported information on cardiovascular outcomes, and even fewer were designed to detect changes in these clinical outcomes. Therefore, evidence that using niacin alone to correct primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia to change the risk of cardiovascular mortality or morbidity is limited.

### Model-based simulation to explore the cost-effectiveness of following practice guidelines for triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol control among patients with diabetes mellitus and mixed dyslipidemia [^113TL5mt]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines recommend maintaining lipid levels within particular targets to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events.

Objective

The objective of this simulation study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of following guideline-recommended care compared with current practice or usual care for patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and mixed dyslipidemia (ie, high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] and triglyceride [TG] levels).

Methods

A simulation model using a US health care payer perspective was designed to predict changes in lipid levels (LDL-C, TG, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol) and long-term CHD risk. Data about patients with DM and uncontrolled TG and/or LDL-C were taken from an electronic medical records database to develop the description of current care (eg, statin, fibrate, or no medication) and cholesterol levels. Patients with uncontrolled lipid levels who were not following guideline recommendations were assumed to be receiving combination treatment (ie, coadministration of statin and fibrate) or monotherapy for the uncontrolled lipids under guideline care. Results from a previous study were used to project incremental benefits of combination treatment compared with monotherapy. CHD events were predicted based on risk equations. A 20-year model of direct costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was created.

Results

Among patients switched to guideline therapy, the model predicted 72% achieved 2 lipid targets and 44% achieved 3 lipid targets in 1 year. Over 20 years, in a modeled sample of 1000 patients, 176 myocardial infarction and angina events would be avoided by following guideline care. Total present value of costs for drug treatment and medical care for CHD events would be $33,626 per patient for guideline treatment versus $25,264 per patient for current care. The discounted QALY gain would be 0.18 per patient for an incremental cost per QALY of $50,315.

Conclusions

The results of this model simulation suggest that for patients with DM and mixed dyslipidemia, following treatment guidelines rather than current practice (including combination therapy rather than monotherapy) would result in more patients achieving lipid targets, fewer CHD events, and more QALYs gained at a reasonable cost (less than $109,000) per QALY.

### Interaction between primary hyperlipidemias and type 2 diabetes: therapeutic implications [^116NJinJ]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic Implications

Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia

Treatment of mixed hyperlipidemia should achieve a significant lowering of LDL-C, non–HDL-C, and apoB. As mentioned above, the coexistence of FCHL and T2D implies the categorization of cases at least as a high risk status (according to the European Atherosclerosis Society). Intermediate-risk patients with diabetes (i.e. young type 2 diabetes cases with a time since diagnosis lower than 10 years, free of chronic complications) should be considered as a high-risk status because of the coexistence of FCHL. Cases with ten or more years of exposure to hyperglycemia or with one or more chronic complications should be considered as a very high-risk status. As guidelines recommend, patients at high risk need to achieve a 50% LDL-C decrement compared to the baseline concentrations and a during therapy LDL-C level < 70 mg/dl. The same recommendation applies for the very high-risk cases, but the on-therapy LDL-C should be below 55 mg/dl. The main first-line therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk should be statins, and if goals are not attained, the addition of a combined therapy with ezetimibe, PCSK9i, bempedoic acid, or inclisiran should be considered. In cases with a non-HDL-C > 220 mg/dl, a statin/ezetimibe combination should be considered as initial therapy. If there is a persistence of TG > 200 mg/dl despite dietary therapy, a fibrate or eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester should be added, although its capability to reduce CVD is controversial.

### Alirocumab vs usual lipid-lowering care as add-on to statin therapy in individuals with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidaemia: the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA randomized trial [^11187jNq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

The ODYSSEY DM‐DYSLIPIDEMIA trial was designed to address these clinical uncertainties and assessed the efficacy and safety of alirocumab vs usual lipid‐lowering care (UC), stratified by an investigator's predefined option for add‐on therapy (fenofibrate, omega‐3 fatty acids, ezetimibe, nicotinic acid or no additional LLT) to maximally tolerated statins among individuals with T2DM at high ASCVD risk who had mixed dyslipidaemia and in whom non‐HDL cholesterol was not adequately controlled (≥ 2.59 mmol/L [≥ 100 mg/dL]). The primary endpoint (not used in previous randomized studies) was the difference in the percentage change from baseline in non‐HDL cholesterol between alirocumab and UC (overall; ie, all options). A prespecified analysis was used to compare the superiority of alirocumab vs fenofibrate (recommended in guidelines for treating individuals with elevated TGs 4, 5).

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: a randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^115ymTH5]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Atorvastatin, a widely used statin, has demonstrated significant LDL‐C lowering effects and a reduction in cardiovascular events across various risk populations. Consequently, combination therapies that integrate supplementary lipid‐lowering agents, such as ezetimibe, are gaining interest. Ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, has shown promise in further reducing LDL‐C levels when added to statin therapy, providing a potential strategy for patients who do not reach their lipid targets with statin monotherapy. These findings support the complementary mechanisms of action and the potential of combining atorvastatin and ezetimibe to achieve effective LDL‐C lowering and improve clinical outcomes, particularly in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. Although guidelines recommend a moderate‐intensity statin that can lower LDL‐C level by 30%–49% for effective primary prevention in patients at low to moderate cardiovascular risk, there are limited studies comparing the effectiveness and safety of low‐intensity atorvastatin and ezetimibe combination therapy to moderate‐intensity statin. In the RACING trial, the combination of a moderate‐intensity statin and ezetimibe was non‐inferior to high‐intensity statin therapy on the risk of CVD in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, it is not known whether a low‐intensity statin plus ezetimibe is an alternative to a moderate‐intensity statin in the general population. Thus, in this study, we aimed to compare the lipid‐lowering effect and safety of a combination therapy of atorvastatin 5 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg (A5E10) with monotherapy regimens (atorvastatin 5 mg [A5], ezetimibe 10 mg [E10], or atorvastatin 10 mg [A10]) in patients with dyslipidemia.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Mixed dyslipidemia: 135 mg once daily (2.2).
Hypertriglyceridemia: 45 to 135 mg once daily (2.3).
Renally impaired patients: 45 mg once daily (2.5).
Maximum dose: 135 mg once daily (2.1).
May be taken without regard to food (2.1).
May be taken at the same time as a statin (2.2).
Co-administration with the maximum dose of a statin has not been evaluated in clinical studies and should be avoided unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks (2.2).

2.1 General Considerations

Patients should be placed on an appropriate lipid-lowering diet before receiving Trilipix as monotherapy or co-administered with a statin [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2, 2.3 and 2.4)], and should continue this diet during treatment. Trilipix delayed release capsules can be taken without regard to meals. Serum lipids should be monitored periodically. The maximum dose is 135 mg once daily.

2.2 Co-administration Therapy with Statins for the Treatment of Mixed Dyslipidemia

Trilipix 135 mg may be co-administered with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) in patients with mixed dyslipidemia. For convenience, the daily dose of Trilipix may be taken at the same time as a statin, according to the dosing recommendations for each medication. Co-administration with the maximum dose of a statin has not been evaluated in clinical studies and should be avoided unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks.

2.3 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

The initial dose of Trilipix is 45 to 135 mg once daily. Dosage should be individualized according to patient response, and should be adjusted if necessary following repeat lipid determinations at 4 to 8 week intervals. The maximum dose is 135 mg once daily.

2.4 Primary Hyperlipidemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia

The dose of Trilipix is 135 mg once daily.

2.5 Impaired Renal Function

Treatment with Trilipix should be initiated at a dose of 45 mg once daily in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and should only be increased after evaluation of the effects on renal function and lipid levels at this dose. The use of Trilipix should be avoided in patients with severely impaired renal function.

2.6 Elderly Patients

Dose selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.5)].

Study with Simvastatin in Patients with ≥ 2 Risk Factors for Coronary Heart Disease (Study 304)

Pitavastatin was compared with simvastatin tablets (referred to as simvastatin) in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, non-inferiority study of 351 adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia with ≥ 2 risk factors for coronary heart disease. After a 6- to 8-week wash-out/dietary lead-in period, patients were randomized to a 12-week treatment with either pitavastatin or simvastatin (Table 8). Non-inferiority of pitavastatin to simvastatin was considered to be demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% CI for the mean treatment difference was greater than -6% for the mean percent change in LDL-C.

Lipid results are shown in Table 8. Pitavastatin 4 mg was non-inferior to simvastatin 40 mg for percent change from baseline to endpoint in LDL-C. The mean treatment difference (95% CI) was 0% (-2%, 3%).

4.1 The Benefits of Low‐Intensity Statin Combination Therapy Over Moderate‐Intensity Statin Therapy

Lowering LDL‐C improves clinical outcomes and statins are recommended as the mainstay of lipid‐lowering therapy. Therefore, recent lipid guidelines recommend LDL‐C reduction based on cardiovascular risk. Clinical guidelines recommend moderate‐intensity statins for primary prevention in adults aged 40–75 years without diabetes and at a moderate cardiovascular risk, or in patients with diabetes and aged 40–75 years. Although the initial lowering of LDL‐C levels with statins is effective, further reductions require disproportionately larger dose increases. This is because statin‐induced reductions in serum cholesterol can lead to increased cholesterol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, which diminishes the efficacy of higher statin doses. Typically, doubling the statin dose from the minimum effective dose yields only an additional 6% reduction in serum LDL‐C concentration. In addition, side effects associated with statins include myopathy, new‐onset diabetes, and an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. The SEARCH trial compared the effects of 80 mg versus 20 mg of simvastatin in patients with a history of myocardial infarction. The trial demonstrated a higher risk of myopathy in high‐dose simvastatin (0.9%) compared to the low‐dose group (0.03%). Similarly, the JUPITER trial, which compared rosuvastatin 20 mg to placebo, reported a higher incidence of new‐onset diabetes in the rosuvastatin (3.0% vs. 2.4%). In another meta‐analysis comparing high‐intensity and moderate‐intensity statins, new‐onset DM occurred 12% more often in the high‐intensity statin group compared with the moderate‐intensity statin group. These findings highlight the dose‐dependent manner in which statin‐associated side effects, which are important because they reduce patient adherence, are associated with clinical outcomes. Our study found that combining a low‐intensity statin atorvastatin 5 mg with ezetimibe resulted in a 47.6% reduction in LDL‐C from baseline, a significantly greater reduction than that achieved with atorvastatin 10 mg monotherapy, which is classified as a moderate‐intensity statin. Moreover, in the A5E10 group, 100% of participants with low‐to‐moderate risk achieved their LDL‐C targets. Consistent with the results of previous studies, these findings suggest that adding ezetimibe to a low‐intensity statin can achieve greater LDL‐C reduction than a moderate‐intensity statin alone, potentially offering a more effective and better‐tolerated treatment option by reducing the side effects commonly associated with high‐intensity statin therapy.

14.1 Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia

CRESTOR reduces Total‑C, LDL‑C, ApoB, nonHDL‑C, and TG, and increases HDL‑C, in adult patients with hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia.

Dose-Ranging Study: In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in patients with hyperlipidemia CRESTOR given as a single daily dose for 6 weeks significantly reduced Total‑C, LDL‑C, nonHDL‑C, and ApoB, across the dose range (Table 6).

Active-Controlled Study: CRESTOR was compared with the HMG‑CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin in a multicenter, open-label, dose-ranging study of 2240 patients with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia. After randomization, patients were treated for 6 weeks with a single daily dose of either CRESTOR, atorvastatin, simvastatin, or pravastatin (Figure 1 and Table 7).

### Atorvaliq [^113M98eq]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary Hyperlipidemia in Adults

Atorvastatin reduces total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG, and increases HDL-C in patients with hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy.

In two multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose-response trials in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG. (Pooled results are provided in Table 8.)

In three multicenter, double-blind trials in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either atorvastatin 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 9).

Table 9 does not contain data comparing the effects of atorvastatin 10 mg and higher doses of lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. The drugs compared in the trials summarized in the table are not necessarily interchangeable.

Hypertriglyceridemia in Adults

The response to atorvastatin in 64 patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia treated across several clinical trials is shown in the table below (Table 10). For the atorvastatin-treated patients, median (min, max) baseline TG level was 565 (267–1502).

### Efficacy and safety of fenofibric acid in combination with atorvastatin and ezetimibe in patients with mixed dyslipidemia [^116QbVZ6]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Statin and ezetimibe combination therapy may be insufficient to improve lipid and nonlipid parameters beyond low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

Methods

In this phase 3, multicenter, double-blind study, a total of 543 patients with triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL and < 400 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) < 40 mg/dL (< 50 mg/dL for women), and LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL were randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with fenofibric acid 135 mg (FA) or placebo, each coadministered with atorvastatin 40 mg + ezetimibe 10 mg (Atorva/Eze).

Results

Both treatment regimens lowered LDL-C by > 50%; however, FA + Atorva/Eze resulted in significantly (P < .001) greater improvements in HDL-C (13.0% vs 4.2%), triglycerides (-57.3% vs -39.7%), non-HDL-C (-55.6% vs -51.0%), and apoprotein B (-49.1% vs -44.7%) compared with Atorva/Eze. Overall, adverse events were similar in the 2 treatment groups. No unexpected muscle, hepatic, or renal safety signals were identified with either treatment combination.

Conclusions

In patients with mixed dyslipidemia, the combination of FA + Atorva/Eze significantly improved lipid and nonlipid parameters compared with Atorva/Eze and was generally well tolerated.

### Safety and efficacy of long-term co-administration of fenofibrate and ezetimibe in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia [^1167n1S8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of co-administered fenofibrate (FENO) and ezetimibe (EZE) in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia.

Background

Both EZE and FENO offer complementary benefits to the lipid profile of patients with mixed hyperlipidemia.

Methods

After completing the 12-week randomized, double-blind base study that compared EZE 10 mg, FENO 160 mg, FENO 160 mg plus EZE 10 mg, and placebo in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, patients continued into a double-blind, 48-week extension phase. Those patients in the FENO plus EZE and FENO groups continued on their respective base study treatment, and patients in the EZE and placebo groups were switched to FENO plus EZE and FENO, respectively.

Results

Of the 587 patients who completed the base study, 576 continued into the extension study (n = 340 in FENO plus EZE and n = 236 in FENO). The FENO plus EZE produced significantly greater reductions in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol compared with FENO (-22% vs. -9%, respectively; p < 0.001). There were also significantly greater improvements in triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol, non-HDL-C, and apolipoprotein B with FENO plus EZE compared with FENO. Changes in apolipoprotein A-I and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were similar between groups. Overall, FENO plus EZE was well tolerated during the extension study. The proportion of patients with consecutive elevations of alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase ≥ 3 times upper limit of normal were similar between the FENO plus EZE (1.2%) and FENO (1.7%) groups. No cases of creatine phosphokinase elevations ≥ 10 times upper limit of normal or myopathy were observed in either group.

Conclusions

Long-term, 48-week co-administration of FENO plus EZE was well tolerated and more efficacious than FENO in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia.

Lipid guidelines comparison — LDL role, on‑treatment targets, and combination therapy are contrasted as follows: KDIGO states "does not consider LDL in treatment decision", while ACC/AHA specifies "If CVD history, do not consider LDL; if LDL ≥ 190, treat; if LDL 70–189, depends on risk", and 2014 ADA notes "LDL not used for treatment initiation, though there are target LDL levels on treatment", whereas AACE advises "As part of risk assessment, recommend that all adults at risk for CAD to reach optimum lipid values". For treatment targets, ACC/AHA indicates "Reasonable to target 50% reduction if LDL ≥ 190, otherwise no"; 2014 ADA specifies "Without CVD, LDL < 100; with CVD, LDL < 70 is an option; can use reduction by 30%–40% as alternative target if on maximum statin", and AACE lists "LDL < 100 with goal < 70 for very high risk, also targets HDL and triglycerides". For combination pharmacologic therapy, AACE allows "Yes if cholesterol markedly elevated and target not achieved with monotherapy, for mixed dyslipidemia, or to use lower doses of ≥ 2 drugs to decrease toxicity risk". LDL levels are reported in mg/dL.

### Alirocumab vs usual lipid-lowering care as add-on to statin therapy in individuals with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidaemia: the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA randomized trial [^116j5arg]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Participating individuals

Eligible individuals were allocated to UC options by the investigator prior to randomization, and were subsequently randomized within each stratum to either alirocumab or UC option in a 2:1 ratio (Figure 1). A total of 413 individuals were randomized to alirocumab (n = 276) or UC (n = 137). The median daily doses of UC treatments are given in Table S1.

Figure 1
Disposition of individuals for the DM‐DYSLIPIDEMIA study. Abbreviations: ALI, alirocumab; FA, fatty acids; ITT, intention‐to‐treat; LLT, lipid‐lowering therapy; Q2W, every 2 weeks. a Thirty‐nine individuals were intended for "no LLT" prior to randomization; however, 37 actually received "no LLT". One individual intended for "no LLT" received fenofibrate and another received ezetimibe. In total, 4 individuals were not included in the ITT analysis (no non‐HDL cholesterol value available within 1 of the analysis windows up to week 24) and 1 individual was not included in the safety analysis (individual did not wish to continue prior to treatment)

Baseline characteristics and lipid variables were generally similar regardless of treatment allocation (Tables 1 and S2). At baseline, 84.0% of individuals in the alirocumab group and 76.6% in the UC group were receiving statin therapy (of these, 46.3% [alirocumab] and 36.2% [UC] were receiving high‐intensity statin). Treatment groups included 34.4% and 34.3% of individuals with a history of ASCVD and 65.6% and 65.7% without ASCVD but with additional CV risk factors in the alirocumab and UC groups, respectively (Table 1).

### Effect of evolocumab or ezetimibe added to moderate-or high-intensity statin therapy on LDL-C lowering in patients with hypercholesterolemia: the LAPLACE-2 randomized clinical trial [^116oACdb]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In phase 2 studies, evolocumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to PCSK9, reduced LDL-C levels in patients receiving statin therapy.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of evolocumab when used in combination with a moderate- vs high-intensity statin.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Phase 3, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and ezetimibe-controlled study conducted between January and December of 2013 in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia at 198 sites in 17 countries.

Interventions

Patients (n = 2067) were randomized to 1 of 24 treatment groups in 2 steps. Patients were initially randomized to a daily, moderate-intensity (atorvastatin [10 mg], simvastatin [40 mg], or rosuvastatin [5 mg]) or high-intensity (atorvastatin [80 mg], rosuvastatin [40 mg]) statin. After a 4-week lipid-stabilization period, patients (n = 1899) were randomized to compare evolocumab (140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 mg monthly) with placebo (every 2 weeks or monthly) or ezetimibe (10 mg or placebo daily; atorvastatin patients only) when added to statin therapies.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Percent change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level at the mean of weeks 10 and 12 and at week 12.

Results

Evolocumab reduced LDL-C levels by 66% (95% CI, 58% to 73%) to 75% (95% CI, 65% to 84%) (every 2 weeks) and by 63% (95% CI, 54% to 71%) to 75% (95% CI, 67% to 83%) (monthly) vs placebo at the mean of weeks 10 and 12 in the moderate- and high-intensity statin-treated groups; the LDL-C reductions at week 12 were comparable. For moderate-intensity statin groups, evolocumab every 2 weeks reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 115 to 124 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 39 to 49 mg/dL; monthly evolocumab reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 123 to 126 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 43 to 48 mg/dL. For high-intensity statin groups, evolocumab every 2 weeks reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 89 to 94 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 35 to 38 mg/dL; monthly evolocumab reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 89 to 94 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 33 to 35 mg/dL. Adverse events were reported in 36%, 40%, and 39% of evolocumab-, ezetimibe-, and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common adverse events in evolocumab-treated patients were back pain, arthralgia, headache, muscle spasms, and pain in extremity (all < 2%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this 12-week trial conducted among patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia, evolocumab added to moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy resulted in additional LDL-C lowering. Further studies are needed to evaluate the longer-term clinical outcomes and safety of this approach for LDL-C lowering.

### Clozapine-induced severe mixed hyperlipidemia: a case report [^111wycoR]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To highlight the association between the use of clozapine and the early development of severe mixed hyperlipidemia, a condition that substantially increases the risk of cardiovascular events and other medical complications.

Method

Clinical information and data from investigations in a single patient were collated and reviewed in light of the literature.

Results

A 47-year-old man with a background history of schizophrenia taking clozapine presented with multiple episodes of severe elevation of serum triglycerides and cholesterol with subsequent development of diabetes mellitus. His metabolic parameters normalized following discontinuation of clozapine.

Conclusion

Lipid and metabolic profiles should be closely monitored in patients receiving clozapine in order to facilitate early detection and intervention to prevent further health complications.

### Targeting the angiopoietin-like protein 3 / 8 complex with a monoclonal antibody in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia: a phase 1 trial [^1174sYvH]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The angiopoietin-like protein 3/8 complex (ANGPTL3/8) inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, primarily in oxidative tissues, and does so more potently than ANGPTL3, making ANPTL3/8 an attractive target for treating dyslipidemia. This study enrolled 48 adults (36 men, 12 women) with mixed hyperlipidemia to assess the primary outcome of safety and the secondary outcomes of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ascending doses of LY3475766, a human monoclonal antibody that specifically blocks ANGPTL3/8-mediated inhibition of LPL activity. Participants received a single dose of LY3475766 or placebo. LY3475766 was well tolerated with no severe adverse events or adverse event-related discontinuations. Compared with placebo, LY3475766 dose-dependently reduced the concentration of triglycerides (-70%), remnant cholesterol (-86%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-32%), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) (-35%) and apolipoprotein B (-29%) while increasing HDL-C (+27%). LY3475766 thus significantly reduced atherogenic lipoprotein levels while increasing HDL-C levels; however, the effects on cardiovascular risk remain to be established.

### Efficacy and safety of ongericimab in Chinese statin-intolerant patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^1155eWzj]. Atherosclerosis (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Several protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have been shown to significantly reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in statin-intolerant patients, but none have been verified in Chinese patients. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ongericimab, a novel PCSK9 monoclonal antibody, in Chinese statin-intolerant patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia.

Methods

This was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study designed to enroll 120 statin-intolerant adult patients. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive ongericimab 150 mg or placebo subcutaneously every 2 weeks for 12 weeks in the double-blind treatment period, followed by 40 weeks of ongericimab treatment during the open-label period. The primary endpoint was a percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to week 12. The key secondary endpoints included percentage change from baseline to week 12 in non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), total cholesterol (TC), and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)].

Results

From February 6, 2023, to September 23, 2024, a total of 139 patients were enrolled. The least-squares (LS) mean difference between ongericimab and placebo groups in LDL-C from baseline to week 12 was -66.2% (95% CI: 74.2%, -58.2%; p < 0.0001), with reductions sustained up to week 52. Ongericimab also significantly reduced levels of non-HDL-C, ApoB, TC, and Lp(a). The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was comparable between the ongericimab and placebo groups.

Conclusion

Ongericimab significantly reduced LDL-C as well as other atherogenic lipid levels and was well tolerated in Chinese statin-intolerant patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia.

During the 52‐week treatment period, stable reductions in LDL‐C from baseline were sustained at ≈67.8% to 72.9% and 51.4% to 56.9% in the ongericimab every 2 weeks and every 4 weeks groups, respectively (Figure 2).

Figure 2
Percentage change in LDL‐C level from baseline to scheduled visits for ongericimab 150 mg every 2 weeks dosing (A) and 300 mg every 4 weeks dosing groups (B).

The percentage changes in LDL‐C level from baseline to scheduled visits were analyzed in the full analysis set using a mixed‐effects model for repeated measures. LDL‐C indicates low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol; and LS, least squares.

At week 24, an LDL‐C reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline was achieved in 81.3% and 63.2% of patients in the ongericimab 150 mg every 2 weeks and 300 mg every 4 weeks groups, respectively, compared with 4.5% and 0.8% in the placebo groups, respectively (Table S2). The percentages of patients at low‐to‐moderate, high, very high, and extremely high cardiovascular risk who achieved LDL‐C targets in the ongericimab 150 mg every 2 weeks group were 100%, 96.4%, 91.8%, and 87.5%, respectively, which were 100%, 80%, 78.2%, and 71.2%, respectively, in the 300 mg every 4 weeks group. Even in patients at extremely high cardiovascular risk, > 70% achieved the LDL‐C target after 24 weeks of treatment with ongericimab.

Primary Hyperlipidemia in Adults

Study with Atorvastatin (Study 301)

Pitavastatin was compared with atorvastatin calcium tablets (referred to as atorvastatin) in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, non-inferiority study of 817 adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia. Patients entered a 6- to 8-week wash-out/dietary lead-in period and then were randomized to a 12-week treatment with either pitavastatin or atorvastatin (Table 5). Non-inferiority of pitavastatin to a given dose of atorvastatin was considered to be demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% CI for the mean treatment difference was greater than -6% for the mean percent change in LDL-C.

Lipid results are shown in Table 5. For the percent change from baseline to endpoint in LDL-C, pitavastatin was non-inferior to atorvastatin for the two pairwise comparisons: pitavastatin 2 mg vs. atorvastatin 10 mg and pitavastatin 4 mg vs. atorvastatin 20 mg. Mean treatment differences (95% CI) were 0% (-3%, 3%) and 1% (-2%, 4%), respectively.

### Atorvastatin calcium tablets (atorvastatin calcium) [^114aPG1C]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

14.2 Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia

Atorvastatin calcium reduces total-C, LDL-C, VLDL-C, apo B, and TG, and increases HDL-C in patients with hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb). Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy.

Atorvastatin calcium is effective in a wide variety of patient populations with hyperlipidemia, with and without hypertriglyceridemia, in men and women, and in the elderly.

In two multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose-response studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin calcium given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG. (Pooled results are provided in Table 9.)

TABLE 9. Dose Response in Patients With Primary Hyperlipidemia (Adjusted Mean % Change From Baseline)a

a Results are pooled from 2 dose-response studies.

In patients with Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb hyperlipoproteinemia pooled from 24 controlled trials, the median (25thand 75thpercentile) percent changes from baseline in HDL-C for atorvastatin calcium 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg were 6.4 (-1.4, 14), 8.7 (0, 17), 7.8 (0, 16), and 5.1 (-2.7, 15), respectively. Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in total-C, LDL-C, TG, total-C/HDL-C, and LDL-C/HDL-C.

1 INTRODUCTION

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1 The reasons are probably multifactorial, but a relevant contributory factor may be the greater prevalence of mixed dyslipidaemia, which is characterized by elevated triglyceride (TG) levels and thus elevated TG‐rich lipoprotein (TRL) and TRL cholesterol levels, as well as low levels of HDL cholesterol. 2 Mixed dyslipidaemia in T2DM might not be detected with measurement of LDL cholesterol levels, as these may remain within a normal range. 3 Non‐HDL cholesterol (calculated by subtracting HDL cholesterol from total cholesterol), accounts for the sum of all atherogenic lipoproteins (LDL cholesterol, intermediate‐density lipoprotein, very‐low‐density lipoprotein [VLDL], VLDL remnants, chylomicron remnants, and lipoprotein a [Lp(a)]) and has been suggested to be a better indicator of cardiovascular (CV) risk than LDL cholesterol among individuals with elevated TG levels, including individuals with dyslipidaemia. 3, 4, 5 Populations with mixed dyslipidaemia also have qualitative changes in LDL particles, with a higher number of smaller, more dense LDL particles; these are believed to be more atherogenic than larger, more buoyant particles. 2

Lipid‐lowering therapy (LLT) with statins increases the clearance of atherogenic lipoproteins and thus reduces plasma cholesterol levels, principally through reductions in LDL cholesterol. 6 This results in a significantly lower risk of ASCVD with the proportional benefit related to the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol. 7 Other therapeutic approaches that further increase clearance of atherogenic lipoproteins include ezetimibe 8 and the inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin‐kexin type 9 (PCSK9), alirocumab 9 and evolocumab. 10 Adding ezetimibe or evolocumab to statin significantly reduces CV events (the CV outcomes study with alirocumab [NCT01663402] is ongoing) 11, 12; however, no previous study has prospectively evaluated PCSK9 inhibition in individuals with diabetes and mixed dyslipidaemia or compared different therapeutic options among individuals with elevated TG levels despite maximally tolerated statin therapy, an important consideration given the "real‐world" clinical uncertainty around potential therapeutic agents which principally reduce either the synthesis of TRL particles (fibrates), lipolysis of TGs (omega‐3 fatty acids), clearance of atherogenic lipoproteins (ezetimibe), or a combination of these mechanisms (nicotinic acid).

### Prevalence of lipid abnormalities in the United States: the national health and nutrition examination survey 2003–2006 [^113BVTfR]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The association between increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and increased risk for cardiovascular events is well established, with treatment focusing on LDL-C lowering. Other lipid abnormalities are also associated with increased cardiovascular risk (eg, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], high triglycerides [TG], and high non-HDL-C). Despite national lipid guidelines, the prevalence of these abnormal lipid parameters alone or in combination (mixed dyslipidemia) is not well recognized.

Objective

We assessed the prevalence of high LDL-C, low HDL-C, high TG, high non-HDL-C, and mixed dyslipidemia by using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to estimate the proportions of U.S. adults not at guideline-recommended lipid goals.

Methods

NHANES 2003–2006 fasting blood serum data were used to categorize adults aged ≥ 20 years by LDL-C (risk stratum-specific), HDL-C (men, < 40 mg/dL; women, < 50 mg/dL), non-HDL-C (in subjects with TG ≥ 200 mg/dL), and TG (≥ 150 mg/dL) target levels with use of the NCEP ATP III definitions based on coronary heart disease (CHD) risk.

Results

An estimated 53% (105.3M) of U.S. adults have lipid abnormalities: 27% (53.5M) have high LDL-C, 23% (46.4M) have low HDL-C, and 30% (58.9M) have high TG. Among patients with serum TG levels ≥ 200 mg/dL, approximately 13% (25.7M) of adults have non-HDL-C levels ≥ 130 mg/dL. Also, 21% (42.0M) of U.S. adults have mixed dyslipidemia (high LDL-C with either low HDL-C and/or high TG), with nearly 6% (11.6M) having all three lipid abnormalities. For LDL-C, an estimated 23M adults with CHD or a CHD risk equivalent and 17M with ≥ 2 risk factors but a Framingham risk ≤ 20% are not at goals of < 100 and < 130 mg/dL, respectively.

Conclusion

Prevalence of dyslipidemia in the United States continues to be high, with the majority of U.S. adults now affected by some form of lipid abnormality. Efforts to promote screening, risk stratification, and initiating appropriate treatment should be intensified.

### Design and rationale of the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA trial: lipid-lowering efficacy and safety of alirocumab in individuals with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidaemia at high cardiovascular risk [^116dEvqP]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is often associated with mixed dyslipidaemia, where non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels may more closely align with cardiovascular risk than low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). We describe the design and rationale of the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA study that assesses the efficacy and safety of alirocumab, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor, versus lipid-lowering usual care in individuals with T2DM and mixed dyslipidaemia at high cardiovascular risk with non-HDL-C inadequately controlled despite maximally tolerated statin therapy. For the first time, atherogenic cholesterol-lowering with a PCSK9 inhibitor will be assessed with non-HDL-C as the primary endpoint with usual care as the comparator.

Methods

DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA is a Phase 3b/4, randomised, open-label, parallel group, multinational study that planned to enrol 420 individuals. Main inclusion criteria were T2DM and mixed dyslipidaemia (non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dl [≥ 2.59 mmol/l], and triglycerides ≥ 150 and < 500 mg/dl [≥ 1.70 and < 5.65 mmol/l]) with documented atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or ≥ 1 additional cardiovascular risk factor. Participants were randomised (2:1) to alirocumab 75 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or lipid-lowering usual care on top of maximally tolerated statin (or no statin if intolerant). If randomised to usual care, investigators were able to add their pre-specified choice of one of the following to the patient's current statin regimen: ezetimibe, fenofibrate, omega-3 fatty acids or nicotinic acid, in accordance with local standard-of-care. Alirocumab-treated individuals with non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dl at week 8 will undergo a blinded dose increase to 150 mg Q2W at week 12. The primary efficacy endpoint is non-HDL-C change from baseline to week 24 with alirocumab versus usual care; other lipid levels (including LDL-C), glycaemia-related measures, safety and tolerability will also be assessed. Alirocumab will be compared to fenofibrate in a secondary analysis.

Results

Recruitment completed with 413 individuals randomised in 14 countries worldwide. Results of this trial are expected in the second quarter of 2017.

Conclusions

ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA will provide information on the efficacy and safety of alirocumab versus lipid-lowering usual care in individuals with T2DM and mixed dyslipidaemia at high cardiovascular risk using non-HDL-C as the primary efficacy endpoint. Trial registration NCT02642159 (registered December 24, 2015).

### Simvastatin [^114ZPRsp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary Hyperlipidemia in Adults

The effects of simvastatin tablets on total-C and LDL-C were assessed in controlled clinical studies in adult patients with heterozygous familial and non-familial forms of hyperlipidemia and in mixed hyperlipidemia. Simvastatin tablets significantly decreased total-C, LDL-C, and TG, and increased HDL-C (see Table 6). Maximal to near maximal response was generally achieved within 4 to 6 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy.

### Efficacy and safety of adding fenofibrate 160 mg in high-risk patients with mixed hyperlipidemia not controlled by pravastatin 40 mg monotherapy [^111ZP1VP]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with mixed hyperlipidemia and at high risk of coronary heart disease may not achieve recommended low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol goals on statin monotherapy. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fenofibrate 160 mg/pravastatin 40 mg fixed-dose combination therapy in high-risk patients not at their LDL cholesterol goal on pravastatin 40 mg. In this 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study, after a run-in on pravastatin 40 mg, 248 patients were randomly assigned to fenofibrate/pravastatin combination therapy or to pravastatin monotherapy. Combination therapy produced significantly greater complementary decreases in non-HDL cholesterol (primary end point) than pravastatin monotherapy (-14.1% vs -6.1%, p = 0.002). Significantly greater improvements were also observed in LDL cholesterol (-11.7% vs -5.9%, p = 0.019), HDL cholesterol (+6.5% vs +2.3%, p = 0.009), triglycerides (-22.6% vs -2.0%, p = 0.006), and apolipoprotein B (-12.6% vs -3.8%, p < 0.0001). Significantly more patients receiving the fenofibrate/pravastatin combination therapy than pravastatin alone achieved the LDL cholesterol (< 100 mg/dl) and non-HDL cholesterol (< 130 mg/dl) goals (p < 0.01). Combination therapy was generally well tolerated with incidences of clinical and laboratory adverse experiences similar between the 2 groups. In conclusion, the fenofibrate 160 mg/pravastatin 40 mg fixed-dose combination therapy significantly improved the global atherogenic lipid profile in high-risk patients with mixed hyperlipidemia not controlled by pravastatin 40 mg monotherapy.

### Fixed-dose combination fenofibrate / pravastatin 160 / 40 mg versus simvastatin 20 mg monotherapy in adults with type 2 diabetes and mixed hyperlipidemia uncontrolled with simvastatin 20 mg: a double-blind, randomized comparative study [^115e9hjh]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mixed hyperlipidemia have an increased cardiovascular risk and may not achieve recommended LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals on statin monotherapy. This study was designed to obtain regulatory approval of a fenofibrate/pravastatin 160/40 mg fixed-dose combination (FDC) capsule.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of this FDC and simvastatin 20 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm study was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes and mixed hyperlipidemia, without cardiovascular disease, and who were not at lipid goals with simvastatin 20 mg monotherapy. After a 6-week run-in period during which patients received simvastatin 20 mg, those with non-HDL-C concentrations ≥ 130 mg/dL or LDL-C concentrations ≥ 100 mg/dL and triglyceride concentrations 150 to 600 mg/dL were enrolled. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive 12-week treatment with fenofibrate/pravastatin 160/40 mg FDC or simvastatin 20 mg once daily, followed by a 12-week open-label tolerability-assessment period during which all patients received the FDC. The primary efficacy outcome was the mean percentage change in non-HDL-C after 12 weeks. Secondary efficacy outcomes included changes in other lipid and lipoprotein parameters, fibrinogen, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Tolerability was assessed based on the prevalence of adverse events and abnormal laboratory data in each treatment group.

Results

A total of 291 patients were randomized to receive fenofibrate/pravastatin (n = 145) or simvastatin (n = 146). The mean (SD) age of the participants was 56.6 (8.9) years, 48.1% were men, and the body mass index was 31.3 (4.6) kg/m(2). The FDC was associated with a significantly greater reduction in non-HDL-C (primary end point) compared with simvastatin monotherapy (-12.9% [1.8] vs -6.8% [1.8]; P = 0.008). Triglyceride (-28.6% [3.7] vs +5.0% [3.6]; P < 0.001), fibrinogen (-11.5% [1.6] vs +0.3% [1.6]; P < 0.001), and HDL-C (+6.3% [1.3] vs +1.8% [1.3]; P = 0.008) concentrations also were significantly improved with the FDC compared with simvastatin monotherapy. The proportions of patients who achieved the LDL-C target (< 100 mg/dL) were not significantly different between the 2 groups. The proportion of patients who achieved the combined end point of non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dL and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL was significantly greater with fenofibrate/pravastatin compared with simvastatin monotherapy (41 [28.5%] vs 26 [17.9%]; P < 0.05). The prevalences of patients who experienced ≥ 1 adverse event were not statistically different between the fenofibrate/pravastatin and simvastatin groups (17.2% vs 15.1%). However, compared with simvastatin monotherapy, the combination treatment was associated with significantly greater increases in alanine aminotransferase (+9.6% vs +1.5%; P = 0.03 between groups), creatinine (+13.7% vs +6.8%; P = 0.002 between groups), and homocysteine (+36.5% vs +1.6%; P < 0.001 between groups) concentrations.

Conclusions

In this selected population of adults with type 2 diabetes, the fenofibrate/pravastatin 160/40 mg FDC was associated with significantly greater changes from baseline in non-HDL-C, triglyceride, and HDL-C concentrations compared with simvastatin 20 mg. Both treatments were well tolerated.

### Niacin (niaspan) [^115GDYDe]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hyperlipidemia. Niacin therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate.

NIASPAN is indicated to reduce elevated TC, LDL-C, Apo B and TG levels, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia.
NIASPAN in combination with simvastatin or lovastatin is indicated for the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia when treatment with NIASPAN, simvastatin, or lovastatin monotherapy is considered inadequate.
In patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hyperlipidemia, niacin is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction.
In patients with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and hyperlipidemia, niacin, in combination with a bile acid binding resin, is indicated to slow progression or promote regression of atherosclerotic disease.
NIASPAN in combination with a bile acid binding resin is indicated to reduce elevated TC and LDL-C levels in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia.
Niacin is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for treatment of adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia who present a risk of pancreatitis and who do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control them.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^116k6MUr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate.

Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets, which contain a cholesterol absorption inhibitor and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), are indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to:

reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, TG, and non-HDL-C, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hyperlipidemia or mixed hyperlipidemia. (1.1)
reduce elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments. (1.2)

Limitations of Use (1.3)

No incremental benefit of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for simvastatin has been established.
Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets have not been studied in Fredrickson Type I, III, IV, and V dyslipidemias.

1.1 Primary Hyperlipidemia

Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets are indicated for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), triglycerides (TG), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hyperlipidemia or mixed hyperlipidemia.

1.2 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)

Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets are indicated for the reduction of elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g. LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable.

1.3 Limitations of Use

No incremental benefit of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for simvastatin has been established.

Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets have not been studied in Fredrickson type I, III, IV, and V dyslipidemias.

### Fenofibrate [^115peega]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Fenofibrate is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha agonist indicated as an adjunct to diet:

To reduce elevated LDL-C, Total-C, TG and Apo B, and to increase HDL-­C in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. (1.1)
For treatment of adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. (1.2)

Limitations of Use: Fenofibrate was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. (5.1)

1.1 Primary Hypercholesterolemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia

Fenofibrate tablets are indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (Total-C), Triglycerides and apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia.

1.2 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

Fenofibrate tablets are also indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for treatment of adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually obviate the need for pharmacologic intervention.

Markedly elevated levels of serum triglycerides (e.g., > 2,000 mg/dL) may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis. The effect of fenofibrate therapy on reducing this risk has not been adequately studied.

1.3 Important Limitations of Use

Fenofibrate at a dose equivalent to 160 mg of fenofibrate tablet was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in a large, randomized controlled trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Efficacy and safety of the coadministration of ezetimibe with fenofibrate in patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia [^111DPaM1]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

To examine the efficacy and safety of coadministered ezetimibe (EZE) with fenofibrate (FENO) in patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia.

Methods and Results

This was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm trial in patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia [LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), 3.4–5.7 mmol/L (2.6–4.7 mmol/L for patients with type 2 diabetes); triglycerides (TG), 2.3–5.7 mmol/L] and no history of coronary heart disease (CHD), CHD-equivalent disease (except for type 2 diabetes), or CHD risk score > 20%. A total of 625 patients was randomized in a 1:3:3:3 ratio to one of four daily treatments for 12 weeks: placebo; EZE 10 mg; FENO 160 mg; FENO 160 mg plus EZE 10 mg (FENO+EZE). The primary endpoint compared the LDL-C lowering efficacy of FENO+EZE vs. FENO alone. LDL-C, non-HDL-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and apolipoprotein B were significantly (P < 0.001) reduced with FENO+EZE when compared with FENO or EZE alone. TG levels were significantly decreased and HDL-C was significantly increased with FENO+EZE and FENO treatments when compared with placebo (P < 0.001). Coadministration therapy reduced LDL-C by 20.4%, non-HDL-C by 30.4%, TG by 44.0%, and increased HDL-C by 19.0%. At baseline, > 70% of all patients exhibited the small, dense LDL pattern B profile. A greater proportion of patients on FENO+EZE and FENO alone treatments shifted from a more atherogenic LDL size pattern to a larger, more buoyant, and less atherogenic LDL size pattern at study endpoint than those on placebo or EZE. All three active therapies were well tolerated.

Conclusion

Coadministration of EZE with FENO provided a complementary efficacy therapy that improves the atherogenic lipid profile of patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia.

### Omega 3 fatty acids induce a marked reduction of apolipoprotein B48 when added to fluvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes and mixed hyperlipidemia: a preliminary report [^117PaEh2]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes is characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, low concentrations of HDL cholesterol, increased small-dense LDL (sdLDL), greater postprandial lipidemia and a considerable increase in vascular risk. It has been clearly established that LDL cholesterol levels should be kept below 100 mg/dL (with an optional goal of < 70 mg/dL) or, if hypertriglyceridemia is present, a non-HDL cholesterol < 130 mg/dL (optional < 100 mg/dL). Together with dietary recommendations and lifestyle changes, statins are the drugs of choice for this goal.

Postprandial lipoprotein particles have been shown to be atherogenic in experimental animal, case-control and histological studies. Indeed, nonfasting triglycerides predict the vascular risk better than fasting measurements. Additionally, postprandial triglycerides are independently associated with carotid and peripheral atheromatosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. Accordingly, it seems reasonable to seek additional control of the triglycerides in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia. We therefore undertook a preliminary evaluation of the effect of the addition of omega 3 fatty acids on the postprandial particles, measured specifically as plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein B48, in diabetic patients with mixed hyperlipidemia receiving treatment with fluvastatin.

### Statin-fibrate combination therapy [^112fNy9j]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Precautionary warnings for severe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis from the coadministration of statins and fibrates have been well publicized. However, a recent cerivastatin labeling change made the combined use with fibric acid derivatives a contraindication. Practical recommendations for clinicians who care for patients with refractory mixed hyperlipidemia are needed.

Objective

To provide recommendations for clinicians in the treatment of refractory mixed hyperlipidemia.

Data Sources

A comprehensive MEDLINE (1966-July 2000) and bibliographic search was performed.

Data Synthesis

Thirty-six published clinical trials and 29 case reports involving combination therapy with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors and fibric acid derivatives regarding the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis or myopathy were reviewed. The literature review demonstrated that combination therapy with a statin and fibrate increases the risk of muscle damage, with an incidence of 0.12%. Risk factors that predispose patients to myopathy caused by combination statin-fibrate therapy include increased age, female gender, renal or liver disease, diabetes, hypothyroidism, debilitated status, surgery, trauma, excessive alcohol intake, and heavy exercise.

Conclusions

Combination therapy with a statin and fibrate offers significant therapeutic advantage for the treatment of severe or refractory mixed hyperlipidemia. Although such a combination does increase the risk of myopathy, with an incidence of approximately 0.12%, this small risk of myopathy rarely outweighs the established morbidity and mortality benefits of achieving lipid goals. Nevertheless, a higher incidence of myopathy has been reported with statin monotherapy. When monotherapy with a statin fails to control mixed hyperlipidemia, combination therapy may be considered. Niacin may be added before a fibrate is considered, as it appears to have less risk of myopathy. Statin-fibrate combination therapy must be undertaken cautiously and only after careful risk-benefit analysis. Patient counseling on the risks and warning signs of myopathy is extremely important.

### Efficacy and safety of ongericimab in Chinese patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia [^111UgXso]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Emerging findings from epidemiological, genetic, and clinical intervention studies have strengthened the causal relationship between LDL‐C and arteriosclerosis. These advancements have led to the development of new lipid‐lowering drugs such as PCSK9 inhibitors that have shown significant efficacy in reducing LDL‐C and cardiovascular risks. As a result, many countries have updated their lipid management guidelines, with stricter LDL‐C control targets, particularly for patients at extremely high risk of ASCVD. In this study, we followed the latest international guidelinesas well as the Chinese expert consensus, and enrolled clearly defined extremely high‐risk patients, accounting for up to 64.3% (516/802 patients). The findings indicated that treatment with ongericimab, at doses of 150 mg every 2 weeks or 300 mg every 4 weeks, both resulted in significant reductions in LDL‐C levels ranging from 60.3% to 76.5% compared with placebo. The observed reduction was sustained for 52 weeks, similar to or numerically higher than the reduction achieved with the approved PCSK9 antibodies (45%–75%). Moreover, ongericimab 150 mg every 2 weeks enabled 87.5% to 91.4% of patients at extremely high risk to achieve the LDL‐C target of < 1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL), and 88.1% to 91.8% of patients at very high risk to achieve the LDL‐C target of < 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). These results were comparable with or slightly higher than the targets achieved with the approved PCSK9 antibodies. While the percentage of patients achieving LDL‐C targets with ongericimab at 300 mg every 4 weeks were slightly lower than those at 150 mg every 2 weeks, this dosing regimen allowed 71.2% to 71.4% of patients at extremely high risk and 78.2% to 84.1% of patients at very high risk to achieve their LDL‐C targets. The advantage of the 300 mg every 4 weeks dosing regimen lies in its ability to improve patients' long‐term compliance without additional cost, thus providing clinicians with more options to develop personalized treatment strategies on the basis of patients' blood lipid and cardiovascular risk levels.

### Atherogenic dyslipidemia in metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes: therapeutic options beyond statins [^11276D3D]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Controlled clinical trials show similar or even greater cardiovascular benefits from statins-based therapy in patient subgroups with diabetes, impaired fasting glucose, and metabolic syndrome, compared with overall study populations. Therefore, statins are the drug of first choice for aggressive lipid lowering actions and reducing risk of coronary artery disease in these patients with combined atherogenic dyslipidemia. However, current therapeutic use of statins as monotherapy is still leaving many patients with mixed atherogenic dyslipidemia at high risk for coronary events and commonly insufficient to achieve all lipid targets recommended by current guidelines. For this reason, other approaches to treatment of combined hyperlipidemia should be considered. Because fibrates, niacin, ezetimibe and statins each regulate serum lipids by different mechanisms, combination therapy may offer particularly desirable benefits in patients with combined hyperlipidemia.

A combination statin/fibrate or statin/niacin therapy may be often necessary to control all lipid abnormalities in patients with metabolic syndrome and diabetes adequately, since fibrates and niacin provide additional important benefits, particularly on triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol levels. Thus, this combined therapy concentrates on all the components of the mixed dyslipidemia that often occurs in persons with diabetes or metabolic syndrome, and may be expected to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Safety concerns about some fibrates such as gemfibrozil may lead to exaggerate precautions regarding fibrate administration and therefore diminish the use of these agents. However, other fibrates (such as bezafibrate and fenofibrate) appear to be safer and better tolerated. In addition, bezafibrate as pan-PPAR-activator has clearly demonstrated beneficial pleiotropic effects related to glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Therefore a proper co-administration of statins with other agents: fibrates, niacin or ezetimibe – selected on basis of their safety and effectiveness, could be more valuable in achieving a comprehensive lipid control as compared with statins monotherapy.

### Rosuvastatin (Crestor) [^111uefgN]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In a post-hoc subgroup analysis of JUPITER subjects (rosuvastatin = 725, placebo = 680) with a hsCRP ≥ 2 mg/L and no other traditional risk factors (smoking, BP ≥ 140/90 or taking antihypertensives, low HDL‑C) other than age, after adjustment for high HDL‑C, there was no significant treatment benefit with CRESTOR treatment.

Figure 2. Major CV Events by Treatment Group in JUPITER

At one year, CRESTOR increased HDL‑C and reduced LDL‑C, hsCRP, total cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels (p < 0.001 for all versus placebo).

Primary Hyperlipidemia in Adults

CRESTOR reduces Total‑C, LDL‑C, ApoB, non‑HDL‑C, and TG, and increases HDL‑C, in adult patients with hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia.

In a multicenter, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled study in patients with hyperlipidemia, CRESTOR given as a single daily dose (5 to 40 mg) for 6 weeks significantly reduced Total‑C, LDL‑C, non‑HDL‑C, and ApoB, across the dose range (Table 10).

CRESTOR was compared with the statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin) in a multicenter, open-label, dose‑ranging study of 2,240 patients with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia. After randomization, patients were treated for 6 weeks with a single daily dose of either CRESTOR, atorvastatin, simvastatin, or pravastatin (see Figure 3 and Table 11).

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^1159PRD8]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Triglyceride (TG) and non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non–HDL–C) management after control of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL–C) is level based. Children with average fasting levels of TG ≥ 500 mg/dL or any single measurement ≥ 1,000 mg/ dL related to a primary hypertriglyceridemia should be treated in conjunction with a lipid specialist; the CHILD-2–TG diet should be started and use of fish oil, fibrate, or niacin to prevent pancreatitis should be considered (Grade D). Children with fasting levels of TG 200 to 499 mg/dL after a trial of lifestyle/diet management with CHILD 1 → CHILD 2–TG should have non–HDL recalculated and be managed to a goal of less than 145 mg/dL (Grade D). For those with TG 200 to 499 mg/dL and non–HDL ≥ 145 mg/dL after CHILD 1 → CHILD 2–TG, including increased fish intake, fish oil supplementation may be considered (Grade D). Children ages 10 years or older with non–HDL–C levels ≥ 145 mg/dL after the LDL–C goal is achieved may be considered for further intensification of statin therapy or additional therapy with a fibrate or niacin, with referral to a lipid specialist (Grade D). Children with severe or complex mixed dyslipidemias, particularly where multiple medications are being considered, should be referred for consultation with a lipid specialist (Grade D).

After completing the 12-week trial, eligible patients were assigned to ezetimibe tablet coadministered with fenofibrate or fenofibrate monotherapy for an additional 48 weeks.

### Fenofibrate (fenoglide) [^11683jjB]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Fenoglide is a peroxisome proliferator receptor alpha (PPARα) activator indicated:

as an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated LDL-C, Total-C, TG, and Apo B, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia when response to diet and non-pharmacological interventions alone has been inadequate. (1.1)
as an adjunct to diet to treat patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually obviate the need for pharmacologic intervention. (1.2)

Fenofibrate was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in a large, randomized controlled trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. (1.3)

1.1 Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia

Fenoglide is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated LDL-C, Total-C, Triglycerides, and Apo B, and to increase HDL-C in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia. Lipid-altering agents should be used in addition to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol when response to diet and nonpharmacological interventions alone has been inadequate.

1.2 Hypertriglyceridemia

Fenoglide is also indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for treatment of adult patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually reduce fasting triglycerides and eliminate chylomicronemia thereby obviating the need for pharmacologic intervention.

1.3 General Guidelines

Fenofibrate was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in a large, randomized controlled trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) .]

Markedly elevated levels of serum triglycerides (e.g. > 2,000 mg/dL) may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis. The effect of Fenoglide therapy on reducing this risk has not been adequately studied.

Drug therapy is not indicated for patients who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma triglycerides, but who have normal levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Inspection of plasma refrigerated for 14 hours is helpful in distinguishing these patients from those with elevated VLDL.2

### Mixed dyslipidemia among patients using lipid-lowering therapy in French general practice: an observational study [^113Q5bXy]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TGs) are associated with an increased incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, limited data are available about the prevalence of dyslipidemias related to LDL-C, HDL-C, and TGs among French patients treated with lipid-lowering agents.

Objective

This paper describes the prevalence of various types of dyslipidemias among patients treated with lipid-lowering agents in French general practice.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional, observational study conducted using retrospective data collection at the time of enrollment. Eligible patients were those treated pharmacologically for dyslipidemia in the Cegedim Strategic Data general practice network. Fasting lipid values and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors were gathered by investigators using an ad hoc questionnaire. European guidelines were used to define various types of dyslipidemias. Polytomous logistic regression was used to assess the associations between different dyslipidemias and diabetes mellitus, a history of CHD, and the number of CV risk factors.

Results

A total of 946 patients had a complete lipid profile and valid data for determining CV risk status. The mean (SD) age of these patients was 64.0 (9.9) years, and 55.7% of the patients were men. At least 1 abnormality in LDL-C, HDL-C, or TGs was present in 791 (83.6%) of the 946 patients. The rates of elevated LDL-C, low HDL-C, and elevated TGs were 73.2%, 16.9%, and 30.3%, respectively (these groups are not mutually exclusive). Among those who did not reach the LDL-C goal, 38.7% had dyslipidemias with low HDL-C, elevated TGs, or both. Compared with having a normal lipid profile, each additional CV risk factor increased the likelihood of the following types of dyslipidemias: low HDL-C and/or elevated TGs, but normal LDL-C (odds ratio [OR], 1.36; 95% CI, 1.03–1.79); elevated LDL-C and TGs, but normal HDL-C (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.24–2.02); and all 3 lipid abnormalities (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.10–2.14). Patients with diabetes had a similarly increased risk of mixed dyslipidemias, whereas patients with a history of CHD did not.

Conclusions

Among these patients treated with lipid-lowering agents, 38.7% had mixed dyslipidemias, including low HDL-C, elevated TGs, both low HDL-C and elevated TGs, or all 3 lipid abnormalities. Patients with a greater number of nonlipid CV risk factors or with diabetes had a significantly increased risk of mixed dyslipidemias involving elevated TGs and/or low HDL-C in addition to elevated LDL-C.

### Efficacy and safety of ongericimab in Chinese patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia [^1142f8NV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The data, methods employed in the analysis, and materials used in the research are available to any researcher upon reasonable request from the corresponding author. This enables them to replicate the procedure or reproduce the results.

Study Design

This was a multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group clinical trial conducted over a period of 52 weeks.

This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at each study site involved in this study before patients' recruitment. In addition, an independent data monitoring committee periodically reviewed the safety data provided by an independent and external biostatistical group.

Study Patients

Briefly, this study enrolled patients aged 18 to 80 years who had been receiving stable and optimized lipid‐lowering therapy for at least 4 weeks before randomization. Optimized lipid‐lowering therapy was defined as moderate‐ or high‐intensity statins in accordance with Chinese guidelines, such as atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg/day and rosuvastatin 5 to 20 mg/day, either alone or in combination with ezetimibe. Eligible patients should have a fasting triglyceride level of ≤ 4.5 mmol/L (400 mg/dL), and a fasting LDL‐C level of at least 1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL), 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL), 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL), and 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) for those at extremely high, very high, high, and low‐to‐moderate cardiovascular risk, respectively. Key exclusion criteria included heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, recent or planned revascularization procedures, uncontrolled hypertension, moderate‐to‐severe renal dysfunction, and active liver disease or hepatic dysfunction. All patients provided written informed consent before participating in the study.

### Omega 3 fatty acids induce a marked reduction of apolipoprotein B48 when added to fluvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes and mixed hyperlipidemia: a preliminary report [^113r2vn5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

The apolipoprotein B48 concentrations only fell significantly after the incorporation of omega 3 fatty acids to the treatment with fluvastatin. As treatment with omega 3 fatty acids in patients with hypercholesterolemia who are receiving statins is accompanied by a reduction in ischemic events and vascular death, even in populations that have a high consumption of fish, we may speculate that the reduction in apolipoprotein B48-containing particles might contribute to this benefit. It is believed that omega 3 fatty acids enhances chylomicron clearence due to a reduction in hepatic VLDL synthesis. Moreover, in experimental models omega 3 fatty acids may also reduce intestinal lipoprotein production, which is increased in patients with insulin-resistance and type 2 diabetes.

In conclusion, these preliminary findings suggest that treatment with 4 g of omega 3 fatty acids added to higher doses of fluvastatin in diabetic patients with mixed hyperlipidemia is accompanied by a significant additional benefit in apolipoprotein B48-containing particles and may thus represent a complementary therapy for the reduction of LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol and B100 to that achieved with statins alone. Nevertheless, due to small sample size, lack of postprandial data and open-label design, large-scale, double-blind, randomized studies are needed to confirm our results.

### Fenofibric acid (Fibricor) [^111NjNRB]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

FIBRICOR is a peroxisome proliferator receptor alpha (PPARα) activator indicated as an adjunct to diet:

to reduce triglyceride (TG) levels in adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL) (1.1).
to reduce elevated total cholesterol (TC), low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), TG and apolipoprotein (Apo) B and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia (1.2).

Important Limitations of Use: Fenofibrate was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (1.3).

1.1	Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

FIBRICOR is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL). Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually obviate the need for pharmacologic intervention.

Markedly elevated levels of serum triglycerides > 2000 mg/dL may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis. The effect of fenofibrate therapy on reducing this risk has not been adequately studied.

1.2	Primary Hypercholesterolemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia

FIBRICOR is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (Total-C), triglycerides (TG), and apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia.

1.3	Important Limitations of Use

Fenofibrate at a dose equivalent to 105 mg of FIBRICOR was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Non-lipid effects of rosuvastatin-fenofibrate combination therapy in high-risk Asian patients with mixed hyperlipidemia [^114nTjGJ]. Atherosclerosis (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study is to compare the non-lipid effects of rosuvastatin-fenofibrate combination therapy with rosuvastatin monotherapy in high-risk Asian patients with mixed hyperlipidemia.

Methods

A total of 236 patients were initially screened. After six weeks of diet and life style changes, 180 of these patients were randomly assigned to receive one of two regimens: rosuvastatin 10 mg plus fenofibrate 160 mg or rosuvastatin 10 mg. The primary outcome variables were the incidences of muscle or liver enzyme elevation. The patients were followed for 24 weeks during drug treatment and for an additional four weeks after drug discontinuation.

Results

The rates of the primary outcome variables were similar between the two groups (2.8% and 3.9% in the combination and the rosuvastatin groups, respectively, p = 1.00). The combination group had more, but not significantly, common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) (13.3% and 5.6%, respectively) and drug discontinuation due to AEs (10.0% and 3.3%, respectively) than the rosouvastatin group. Combination therapy was associated with higher elevations in homocysteine, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine, whereas elevation in alanine aminotransferase was greater in the rosuvastatin group. Leukocyte count and hemoglobin level decreased to a greater extent in the combination group. The combination group showed greater reductions in TG and elevation in HDL-cholesterol.

Conclusion

In our study population, the rosuvastatin-fenofibrate combination resulted in comparable incidences of myo- or hepatotoxicity as rosuvastatin monotherapy. However, this combination may need to be used with caution in individuals with underlying pathologies such as renal dysfunction (NCT01414803).

### Dyslipidemia treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus in a US managed care plan: a retrospective database analysis [^115rUWHc]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

Multiple guidelines writing groups advocate combination therapy for the management of multiple lipid abnormalities (NCEP ATPIII, ADA, AHA/ACC). Statin-fibrate combination therapy has been found to be more successful than statin monotherapy in achieving therapeutic targets in dyslipidemic patients with DM or the metabolic syndrome. The ongoing Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial was designed to evaluate the effect of simvastatin-fenofibrate combination therapy on cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 DM. The effect of statin-niacin combination therapy on atherosclerosis progression in patients with high cardiovascular risk (CHD and low HDL-C levels) has been evaluated in both the Arterial Biology for the Investigation of the Treatment Effects of Reducing Cholesterol 2 (ARBITER 2) and the HDL Atherosclerosis Treatment (HATS) studies. These trials demonstrated that the use of statin-niacin combination therapy is associated with stabilization of atherosclerotic disease.

Despite the abundance of data confirming the role of suboptimal lipoprotein levels as a risk factor for CHD and the availability of guidelines enumerating therapeutic lifestyle modifications and pharmaceutical treatment options for the management of mixed dyslipidemia, a substantial proportion of dyslipidemic patients remain untreated or inappropriately treated, or patients choose to discontinue treatment soon after it is initiated. The primary objective of the present study was to achieve greater understanding of treatment patterns in "real-world" patients by evaluating pharmacologic treatment of DM patients with mixed dyslipidemia enrolled in a commercial health plan. Specifically, the purpose was to determine the proportion of DM patients with suboptimal LDL, HDL-C, and/or TG values not being appropriately treated with lipid-modifying medications.

### Alirocumab vs usual lipid-lowering care as add-on to statin therapy in individuals with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidaemia: the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA randomized trial [^113HWK5t]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Study design

ODYSSEY DM‐DYSLIPIDEMIA (NCT02642159) was a phase IIIb/IV, randomized, open‐label, parallel group, multicentre trial. The trial was conducted at 110 sites in 14 countries; screening started in March 2016 and recruitment was completed in September 2016. The study design and methods have been published previously. 13 Brief methods are summarized below and further details are provided in Appendix S1.

The trial was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles laid down by the 18th World Medical Assembly (Helsinki, 1964) and all applicable amendments laid down by the World Medical Assemblies, and the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines. The trial protocol was approved by the relevant institutional review boards or independent ethics committees, and all participating individuals provided written informed consent.

2.2 Trial participants

The trial included individuals (aged ≥ 18 years) with T2DM and mixed dyslipidaemia whose non‐HDL cholesterol was not adequately controlled despite stable maximally tolerated statin dose for ≥ 4 weeks prior to screening visit, without other LLTs, and who had either a documented history of ASCVD or at least 1 additional CV risk factor. Study participants had to have a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of < 9% (74.9 mmol/mol); changes to antihyperglycaemic medications were to be limited and made only in circumstances of clinical need for the duration of the study.

Mixed dyslipidaemia was defined as non‐HDL cholesterol ≥ 2.59 mmol/L (≥ 100 mg/dL) and TGs ≥ 1.70 mmol/L (150 mg/dL; but < 5.65 mmol/L [500 mg/dL]) at the screening visit. The maximally tolerated dose of statin was based on the judgment of the investigator. Individuals with documented statin intolerance (as judged by the investigator) and therefore not receiving statin therapy could also be enrolled. ASCVD was defined as coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease or ischaemic stroke. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria have been reported previously. 13

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid for prevention of cardiovascular events and diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114NJGhp]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular diseases are among the principal causes of mortality, accounting for about 1 in 3 deaths in the United States. Therefore, preventive interventions from the established risk factors for such diseases are a high priority. Statins are the standard of care for lower cholesterol levels and prevention of cardiovascular events. However, statin intolerance is reported to prevalent from 7 to 29%, with the predominant symptoms being muscle-related side effects. Inability to tolerate statins leads to uncontrolled cholesterol levels and insufficient cardiovascular risk reduction. To reduce cardiovascular risk in these patients, the 2018 multisociety guidelines advocate the addition of non-statin agents.

Bempedoic acid (Esperion Therapeutics Inc, Ann Arbor, MI), as a small molecule inhibitor of ATP-citrate lyase, is an oral, once-daily, first-in-class drug being developed for the treatment of hyperlipidemia by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis. Randomized clinical trials have shown the efficacy of bempedoic acid treatment on lowering low-density lipoprotein–cholesterol. Thus, the drug has been listed in the future perspectives of 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for new approaches to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved bempedoic acid for the treatment of adults who require additional low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol lowering, and European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended approval bempedoic acid to treat adults with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia. However, the benefites of bempedoic acid are limited, because current trials have not proved the potential benefits of bempedoic acid use for prevention of cardiovascular events. The primary criticisms of those trials have been small numbers of events, raising the probability of a type II error. We performed the systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the potential benefit and safety of bempedoic acid use for the prevention of cardiovascular events.

### Autosomal dominant familial dysbetalipoproteinemia: a pathophysiological framework and practical approach to diagnosis and therapy [^113fQxFH]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2016). Low credibility.

Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (FD) is a genetic disorder of lipoprotein metabolism associated with an increased risk for premature cardiovascular disease. In about 10% of the cases, FD is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE). This review article provides a pathophysiological framework for autosomal dominant FD (ADFD) and discusses diagnostic challenges and therapeutic options. The clinical presentation and diagnostic work-up of ADFD are illustrated by two cases: a male with premature coronary artery disease and a p.K164Q mutation in APOE and a female with mixed hyperlipidemia and a p.R154H mutation in APOE. ADFD is characterized by a fasting and postprandial mixed hyperlipidemia due to increased remnants. Remnants are hepatically cleared by the low-density lipoprotein receptor and the heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptor (HSPG-R). Development of FD is associated with secondary factors like insulin resistance that lead to HSPG-R degradation through sulfatase 2 activation. Diagnostic challenges in ADFD are related to the clinical presentation; lipid phenotype; dominant inheritance pattern; genotyping; and possible misdiagnosis as familial hypercholesterolemia. FD patients respond well to lifestyle changes and to combination therapy with statins and fibrates. To conclude, diagnosing ADFD is important to adequately treat patients and their family members. In patients presenting with mixed hyperlipidemia, (autosomal dominant) FD should be considered as part of the diagnostic work up.

### Influence of simvastatin, fenofibrate and / or ezetimibe on correlation of low-density lipoprotein and nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol with apolipoprotein B in mixed dyslipidemic patients [^111XfvRx]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Correlations between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), or nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (Apo B) change after statin therapy has been initiated in hypercholesterolemic patients. This post-hoc analysis studied the correlation between these parameters in patients with mixed dyslipidemia before and after receiving lipid-lowering treatment.

Results

Data from two randomized, double-blind studies of 1112 patients with mixed dyslipidemia receiving treatment (ezetimibe 10 mg, ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20 mg, fenofibrate 160 mg, ezetimibe + fenofibrate 10/160 mg, or ezetimibe/simvastatin + fenofibrate 10/20/160 mg) were pooled. Correlation analyses and simple linear regression analyses were performed at baseline in untreated patients and after 12 weeks of treatment in the whole pooled population, the treatment groups, and after stratification by baseline triglyceride levels (150–250, ≥ 250 mg/dL) within the treatment groups. Both LDL-C and non-HDL-C were closely correlated with levels of Apo B at baseline, and these correlations improved after treatment. When using the fitted simple linear regression equations, we found that the on-treatment LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels corresponding to an Apo B of 90, 80, and 70 mg/dL were lower than proposed LDL-C and non-HDL-C treatment targets. For TG ≥ 250 mg/dL, the corresponding LDL-C was generally lower than that for triglycerides 150–250 mg/dL, except in the cases with fenofibrate in the treatment.

Conclusion

The results of these analyses suggest that achieving goal-specified levels of Apo B in statin-treated patients with mixed dyslipidemia would require more aggressive LDL-C lowering to achieve the greatest reduction in LDL particle number.

### Interaction between primary hyperlipidemias and type 2 diabetes: therapeutic implications [^1117C2bt]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

The FD relationship with T2D has not been fully explored. As mentioned above, the development of T2D may be a precipitating factor for the development of the FD phenotype in those at risk, but if there is a genetic link between them has not been explored. Although in the majority of cohort studies the prevalence of T2D in FD is considered to be higher than what is seen in the general population (8–20% in FD), and the coexistence of both is associated with a higher risk of the development of CVD. This combination is probably underdiagnosed by the assumption that the mixed dyslipidemia in a T2D patient may be due to diet habits and to T2D by itself, and by the fact that dietary intervention in combination with treatment of associated disorders (such as overweight, diabetes mellitus) may normalize plasma lipid levels.

### Effect of evolocumab on non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotein (a): a pooled analysis of phase 2 and phase 3 studies [^112LYAnR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Dyslipidemia guidelines recommend non‐high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (non‐‐C) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) as additional targets of therapy and consider lipoprotein(a) a significant cardiovascular risk marker. The current analysis evaluates the effects of evolocumab on these parameters in various patient populations over time.

Methods and Results

Data from 7690 patients, 4943 of whom received at least 1 dose of evolocumab, in 15 phase 2 and phase 3 studies with a duration ranging from 12 weeks to 5 years were pooled based on study length, patient population, and ezetimibe or placebo comparator groups. Patients could receive intensive statin therapy but not in the statin intolerance and monotherapy studies. The effects of evolocumab on percent change from baseline for non‐‐C, ApoB, and lipoprotein(a) and achievement of treatment goals for non‐‐C and ApoB were examined. Compared with placebo, evolocumab at both approved dosing regimens substantially reduced mean non‐‐C (Q2W dose: −49% to −56%, monthly dose: −48% to −52%), mean ApoB (Q2W dose: −46% to −52%, monthly dose: −40% to −48%), and median lipoprotein(a) (Q2W dose: −22% to −38%, monthly dose: −20% to −33%) at 12 weeks. Effects on all 3 parameters persisted over 5 years. Lipid‐lowering effects were consistent among the patient populations examined (hypercholesterolemia/mixed dyslipidemia, statin intolerance, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus).

Conclusions

In this pooled analysis, evolocumab substantially reduced non‐‐C, ApoB, and lipoprotein(a) compared with placebo. The effect was consistent and maintained in various patient populations over 5 years.

### Pitavastatin in cardiometabolic disease: therapeutic profile [^115yyLg5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Pitavastatin

Pitavastatin is a relatively new member of the statin family. Pitavastatin was first introduced in Japan in 2003 for the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia and has since been licensed for use in 13 countries worldwide, including the United States, Japan, China, Germany and Spain. Pitavastatin has recently been approved for use in 20 additional countries, including the UK, Australia, and France, and is pending approval in a further 12 countries. Compared with other statins, pitavastatin has a unique structure that contributes to a number of pharmacological benefits, including increased systemic bioavailability, a high level of oral absorption and potent effects on LDL-C and HDL-C. This review will discuss the potential benefits for pitavastatin in the treatment of patients with MetS or T2D, focusing on its beneficial effects on the atherogenic lipid triad, its neutral effects on glycemic control and its reduced potential for DDIs.

### Guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia: how can clinicians effectively implement them? [^113tgunW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Guidelines support lowering cholesterol to decrease atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk across the entire lifespan with intensive lifestyle intervention, as well as statin and non-statin pharmacotherapy for those at highest risk. Modest improvements in the initiation, use, and adherence to statin therapy in patients with ASCVD have occurred over the past decades. However, studies continue to document a less than desired implementation of guidelines highlighting a substantial and persistent treatment gap. The success of implementation depends on the consideration of a variety of barriers that exist throughout the healthcare delivery system. Further research is needed to comprehensively evaluate these barriers in order to develop appropriate and sustainable interventions to improve guideline implementation.

### Evaluating the cardiometabolic efficacy and safety of lipoprotein lipase pathway targets in combination with approved lipid-lowering targets: a drug target mendelian randomization study [^116m88F5]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. CVD prevention strategies include the management of hypercholesterolemia, predominantly through low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) lowering medications including statins and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors. Alternative lipid-lowering therapies targeting the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) pathway are emerging as efficacious in the management of hypertriglyceridemia –. A recent phase 3 clinical trial demonstrated that plozasiran, an RNA interference agent targeting apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3), a known inhibitor of LPL, significantly reduced triglyceride levels in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia. Similarly, findings from a phase 2b clinical trial indicated that zodasiran, an RNA interference agent targeting angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3), another LPL inhibitor, also led to a significant reduction in triglyceride levels in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia. Nonetheless, pharmacological activators of LPL are still in the development stages for the prevention of CVD, and our understanding of their efficacy in treating cardiometabolic disease alone or in combination with existing lipid-lowering therapies remains incomplete.

LPL is an enzyme that catalyzes the clearance of atherogenic triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoprotein particles. Currently, genetic evidence supports a potentially causal relationship between enhanced LPL-mediated lipolysis and a reduced risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) –. Specifically, gain-of-function genetic variants in the LPL gene region, and loss-of-function (LoF) variants in the genes encoding its known inhibitors angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) and apolipoprotein CIII (APOC3) are associated with a lower risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) –. More recent studies have also suggested an association between ANGPTL4 LoF variants and a lower risk of T2D, in addition to a more favourable body-weight distribution. In contrast to LDLR-pathway drugs, genetically predicted LPL pathway targeting scaled on apoB levels have heterogeneous associations with CAD, suggesting that the association of the LPL pathway with CAD is not entirely explained by apoB lowering. There is therefore a need to investigate the mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity in biomarkers and potential differential effects.

### Alirocumab vs usual lipid-lowering care as add-on to statin therapy in individuals with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidaemia: the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA randomized trial [^117BVhbd]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Non‐HDL cholesterol was chosen as the primary endpoint in this study after reports that it represents a better risk marker than LDL cholesterol when TG levels are elevated 4; however, we acknowledge that there is no direct strong evidence from randomized trials that additional changes in non‐HDL cholesterol, on top of LDL cholesterol reductions, contribute to further CVD reduction. Moreover, it is difficult to separate reductions in non‐HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, ApoB and LDL particle number, which are highly correlated. There are data from meta‐analyses suggesting that greater reductions in non‐HDL cholesterol and ApoB are related to further reductions in CVD, 28, 29 analogous to well‐established data for LDL cholesterol reduction. 7, 12, 26 The importance of reducing atherogenic particle number has gained further credence with the large genetic analyses by Ference et al 30 demonstrating that, with add‐on therapy, which affects both the quality and content of atherogenic particles, any CV benefit is more accurately predicted by particle number (as depicted by changes in ApoB) rather than by LDL cholesterol. This is supported by findings from the recent REVEAL trial with the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor anacetrapib, in which the observed clinical risk reduction was considerably less than that anticipated by the observed reductions in LDL cholesterol. 31 A meta‐regression analysis of statin and non‐statin therapies by Robinson et al 28 suggested that every 10 mg/dL (0.1 g/L) reduction in ApoB would result in a ~6% proportional reduction in CVD risk. Applying those data to the present population with a starting ApoB level of ~100 mg/dL (1 g/L), alirocumab, fenofibrate, omega‐3 fatty acids and ezetimibe would be expected to achieve an absolute reduction of 33.8 mg/dL (0.3 g/L), 3.8 mg/dL (0.04 g/L), 1.9 mg/dL (0.02 g/L) and 8.8 mg/dL (0.1 g/L), respectively. Extrapolating from the meta‐regression, this would be expected to translate into 20.3%, 2.3%, 1.1% and 5.3% reductions in the risk of CVD. Notably, the estimated 20.3% risk reduction is consistent with the observed results from the FOURIER study, 11 and the estimated 5.3% risk reduction is roughly consistent with the results of the ezetimibe IMPROVE‐IT study. 12 Our data also suggest that, unless there is some benefit of TG‐lowering per se on CVD, as yet unidentified and independent of the modest reductions in ApoB and LDL particle number, the results of the ongoing outcomes trials for fibrates and fish oils (PROMINENT: NCT03071692; STRENGTH: NCT02104817; REDUCE‐IT: NCT01492361) are unlikely to show significant CVD risk reduction. Furthermore, based on these data, there is no rationale for the routine use of fenofibrate as add‐on to statin therapy if the goal of adding it is to reduce non‐HDL cholesterol or ApoB as a means to reduce CV risk.

### Effect of evolocumab on non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotein (a): a pooled analysis of phase 2 and phase 3 studies [^116sxXje]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background Dyslipidemia guidelines recommend non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) as additional targets of therapy and consider lipoprotein(a) a significant cardiovascular risk marker. The current analysis evaluates the effects of evolocumab on these parameters in various patient populations over time. Methods and Results Data from 7690 patients, 4943 of whom received at least 1 dose of evolocumab, in 15 phase 2 and phase 3 studies with a duration ranging from 12 weeks to 5 years were pooled based on study length, patient population, and ezetimibe or placebo comparator groups. Patients could receive intensive statin therapy but not in the statin intolerance and monotherapy studies. The effects of evolocumab on percent change from baseline for non-HDL-C, ApoB, and lipoprotein(a) and achievement of treatment goals for non-HDL-C and ApoB were examined. Compared with placebo, evolocumab at both approved dosing regimens substantially reduced mean non-HDL-C (Q2W dose: -49% to -56%, monthly dose: -48% to -52%), mean ApoB (Q2W dose: -46% to -52%, monthly dose: -40% to -48%), and median lipoprotein(a) (Q2W dose: -22% to -38%, monthly dose: -20% to -33%) at 12 weeks. Effects on all 3 parameters persisted over 5 years. Lipid-lowering effects were consistent among the patient populations examined (hypercholesterolemia/mixed dyslipidemia, statin intolerance, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus). Conclusions In this pooled analysis, evolocumab substantially reduced non-HDL-C, ApoB, and lipoprotein(a) compared with placebo. The effect was consistent and maintained in various patient populations over 5 years.

### (ezetimibe and atorvastatin) (Lypqozet) [^111Caxmk]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate.

LYPQOZET, which contains a cholesterol absorption inhibitor and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to:

reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, TG, and non-HDL-C, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hyperlipidemia or mixed hyperlipidemia. (1.1)
reduce elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments. (1.2)

Limitations of Use

No incremental benefit of LYPQOZET on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for atorvastatin has been established. LYPQOZET has not been studied in Fredrickson Type I, III, IV, and V dyslipidemias. (1.3)

1.1 Primary Hyperlipidemia

LYPQOZET is indicated for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), triglycerides (TG), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hyperlipidemia or mixed hyperlipidemia.

1.2 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)

LYPQOZET is indicated for the reduction of elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g. LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable.

1.3 Limitations of Use

No incremental benefit of LYPQOZET on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for atorvastatin has been established. LYPQOZET has not been studied in Fredrickson type I, III, IV, and V dyslipidemias.

### Effect of atorvastatin and bezafibrate on plasma levels of C-reactive protein in combined (mixed) hyperlipidemia [^111EC8cL]. Atherosclerosis (2002). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a non-specific but sensitive marker of underlying systemic inflammation. High CRP plasma levels correlate with risk for future cardiovascular events. The present study evaluated the effects of atorvastatin (10–40 mg) and bezafibrate (400 mg) on CRP concentrations after 6 and 12 months of treatment in 103 patients with combined (mixed) hyperlipidemia. The number of cardiovascular risk factors present in a given patient was associated with baseline CRP levels. After 6 months and 1 year, atorvastatin treatment was associated with significant (P < 0.001) decreases from baseline of CRP concentrations by 29 and 43%, respectively, while bezafibrate-treated patients showed non-significant reductions of 2.3 and 14.6%, respectively (P = 0.056 and 0.005 for the respective differences between the two treatment arms at 6 months and 1 year). The magnitude of change in CRP after 1 year was directly related to baseline CRP levels. Covariance analysis showed that CRP decreases in the atorvastatin group were unrelated to total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol reductions; however, they were directly related to triglyceride changes (r = 0.28, P = 0.047) and inversely related to HDL cholesterol changes (r = -0.28, P = 0.045). A model including baseline CRP values and treatment effect showed that atorvastatin use was a significant predictor of change in CRP levels over time (beta = 0.82, P = 0.023). These results suggest a potential anti-atherosclerotic additional benefit of atorvastatin in patients at a risk of cardiovascular disease.

### Efficacy and safety after cessation of treatment with the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor anacetrapib (MK-0859) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed hyperlipidemia [^112SXTBx]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

This report describes the lipid and safety data collected during an off-drug period that followed 8 weeks of treatment with the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor, anacetrapib (ANA). A total of 589 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed hyperlipidemia were randomized to placebo, atorvastatin (ATV) 20 mg, and varying doses of ANA, provided as monotherapy or coadministered with ATV 20 mg daily. Patients were treated for 8 weeks, followed by an 8-week follow-up period, during which ANA was switched to placebo. At week 16 (8 weeks after ANA was stopped), persistent reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were evident for the monotherapy groups receiving ANA 150 and 300 mg (-9.3% and -15.3%, respectively), and residual increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were observed for the monotherapy groups receiving ANA 40 mg (18.6%), 150 mg (40.5%), and 300 mg (43.4%). The effects on apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein A-I were consistent with the changes observed for LDL-C and HDL-C, respectively. Corresponding residual changes in LDL-C and HDL-C were also noted in the ATV coadministration groups at the similar doses of ANA compared with ATV 20 mg alone. Residual plasma drug levels accompanied by reductions in cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity were observed at week 16 and may account for the alterations in plasma lipids 8 weeks after cessation of ANA.

### Adult treatment panel II versus adult treatment panel III: what has changed and why? [^112JXmdx]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

The Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel [ATP] III) differs in several ways from the ATP II guidelines. Several principal advances include (1) new risk levels for major lipid measures, (2) increased emphasis on primary prevention, (3) inclusion of high-risk groups in secondary prevention, (4) broader lifestyle program, and (5) increased focus on implementation and adherence. The purpose of this article is to discuss the major changes in ATP III and to highlight the benefits of the new guidelines in the management of hypercholesterolemia in adults.

### Fluvastatin sodium (Lescol XL) [^1164ADc7]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be used in addition to
a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol (see National Cholesterol
Education Program [NCEP] Treatment Guidelines, below).

Lescol®(fluvastatin sodium) and
Lescol®XL (fluvastatin sodium) are indicated to reduce
elevated total cholesterol (Total-C), LDL-C, TG and Apo B levels, and to
increase HDL-C in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed
dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Type IIa and IIb) whose response to dietary
restriction of saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacological
measures has not been adequate.

Lescol and Lescol XL are indicated as an adjunct to diet to
reduce Total-C, LDL-C, and Apo B levels in adolescent boys and girls who are at
least one year post-menarche, 10–16 years of age, with heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia whose response to dietary restriction has not been adequate
and the following findings are present:

LDL-C remains > 190 mg/dL or
LDL-C remains > 160 mg/dL and:
there is a positive family history of premature cardiovascular disease
or
two or more other cardiovascular disease risk factors are
present.

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be considered only after
secondary causes for hyperlipidemia such as poorly controlled diabetes mellitus,
hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, dysproteinemias, obstructive liver disease,
other medication, or alcoholism, have been excluded. Prior to initiation of
fluvastatin sodium, a lipid profile should be performed to measure Total-C,
HDL-C and TG. For patients with TG < 400 mg/dL (< 4.5 mmol/L), LDL-C can be
estimated using the following equation:

### Atherogenic dyslipidemia in metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes: therapeutic options beyond statins [^115G7ESL]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2006). Low credibility.

Lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) is clearly efficacious in the treatment and prevention of coronary artery disease. However, despite increasing use of statins, a significant number of coronary events still occur and many of such events take place in patients presenting with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. More and more attention is being paid now to combined atherogenic dyslipidemia which typically presents in patients with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. This mixed dyslipidemia (or "lipid quartet"): hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, a preponderance of small, dense low-density lipoprotein particles and an accumulation of cholesterol-rich remnant particles (e.g. high levels of apolipoprotein B) — emerged as the greatest "competitor" of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol among lipid risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Most recent extensions of the fibrates trials (BIP - Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention study, HHS - Helsinki Heart Study, VAHIT — Veterans Affairs High-density lipoprotein cholesterol Intervention Trial and FIELD — Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes) give further support to the hypothesis that patients with insulin-resistant syndromes such as diabetes and/or metabolic syndrome might be the ones to derive the most benefit from therapy with fibrates. However, different fibrates may have a somewhat different spectrum of effects. Other lipid-modifying strategies included using of niacin, ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants and cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibition. In addition, bezafibrate as pan-peroxisome proliferator activated receptor activator has clearly demonstrated beneficial pleiotropic effects related to glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Because fibrates, niacin, ezetimibe and statins each regulate serum lipids by different mechanisms, combination therapy — selected on the basis of their safety and effectiveness - may offer particularly desirable benefits in patients with combined hyperlipidemia as compared with statins monotherapy.

### The use of lipid-lowering therapy and effects of antihyperglycaemic therapy on lipids in subjects with type 2 diabetes with or without cardiovascular disease: a pooled analysis of data from eleven randomized trials with insulin glargine 100 U / mL [^116dswK5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetes is commonly associated with a phenotype of mixed dyslipidaemia. This is characterized by low HDL-C and high triglyceride levels, with often normal or modestly elevated LDL-C levels. However, normal LDL-C levels in diabetes may be misleading, as there is generally an increase in the number of small, dense atherogenic LDL and cholesterol-enriched remnant particles. Therefore, in patients with diabetes, non-HDL cholesterol may be a stronger predictor of CVD than LDL cholesterol or triglycerides, as levels correlate highly with atherogenic lipoproteins.

Until recently, the majority of guidelines for cholesterol treatment and CVD prevention have focused on targets for lipids, broadly set at: < 100 mg/dL for LDL-C; < 150 mg/dL for triglycerides; and > 50 mg/dL for HDL-C. However, as in the majority of branches of medicine, up-to-date guidelines focus on a personalized approach rather than a blanket recommendation for all patients. Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend the use of a risk-assessment algorithm to calculate 10-year risk of CVD. The cholesterol-treatment guideline recommends an algorithm which takes into account a range of factors when deciding on the need for lipid-lowering therapy. These include age, race, smoking presence of CVD or history of major cardiovascular events and diabetes status, blood pressure, LDL and cholesterol levels. Current recommendations for the general population suggest that statins should be introduced if the 10-year risk of CVD is greater than 7.5%. For patients with diabetes, statin use is recommended for all patients between the ages of 40 and 75 years and with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL. High intensity statin use is recommended for patients with diabetes and 10-year risk of CVD above 7.5% or with CVD. Reflecting this, recent outcome studies investigating intensified glucose control require control of major risk factors (e.g. lipids, blood pressure) as a precondition. However, despite detailed guidelines, data indicate that the majority of patients at high risk of CVD, including those with diabetes, are failing to attain lipid-goals.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^114QPd75]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Fibrate drugs — gemfibrozil has been shown to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events as monotherapy in primary prevention high risk males with elevated non-HDL-C and for secondary prevention in males with below average HDL-C; the class can reduce TG and non-HDL-C in mixed dyslipidemia and is considered a first-line choice for severe hypertriglyceridemia (TG ≥ 500 mg/dL). In the ACCORD Lipid trial of fenofibrate added to a statin, no benefit was demonstrated in the full study sample compared to statin monotherapy in type 2 diabetes, but a predefined subgroup with TG in the top tertile (≥ 204 mg/dL) and HDL-C in the bottom tertile (≤ 34 mg/dL) had a significantly lower ASCVD event rate with fenofibrate compared to placebo (−29%). Gemfibrozil should not be used with statins because of a drug–drug interaction that increases the risk for myositis; fenofibrate and fenofibric acid have not been found to have this adverse event when combined with statins. Fenofibrate has been shown to reduce the progression of diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy and has not been associated with incident diabetes. Fibrates should not be used in patients with stage 3B CKD or worse, and based on limited outcomes data, consideration of fenofibrate or fenofibric acid as statin combination therapy is in type 2 diabetes patients with a non-HDL-C at goal who also have retinopathy and/or microalbuminuria and who do not have stage 3B or worse CKD.

### The clinical importance of recognizing capecitabine-induced hypertriglyceridemia: a case report and review of the literature [^11338wT6]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2018). Low credibility.

This case report describes a patient who developed a mixed hyperlipidemia and severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 20 mmol/L or 1772 mg/dL) while receiving capecitabine chemotherapy. After lipid-lowering treatment (statin and omega-3 acid ethyl esters) and completion of chemotherapy, her lipid levels had been significantly reduced. Other secondary causes of hyperlipidemia were also investigated. In view of the abnormal lipid results worsened by capecitabine, we suggest that careful lipid monitoring and thorough lipid management are important in such patients to avoid acute pancreatitis.

### Omega 3 fatty acids induce a marked reduction of apolipoprotein B48 when added to fluvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes and mixed hyperlipidemia: a preliminary report [^11752wdB]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

Omega 3 fatty acids have long been used in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia, as they reduce the hepatic production of VLDL, favor fatty acid oxidation and enhance VLDL clearance. They have also been shown to reduce levels of chylomicrons and their remnants, as well as the amount of apolipoprotein B48. The reduction in the concentrations of triglycerides and VLDL triglycerides and the increase in HDL cholesterol noted in this study are thus in agreement with the literature mentioned. Concerning LDL cholesterol, treatment with omega 3 fatty acids in patients with hypertriglyceridemia or mixed hyperlipidemia is usually followed by a slight rise in LDL cholesterol. Although in our study, LDL cholesterol rose slightly, but not significantly after the omega 3 treatment, the marked reduction in the triglyceride/HDL cholesterol ratio noted suggests the transformation of sdLDL to larger particles.

Evidence exists for the beneficial effect on non-HDL cholesterol of the addition of omega 3 fatty acids to the treatment in persons with residual hypertriglyceridemia despite the use of statins. However, their benefit on the intestinal atherogenic lipoprotein particles has not been assessed.

The quantification of apolipoprotein B48 by ELISA is a simple way to measure postprandial metabolism, without the need for ultracentrifugation, sample delipidation and gradient electrophoresis, a very costly process. Apolipoprotein B48 is specific for the intestinal lipoproteins and its fasting levels correlate very well with the area under the curve after a fatty meal. Its levels are raised in persons with type 2 diabetes, especially when they also have renal failure.

The effects of fluvastatin on the concentration of apolipoprotein B48 has not been reported. Nevertheless, atorvastatin is able to reduce apolipoprotein B48 concentrations by increasing the catabolism of chylomicrons and their remnants. This study supports the hypothesis that levels of B48-containing atherogenic lipoproteins may be further reduced by omega 3 fatty acids, even when added to the traditional statin therapy; in fact, the reduction in the B48 was over two-fold greater with the omega 3 fatty acids than with 80 mg of fluvastatin alone (Figure 1). Because we just evaluated the patients over eight weeks, the reduction in the levels of apolipoprotein B48 might be even more pronounced over time.

### EZETIMIBE… [^116QNhhR]. FDA (DailyMed) (2022). Medium credibility.

Therapy with HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Ezetimibe Tablets, administered in combination with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for the reduction of elevated total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia. Combination Therapy with Fenofibrate Ezetimibe Tablets, administered in combination with fenofibrate, is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for the reduction of elevated total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C in adult patients with mixed hyperlipidemia.

1. 2 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia. The combination of Ezetimibe Tablets and atorvastatin or simvastatin is indicated for the reduction of elevated total-C and LDL-C levels in patients with HoFH, as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments or if such treatments are unavailable.
2. 3 Homozygous Sitosterolemia.

This clinical study involving 625 patients with mixed dyslipidemia treated for up to 12 weeks and 576 patients treated for up to an additional 48 weeks evaluated co-administration of Ezetimibe Tablets and fenofibrate. Ezetimibe Tablets reduces total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, non-HDL-C, and TG, and increases HDL-C in patients with hyperlipidemia. Administration of Ezetimibe Tablets with a statin is effective in improving serum total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, non-HDL-C, TG, and HDL-C beyond either treatment alone. Administration of Ezetimibe Tablets with fenofibrate is effective in improving serum total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia as compared to either treatment alone. The effects of ezetimibe given either alone or in addition to a statin or fenofibrate on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have not been established.
