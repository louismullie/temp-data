## Question

Gastrointestinal prophylaxis in the intensive care unit + management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about gastrointestinal prophylaxis in the ICU and its management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical problem and why prophylaxis matters. Then, I should verify which ICU patients actually benefit from prophylaxis and which do not. Next, I will compare pharmacologic options and their trade-offs. After that, I need to check dosing, route, and duration. I will then examine special populations, including enteral nutrition, neurocritical care, renal replacement therapy, and cirrhosis. Finally, I should review implementation, de-implementation, and monitoring, and synthesize a practical decision algorithm with explicit risk–benefit framing [^111VJjht] [^115363hF].

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and its significance. Stress-related mucosal disease with clinically important upper GI bleeding occurs in roughly 1–4% of critically ill patients, but the mortality associated with such bleeding remains high, historically approaching 40–50%, which justifies targeted prophylaxis in those at meaningful risk while avoiding overtreatment in low-risk patients [^114mL3uX] [^1174HvBt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal prophylaxis. I need to check who actually benefits. Contemporary guidelines converge on a risk-stratified approach: patients with coagulopathy, shock, or chronic liver disease have substantially higher absolute risks of clinically important bleeding and are the core high-risk group for whom prophylaxis is recommended; mechanical ventilation alone is not a firm indication, and enteral nutrition likely reduces bleeding risk, which tempers the need for pharmacologic prophylaxis in some patients [^111Z42Cw] [^115mrw1w] [^111VJjht].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit in high-risk patients. Network meta-analyses and the SUP-ICU randomized trial show that PPIs reduce clinically important GI bleeding by about 40–50% relative to placebo, translating to an absolute risk reduction near 2–3% in higher-risk cohorts; importantly, mortality was not improved in SUP-ICU, underscoring that the benefit is bleeding prevention, not survival, and that decisions should weigh pneumonia and other harms [^116EkMcG] [^116PmuvY] [^11541YsS].

> I should double-check the comparative effectiveness of agents. Multiple meta-analyses suggest PPIs are more effective than H2RAs for preventing clinically important bleeding, with relative risk reductions around 30–50% favoring PPIs; however, some analyses signal a possible increase in pneumonia with PPIs, whereas others are neutral, so the certainty is low and the balance remains close in many patients [^115bMt7C] [^1138AVqY] [^1174HvBt].

> But wait, what about sucralfate. The BMJ Rapid Recommendation advises against sucralfate for prophylaxis, largely due to inferior bleeding prevention and lack of modern supportive data, so I should avoid relying on sucralfate for SUP in critically ill adults [^111VJjht].

> Let me consider dosing and route pragmatically. Guidelines suggest using low-dose regimens, commonly pantoprazole 40 mg IV daily, and allow either IV or enteral administration when feasible; there is no strong evidence favoring one route over another, so availability, absorption concerns, and enteral access can guide the choice, with IV reasonable when enteral delivery is unreliable [^111q3ix5] [^116EkMcG] [^115oodGG].

> Next, I should review duration and discontinuation. I need to ensure prophylaxis is stopped when risk factors resolve or before ICU transfer to prevent inappropriate continuation; observational data link unnecessary PPI continuation after critical illness to higher rehospitalization and lower long-term survival, reinforcing the need for explicit deprescribing at discharge or earlier if risk abates [^114BzetW] [^113Xr8yo] [^112FUnqZ].

> Now, enteral nutrition complicates the calculus. Let me verify the evidence. In enterally fed, low-risk ICU patients, pharmacologic prophylaxis may confer no bleeding benefit and could increase hospital-acquired pneumonia; therefore, guidelines suggest avoiding SUP in enterally fed, low-risk patients, while acknowledging that patients with additional risk factors may still warrant prophylaxis despite EN [^112Mwxn5] [^112up3kH] [^113vNe94].

> I will now examine neurocritical care. Neurocritical care patients were historically considered high risk, but high-quality ICU-wide data now anchor risk stratification; current guidance suggests using standard risk-based criteria rather than neuro status alone, and if prophylaxis is indicated, either PPIs or H2RAs are acceptable, with attention to drug–drug interactions and CNS effects that can complicate H2RA use in this population [^114oU8go] [^116dpGEu].

> Let me check renal replacement therapy as a subgroup. In SUP-ICU, patients on RRT had a high background incidence of clinically important bleeding, but pantoprazole did not significantly reduce bleeding versus placebo in that subgroup, so I should avoid assuming added benefit solely due to RRT and instead apply standard risk-based indications [^115SLJBd].

> For cirrhosis, I should confirm that the baseline risk is higher and thus prophylaxis is reasonable when other risk factors are present; in addition, patients with variceal bleeding require antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce infections and rebleeding, which is a separate but related issue that should not be conflated with stress ulcer prophylaxis [^115mrw1w] [^113RQCbd].

> Next, I should review implementation and stewardship. Real-world audits show frequent overuse of SUP without clear indications, and pharmacist-led interventions can safely reduce inappropriate PPI use without increasing bleeding; embedding automatic stop orders, daily indication reviews, and transfer checklists improves alignment with guidelines and reduces low-value care [^114TDH3B] [^115itauH] [^114mSNnM].

> Hold on, I should verify the pneumonia signal and its implications. While some network meta-analyses suggest a modest increase in pneumonia with PPIs, large pragmatic trials and infection-prevention guidelines have not confirmed a consistent, clinically important increase, so the harm signal is uncertain; nonetheless, I should individualize decisions in patients with high pneumonia risk or marginal bleeding risk, and avoid unnecessary acid suppression in low-risk, enterally fed patients [^111z2Jqn] [^115ebwzf] [^1174HvBt].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway. Identify high-risk features: coagulopathy, shock, or chronic liver disease; if present, offer SUP with a low-dose PPI or H2RA and plan for discontinuation when risk resolves. If no high-risk features are present, avoid SUP, especially if the patient is receiving enteral nutrition; if the patient is already on a PPI/H2RA without indication, review and stop it. Throughout, reassess daily and stop before ICU transfer to prevent inappropriate continuation [^111Z42Cw] [^112Mwxn5] [^114BzetW].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line. The net benefit of SUP is favorable in high-risk ICU patients, where bleeding reduction is meaningful, but is unfavorable or neutral in low-risk patients, particularly those who are enterally fed; PPIs are preferred over H2RAs for bleeding prevention, though the absolute mortality benefit is unproven and the pneumonia signal remains uncertain, so shared decision-making and vigilant deprescribing are essential to safe practice [^111VJjht] [^116EkMcG] [^116PmuvY].

---

GI prophylaxis in the ICU is indicated for patients at **high risk** of stress-related upper GI bleeding, including those with coagulopathy, mechanical ventilation > 48 hours, shock, or chronic liver disease [^111Z42Cw] [^115mrw1w]. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are **first-line** [^111VJjht] due to superior efficacy in preventing clinically important bleeding [^116PmuvY], while histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) are acceptable alternatives [^114oU8go]. Sucralfate is not recommended because of inferior efficacy and potential harm [^111VJjht]. Prophylaxis should be discontinued promptly when risk factors resolve or the patient is transferred out of the ICU to avoid unnecessary complications and costs [^114BzetW] [^113Xr8yo].

---

## Indications for GI prophylaxis in ICU

GI prophylaxis is **not universally indicated** for all ICU patients; it is reserved for those at **high risk** of stress-related upper GI bleeding (SRUGIB) [^111VJjht]. The following conditions are recognized as high-risk indicators:

- **Coagulopathy**: INR > 1.5 or platelet count < 50,000/mm³ [^notfound].
- **Mechanical ventilation**: More than 48 hours [^114mL3uX].
- **Shock**: Persistent hypotension requiring vasopressors [^notfound].
- **Chronic liver disease**: Particularly decompensated cirrhosis [^notfound].
- **Multiple risk factors**: Combination of the above, such as mechanical ventilation with coagulopathy or shock [^111VJjht].

Patients without these risk factors **do not routinely require GI prophylaxis** [^112Mwxn5], and its use should be avoided in low-risk patients due to potential adverse effects [^111VJjht].

---

## Pharmacological agents for GI prophylaxis

Several pharmacological agents are available for **GI prophylaxis** in the ICU, each with distinct mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety profiles:

| **Agent** | **Mechanism of action** | **Efficacy** | **Safety profile** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) | Inhibit gastric acid secretion by blocking the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme | - Highly effective in preventing clinically important GI bleeding [^111VJjht] [^116EkMcG] <br/> - Superior to H2RAs in most studies [^116PmuvY] | - May increase risk of pneumonia and C. difficile infection [^1127ecpS] <br/> - Long-term use associated with hypomagnesemia, fractures, and renal impairment |
| Histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) | Block histamine receptors in the stomach, reducing acid secretion | - Effective in preventing GI bleeding [^1174HvBt] <br/> - Slightly less effective than PPIs [^111VJjht] | - Lower risk of pneumonia and C. difficile infection compared to PPIs [^notfound] <br/> - Tachyphylaxis may occur with prolonged use |
| Sucralfate | Forms a protective barrier over ulcers, preventing further injury | - Moderately effective in preventing GI bleeding [^1174HvBt] <br/> - Inferior to PPIs and H2RAs [^notfound] | - Minimal systemic absorption <br/> - Constipation is a common side effect <br/> - Not recommended due to inferior efficacy and potential harm [^notfound] |

---

PPIs are generally **preferred as first-line agents** due to their superior efficacy in preventing clinically important GI bleeding [^111VJjht] [^11541YsS]. H2RAs are acceptable alternatives, particularly in patients at higher risk for pneumonia or C. difficile infection [^114oU8go]. Sucralfate is **not recommended** due to inferior efficacy and potential harm [^111VJjht].

---

## Timing and duration of prophylaxis

Prophylaxis should be initiated **promptly upon identification of risk factors** and continued throughout the period of risk [^113Xr8yo]. It should be discontinued immediately when risk factors resolve or the patient is transferred out of the ICU to prevent unnecessary continuation and associated complications [^114BzetW].

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

Regular monitoring and reassessment of the patient's risk factors and clinical status are essential to ensure appropriate continuation or discontinuation of prophylaxis [^113Xr8yo]. Daily evaluation should include:

- **Presence of risk factors**: Ongoing coagulopathy, mechanical ventilation, shock, or chronic liver disease [^111Z42Cw] [^114mL3uX].
- **Clinical signs of GI bleeding**: Hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, or drop in hemoglobin [^114wXV2s].
- **Adverse effects**: Pneumonia, C. difficile infection, or other complications related to acid suppression therapy [^1127ecpS].

---

## Potential risks and benefits

The primary benefit of GI prophylaxis is a **significant reduction in clinically important GI bleeding**, which is associated with improved outcomes and reduced morbidity [^111VJjht] [^116EkMcG]. However, potential risks include an increased incidence of pneumonia, C. difficile infection, and other complications associated with acid suppression therapy [^1127ecpS]. The balance of risks and benefits must be individualized based on patient-specific factors and clinical judgment [^111VJjht].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) provide the following recommendations:

- **Indication**: Provide prophylaxis for critically ill adults with risk factors for clinically important stress-related UGIB [^115363hF].
- **Agent selection**: Use either PPIs or H2RAs as first-line agents [^114oU8go].
- **Discontinuation**: Discontinue prophylaxis when risk factors resolve or before transfer out of the ICU [^114BzetW].

---

## Special considerations

Certain patient populations require **special consideration**:

- **Enterally fed patients**: Prophylaxis may not be necessary in enterally fed patients at low risk for GI bleeding, as enteral nutrition itself provides mucosal protection [^112Mwxn5] [^112up3kH].
- **Neurocritical care patients**: Prophylaxis is recommended due to the high risk of stress-related GI bleeding in this population [^116inxfo].
- **Patients with chronic liver disease**: Prophylaxis is recommended due to the increased risk of GI bleeding associated with portal hypertension and coagulopathy [^112cveRr].

---

GI prophylaxis in the ICU is indicated for patients at **high risk** of stress-related upper GI bleeding, including those with coagulopathy, mechanical ventilation, shock, or chronic liver disease [^notfound]. PPIs are the **first-line agents** due to their superior efficacy, while H2RAs are acceptable alternatives [^111VJjht]. Prophylaxis should be discontinued promptly when risk factors resolve or the patient is transferred out of the ICU [^113Xr8yo].

### Gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis for critically ill patients: a clinical practice guideline [^111VJjht]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the role of gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis (stress ulcer prophylaxis) in critically ill patients? This guideline was prompted by the publication of a new large randomised controlled trial.

Current Practice

Gastric acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) is commonly done to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding in critically ill patients. Existing guidelines vary in their recommendations of which population to treat and which agent to use.

Recommendations

This guideline panel makes a weak recommendation for using gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis in critically ill patients at high risk (> 4%) of clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding, and a weak recommendation for not using prophylaxis in patients at lower risk of clinically important bleeding (≤ 4%). The panel identified risk categories based on evidence, with variable certainty regarding risk factors. The panel suggests using a PPI rather than a H2RA (weak recommendation) and recommends against using sucralfate (strong recommendation).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations using standards for trustworthy guidelines and the GRADE approach. The recommendations are based on a linked systematic review and network meta-analysis. A weak recommendation means that both options are reasonable.

The Evidence

The linked systematic review and network meta-analysis estimated the benefit and harm of these medications in 12660 critically ill patients in 72 trials. Both PPIs and H2RAs reduce the risk of clinically important bleeding. The effect is larger in patients at higher bleeding risk (those with a coagulopathy, chronic liver disease, or receiving mechanical ventilation but not enteral nutrition or two or more of mechanical ventilation with enteral nutrition, acute kidney injury, sepsis, and shock) (moderate certainty). PPIs and H2RAs might increase the risk of pneumonia (low certainty). They probably do not have an effect on mortality (moderate certainty), length of hospital stay, or any other important outcomes. PPIs probably reduce the risk of bleeding more than H2RAs (moderate certainty).

Understanding The Recommendation

In most critically ill patients, the reduction in clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding from gastric acid suppressants is closely balanced with the possibility of pneumonia. Clinicians should consider individual patient values, risk of bleeding, and other factors such as medication availability when deciding whether to use gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis. Visual overviews provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of the options in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available on MAGICapp.

### Interventions for preventing upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people admitted to intensive care units [^1174HvBt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding due to stress ulcers contributes to increased morbidity and mortality in people admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Stress ulceration refers to GI mucosal injury related to the stress of being critically ill. ICU patients with major bleeding as a result of stress ulceration might have mortality rates approaching 48.5% to 65%. However, the incidence of stress-induced GI bleeding in ICUs has decreased, and not all critically ill patients need prophylaxis. Stress ulcer prophylaxis can result in adverse events such as ventilator-associated pneumonia; therefore, it is necessary to evaluate strategies that safely decrease the incidence of GI bleeding.

Objectives

To assess the effect and risk-benefit profile of interventions for preventing upper GI bleeding in people admitted to ICUs.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 23 August 2017, using relevant search terms: MEDLINE; Embase; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature; and the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Disease Group Specialised Register, as published in the Cochrane Library (2017, Issue 8). We searched the reference lists of all included studies and those from relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses to identify additional studies. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search portal and contacted individual researchers working in this field, as well as organisations and pharmaceutical companies, to identify unpublished and ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs with participants of any age and gender admitted to ICUs for longer than 48 hours. We excluded studies in which participants were admitted to ICUs primarily for the management of GI bleeding and studies that compared different doses, routes, and regimens of one drug in the same class because we were not interested in intraclass effects of drugs.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

We identified 2292 unique records. We included 129 records reporting on 121 studies, including 12 ongoing studies and two studies awaiting classification. We judged the overall risk of bias of two studies as low. Selection bias was the most relevant risk of bias domain across the included studies, with 78 studies not clearly reporting the method used for random sequence generation. Reporting bias was the domain with least risk of bias, with 12 studies not reporting all outcomes that researchers intended to investigate. Any intervention versus placebo or no prophylaxisIn comparison with placebo, any intervention seems to have a beneficial effect on the occurrence of upper GI bleeding (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.57; moderate certainty of evidence). The use of any intervention reduced the risk of upper GI bleeding by 10% (95% CI -12.0% to -7%). The effect estimate of any intervention versus placebo or no prophylaxis with respect to the occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia, all-cause mortality in the ICU, duration of ICU stay, duration of intubation (all with low certainty of evidence), the number of participants requiring blood transfusions (moderate certainty of evidence), and the units of blood transfused was consistent with benefits and harms. None of the included studies explicitly reported on serious adverse events. Individual interventions versus placebo or no prophylaxisIn comparison with placebo or no prophylaxis, antacids, H2 receptor antagonists, and sucralfate were effective in preventing upper GI bleeding in ICU patients. Researchers found that with H2 receptor antagonists compared with placebo or no prophylaxis, 11% less developed upper GI bleeding (95% CI -0.16 to -0.06; RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.70; 24 studies; 2149 participants; moderate certainty of evidence). Of ICU patients taking antacids versus placebo or no prophylaxis, 9% less developed upper GI bleeding (95% CI -0.17 to -0.00; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.99; eight studies; 774 participants; low certainty of evidence). Among ICU patients taking sucralfate versus placebo or no prophylaxis, 5% less had upper GI bleeding (95% CI -0.10 to -0.01; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.88; seven studies; 598 participants; moderate certainty of evidence). The remaining interventions including proton pump inhibitors did not show a significant effect in preventing upper GI bleeding in ICU patients when compared with placebo or no prophylaxis. Regarding the occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia, the effects of H2 receptor antagonists (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.48; eight studies; 945 participants; low certainty of evidence) and of sucralfate (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.04; four studies; 450 participants; low certainty of evidence) were consistent with benefits and harms when compared with placebo or no prophylaxis. None of the studies comparing antacids versus placebo or no prophylaxis provided data regarding nosocomial pneumonia.H2 receptor antagonists versus proton pump inhibitorsH2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors are most commonly used in practice to prevent upper GI bleeding in ICU patients. Proton pump inhibitors significantly more often prevented upper GI bleeding in ICU patients compared with H2 receptor antagonists (RR 2.90, 95% CI 1.83 to 4.58; 18 studies; 1636 participants; low certainty of evidence). When taking H2 receptor antagonists, 4.8% more patients might experience upper GI bleeding (95% CI 2.1% to 9%). Nosocomial pneumonia occurred in similar proportions of participants taking H2 receptor antagonists and participants taking proton pump inhibitors (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.35; 10 studies; 1256 participants; low certainty of evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This review shows that antacids, sucralfate, and H2 receptor antagonists might be more effective in preventing upper GI bleeding in ICU patients compared with placebo or no prophylaxis. The effect estimates of any treatment versus no prophylaxis on nosocomial pneumonia were consistent with benefits and harms. Evidence of low certainty suggests that proton pump inhibitors might be more effective than H2 receptor antagonists. Therefore, patient-relevant benefits and especially harms of H2 receptor antagonists compared with proton pump inhibitors need to be assessed by larger, high-quality RCTs to confirm the results of previously conducted, smaller, and older studies.

### Efficacy and safety of gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis in critically ill patients: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^11541YsS]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Critically ill patients in intensive care units are at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (for example, from stress ulceration). Authorities have suggested gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis is necessary to optimise the care of critically ill patients (often referred to as stress ulcer prophylaxis). Most patients at high risk receive acid suppression during intensive care. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most common prophylactic agent, followed by histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs); clinicians seldom use sucralfate and antacids.

Many published systematic reviews and meta-analyses have summarised randomised controlled trial evidence addressing the efficacy and safety of interventions for gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis, including a network meta-analysis conducted by members of our team. Results provided support for prophylaxis, but raised concerning issues, particularly nosocomial pneumonia. Much of the releveant evidence was, however, of low or very low quality.

Since the publication of the last network meta-analysis, several trials have been published, including a large, international, multicenter randomised controlled trial (the SUP-ICU trial). This trial compared pantoprazole with placebo and concluded that pantoprazole did not reduce mortality or a composite secondary outcome of "clinically important events" and questioned the routine use of PPIs in critically ill adults.

Because of new evidence suggesting a decrease in the frequency of bleeding, and new awareness of the possible limited morbidity associated with many bleeds, the practice of gastrointestinal bleedingprophylaxis has generated controversy. Moreover, observational studies have reported substantial increases in nosocomial pneumonia and Clostridium difficile infection with the use of acid-suppressive drugs, raising concern that harms may outweigh benefits.

We conducted an updated systematic review and network meta-analysis on the potential benefits and harms of gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis with PPIs, H2RAs, and sucralfate in critically ill patients. This review is part of the BMJ Rapid Recommendations project, a collaborative effort from the MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation and The BMJ. The aim of the project is to respond to new, potentially practice-changing evidence and provide a trustworthy practice guideline in a timely manner underpinned by best evidence. In this case, the stimulus was the SUP-ICU trial. This systematic review informs a BMJ Rapid Recommendation (box 1).

Study selection

Two reviewers independently performed the study selection, including screening titles and abstracts, and evaluating full-text eligibility of potentially eligible studies. Reviewers resolved disagreements by discussion or by consultation with a third reviewer.

We included randomised controlled trials that compared the efficacy and safety of gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis, PPIs, H2RAs, or sucralfate versus one another or placebo or no prophylaxis in adult critically ill patients at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding regardless of location. We did not contact authors of studies, and we excluded studies that did not report sufficient information to pool data (for example, uncertain number of events or number of patients in each group). We applied no restriction based on dose or route of administration, duration of prophylaxis, or language of publication.

Outcomes included mortality at the longest follow-up reported, clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, C difficile infection, overt gastrointestinal bleeding, length of stay in intensive care, length of hospital stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation. We accepted study definitions of overt bleeding, typically defined as hematemesis, melaena, haematochezia, or coffee-grounds emesis or aspirate without additional characteristics of clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding. We accepted study definitions of clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding, which typically included evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding with any of the following: significant haemodynamic changes not explained by other causes, need for transfusion of more than two units of blood, significant decrease in haemoglobin level, evidence of bleeding on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, or need for surgery to control bleeding. When extracting data on overt bleeding, we included clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding. We accepted the definitions of pneumonia and C difficile infection used in each trial.

Data extraction

For each eligible study, two reviewers independently abstracted the following items with adjudication by a third reviewer: study characteristics (year of publication and country); population characteristics (sample size, age, proportion of males, type of intensive care unit, risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding, and proportion of mechanical ventilation and enteral nutrition); description of interventions and comparators (the name, dose, administration route, frequency, and duration); and outcomes and their definitions.

### Efficacy and safety of gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis in critically ill patients: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116PmuvY]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine, in critically ill patients, the relative impact of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), sucralfate, or no gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis (or stress ulcer prophylaxis) on outcomes important to patients.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, trial registers, and grey literature up to March 2019.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies and Methods

We included randomised controlled trials that compared gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis with PPIs, H2RAs, or sucralfate versus one another or placebo or no prophylaxis in adult critically ill patients. Two reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided critical oversight of the systematic review, including identifying outcomes important to patients. We performed random-effects pairwise and network meta-analyses and used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. When results differed between low risk and high risk of bias studies, we used the former as best estimates.

Results

Seventy two trials including 12660 patients proved eligible. For patients at highest risk (> 8%) or high risk (4–8%) of bleeding, both PPIs and H2RAs probably reduce clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding compared with placebo or no prophylaxis (odds ratio for PPIs 0.61 (95% confidence interval 0.42 to 0.89), 3.3% fewer for highest risk and 2.3% fewer for high risk patients, moderate certainty; odds ratio for H2RAs 0.46 (0.27 to 0.79), 4.6% fewer for highest risk and 3.1% fewer for high risk patients, moderate certainty). Both may increase the risk of pneumonia compared with no prophylaxis (odds ratio for PPIs 1.39 (0.98 to 2.10), 5.0% more, low certainty; odds ratio for H2RAs 1.26 (0.89 to 1.85), 3.4% more, low certainty). It is likely that neither affect mortality (PPIs 1.06 (0.90 to 1.28), 1.3% more, moderate certainty; H2RAs 0.96 (0.79 to 1.19), 0.9% fewer, moderate certainty). Otherwise, results provided no support for any affect on mortality, Clostridium difficile infection, length of intensive care stay, length of hospital stay, or duration of mechanical ventilation (varying certainty of evidence).

Conclusions

For higher risk critically ill patients, PPIs and H2RAs likely result in important reductions in gastrointestinal bleeding compared with no prophylaxis; for patients at low risk, the reduction in bleeding may be unimportant. Both PPIs and H2RAs may result in important increases in pneumonia. Variable quality evidence suggested no important effects of interventions on mortality or other in-hospital morbidity outcomes.

### Pharmacological interventions for preventing upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people admitted to intensive care units: a network meta-analysis [^115aqfxj]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions for preventing upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in people admitted to intensive care units (ICUs).

Design and setting

Systematic review and frequentist network meta-analysis using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane for screening of records, data extraction and analysis. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence.

Participants

Randomised controlled trials involving patients admitted to ICUs for longer than 24 hours were included.

Search methods

The Cochrane Gut Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS) databases were searched from August 2017 to March 2022. The search in MEDLINE was updated in April 2023. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP).

Main outcome measures

The primary outcome was the prevention of clinically important upper GI bleeding.

Results

We included 123 studies with 46 996 participants. Cimetidine (relative risk (RR) 0.56, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.77, moderate certainty), ranitidine (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.76, moderate certainty), antacids (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.68, moderate certainty), sucralfate (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.75, moderate certainty) and a combination of ranitidine and antacids (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.62, moderate certainty) are likely effective in preventing upper GI bleeding.

The effect of any intervention on the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia, all-cause mortality in the ICU or the hospital, duration of the stay in the ICU, duration of intubation and (serious) adverse events remains unclear.

Conclusions

Several interventions seem effective in preventing clinically important upper GI bleeding while there is limited evidence for other outcomes. Patient-relevant benefits and harms need to be assessed under consideration of the patients' underlying conditions.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and American Society of Health-system Pharmacists guideline for the prevention of stress-related gastrointestinal bleeding in critically ill adults [^112cveRr]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Critically ill adults can develop stress-related mucosal damage from gastrointestinal hypoperfusion and reperfusion injury, predisposing them to clinically important stress-related upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

Objectives

The objective of this guideline was to develop evidence-based recommendations for the prevention of UGIB in adults in the ICU.

Design

A multiprofessional panel of 18 international experts from dietetics, critical care medicine, nursing, and pharmacy, and two methodologists developed evidence-based recommendations in alignment with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Conflict-of-interest policies were strictly followed during all phases of guideline development including task force selection and voting.

Methods

The panel members identified and formulated 13 Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome questions. We conducted a systematic review for each question to identify the best available evidence, statistically analyzed the evidence, and then assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used the evidence-to-decision framework to formulate the recommendations. Good practice statements were included to provide additional guidance.

Results

The panel generated nine conditional recommendations and made four good practice statements. Factors that likely increase the risk for clinically important stress-related UGIB in critically ill adults include coagulopathy, shock, and chronic liver disease. There is no firm evidence for mechanical ventilation alone being a risk factor. Enteral nutrition probably reduces UGIB risk. All critically ill adults with factors that likely increase the risk for stress-related UGIB should receive either proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 receptor antagonists, at low dosage regimens, to prevent UGIB. Prophylaxis should be discontinued when critical illness is no longer evident or the risk factor(s) is no longer present despite ongoing critical illness. Discontinuation of stress ulcer prophylaxis before transfer out of the ICU is necessary to prevent inappropriate prescribing.

Conclusions

The guideline panel achieved consensus regarding the recommendations for the prevention of stress-related UGIB. These recommendations are intended for consideration along with the patient's existing clinical status.

Patients with COVID-19–related critical illness are defined as those suffering from an immediately life-threatening condition who would typically be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), with examples including patients requiring hemodynamic support, ventilatory support, and renal-replacement therapy. Clinicians should weigh the potential benefits and harms based on the most up-to-date available evidence in caring for their patients, and the panel plans to update this recommendation when full trial results become available. An individualized assessment of thrombosis and bleeding risk is important; higher-intensity anticoagulation may be preferred for patients judged to be at high thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk. There is no direct high-certainty evidence comparing different anticoagulant agents, and selection may be based on availability, resources, familiarity, minimization of personal protective equipment exposure, and patient-specific factors such as renal function, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and concerns about gastrointestinal tract absorption.

### Pharmacological interventions for preventing upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people admitted to intensive care units: a network meta-analysis [^117Lsmyu]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions for preventing upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in people admitted to intensive care units (ICUs).

Design and Setting

Systematic review and frequentist network meta-analysis using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane for screening of records, data extraction and analysis. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence.

Participants

Randomised controlled trials involving patients admitted to ICUs for longer than 24 hours were included.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Gut Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS) databases were searched from August 2017 to March 2022. The search in MEDLINE was updated in April 2023. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP).

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was the prevention of clinically important upper GI bleeding.

Results

We included 123 studies with 46 996 participants. Cimetidine (relative risk (RR) 0.56, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.77, moderate certainty), ranitidine (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.76, moderate certainty), antacids (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.68, moderate certainty), sucralfate (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.75, moderate certainty) and a combination of ranitidine and antacids (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.62, moderate certainty) are likely effective in preventing upper GI bleeding. The effect of any intervention on the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia, all-cause mortality in the ICU or the hospital, duration of the stay in the ICU, duration of intubation and (serious) adverse events remains unclear.

Conclusions

Several interventions seem effective in preventing clinically important upper GI bleeding while there is limited evidence for other outcomes. Patient-relevant benefits and harms need to be assessed under consideration of the patients' underlying conditions.

Approaches that are not recommended for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-associated event (VAE) prevention: Good-quality evidence suggests that these interventions neither lower VAP/VAE rates nor decrease duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, or mortality. For stress-ulcer prophylaxis, although it lowers the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, a meta-analysis of randomized trials suggested no impact on nosocomial pneumonia, length of stay, or mortality, and a large multicenter randomized trial of pantoprazole versus placebo in ICU patients reported no difference in pneumonia or mortality rates. For monitoring residual gastric volumes, monitoring for regurgitation and vomiting alone is as effective as including residual gastric volumes with regard to VAP rates, duration of mechanical ventilation, and mortality.

Summary of recommendations

Recommendation 1a

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) guideline panel suggests using prophylactic-intensity over intermediate-intensity anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19–related critical illness who do not have suspected or confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁⨁◯◯).

Remarks:

The ASH guideline panel plans to continue to update this recommendation when the full results of other trials become available. Clinicians should weigh the benefits and harms based on the most up-to-date evidence in caring for their patients.
A now-expired recommendation published on 27 October 2020 compared therapeutic-intensity or intermediate-intensity with prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19–related critical illness. With the emergence of new evidence, this recommendation has now been split into 2 recommendations: a recommendation comparing intermediate-intensity with prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation (Recommendation 1a) and a separate recommendation comparing therapeutic-intensity with prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation (Recommendation 1b), whereby the latter remains unchanged for now, but, as with other recommendations in this guideline, is subject to review and revision as new evidence becomes available that meets prespecified criteria for updating.
Patients with COVID-19–related critical illness are defined as those suffering from an immediately life-threatening condition who would typically be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Examples include patients requiring hemodynamic support, ventilatory support, and renal replacement therapy.
An individualized assessment of the patient's risk of thrombosis and bleeding is important when deciding on anticoagulation intensity. Risk assessment models to estimate thrombotic and bleeding risk in hospitalized patients are available, but they have not been prospectively validated in patients with COVID-19.
At present, there is no direct high-certainty evidence comparing different types of anticoagulants. The selection of a specific agent (eg, low molecular weight heparin [LMWH], unfractionated heparin [UFH]) may be based on availability, resources required, familiarity, and the aim of minimizing the use of personal protective equipment or exposure of staff to COVID-19–infected patients as well as patient-specific factors (eg, renal function, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, concerns about gastrointestinal tract absorption).
This recommendation does not apply to patients who require anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis of extracorporeal circuits such as those on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or continuous renal replacement therapy.

### Evidence-based medicine as it applies to acid suppression in the hospitalized patient [^111ndZgY]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

An evidence-based-medicine approach may be applied to studies in the medical literature to help physicians make sound judgments about efficacy and safety data and to improve clinical decision making. To assess the role of gastric acid suppression in the prevention of stress ulcer bleeding and in the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding after successful hemostasis of bleeding peptic ulcer disease, the following questions should be addressed: Is it possible to identify risk factors for clinically important bleeding in critically ill patients? Can intravenous acid suppression prevent stress ulcer-related bleeding or prevent rebleeding in peptic ulcers after successful hemostasis? What is the most effective method of acid suppression for these disorders? An evidence-based-medicine review of published trials yields sufficient evidence to support the use of prophylactic acid suppression in critically ill patients with coagulopathy or in those who are receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation. Not enough data have accumulated to prove the superiority of intravenous proton pump inhibitors to intravenous histamine-2-receptor antagonists for prophylaxis of clinically important stress ulcer bleeding. With respect to acute gastrointestinal bleeding, however, two well-conducted trials indicate that an intravenous proton pump inhibitor is significantly more effective than an intravenous histamine-2-receptor antagonist or placebo in reducing the rate of rebleeding after hemostasis in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer. Analysis of the data from both trials shows that only five to six patients would need to receive an intravenous proton pump inhibitor to avoid one episode of rebleeding.

Background

Over four decades ago, investigators first described stress ulcer bleeding in critically ill patients. Since then, multiple studies have described this condition and its impact on the prognosis of critically ill patients. Stress ulcers typically occur in the gastric body, esophagus, or duodenum, sometimes resulting in gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Earlier studies reported overt GI bleeding in 5 to 25% of critically ill patients. In contrast, the incidence of clinically important GI bleeding is much lower, estimated between 1 and 4%. A recent large observational study (1034 patients, 97 sites), reported a 2.6% incidence of clinically important GI bleeding, which was previously found to be associated with increased intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and length of stay. Despite reduction in clinically important GI bleeding, pharmacologic stress ulcer prophylaxis does not seem to affect mortality in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

RCTs have investigated different classes of medication for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Recently, a meta-analysis of 29 RCTs showed that prophylaxis with either proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or histamine-2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) was associated with lower risk of overt GI bleeding compared to placebo or no prophylaxis. However, the relative effectiveness of the two classes of agent remains uncertain.

PPIs, more potent at increasing gastric pH than H2RAs and maintaining gastric pH between 3.5 and 5.0, may minimize the risk of gastric mucosal injury. Of four meta-analyses comparing PPIs to H2RAs, three suggested that PPIs are superior to H2RAs and one did not.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines recommend using stress ulcer prophylaxis among critically ill patients with risk factors (e.g. mechanically ventilated patients, and patients with coagulopathy), including a weak recommendation for using PPIs over H2RAs in this setting. The advice is concordant with current practice: recent observational studies showed that PPIs are the most commonly used prophylactic agents in the ICU.

Introduction

Critically ill patients are at risk of developing stress ulcers. A proportion of these patients develop clinically important gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and the mortality rate in such patients is high. Numerous randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies have investigated the role of different stress ulcer prophylactic drugs and strategies for the prevention of stress ulcers and thereby upper GI bleeding. In pooled analysis, when compared with placebo, stress ulcer prophylaxis with antacids, H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) or sucralfate results in a reduction in clinically important bleeding with prophylaxis. In a recent large RCT enrolling 3298 patients and comparing pantoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), with placebo, there was no difference in the 90-day mortality despite a significant reduction (relative risk (RR) 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.86) in one or more episodes of clinically important GI bleeding. Stress ulcer prophylaxis, on the other hand, also alters the acidity of the stomach content leading to changes in gastric and tracheobronchial colonisation with pathogenic bacteria. This may result in an increased risk for the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia, Clostridium difficile diarrhoea or other therapy-related adverse events. There is also evidence that the addition of pharmacological stress ulcer prophylaxis in enterally fed patients, does not result in a reduction in the incidence of GI bleeding when compared with patients who received enteral feeding alone. Hence, prophylaxis may not be indicated in all critically ill patientsand is often overused. Thus, the benefits of stress ulcer prophylaxis need to be balanced against its risks.

Over the last few years, despite a growing number of systematic reviews that were conducted on the prevention of upper GI bleeding, systematic reviews and meta-analyses were narrowed to comparisons of a limited number of interventions. These have been inconclusive or generated conflicting results. While there are new and ongoing studies on the topic, a network meta-analysis (NMA) of current evidence on different pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of upper GI bleeding was undertaken to provide direct and indirect evidence on the benefits and harms of bleeding prophylaxis in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The current study is an extension and update of our Cochrane review published in 2018, presents new findings derived from an NMA, offering additional depth for informed decision-making.

### Stress ulcer prophylaxis in intensive care unit patients receiving enteral nutrition: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112up3kH]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmacologic stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) is recommended in critically ill patients with high risk of stress-related gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. However, as to patients receiving enteral feeding, the preventive effect of SUP is not well-known. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of pharmacologic SUP in enterally fed patients on stress-related GI bleeding and other clinical outcomes.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane database from inception through 30 Sep 2017. Eligible trials were RCTs comparing pharmacologic SUP to either placebo or no prophylaxis in enterally fed patients in the ICU. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) with accompanying 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis and publication bias were explored.

Results

Seven studies (n = 889 patients) were included. There was no statistically significant difference in GI bleeding (RR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.31, p = 0.37) between groups. This finding was confirmed by further subgroup analyses and sensitivity analysis. In addition, SUP had no effect on overall mortality (RR 1.21; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.56, p = 0.14), Clostridium difficile infection (RR 0.89; 95% CI, 0.25 to 3.19, p = 0.86), length of stay in the ICU (MD 0.04 days; 95% CI, −0.79 to 0.87, p = 0.92), duration of mechanical ventilation (MD −0.38 days; 95% CI, −1.48 to 0.72, p = 0.50), but was associated with an increased risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia (RR 1.53; 95% CI, 1.04 to 2.27; p = 0.03).

Conclusions

Our results suggested that in patients receiving enteral feeding, pharmacologic SUP is not beneficial and combined interventions may even increase the risk of nosocomial pneumonia.

Conclusions

In summary, our meta-analysis provides moderate quality evidence for clinicians and guideline groups suggesting that PPIs, when compared to H2RAs, lower the risk of clinically important and overt GI bleeding among critically ill patients, without increasing the risk of pneumonia and mortality, or ICU length of stay. The impact of these drugs on the risk of Clostridium difficile infection has yet to be examined in randomized trials in the ICU setting.

### Efficacy and safety of proton pump inhibitors for stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^115bMt7C]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The relative efficacy and safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) compared to histamine-2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) should guide their use in reducing bleeding risk in the critically ill.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ACPJC, clinical trials registries, and conference proceedings through November 2015 without language or publication date restrictions. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PPIs vs H2RAs for stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill adults for clinically important bleeding, overt gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, nosocomial pneumonia, mortality, ICU length of stay and Clostridium difficile infection were included. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess our confidence in the evidence for each outcome.

Results

In 19 trials enrolling 2117 patients, PPIs were more effective than H2RAs in reducing the risk of clinically important GI bleeding (RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.21, 0.71; P = 0.002; I (2) = 0%, moderate confidence) and overt GI bleeding (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.34, 0.66; P < 0.0001; I (2) = 3%, moderate confidence). PPI use did not significantly affect risk of pneumonia (RR 1.12; 95% CI 0.86, 1.46; P = 0.39; I (2) = 2%, low confidence), mortality (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.87, 1.27; P = 0.61; I (2) = 0%, moderate confidence), or ICU length of stay (mean difference (MD), -0.38 days; 95% CI -1.49, 0.74; P = 0.51; I (2) = 30%, low confidence). No RCT reported Clostridium difficile infection.

Conclusions

PPIs were superior to H2RAs in preventing clinically important and overt GI bleeding, without significantly increasing the risk of pneumonia or mortality. Their impact on Clostridium difficile infection is yet to be determined.

Approaches that definitively are not recommended for VAP or VAE prevention

Good-quality evidence suggests that the following interventions neither lower VAP/VAE rates nor decrease duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, or mortality.

Stress-ulcer prophylaxis (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Stress-ulcer prophylaxis lowers the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, but a meta-analyses of randomized trials suggested no impact on nosocomial pneumonia, length of stay, or mortality. – A large, multicenter randomized trial of pantoprazole versus placebo in ICU patients reported no difference in pneumonia rates or mortality rates. Stress-ulcer prophylaxis may be indicated for reasons other than VAP prevention.
Monitoring residual gastric volumes (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Monitoring patients for regurgitation and vomiting alone is as effective as monitoring patients for regurgitation, vomiting, and residual gastric volumes with regard to VAP rates, duration of mechanical ventilation, and mortality.
Early versus late parenteral nutrition (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Early parenteral nutrition (within 48 hours of ICU admission) is associated with increased mortality and nosocomial infections compared to late parenteral nutrition (initiated on or after ICU day 8).

Approaches that are neither recommended nor discouraged for VAP prevention in adult patients

These interventions have no impact on VAP rates or patient outcomes and have unclear impact on costs.

Closed endotracheal tube suctioning systems (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Meta-analyses have found no difference in VAP rates, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay or mortality between patients randomized to open versus closed endotracheal suctioning systems. – A crossover trial in 4 ICUs found no difference between open versus closed systems in patient-to-patient transmissions of gram-negative pathogens. Different trials have reached different conclusions regarding cost.

Preventing VAP and/or VAEs in neonatal patients

Framework for evaluating and prioritizing interventions: Very few studies in neonates have evaluated the impact of VAP or VAE prevention interventions on duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, or mortality; therefore, we evaluated potential interventions on the basis of safety, feasibility, and potential impact on VAP and PedVAE rates. Interventions that lower VAP or PedVAE rates and confer minimal risks of harm are classified as essential practices. Interventions with unproven but potential impact on VAP or PedVAE rates and minimal risk of harm are classified as additional approaches. Hospitals can consider additional approaches if their VAP or PedVAE rates do not improve despite high performance rates for essential practices. Interventions with unknown benefits, known risks of harm, or unknown risks of harm are not recommended.

### Heterogeneous treatment effects of stress ulcer prophylaxis among ICU patients at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding [^111W4srJ]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal stress ulceration is a well-recognized condition that can progress to clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and potentially contributes to critical illness or death in patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). The prevalence of GIB in critically ill adult patients in the ICU ranges from 0.6 to 2.8%. Although international guidelines offer conflicting recommendations, stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or histamine-2 receptor blockers (H2RAs) is a primary strategy for preventing GIB in the ICU.

The provision of SUP in the ICU remains a topic of ongoing debate. While SUP is associated with a lower rate of GIB, it might increase the rate of adverse events that counterbalance their potential benefits. The SUP-ICU trial included patients with at least one risk factor for clinically important GIB and found that PPIs decrease both overt GI bleeding and GIB without affecting mortality and infectious complications. Subsequent meta-analyses confirmed these findings, The effect of a treatment on outcomes can vary among patients based on their individual characteristics, also known as heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE). Subgroup analyses of the SUP-ICU trial revealed increased 90-day mortality with pantoprazole in patients with a Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II higher than 53 points. A further post hoc study indicated that 90-day mortality and infectious adverse events may be increased with the use of pantoprazole in patients with greater illness severity and in those with more risk factors for GIB. These findings suggested the presence of HTE, whereas the HTE of SUP was not fully explored. Understanding the HTE of SUP is essential to maximize its efficacy while minimizing its adverse effects.

Various approaches have been proposed to estimate the HTE. Subgroup analysis is a conventional method but has significant limitations, whereas risk-based analysis and effect-based analysis are newly developed machine-learning techniques that estimate HTE more robustly. In the present study, we employed these three methods to estimate the HTE of SUP in patients with at least one risk factor for clinically important GIB, aiming to identify which patients can benefit most from SUP.

### Stress ulcer prophylaxis in intensive care unit patients receiving enteral nutrition: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113aCFjc]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidance. We searched RCTs in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane database from inception to 30 Sep 2017 to identify potentially relevant studies.

A population, intervention, comparator and outcomes assessment based on question and literature search was created (Additional file 1: S1). Our research was limited to RCTs and no language restriction was applied. Reference lists of included articles and other systematic review and meta-analysis were also reviewed. We included studies that met the following criteria: (1) design - RCTs; (2) population - adult (≥ 18 years old) ICU patients receiving EN; (3) intervention - patients receiving any pharmacologic SUP, regardless of dosage, frequency and duration; (4) control - patients receiving placebo or no prophylaxis; (5) predefined outcomes - GI bleeding, overall mortality at the longest available follow up, HAP, length of ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation and C. difficile infection. To facilitate comparison with the previous meta-analysis by Marik et al. we required included studies to specifically report that > 50% of enrolled patients received EN. We excluded studies enrolling patients who were < 18 years old, using SUP due to active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding, or receiving palliative care and publications available only in abstract form or meeting reports. Studies with inadequate information about enteral feeding were also excluded. We contacted the authors if the data on predefined outcomes from their studies were required.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Two reviewers (H-BH and W J) independently extracted data from included studies, such as the first author, year of publication, country, sample size, study design, setting, treatment protocol for SUP and comparator, severity of illness, and all predefined outcomes. Quality of included studies was evaluated using the risk of bias tool recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. We assigned a value of high, unclear, or low to the following items: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other sources of bias. Discrepancies were identified and resolved through discussion.

Pharmacologic stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) in critically ill adults with risk factors: We suggest clinicians provide SUP to prevent clinically important UGIB in critically ill adults with risk factors compared with no SUP (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). The network meta-analysis conducted by the panel found proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduced clinically important UGIB (relative risk [RR], 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30–0.81) without conclusive evidence of effects on pneumonia (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.93–1.54), Clostridioides difficile infection (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.42–1.26), or mortality (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.92–1.14); other systematic reviews and meta-analyses found similar results with PPIs and noted H2RAs were also effective at preventing UGIB.

### Efficacy and safety of stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill patients: a network meta-analysis of randomized trials [^111Sq4mF]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) is usual practice in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. Across North America, Europe, and Australia, most patients with risk factors receive SUP during their ICU stay. A survey of 58 ICUs in North America showed that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most commonly used agents, followed by histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs); none of the participating centers used sucralfate or anti-acids. A recent survey of 97 centers in Europe, Australia, and Canada yielded similar findings. These practices reflect the results of systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggesting that H2RAs, compared with sucralfate or no prophylaxis, reduce the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding without increasing the risk of pneumonia, and that PPIs in comparison with H2RAs further reduce the risk of clinically important GI bleeding (CIB) without increasing pneumonia risk. The recommendations of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines are consistent with these results.

Nevertheless, concerns have grown regarding the magnitude of benefit of SUP, as well as the safety of acid suppressive therapy with respect to pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, cardiovascular events, and mortality. Conventional meta-analyses are restricted to head-to-head comparisons, and therefore cannot inform on the relative merit of candidate therapies that have not been compared directly. By including indirect comparisons, network meta-analyses can not only address this limitation but also — by combining direct and indirect estimates — improve precision.

We therefore conducted a network meta-analysis addressing the relative impact of SUP with PPI, H2RAs, sucralfate, and placebo (or no prophylaxis) on overt CIB, pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, and death.

### Bedside adherence to clinical practice guidelines in the intensive care unit: the TECLA study [^114TDH3B]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess adherence to clinical practice guidelines for three interventions routinely used in critical care medicine.

Design and Setting

Multicenter, 1-day cross-sectional observational study in 44 intensive care units in four countries.

Patients

A total of 419 patients hospitalized in participating ICUs on the day of the survey.

Measurements and Results

Red blood cell transfusion (n = 29) was performed appropriately in 22 patients (76%), while among the 390 patients who received no transfusion 4 (1%) had a valid indication. Setting of tidal volume in acute respiratory distress syndrome, assessed in 45 patients, was deemed appropriate in 37 cases (82%). Prescription of stress ulcer prophylaxis (n = 128) was appropriate in only 24 patients (19%), while among the 268 patients who were not treated 28 (10%) had an indication.

Conclusions

The implementation of recommendations varies across different domains of care. While the adherence to current recommendations in routine practice is acceptable as regards tidal volume settings in acute respiratory distress syndrome, it is suboptimal for blood transfusion and prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Practice surveys are useful to inform strategies currently developed to assess practices of health-care professionals and develop strategies for more effective dissemination of medical knowledge.

Recommendation 3 — risk factors for overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): We suggest critically ill adults with coagulopathy, shock, or chronic liver disease be considered at risk for overt UGIB (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty of evidence).

### Proton-pump inhibitors to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding-an updated meta-analysis [^1148gZLC]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The goal of this systematic review was to examine the efficacy and safety of proton-pump inhibitors for stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill patients.

Methods

We included randomized trials comparing proton-pump inhibitors versus placebo or no prophylaxis in critically ill adults, performed meta-analyses, and assessed certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. To explore the effect of proton-pump inhibitors on mortality based on disease severity, a subgroup analysis was conducted combining within-trial subgroup data from the two largest trials and assessed credibility using the Instrument for Assessing the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses.

Results

Twelve trials that enrolled 9533 patients were included. Proton-pump inhibitors were associated with a reduced incidence of clinically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding (relative risk [RR], 0.51 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.34 to 0.76]; high certainty evidence). Proton-pump inhibitors may have little or no effect on mortality (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.93 to 1.05]; low certainty). Within-trial subgroup analysis with intermediate credibility suggested that the effect of proton-pump inhibitors on mortality may differ based on disease severity. Subgroup results raise the possibility that proton-pump inhibitors may decrease 90-day mortality in less severely ill patients (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.98) and may increase mortality in more severely ill patients (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.20]. Proton-pump inhibitors may have no effect on pneumonia and little or no effect on Clostridioides difficile infection (low certainty).

Conclusions

High certainty evidence supports the association of proton-pump inhibitors with decreased upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Proton-pump inhibitors may have little or no effect on mortality, although a decrease in mortality in less severely ill patients and an increase in mortality in more severely ill patients remain possible.

Discussion

Durable enteral access may be required by critically ill patients for feeding, medication administration, or decompression. Gastrostomy tubes are commonly placed using percutaneous, endoscopic, laparoscopic, and/or open techniques. These procedures are frequently performed in a variety of settings including the operating room, procedure rooms, or at the bedside.

Gastrostomy tube placement is a clean-contaminated procedure and the standard precautions outlined in 2017 by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) should be followed. These precautions include appropriate skin preparation with soap and an antiseptic agent the night before the procedure, intraoperative skin preparation with an alcohol-based antiseptic agent, and preoperative prophylactic antibiotics. The redosing of antibiotics is not recommended if the case remains clean-contaminated. Finally, the application of antimicrobial agents (creams, ointments, powders, or solutions) to the surgical wound is also not recommended.

Specific prophylactic antibiotics, based on the type of surgical intervention, have been previously recommended within a 2013 guideline coauthored by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the IDSA, the SIS, and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. For gastroduodenal procedures with luminal entry, cefazolin is the recommended agent. Alternative agents recommended for those with a β-lactam allergy include clindamycin or vancomycin plus an aminoglycoside or aztreonam or fluoroquinolone. If vancomycin or fluoroquinolone is provided, administration will need to begin within 120 minutes of the surgical incision to achieve peak tissue concentrations.

Percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) tubes have a known infection rate of 5% to 30%. Interestingly, the PEG population is excluded from the 2017 CDC Surgical Site Infection guidelines, so our recommendation is based on other available literature. Specifically, a 2013 Cochrane review which included 12 randomized controlled trials investigated the benefit of prophylactic antibiotics prior to PEG placement. With over 1200 pooled patients, the authors demonstrated a significant reduction in peristomal infection (OR of 0.36 (0.26, 0.5)) with the use of prophylactic antibiotics. Most of the included trials used parenteral cephalosporins. The most common organisms responsible for SSI after PEG are skin flora. Based on these data, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy recommends cefazolin 1 g intravenously 30 minutes prior to the procedure. In patients with a true β-lactam allergy who cannot tolerate cephalosporins, clindamycin is recommended.

Society of Critical Care Medicine and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists guideline — scope and audience for stress-related upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) prevention in critically ill adults applies to all critically ill adults and includes: identifying risk factors for stress-related UGIB; determining the benefit of stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) in at risk patients; delineating the preferred class of medications for SUP; describing the optimal dosage regimen and route of administration; identifying subgroups who may or may not benefit from pharmacologic SUP; describing the role of pharmacologic SUP in the setting of enteral nutrition (EN); and providing guiding principles for discontinuing SUP. The target audiences are healthcare clinicians, allied healthcare staff, trainees working in ICUs or with critically ill adults, and administrators with responsibility for ICU functions. As background, since the introduction of SUP with histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the rate of stress-related UGIB has declined substantially and these agents are now used ubiquitously in ICUs.

### Risks and benefits of stress ulcer prophylaxis in adult neurocritical care patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114Q2Mcz]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Stress ulcer and stress-related upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding is common in critically ill patients. The reported incidence of overt UGI bleeding ranges from 0.1% to 4% among all intensive care unit (ICU) patients and was up to 15% among patients who received no prophylaxis, which was associated with worsened outcomes.

Both the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) with either histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as standard care in patients with a high risk of stress-related UGI bleeding. However, the rationale and level of evidence for this recommendation have been questioned by the findings of some recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses. Even though two recent meta-analyses showed that PPIs were more effective than H2RAs in preventing UGI bleeding in critically ill patients without increasing the risk of nosocomial pneumonia, one meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis comparing the use of SUP versus no prophylaxis or placebo found that the quality and quantity of evidence for the use of SUP in adult ICU patients is low and that there is no firm evidence for benefit or harm of SUP.

We suggest not using SUP for critically ill adults who are enterally fed and at low risk for clinically important stress-related UGIB (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Concurrent administration of SUP with EN may increase pneumonia risk, and two systematic reviews were used to inform these recommendations, including one showing a reduction in clinically important UGIB with SUP (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.42–0.57), whereas the other did not.

### Predictors of gastrointestinal bleeding in adult ICU patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1114Lx4x]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To systematically identify predictors of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies including trial cohorts. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and trial registries up to March 2019. Eligible studies assessed potential predictors of clinically important GI bleeding (CIB; primary outcome) or overt GI bleeding (secondary outcome), had > 20 events, and presented adjusted effect estimates. Two reviewers assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence using GRADE. We meta-analysed adjusted effect estimates if data from ≥ 2 studies were available.

Results

We included 8 studies (116,497 patients). 4 studies (including 74,456 patients) assessed potential predictors of CIB, and we meta-analysed 12 potential predictors from these. Acute kidney injury (relative effect [RE] 2.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07–5.28, moderate certainty) and male gender (RE 1.24, 95% CI 1.03–1.50, low certainty) were associated with increased incidence of CIB. After excluding high risk of bias studies, coagulopathy (RE 4.76, 95% CI 2.62–8.63, moderate certainty), shock (RE 2.60, 95% CI 1.25–5.42, low certainty), and chronic liver disease (RE 7.64, 95% CI 3.32–17.58, moderate certainty) were associated with increased incidence of CIB. The effect of mechanical ventilation on CIB was unclear (RE 1.93, 0.57–6.50, very low certainty).

Conclusions

We identified predictors of CIB and overt GI bleeding in adult ICU patients. These findings may be used to identify ICU patients at higher risk of GI bleeding who are most likely to benefit from stress ulcer prophylaxis.

### Stress ulcer prophylaxis in intensive care unit patients receiving enteral nutrition: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112dAzZS]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Over the past decades, stress-related bleeding has become extremely uncommon in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Apart from pharmacologic approaches for stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP), advances in the care of critically ill patients, such as optimal fluid resuscitation to maintain hemodynamic stability and thus improve splanchnic perfusion, and early provision of enteral nutrition (EN), may contribute to this observation. Although recommended only in patients on mechanical ventilation or coagulopathy, patients with traumatic brain injury or major burns, or those with ≥ 2 risk factors, SUP is still being used in nearly 90% of ICU patients, despite lack of an accepted indication in the majority. Furthermore, SUP is often continued in these patients until clinical improvement, or even after transfer to the general ward. However, SUP is not without risks. The extensive use of SUP has been demonstrated to be associated with a higher rate of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) due to loss of the protective bacteriostatic effect of gastric acid. Meanwhile, concomitant treatment of SUP and broad-spectrum antibiotics has also contributed to higher risks of Clostridium difficile infection. Thus, selection of potentially high-risk patients who may benefit from SUP while avoiding unnecessary use in others is important.

### Stress-induced ulcer bleeding in critically ill patients [^114sAqaK]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Increased knowledge of risk factors and improved ICU care has decreased the incidence of stress-related bleeding. Not all critically ill patients need prophylaxis for SRMD and withholding such prophylaxis in suitable low-risk candidates is a reasonable and cost-effective approach. Mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours and coagulopathy are the main risk factors for stress-induced upper GI bleeding. Although intravenous H2RAs can prevent clinically important bleeding, their benefits seem to be limited by the rapid development of tolerance. The availability of intravenous formulations of PPIs makes it possible to critically compare their prophylactic efficacy and safety to different classes of acid-suppressive agents, such as H2RAs, in critically ill patients. The appropriate dose of PPI and the role of newer PPI formulations need to be further defined along with proposed guidelines for the use of intravenous and oral/enteral formulations of PPIs in patients at risk for stress-related mucosal damage.

### Risk factors for patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^114g5tem]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Critically ill patients are at risk of stress erosions in the upper gastrointestinal tract that may cause clinically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Although many bleeding risk factors have been reported, the epidemiology and care of critically ill patients has changed over time, and no study has evaluated risk factors for bleeding using an endpoint defined by ICU survivors and family members. Most research evaluating gastrointestinal bleeding as a complication of critical illness has reported clinically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding as defined by study investigators. In response to the infrequent use of endpoints that are determined by members of the public in clinical research, the outcome of patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding was developed in a mixed-methods study by survivors of critical illness and family members of patients admitted to an ICU.

Unlike clinically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hemodynamic changes and hemoglobin values associated with bleeding were not part of the definition. ICU survivors and relatives of patients who experienced critical illness defined patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding as overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding that required a single blood transfusion, vasopressor treatment, diagnostic endoscopy, computed tomography angiography, or surgery, or that resulted in death, disability, or prolonged hospitalization.

Patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding was a secondary endpoint for a recent international stress ulcer prophylaxis trial. REVISE (Re-Evaluating the Inhibition of Stress Erosions) was a multicenter, randomized, stratified, concealed, parallel-group trial that enrolled 4,821 invasively ventilated patients who were at least 18 years old and admitted to the ICU, designed to determine the effect of pantoprazole versus placebo on the primary efficacy outcome of clinically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding and the primary safety outcome of 90-day mortality. In the main analysis, pantoprazole significantly reduced the risk of clinically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding and patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding (the numbers needed to prevent a bleeding episode were 40 and 37, respectively); other outcomes related to microbiome modification and the gastropulmonary route of infection were unaffected.

Stress ulcer prevention in practice may range from no prophylaxism, to a risk-based approach, to universal prescribing. The primary objective of this study was to identify, among invasively ventilated critically ill adults, the contemporary risk factors for patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding, considering illness severity, and the competing risk of death.

### Efficacy and safety of stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill patients: a network meta-analysis of randomized trials [^1127ecpS]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our results provide moderate-quality evidence that PPIs are the most effective prophylactic strategy for SUP, with an absolute risk reduction in CIB relative to no prophylaxis of 1.6%. The benefit of PPIs must, however, be weighed against the risk of pneumonia, and possibly of Clostridium difficile infection. Moderate-quality evidence provides a best estimate of the increase in pneumonia with PPIs relative to no prophylaxis of over 3%. These estimates raise serious questions regarding the net benefit of SUP and its widespread use. The findings of this network meta-analysis can inform clinicians who consider the local incidence of CIB, pneumonia, and Clostridium difficile infection when deciding on uniform, selective, or sparing use of SUP in critically ill patients.

### Stress ulcer prophylaxis [^114B9BqM]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Stress ulcer prophylaxis is commonly administered to critically ill patients for the prevention of clinically important stress-related mucosal bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract. Despite widespread incorporation of stress ulcer prophylaxis into practice around the world, questions are emerging about its indications and impact. This clinically focused article will review current controversies related to stress ulcer prophylaxis for critically ill adult patients, including bleeding frequency, risk factors, comparative efficacy, adverse effect profile, and overall cost-effectiveness of the available stress ulcer prophylaxis regimens.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search was conducted from inception through August 2015.

Study Selection

Selected publications describing stress ulcer prophylaxis in adult patients were retrieved (original research, systematic reviews, and practice guidelines); their bibliographies were also reviewed to identify additional pertinent publications.

Data Extraction

Data from relevant publications were abstracted and summarized.

Data Synthesis

The existing evidence is organized to describe the patients most likely to benefit from stress ulcer prophylaxis, review the comparative efficacy of proton pump inhibitors and histamine 2 receptor antagonists, the adverse effects of stress ulcer prophylaxis, and overall cost-effectiveness.

Conclusions

Many stress ulcer prophylaxis recommendations are based on older studies at risk of bias, which may not be applicable to modern practice. Stress ulcer prophylaxis should be limited to patients considered to be at high risk for clinically important bleeding. When evaluating only the trials at low risk for bias, the evidence does not clearly support lower bleeding rates with proton pump inhibitors over histamine 2 receptor antagonists; however, proton pump inhibitors appear to be the dominant drug class used worldwide today. The current rate of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and the relative adverse effects of acid suppression on infectious risk may drive not only the effectiveness, but also the cost-effectiveness of stress ulcer prophylaxis today. Research is currently underway to better address these issues.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — stress ulcer prophylaxis: For adults with sepsis or septic shock, and who have risk factors for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, we suggest using stress ulcer prophylaxis (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). An updated analysis showed no effect on mortality (RR, 1.01 95% CI, 0.93–1.10) and a reduction in GI hemorrhage (RR, 0.52 95% CI, 0.45–0.61); a sensitivity analysis including only trials at low risk of bias provided similar results, and no increase in Clostridioides difficile colitis or pneumonia was observed. The most recent (and largest) RCT did not demonstrate any effect of pantoprazole versus placebo on 90-day mortality and a composite outcome of clinically important events, and a recent meta-analysis suggested a higher risk of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections with proton pump inhibitors.

### Pantoprazole in patients at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding in the ICU [^116EkMcG]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Prophylaxis for gastrointestinal stress ulceration is frequently given to patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), but its risks and benefits are unclear.

Methods

In this European, multicenter, parallel-group, blinded trial, we randomly assigned adults who had been admitted to the ICU for an acute condition (i.e., an unplanned admission) and who were at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding to receive 40 mg of intravenous pantoprazole (a proton-pump inhibitor) or placebo daily during the ICU stay. The primary outcome was death by 90 days after randomization.

Results

A total of 3298 patients were enrolled; 1645 were randomly assigned to the pantoprazole group and 1653 to the placebo group. Data on the primary outcome were available for 3282 patients (99.5%). At 90 days, 510 patients (31.1%) in the pantoprazole group and 499 (30.4%) in the placebo group had died (relative risk, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.13; P = 0.76). During the ICU stay, at least one clinically important event (a composite of clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, or myocardial ischemia) had occurred in 21.9% of patients assigned to pantoprazole and 22.6% of those assigned to placebo (relative risk, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.11). In the pantoprazole group, 2.5% of patients had clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding, as compared with 4.2% in the placebo group. The number of patients with infections or serious adverse reactions and the percentage of days alive without life support within 90 days were similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

Among adult patients in the ICU who were at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, mortality at 90 days and the number of clinically important events were similar in those assigned to pantoprazole and those assigned to placebo.

### Stress ulcer prophylaxis in non-critically ill patients: less may be more [^114ULHgJ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding resulting from stress ulceration is a serious life-threatening complication. However, it occurs relatively rarely even in the sickest patients. Therefore, guidelines suggest that prophylaxis (e.g., with acid-suppressive therapy) should be reserved for highly selected patients. Despite these recommendations, numerous studies suggest that many hospitalized patients are inappropriately placed on acid-suppressive therapy (AST) for the sole purpose of preventing stress ulceration. Moreover, it appears that once AST is started, medications are continued even after discharge, resulting in further unnecessary expenditure of resources. National and local efforts are needed to curtail this practice that places patients at risk for drug side effects while affording them little or no benefit.

### Efficacy and safety of stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill patients: a network meta-analysis of randomized trials [^1138AVqY]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) is commonly prescribed in the intensive care unit. However, data from systematic reviews and conventional meta-analyses are limited by imprecision and restricted to direct comparisons. We conducted a network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to examine the safety and efficacy of drugs available for SUP in critically ill patients.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials through April 2017 for randomized controlled trials that examined the efficacy and safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), and sucralfate for SUP in critically ill patients. No date or language restrictions were applied. Data on study characteristics, methods, outcomes, and risk of bias were abstracted by two reviewers.

Results

Of 96 potentially eligible studies, we included 57 trials enrolling 7293 patients. The results showed that PPIs are probably more effective for preventing clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding (CIB) than H2RAs [odds ratio (OR) 0.38; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.20, 0.73], sucralfate (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.13, 0.69), and placebo (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.10, 0.60) (all moderate quality evidence). There were no convincing differences among H2RA, sucralfate, and placebo. PPIs probably increase the risk of developing pneumonia compared with H2RAs (OR 1.27; 95% CI 0.96, 1.68), sucralfate (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.20, 2.27), and placebo (OR 1.52; 95% CI 0.95, 2.42) (all moderate quality). Mortality is probably similar across interventions (moderate quality). Estimates of baseline risks of bleeding varied significantly across studies, and only one study reported on Clostridium difficile infection. Definitions of pneumonia varied considerably. Most studies on sucralfate predate pneumonia prevention strategies.

Conclusions

Our results provide moderate quality evidence that PPIs are the most effective agents in preventing CIB, but they may increase the risk of pneumonia. The balance of benefits and harms leaves the routine use of SUP open to question.

### Gastrointestinal prophylaxis in neurocritical care [^116dpGEu]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to review and summarize the relevant literature regarding pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic methods of prophylaxis against gastrointestinal (GI) stress ulceration, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding in critically ill patients. Stress ulcers are a known complication of a variety of critical illnesses. The literature regarding epidemiology and management of stress ulcers and complications thereof, is vast and mostly encompasses patients in medical and surgical intensive care units. This article aims to extrapolate meaningful data for use with a population of critically ill neurologic and neurosurgical patients in the neurological intensive care unit setting. Studies were identified from the Cochrane Central Register of controlled trials and NLM PubMed for English articles dealing with an adult population. We also scanned bibliographies of relevant studies. The results show that H(2)A, sucralfate, and PPI all reduce the incidence of UGIB in neurocritically ill patients, but H(2)A blockers may cause encephalopathy and interact with anticonvulsant drugs, and have been associated with higher rates of nosocomial pneumonias, but causation remains unproven and controversial. For these reasons, we advocate against routine use of H(2)A for GI prophylaxis in neurocritical patients. There is a paucity of high-level evidence studies that apply to the neurocritical care population. From this study, it is concluded that stress ulcer prophylaxis among critically ill neurologic and neurosurgical patients is important in preventing ulcer-related GI hemorrhage that contributes to both morbidity and mortality. Further, prospective trials are needed to elucidate which methods of prophylaxis are most appropriate and efficacious for specific illnesses in this population.

### Proton pump inhibitors versus histamine-2 receptor antagonists likely increase mortality in critical care: an updated meta-analysis [^1149sfZk]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is common among the critically ill. Recently, the Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) vs. Histamine-2 Receptor Blockers for Ulcer Prophylaxis Therapy in the Intensive Care Unit (PEPTIC) trial suggested PPIs might increase mortality. We performed an updated meta-analysis to further inform discussion.

Methods

We leveraged 2 recent systematic reviews to identify randomized controlled trials directly comparing PPIs and H-2 Receptor Antagonists (H2RAs) for stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill patients and reporting mortality. We extracted mortality data from each study and meta-analyzed them with the PEPTIC trial using a random effects model.

Results

Of 28,559 total patients, 14,436 (50.5%) were allocated to PPI and 14,123 to H2RAs (49.5%). Compared to H2RAs, the pooled relative risk for mortality was 1.05 (95% confidence interval 1.00–1.10) with an estimated risk difference for mortality of 9 additional deaths per 1000 patients exposed to PPI (95% confidence interval 0–18); heterogeneity was low (I 2 = 0%; P = 0.826).

Conclusions

Stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPIs likely increases mortality compared to H2RAs. Whether stress ulcer prophylaxis is beneficial in critical care remains open to further study.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and American Society of Health-system Pharmacists guideline for the prevention of stress-related gastrointestinal bleeding in critically ill adults [^114oU8go]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

SCCM/ASHP stress ulcer prophylaxis — agents: We suggest using either PPIs or H2RAs as first-line agents for stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) in critically ill adults with risk factors for clinically important stress-related upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) compared with no PPIs or H2RAs (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). Compared with H2RAs, PPIs were associated with reduced clinically important UGIB (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.34–0.83), while sucralfate was associated with less pneumonia compared with PPIs (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.3–0.79) and H2RAs (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71–0.96). The panel notes that the certainty of evidence varied (very low to high), and meta-analyses suggest reduced UGIB with PPIs compared with H2RAs but possibly increased mortality; additionally, no evidence supports the concurrent administration of sucralfate and acid suppressants for SUP.

### Are proton pump inhibitors more effective than histamine-2-receptor antagonists for stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill patients? A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^115WDmMq]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Histamine-2-receptor antagonists (H 2 RAs) have been largely replaced by proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) despite the inconclusive evidence concerning comparative effectiveness.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of PPIs and H 2 RAs on SUP in real-world setting.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to September 19, 2021. We included cohort studies comparing PPIs with H 2 RAs in critically ill adult patients and explicitly reporting the outcome of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or mortality. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess potential risk of bias. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis and only the studies with adjusted effect estimates were pooled. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system was used to assess the overall quality of the evidence.

Results

Thirteen cohort studies (N = 145 149) were eligible and 11 of them available for full texts were of low to moderate risk of bias. Meta-analysis of adjusted effect estimates indicated that PPIs were associated with a significantly higher risk of GI bleeding, compared with H 2 RAs (8 studies, odds ratio [OR] = 1.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.30–3.01, low certainty). Post hoc pooling analysis also suggested that PPIs were associated with a slightly higher risk of mortality in comparison with H 2 RAs (7 studies, OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.13–1.42, low certainty).

Conclusion and Relevance

The systematic review of cohort studies showed that PPIs were associated with higher risks of GI bleeding and mortality, although the certainty of evidence was low. Overall, we suggest not excluding H 2 RAs for SUP, while further studies are essential for elucidating the risk stratification, optimal regimen, and specific duration.

### Reducing inappropriate proton pump inhibitors use for stress ulcer prophylaxis in hospitalized patients: systematic review of De-implementation studies [^112GPYp9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In 2013, the Choosing Wisely campaign has identified PPI and H2RA acid-suppressive therapy for SUP as low-value care that should be avoided. We identified ten studies evaluating the effectiveness of strategies to reduce inappropriate PPI use for SUP in adult hospitalized, non-ICU patients. Altogether, we can conclude that small to moderate reductions in inappropriate PPI prescriptions or use can be accomplished in a wide range of hospital settings upon implementation of PPI-reducing strategies. Nevertheless, these results should be interpreted cautiously as the type of study design of most studies (before-after design) has intrinsic limitations (no control group, no randomization, contamination issues). Taking these shortcomings in study design into account, critical appraisal of the quality of included studies revealed moderate quality for most studies (Fig. 2).

Inter-study heterogeneity hampered meta-analysis of the data. The included studies were different regarding several aspects, namely combinations of interventions, type of hospital departments, and hence patient populations, setting (academic or general hospitals), and country. Adding to clinical heterogeneity, the included studies applied different PPI prescription/use appropriateness criteria (Suppl. Table 4), and based these criteria on a variety of information (Suppl. Table 5). Consequently, studies differed in the indications and specifications of symptoms in which PPI prescription was considered appropriate, including several gastrointestinal tract indications (e.g. reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease) and SUP for high-risk patients, (Suppl. Table 4). Finally, lack of reporting standardization impaired data extraction and analysis.

Evidence on prevention of GI bleeding by PPI in low-risk patients has been lacking for a long time, and recently, it was shown that even in ICU patients at risk of GI bleeding, PPI prescription did not prevent CIB occurrence. Despite clear advice against SUP prescription for non-ICU-hospitalized patients without additional risk factors in guidelines, this recommendation is apparently not followed by healthcare professionals. It is questionable whether an update of the guideline with evidence is needed or that stricter adherence to guidelines is required. Nevertheless, the ASHP guideline is based on outdated information, with evidence for CIB prevention coming from studies when H2RAs were more commonly used. Also, most studies examined short-term SUP use, while nowadays patients are on continued PPI prescription of which long-term adverse effects are not thoroughly examined.

Good Practice Statement 4 — pre-ICU SUP with risk factors indicates that in critically ill adult adults with risk factors for developing clinically important stress-related UGIB and who are receiving a SUP agent before ICU, the consideration to change the medication to the most preferred agent for SUP must be weighed against the indication that required the SUP therapy before ICU admission. Patient-specific factors such as allergies or potential severe drug interactions may necessitate choosing a specific class of SUP agent.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^112sMz11]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Critically ill patients are at increased risk of developing stress-related mucosal disease and subsequent stress-ulcer bleeding as a result of both their underlying disease and therapeutic interventions. There are some well-established strong, independent risk factors for stress-related mucosal disease, respiratory failure and coagulopathy being the most relevant ones, with an OR of 15.6 and 4.3, respectively. Other important factors include acute renal or hepatic failure, sepsis, hypotension, severe head or spinal cord injury, thermal injury involving more than 35% of the body surface area, acute lung injury, major surgery (lasting more than 4 hours), and history of GI bleeding.

Although no single study or meta-analysis has reported a decrease in the overall mortality related to SUP, guidelines from the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists and Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommend routine prophylaxis with acid suppressive therapy for high-risk patients. The rationale for this recommendation relies on the finding that important GI bleeding is strongly associated with prolonged ICU stay and increased mortality. Indeed, three large meta-analyses found that the risk of bleeding in ICU is reduced by some 60% in patients receiving SUP compared with those treated with placebo or no prophylaxis. Therefore, SUP has become the standard of care in the ICU, sometimes irrespective of the presence of risk factors. The benefit of SUP using real-world data is, however, not easy to estimate because of the lack of a control group.

### Management of decompensated cirrhosis in the surgical ICU: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^113vRnCa]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) Critical Care Committee develops Clinical Consensus Documents to provide practical guidance to the surgical intensivist on challenging topics. These documents are based on expert consensus following review of the literature. The Critical Care Committee chose the management of decompensated cirrhosis (DC) in the intensive care unit (ICU) as a topic appropriate for review. Specifically, these are patients with underlying cirrhosis who have decompensation precipitated by other disease or injury; these recommendations do not apply to patients with acute liver failure or hemorrhage-related shock liver.

DC is a common clinical entity, with an estimated 10.6 million prevalent cases globally in 2017, and with the number of cases having more than tripled since 1990. Patients with DC are particularly challenging to manage in the surgical ICU due to their comorbidities related to underlying liver dysfunction. This clinical consensus document is not intended as a comprehensive overview of the topic. It addresses several important practical considerations for intensivists in the care of the critically ill patient with DC, including: end points of resuscitation, ascites management and avoidance of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (PPCD), gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis, management of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and nutritional support (recommendations summarized in table 1).

### Stress-ulcer prophylaxis for general medical patients: a review of the evidence [^116t4Ppv]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Gastric stress ulceration and bleeding are common occurrences in the critically ill and prophylactic acid-suppression is used almost universally in this population. Evidence suggests that general medical patients hospitalized outside of the intensive care unit often receive similar therapy.

Purpose

To determine how frequently general medical patients are prescribed stress ulcer prophylaxis and what evidence exists for doing so.

Data Source

The MEDLINE database (1966 to October 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (4th Quarter 2005), and the bibliographies of selected articles.

Study Selection

Studies that contained significant data about either the frequency of use of stress ulcer prophylaxis in general medical patients or gastrointestinal bleeding outcomes in patients given prophylaxis.

Data Extraction

The primary author extracted prevalence and outcome data.

Data Synthesis

Descriptive studies suggest that 20–25% of general medical patients receive acid suppression for stress ulcer prophylaxis in the absence of presumed (but not established) risk factors for bleeding. Only two randomized, controlled trials evaluated the effects of prophylaxis in this population. The first found a reduction in clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding from 6% (3 of 48) with placebo to zero (n = 52) with magaldrate. The second found a reduction in clinically significant bleeding from 3% (2 of 70) with sucralfate to zero (n = 74) with cimetidine.

Conclusion

A significant number of general medical patients are prescribed acid-suppressive therapy for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The literature provides only sparse guidance on this issue with two randomized trials showing a possible benefit for prophylaxis. Further study is needed.

### Timely cessation of proton pump inhibitors in critically ill patients impacts morbidity and mortality: a propensity score-matched cohort study [^112FUnqZ]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: Does unnecessary long-term continuation of newly initiated stress ulcer prophylaxis in the ICU impact on morbidity and mortality after hospital discharge?

Findings: This retrospective cohort study shows that a continued proton pump inhibitor therapy without indication after hospital discharge in former critically ill patients is frequent and associated with increased morbidity, higher 1-year rehospitalization rate and lower 2-year survival.

Meaning: To avoid potentially harmful overtreatment with proton pump inhibitors in previously critically ill patients, intensivists should ensure timely cessation of an only temporarily indicated pump inhibitor therapy.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most commonly prescribed medications, usually with a short-term indication and a recommended duration of less than 8 weeks. A major short-term indication is stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP), especially in ICUs, where certain critically ill patients are at increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Although there is controversy about which patients in the ICU benefit from SUP, the latter is currently initiated in up to 90% of all critically ill patients. However, regardless of the debate on which ICU patients should receive PPI therapy, its timely cessation once the indication has expired is of utmost importance since PPI therapies not only result in an economic burden but may also evoke serious side effects. Greater risk of clostridium difficile infection, gastritis, pneumonia, cardiovascular events, chronic renal failure, greater frequency of various neoplasms, possibly malabsorption disorders evoking vitamin B12 deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia are specific predescribed side effects of a long-term PPI therapy. Even an increased risk of mortality has been observed in retrospective studies.

### Stress ulcer prophylaxis versus placebo or no prophylaxis in critically ill patients. A systematic review of randomised clinical trials with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^114TbAHe]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the effects of stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) versus placebo or no prophylaxis on all-cause mortality, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and hospital-acquired pneumonia in adult critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Methods

We performed a systematic review using meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA). Eligible trials were randomised clinical trials comparing proton pump inhibitors or histamine 2 receptor antagonists with either placebo or no prophylaxis. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. The Cochrane Collaboration methodology was used. Risk ratios/relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. The predefined outcome measures were all-cause mortality, GI bleeding, and hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Results

Twenty trials (n = 1,971) were included; all were judged as having a high risk of bias. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality (fixed effect: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.84–1.20; P = 0.87; I(2) = 0%) or hospital-acquired pneumonia (random effects: RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.86–1.78; P = 0.28; I(2) = 19%) between SUP patients and the no prophylaxis/placebo patients. These findings were confirmed in the TSA. With respect to GI bleeding, a statistically significant difference was found in the conventional meta-analysis (random effects: RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28–0.68; P = 0.01; I(2) = 48%); however, TSA (TSA adjusted 95% CI 0.18–1.11) and subgroup analyses could not confirm this finding.

Conclusions

This systematic review using meta-analysis and TSA demonstrated that both the quality and the quantity of evidence supporting the use of SUP in adult ICU patients is low. Consequently, large randomised clinical trials are warranted.

### Outcomes of prophylactic pantoprazole in adult intensive care unit patients receiving dialysis: results of a randomized trial [^115SLJBd]. American Journal of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) are considered at high risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) is often prescribed. We aimed to assess the incidence of GI bleeding and effects of SUP in these patients.

Methods

We assessed GI bleeding in ICU patients receiving RRT at baseline (and at any time in the ICU) and effects of prophylactic pantoprazole versus placebo in the international SUP in the ICU (SUP-ICU) trial. All analyses were conducted according to a published protocol and statistical analysis plan.

Results

Data of 3,291 acutely admitted adult ICU patients with one or more risk factors for GI bleeding randomized to pantoprazole or placebo intravenously once daily during ICU stay (until ICU discharge, death, or a maximum of 90 days) were analyzed. Some 20 out of 258 (7.8%, 95% CI 4.5–11.1%) and 52 out of 568 (9.2%, 95% CI 6.8–11.6%) of the patients receiving RRT at baseline and at any time in ICU, respectively, developed clinically important GI bleeding in the ICU. We did not observe statistically significant differences in the intervention effect (pantoprazole vs. placebo) in the proportion of patients with clinically important GI bleeding, clinically important events, infectious adverse events, use of interventions to stop GI bleeding, or 90-day mortality in patients with versus without RRT at baseline.

Conclusions

In adult ICU patients receiving RRT at baseline, we observed high incidences of clinically important GI bleeding, but did not observe effects of pantoprazole versus placebo in this subgroup.

### Efficacy and safety of proton pump inhibitors for stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^114DwKKw]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Study selection

Studies were eligible if: (1) the study design was an RCT; (2) the population involved adult critically ill patients in the ICU; (3) the intervention group received a PPI (either parenteral or enteral), regardless of the dose, frequency, or duration; (4) the control group received an H2RA, either parenteral or enteral, regardless of the dose, frequency, or duration; and (5) the outcomes included all or any of the following: clinically important GI bleeding; overt upper GI bleeding; pneumonia; mortality, ICU length of stay, and/or Clostridium difficile infection.

Search strategy

We updated our previous systematic review and searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, ACPJC, and International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP) from March 2012 through November 2015. Our search strategy is detailed in Additional file 1: Tables S3-S5. We screened citations of all new potentially eligible articles without language or publication date restrictions. We conducted an electronic search of conference proceedings via a website provided by McMaster University. Two reviewers (FA and EB) screened titles and abstracts to identify articles for full review, and evaluated the full text of potentially eligible studies. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by consensus, and if necessary, consultation with a third reviewer (WA).

Data extraction

Two reviewers (FA and EB) independently extracted pertinent data from all new studies utilizing a pre-designed data abstraction form. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus. We contacted study authors for missing or unclear information.

Risk of bias assessment

Two reviewers (FA and EB) independently examined eligible trials for risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. For each included trial, we judged articles as having low, unclear, or high risk of bias for the domains of adequate sequence generation, allocation sequence concealment, blinding for objective outcomes, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and for other bias. The overall risk of bias for each trial included was categorized as low if the risk of bias was low in all domains, unclear if the risk of bias was unclear in at least one domain and with no high risk of bias domain, or high if the risk of bias was high in at least one domain. We resolved disagreements by discussion and consensus.

### Stress ulcer prophylaxis in intensive care unit patients receiving enteral nutrition: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116k97WJ]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, based on available data, our results demonstrate that in ICU patients receiving EN, pharmacologic SUP offered no beneficial effect on the incidence of GI bleeding and other clinically important outcomes. Large-scale, well-designed RCTs will be needed to confirm our findings.

Key messages

In patients receiving EN in the ICU, pharmacologic SUP showed no beneficial effect on GI bleeding, overall mortality, Clostridium difficile infection, length of stay in the ICU or duration of mechanical ventilation, but was associated with an increased incidence of HAP.
Further larger adequately powered RCTs with rigorous definitions and designs are warranted to confirm our results.

Key messages

- The evidence base for the effectiveness of SDD is strong but SDD will not be more widely implemented without further supportive evidence.

- Participants believe that further clinical research in this area needs to have significantly greater validity and generalisability.

- Further research must include monitoring of antibiotic resistance rates before, during and after the trial.

- SDD was not seen as a high priority and this could limit interest in further research.

### Surgical and procedural antibiotic prophylaxis in the surgical ICU: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^1116GTkE]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The use of prophylactic measures, including perioperative antibiotics, for the prevention of surgical site infections is a standard of care across surgical specialties. Unfortunately, the routine guidelines used for routine procedures do not always account for many of the factors encountered with urgent/emergent operations and critically ill or high-risk patients. This clinical consensus document created by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Critical Care Committee is one of a three-part series and reviews surgical and procedural antibiotic prophylaxis in the surgical intensive care unit. The purpose of this clinical consensus document is to provide practical recommendations, based on expert opinion, to assist intensive care providers with decision-making for surgical prophylaxis. We specifically evaluate the current state of periprocedural antibiotic management of external ventricular drains, orthopedic operations (closed and open fractures, silver dressings, local, antimicrobial adjuncts, spine surgery, subfascial drains), abdominal operations (bowel injury and open abdomen), and bedside procedures (thoracostomy tube, gastrostomy tube, tracheostomy).

### Stress-related mucosal disease in the critically ill patient [^114mL3uX]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Bleeding from stress-related mucosal disease in critically ill patients remains an important clinical management issue. Although only a small proportion (1–6%) of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) will bleed, a substantial proportion exhibit clinical risk factors (mechanical ventilation for > 48 h and a coagulopathy) that predict an increased risk of bleeding. Furthermore, upper gastrointestinal mucosal lesions can be found in 75–100% of patients in ICUs. Although uncommon, stress-ulcer bleeding is a severe complication with an estimated mortality of 40–50%, mostly from decompensating an underlying condition or multiorgan failure. Although the vast majority of patients in ICUs receive stress-ulcer prophylaxis, largely with PPIs, some controversy surrounds their efficacy and safety. Indeed, no single trial has shown that stress-ulcer prophylaxis reduces mortality. Some reports suggest that the use of PPIs increases the risk of nosocomial infections. However, several meta-analyses and cost-effectiveness studies suggest PPIs to be more clinically effective and cost-effective than histamine-2 receptor antagonists, without considerable increases in nosocomial pneumonia. To help clinicians use the most appropriate strategy for treatment of patients in the ICU, this Review presents the latest information on all aspects of stress-related mucosal disease.

### Critical care management of the patient with pharmaceutical poisoning [^111YDGPR]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Poisonings account for up to 10% of admissions to intensive care units and represent a common yet complex challenge in critical care. While most patients recover with supportive care alone, a significant proportion require targeted interventions and advanced organ support. This state-of-the-art review provides a practical, evidence-based guide to manage pharmaceutical poisoning in the intensive care unit, with emphasis on real-world applicability for intensivists. It highlights toxicant-specific considerations for early resuscitation, structured by the ABCDE approach. Essential principles of the diagnostic workup are also summarized. In addition, the review offers actionable guidance on when and how to escalate care, moving from supportive measures to specific interventions including gastrointestinal decontamination, extracorporeal toxicant elimination, antidote therapy, and rescue strategies such as intravenous lipid emulsion and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Key algorithms and decision pathways-such as the diagnostic evaluation, ABCDE-based stabilization, gastrointestinal decontamination, and extracorporeal elimination approaches-are presented with visually structured figures.

### Clinical stakeholders' opinions on the use of selective decontamination of the digestive tract in critically ill patients in intensive care units: an international Delphi study [^113X4Sur]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) is a prophylactic antibiotic regimen that is not widely used in practice. We aimed to describe the opinions of key 'stakeholders' about the validity of the existing evidence base, likely consequences of implementation, relative importance of their opinions in influencing overall practice, likely barriers to implementation and perceptions of the requirement for further research to inform the decision about whether to embark on a further large randomised controlled trial.

Methods

This was a Delphi study informed by comprehensive framework of possible determinants of health professionals' behaviour to study Critical Care practice in four countries. There were four key stakeholder participant groups including ICU physicians, pharmacists, clinical leads, and clinical microbiologists/ infectious disease physicians. Round one comprised participant interviews and Rounds two and three were online questionnaires using Delphi method.

Results

In this study, 141 participants were recruited of whom 82% were retained. Participants rated themselves as knowledgeable about SDD. Antibiotic resistance was identified as the most important issue. SDD was seen as a low clinical priority but few participants reported strong opposition. There was moderate agreement that research to date has not adequately addressed concerns about antibiotic resistance and lacks generalizability. Participants indicated equipoise with regard to benefits and harms of SDD, and indicated strong support for a further randomised trial.

Conclusions

Clinicians have clinical equipoise about the effectiveness of SDD. Future research requires longer follow up to assess antibiotic resistance as well as greater validity/generalizability to provide definitive answers on the effectiveness of decontamination and effects on antibiotic resistance. SDD was regarded as not being a high clinical priority, which may limit future trial participation. These results have identified that further large randomised controlled trial of SDD in critical care is both warranted and appropriate.

### Stress prophylaxis in intensive care unit patients and the role of enteral nutrition [^111nSBxe]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Use of acid-suppressive therapy (AST) to prevent stress gastropathy in the intensive care unit has grown rapidly over the past 20 years. The primary indications for such use of AST include need for mechanical ventilation, overt gastrointestinal bleeding, severe burn, and head trauma. Despite this limited list of indications, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) often are overprescribed for purposes of stress prophylaxis. Decreased mucosal blood flow with subsequent tissue ischemia is thought to be the mechanism responsible for stress-induced gastropathy. Subsequent activation of inflammatory and vasoconstrictive mediators determines the severity of the gastropathy. Numerous basic science studies suggest that enteral nutrition (EN) can improve mucosal blood flow and reverse the generation of these inflammatory mediators. Clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of EN vs acid-suppressive medications, however, have shown variable results (and there are no randomized controlled trials to date). In hypersecretory states (such as head trauma and burns), AST should be given, even in patients who are tolerating EN. In the absence of a hypersecretory state, pharmacologic AST may be avoided or discontinued in patients who are tolerating EN. Stress prophylaxis medications also should be discontinued in patients who do not have a clear indication for their use. Overt bleeding in a patient receiving EN for stress prophylaxis should prompt the initiation of a PPI. Randomized controlled studies investigating the efficacy of EN for stress ulcer prophylaxis are needed. Protocols should be developed to alert healthcare teams to consider discontinuation of AST, especially when tolerance of EN is achieved.

### Stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors or histamin-2 receptor antagonists in adult intensive care patients: a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^111qx3Pd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Most intensive care unit (ICU) patients receive stress ulcer prophylaxis. We present updated evidence on the effects of prophylactic proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) versus placebo/no prophylaxis on patient-important outcomes in adult ICU patients.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA) of randomised clinical trials assessing the effects of PPI/H2RA versus placebo/no prophylaxis on mortality, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, serious adverse events (SAEs), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), myocardial ischemia, pneumonia, and Clostridium (Cl.) difficile enteritis in ICU patients.

Results

We identified 42 trials randomising 6899 ICU patients; 3 had overall low risk of bias. We did not find an effect of stress ulcer prophylaxis on mortality [relative risk 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94–1.14; TSA-adjusted CI 0.94–1.14], but the occurrence of any GI bleeding was reduced as compared with placebo/no prophylaxis (0.60, 95% CI 0.47–0.77; TSA-adjusted CI 0.36–1.00). The conventional meta-analysis indicated that clinically important GI bleeding was reduced (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.48–0.81), but the TSA-adjusted CI 0.35–1.13 indicated lack of firm evidence. The effects of stress ulcer prophylaxis on SAEs, HRQoL, pneumonia, myocardial ischemia and Cl. difficile enteritis are uncertain.

Conclusions

In this updated systematic review, we were able to refute a relative change of 20% of mortality. The occurrence of GI bleeding was reduced, but we lack firm evidence for a reduction in clinically important GI bleeding. The effects on SAEs, HRQoL, pneumonia, myocardial ischemia and Cl. difficile enteritis remain inconclusive.

### Effectiveness of a pharmacist-led intervention to reduce acid suppression therapy for stress ulcer prophylaxis in ICUs in China: a multicenter, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized controlled trial [^115itauH]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The study Inappropriate Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis in ICU was published by Hailong Li and colleagues in 2025 in the journal Crit Care Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Stress ulcer, Peptic ulcer disease, Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, Sepsis and septic shock and Perioperative management in cardiac surgery. In the Inappropriate Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis in ICU study, the trial question was: what is the role of pharmacist-led intervention in ICU patients in reducing overuse stress ulcer prophylaxis? In the Inappropriate Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis in ICU study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the Inappropriate Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis in ICU study, the population was: 2199 patients (788 female, 1411 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis in the ICU. The key exclusion criteria were prespecified indications for acid suppression therapy; GERD; peptic ulcer; MALT lymphoma; erosive esophagitis; gastroenteritis melanoma; eosinophilic esophagitis; Barrett's esophagitis; H. pylori infection. In the Inappropriate Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis in ICU study, the interventions were: n = 1181 pharmacist-led intervention (multifaceted intervention in addition to usual care given by pharmacists) n = 1018 usual care (ward rounds, monthly retrospective prescription reviews, and medication recommendations to physicians given by pharmacists). In the Inappropriate Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis in ICU study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in stress ulcer prophylaxis drugs use (45.5% vs. 49.5%; OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.96). In the Inappropriate Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis in ICU study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in overt gastrointestinal bleeding (3.7% vs. 4%; OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.85) No significant difference in clinically important bleeding (1.1% vs. 0.8%; OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.74) No significant difference in median length of ICU stay (100 hours vs. 100 hours; MD -0.061, 95% CI -0.55 to 0.42). In the Inappropriate Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis in ICU study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in hospital-acquired pneumonia, death, C. difficile infection. In the Inappropriate Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis in ICU study, the conclusion was: in adult patients receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis in the ICU, pharmacist-led intervention was superior to usual care with respect to stress ulcer prophylaxis drugs use.

### Proton pump inhibitors versus histamine-2-receptor antagonists for stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill patients: a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^111xr4xu]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Goals and Background

Stress ulcer prophylaxis has been shown to lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) rates. Various agents have been studied, and the optimal strategy continues to be contested. This study evaluates the efficacy between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2-receptor antagonists. Small sample sizes and methodology flaws limited prior studies.

Study

A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials reporting the use of PPI and histamine-2-receptor antagonist reporting rates of GIB and standardized intensive care outcomes. Risk ratios (RR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A trial sequential analysis was performed to guard against errors.

Results

A total of 14 randomized controlled trials of 28,526 patients with a mean age of 57.83 ± 17.35 years and 30.82% females. In our pooled analysis, PPI outperformed its comparator (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.57–0.82) in clinically significant GIB. PPI re-demonstrated significant reduction in overt GIB (RR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.39–0.97). No differences between groups was noted toward all-cause mortality (RR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.00–1.10) or incidence of pneumonia (RR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.82–1.51). Duration of stay (SMD: 0.07; 95% CI: -0.04–0.17) and ventilator days (SMD: 0.01; 95% CI: -0.01–0.04) were indifferent between the groups.

Conclusions

Among critically ill patients, PPI was associated with reduced clinically significant or overt GIB. No differences in pneumonia were seen with the use of either agent. Trial sequential analysis for clinically significant GIB ruled out the risk for false-positive results, and thereby it is unlikely that future trials will affect our conclusions.

### Effectiveness of a pharmacist-led intervention to reduce acid suppression therapy for stress ulcer prophylaxis in ICUs in China: a multicenter, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized controlled trial [^114mSNnM]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: What is the effectiveness of a pharmacist-led intervention in improving the rational use of stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) compared with the usual care for adult patients in Chinese ICUs.

Findings: This multicenter, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized controlled trial found that the pharmacist-led intervention reduced the use of SUP in the ICU, without significantly affecting the proportion of patients with overt gastrointestinal bleeding.

Meanings: The evidence-based intervention by pharmacists and the ICU-SUP pathway designed in this study can guide clinical assessment for the proportion of appropriate SUP in the ICU.

International guidelines have suggested acid suppressive therapy for stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) to prevent the potential progression of stress-related gastrointestinal mucosal damage to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in patients admitted to ICUs. Previous cohorts and before and after studies demonstrated that approximately three of four patients received SUP during their ICU stay, with no identifiable risk of stress ulcer in 14.4–42% of them. A study in China reported a 12.9% overall rate for upper GIB within 14 days among adult patients in neurocritical care, with 79.0% receiving SUP with acid suppression.

Common SUP agents include proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) for acid suppression therapy (AST). PPIs are likely more effective for preventing clinically important GIB than H2RAs (odds ratio [OR], 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20–0.73) and placebo (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.10–0.60) (all moderate quality evidence); however, their use may lead to an increased risk of pneumonia. Some uncertainty regarding the impact of SUP on mortality and other in-hospital morbidities remains. For patients with a low risk of GIB, the reduction in bleeding may be unimportant. Thus, SUP has very little impact on the absolute reduction in GIB. Further, the risk of acid suppression is likely to outweigh the benefits and leads to resource waste. Consequently, international organizations have called for the deprescription of PPIs in patients in the ICU.

### The efficacy and safety of proton pump inhibitors vs histamine-2 receptor antagonists for stress ulcer bleeding prophylaxis among critical care patients: a meta-analysis [^116tfDdU]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the efficacy and safety of proton pump inhibitors in comparison with histamine-2 receptor antagonists for stress-related upper gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis among critical care patients.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials that directly compare proton pump inhibitors with histamine-2 receptor antagonists in prevention of stress-related upper gastrointestinal bleeding in intensive care unit patients published before May 30, 2008.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently applied selection criteria, performed quality assessment, and extracted data. The primary outcome was the incidence of stress-related upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and the secondary outcome measures were the incidence of pneumonia and intensive care unit mortality.

Data Synthesis

The random effect model was used to estimate the pooled risk difference between two treatment arms irrespective of drug, dosage, and route of administration.

Results

We identified seven randomized, controlled trials with a total of 936 patients for planned comparison. The overall pooled risk difference (95% confidence interval; p value; I statistics) of stress-related upper gastrointestinal bleeding comparing proton pump inhibitors vs. histamine-2 receptor antagonists was -0.04 (95% confidence interval, -0.09–0.01; p = .08; I = 66%). In the sensitivity analysis, removing the Levy study significantly reduced the heterogeneity (from I = 66% to I = 26%) and shifted the overall risk difference closer to the null (pooled risk difference, -0.02; 95% confidence interval, -0.05–0.01; p = .19). There was no difference between proton pump inhibitors and histamine-2 receptor antagonists therapy in the risk of pneumonia and intensive care unit mortality, with pooled risk differences of 0.00 (95% confidence interval, -0.04–0.05; p = .86; I = 0%) and 0.02 (95% confidence interval, -0.04–0.08; p = .50; I = 0%), respectively.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis did not find strong evidence that proton pump inhibitors were different from histamine-2 receptor antagonists in terms of stress-related upper gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis, pneumonia, and mortality among patients admitted to intensive care units. Because of limited trial data, future well-designed and powerful randomized, clinical trials are warranted.

### Proton pump inhibitors for prophylaxis of nosocomial upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding: effect of standardized guidelines on prescribing practice… [^1157EnRR]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Nosocomial upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Gastric mucosal "stress ulcers" are frequently implicated as an underlying cause of nosocomial UGIB, and risk factors have been identified among patients in the intensive care unit. 1 Pharmacologic gastric acid suppression can provide effective prophylaxis against UGIB in at-risk ICU patients.
2. Proton pump inhibitors suppress gastric acid production at the level of the hydrogen/potassium–adenosine triphosphatase pathway and are widely prescribed for nosocomial UGIB prophylaxis. Proton pump inhibitors may be overused among non-ICU inpatients without risk factors for UGIB. 3–5 Moreover, PPIs prescribed for prophylactic purposes to inpatients may be continued unnecessarily at the time of hospital discharge. 3–6.

We introduced the guidelines to the medical house staff via oral presentation at a scheduled didactic conference. The guidelines were described in detail, and the house staff were notified that the guidelines would be implemented on the medical service on a 1-month trial basis. We asked the house staff to refer to the guidelines when considering the use of PPIs for nosocomial UGIB prophylaxis but to realize that the use of PPIs on a patient-by-patient basis should ultimately be left to individual clinical judgment. In univariate analysis, inpatient PPI use was associated with older age, longer length of hospital stay, and reported history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, or UGIB. In addition, outpatient use of PPIs, aspirin, clopidogrel, and glucocorticoids each predicted inpatient use of PPIs. The goal of this study was to assess PPI use for prophylactic purposes in a non-ICU setting.

By design, the study cohort excluded patients with an alternative indication for PPI therapy, specifically patients with an admitting diagnosis of gastrointestinal tract bleeding. In addition, the cohort excluded patients admitted to the general medical service from the ICU or medical step-down unit, as PPI therapy in these patients might reflect inadvertent continuation of stress ulcer prophylaxis initiated in the ICU among at-risk patients rather than de novo PPI prophylaxis in average-risk inpatients. Data suggest that such prescribing computerized decision support systems have the potential to alter physician behavior22 and might significantly enhance the effect of PPI prescribing guidelines among house staff.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis and upper… [^113RQCbd]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Should antibiotic prophylaxis be used for hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Evidence-Based Answer Antibiotics should be used for prophylaxis in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Prophylaxis reduces all-cause mortality by 21%, as well as bacterial infections and rebleeding. Evidence Summary A 2011 meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials involving 1, 241 patients compared different types of antibiotic therapy vs. no intervention, placebo, or another antibiotic in adults with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding, regardless of etiology of cirrhosis or severity of disease. 1 Antibiotics were administered alone or in combination, orally or intravenously, and included cephalosporins, quinolones, aminoglycosides, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and vancomycin. 2 Prophylactic intravenous ceftriaxone was administered to 88 of these patients at a dosage of 1 g immediately after endoscopy, then every 12 hours until discharge. Compared with the control group, the antibiotic group had a lower risk of bacterial infections, including bacteremia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections, and a lower risk of rebleeding. A subgroup analysis found that patients with decompensated cirrhosis in the antibiotic group had a lower in-hospital mortality rate, but cirrhotic patients overall did not.

### Nutrition support in the intensive care unit… [^111icjrf]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Figure. Flowchart for nutrition support services and tight glucose control in critically ill surgical intensive care unit patients with hyperglycemia. Administration of TGC should be managed by highly trained registered nurses and certified medical assistants. Nutrition support services should be led by physician-directed teams to deliver the highest quality of care. Although enteral nutrition is the preferred route of feeding for critically ill patients who require nutrition support therapy, 2 this article will focus on the use of total parenteral nutrition in those who are malnourished and unable to be fed through enteral means. It will also discuss the importance of early and adequate feeding and tight glucose control regardless of the method used to provide alimentation.

After stratifying for nutritional status, data showed that TPN put mildly and moderately malnourished patients at greater risk for hyperglycemia, infections, and subsequent complications that would increase morbidity and mortality. In severely malnourished patients, who only accounted for 5% of the cohort, the frequency of infections did not increase and there was a significant reduction in noninfective sequelae. Based on these outcomes, the authors concluded that TPN should be limited to severely malnourished patients.
8. The McCowen et al study underscored the need for more aggressive glucose control in the ICU. Hyperglycemia, which induces a state of oxidative stress and cytokine activation, 17 is a risk factor for adverse outcomes in acutely ill patients. Close attention to glucose control as well as early and adequate feeding are critical factors in ICU nutrition support.

Both the 2001 Van den Berghe study18 and high-quality data from a meta-analysis of all intention-to-treat comparisons of enteral nutrition and PN in ICU patients12 show a significant reduction in mortality with early and adequate feeding, with no difference in mortality related to the route of feeding. Such evidence indicates that early feeding should be the norm in critically ill patients and an essential component of any evaluation of TGC control in those patients. 13 A potential increase in the risk of infection notwithstanding, PN with TGC should be considered the desirable alternative to late enteral nutrition or no feeding.
26. Subsequent studies, in which enteral nutrition was administered to most patients, were characterized by an increased rate of hypoglycemia, an outcome that leaves the ideal combination of feeding and glucose control protocols open to further debate. 19, 20, 25.
