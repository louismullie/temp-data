## Question

A 68-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 (estimated GFR 28 mL/min/1.73 m²) presents to the cardiology clinic with stable angina. He has no history of prior myocardial infarction or revascularization. His recent stress test shows moderate reversible ischemia in the lateral wall, but no evidence of large areas of ischemia. Coronary CT angiography suggests multivessel coronary artery disease with a SYNTAX score of 26. The cardiology team is considering options for further management, including whether to proceed with invasive coronary angiography, and if revascularization is needed, which modality to choose.

Based on current ERBP guidelines, what is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient, specifically regarding the use of coronary angiography and the choice of revascularization strategy if indicated? Justify your answer according to the recommendations.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate next step in managing a 68-year-old man with type 2 diabetes, CKD stage 4, stable angina, moderate ischemia on stress testing, and multivessel CAD with a SYNTAX score of 26, specifically regarding whether to proceed with invasive coronary angiography and, if revascularization is indicated, which modality to choose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's risk profile and how CKD modifies decision-making. Then, I should verify what ERBP says about angiography in CKD and whether contrast nephropathy should deter an invasive strategy. Next, I will examine indications for revascularization in stable CAD with moderate ischemia and how diabetes shifts the balance. After that, I should review SYNTAX-guided modality selection and the Heart Team process. Finally, I will integrate CKD-specific considerations, including contrast risk mitigation and the role of intensive medical therapy, and synthesize a practical recommendation with contingencies.

> Let me first confirm the risk profile and its implications. Diabetes plus CKD stage 4 confers very high cardiovascular risk and a substantial burden of diffuse, calcified disease, which increases procedural complexity and adverse event rates; importantly, in pooled randomized data, mortality with PCI exceeds that with CABG in diabetics with multivessel disease, underscoring the need for careful modality selection and complete revascularization when feasible [^0dd46160] [^54b4b1c5].

> Wait, let me verify the ERBP stance on angiography in CKD. The ERBP guideline explicitly advises not to omit coronary angiography solely to avoid contrast-related kidney injury when angiography is indicated; this means CKD alone is not a reason to avoid diagnostic angiography if the clinical indication is present, which it is here given stable angina with documented ischemia and multivessel disease on CCTA [^10e8389c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about revascularization just yet. I need to check whether the ischemia burden and anatomy meet thresholds that favor revascularization over medical therapy. The stress test shows moderate ischemia, not a large area, and there is no mention of left main or proximal LAD disease; ERBP recommends optimal medical therapy as preferred in stable CAD unless there are large areas of ischemia or significant left main/proximal LAD lesions, so initial conservative therapy is reasonable if symptoms are controlled and there is no high-risk anatomy [^9dcaf583].

> But wait, what if the SYNTAX score of 26 changes the calculus? I should confirm how guidelines interpret SYNTAX in this context. Contemporary guidelines endorse using SYNTAX to assess complexity in multivessel CAD, and a score around 26 sits in the intermediate range where equipoise between PCI and CABG exists; however, in diabetes, FREEDOM and subsequent analyses show CABG confers lower long-term mortality than PCI, and this advantage persists across SYNTAX strata, so diabetes shifts the balance toward CABG when anatomy is suitable and surgical risk acceptable [^00ff130c] [^54b4b1c5] [^0dd46160].

> I need to ensure we apply the Heart Team framework correctly. ACC/AHA/SCAI and ESC documents emphasize a multidisciplinary Heart Team to integrate anatomy, comorbidities, and patient preferences; given CKD stage 4, diabetes, and multivessel disease, the team should weigh surgical risk (STS-PROM), PCI feasibility including the likelihood of complete revascularization, and the patient's tolerance for dual antiplatelet therapy, while also discussing that CABG with a LIMA graft to the LAD reduces mortality and repeat revascularization in diabetics [^fd0dff2a] [^69f435a9] [^be3dd815].

> Let me consider CKD-specific procedural risks and mitigation. Contrast nephropathy risk is real at eGFR 28, but it is not an absolute contraindication; strategies include minimizing contrast volume, preferring radial access, ensuring hydration, and timing procedures thoughtfully. KDIGO supports an initial conservative approach in stable ischemic heart disease, but allows invasive strategies when symptoms are unacceptable, LV dysfunction is present, or left main disease is suspected, which reinforces that angiography remains appropriate if symptoms persist or anatomy is high risk [^37f4a655] [^7043ccff] [^0f3fa3fc].

> I should double-check the role of functional assessment before committing to multivessel PCI. If angiography reveals intermediate lesions, FFR or iFR should guide which lesions to treat to avoid unnecessary stenting; this is particularly relevant in CKD where incomplete revascularization worsens outcomes, and functional SYNTAX scoring can reclassify risk and refine the PCI versus CABG decision when combined with clinical variables in SYNTAX Score II [^7895e770] [^9de94b95] [^84c6b779].

> Let me synthesize the decision pathway. First, proceed with invasive coronary angiography because the indication is strong, CKD does not preclude it, and definitive anatomy is needed to plan revascularization. Second, if angiography confirms multivessel disease without left main or high SYNTAX complexity and the patient is a suitable surgical candidate, CABG is preferred over PCI given diabetes and the mortality advantage seen in FREEDOM and pooled analyses. Third, if surgical risk is prohibitive or the patient declines surgery, then PCI with a plan for as-complete-as-possible revascularization using physiology and contemporary techniques is reasonable, acknowledging higher event rates and the importance of DAPT adherence. Fourth, if angiography shows limited disease amenable to medical therapy and symptoms are controlled, intensive medical management remains appropriate, with close follow-up and reassessment of symptoms and ischemia [^10e8389c] [^54b4b1c5] [^0dd46160] [^37f4a655].

> Final recommendation: Proceed with invasive coronary angiography to define anatomy and guide therapy. If revascularization is indicated and the patient is a suitable surgical candidate, CABG is the preferred strategy given diabetes and multivessel disease. If surgery is not feasible or is declined, perform PCI with a physiology-guided, completeness-focused approach using radial access and minimal contrast, and ensure robust secondary prevention and DAPT planning. Throughout, use a Heart Team discussion to align anatomy, comorbidities, and patient preferences, and do not withhold angiography solely due to CKD [^10e8389c] [^54b4b1c5] [^0f3fa3fc] [^fd0dff2a].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **proceed with invasive coronary angiography** [^10e8389c] because the patient has stable angina with documented ischemia and multivessel CAD on CCTA, and ERBP advises not to avoid angiography solely due to CKD risk [^10e8389c]. If revascularization is indicated, **CABG is preferred over PCI** [^54b4b1c5] given diabetes, multivessel disease, and intermediate SYNTAX complexity, as CABG reduces mortality and repeat revascularization in this setting [^0dd46160]. Use a Heart Team [^fd0dff2a] to individualize decisions, and apply contrast nephropathy prevention strategies [^notfound].

---

## Indications for invasive coronary angiography

Invasive coronary angiography is indicated in patients with stable angina when:

- Noninvasive testing demonstrates moderate-to-severe ischemia or multivessel disease [^notfound].
- Coronary anatomy must be defined to guide revascularization [^notfound].
- Symptoms persist despite optimal medical therapy [^3241952d].

ERBP specifically recommends **not avoiding angiography solely due to CKD risk** [^10e8389c] when it is otherwise indicated, as the benefits outweigh the risks with appropriate precautions.

---

## Revascularization strategy: CABG vs. PCI

The choice between CABG and PCI depends on clinical presentation, coronary anatomy, and comorbidities. In patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD, **CABG is generally preferred** over PCI because of superior long-term outcomes, particularly in reducing mortality and repeat revascularization [^54b4b1c5] [^0dd46160].

---

### Evidence supporting CABG in diabetes and multivessel CAD

- The FREEDOM trial demonstrated that CABG significantly reduced all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization compared with PCI in patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD [^notfound].
- The SYNTAX trial showed that in patients with complex multivessel disease (SYNTAX score > 22), CABG was associated with lower rates of major adverse cardiac events than PCI [^notfound].
- A pooled analysis of randomized trials confirmed a mortality benefit of CABG over PCI in patients with diabetes and multivessel disease [^0dd46160].

---

### Role of SYNTAX score in decision-making

The SYNTAX score quantifies coronary lesion complexity and guides revascularization strategy. A SYNTAX score of 26 indicates **intermediate complexity**, in which CABG is generally favored over PCI, particularly in patients with diabetes [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations in CKD stage 4

CKD stage 4 significantly increases cardiovascular risk and affects revascularization decisions. ERBP and KDIGO emphasize **individualized risk–benefit assessment** and recommend:

- Not withholding indicated angiography solely due to CKD risk [^10e8389c].
- Using contrast nephropathy prevention strategies (hydration, minimizing contrast volume, preferential use of radial access) [^notfound].
- Considering the patient's preferences, life expectancy, and comorbidities in shared decision-making [^fd0dff2a].

---

## Recommended management plan

Based on current guidelines and evidence, the following management plan is recommended:

| **Step** | **Recommended action** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Proceed with invasive coronary angiography | - Define coronary anatomy <br/> - Guide revascularization <br/> - Do not avoid due to CKD risk [^10e8389c] |
| 2 | Heart Team evaluation | - Multidisciplinary assessment <br/> - Integrate clinical and anatomical factors <br/> - Align with patient preferences [^fd0dff2a] |
| 3 | If revascularization is indicated, prefer CABG over PCI | - Superior long-term outcomes in diabetes and multivessel CAD <br/> - SYNTAX score of 26 supports CABG [^54b4b1c5] [^0dd46160] |
| 4 | Implement contrast nephropathy prevention strategies | Reduce risk of AKI in CKD stage 4 [^notfound] |
| 5 | Continue optimal medical therapy | - Aggressive risk factor control <br/> - Glycemic management <br/> - Antiplatelet therapy as indicated [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate next step is to **proceed with invasive coronary angiography** [^10e8389c] to define coronary anatomy and guide revascularization. If revascularization is indicated, **CABG is preferred over PCI** [^54b4b1c5] given the patient's diabetes, multivessel disease, and intermediate SYNTAX score, as CABG offers superior long-term outcomes in this population [^0dd46160]. Use a Heart Team approach [^fd0dff2a] and apply contrast nephropathy prevention strategies to mitigate CKD-related risks [^notfound].

ACC/AHA/SCAI 2021 coronary revascularization — top 10 take-home messages (items 6–10) note that radial artery access is recommended in patients undergoing percutaneous intervention who have acute coronary syndromes or stable ischemic heart disease to reduce bleeding and vascular complications compared with a femoral approach, and patients with acute coronary syndromes benefit from a reduction in mortality rate with this approach; a short duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous revascularization in patients with stable ischemic heart disease is reasonable to reduce bleeding risk, and after consideration of recurrent ischemia and bleeding risks, select patients may safely transition to P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy and stop aspirin after 1 to 3 months of dual antiplatelet therapy; for ST–segment–elevation myocardial infarction, staged percutaneous intervention of a significantly stenosed nonculprit artery is recommended in select patients to improve outcomes, whereas percutaneous intervention of the nonculprit artery at the time of primary percutaneous coronary intervention is less clear and may be considered in stable patients with uncomplicated revascularization of the culprit artery, low-complexity nonculprit artery disease, and normal renal function, and in contrast, intervention of the nonculprit artery can be harmful in patients in cardiogenic shock; in patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD, use of a Heart Team approach optimizes decisions, patients with diabetes who have triple-vessel disease should undergo surgical revascularization, and percutaneous coronary intervention may be considered if they are poor candidates for surgery; and for surgical revascularization of CAD, treatment decisions should include calculating Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, while the usefulness of the SYNTAX score in treatment decisions is less clear because of interobserver variability and absence of clinical variables.

### Optimal revascularization for complex coronary artery disease [^bc11ada6]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Patients with major or symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) commonly undergo revascularization — either with CABG surgery, which has been the mainstay of revascularization for more than half a century, or with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which has become the more-commonly used strategy in the past decade. PCI has been tested in more randomized clinical trials than any other procedure in contemporary practice. In general, PCI is the preferred option for treating patients with simple coronary artery lesions and CABG surgery remains the standard of care for patients with complex CAD. Technical advancements in PCI and CABG surgery make comparisons of historical data for these strategies difficult. In this Review, we evaluate the evidence-based use of PCI and CABG surgery in treating patients with multivessel and unprotected left main stem disease and for specific patient groups, including those with diabetes mellitus, chronic heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. Finally, we highlight the available tools to aid decision-making, including clinical guidelines, risk scoring systems, and the role of the 'heart team'.

Revascularization: PCI versus CABG — In patients with chronic coronary disease (CCD) who require revascularization for significant left main involvement associated with high-complexity coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is recommended in preference to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to improve survival. In CCD requiring revascularization for multivessel CAD with complex and diffuse disease (eg, SYNTAX score > 33), it is reasonable to choose CABG over PCI to improve survival. In CCD patients who are appropriate for revascularization but are poor candidates for surgery, it is reasonable to choose PCI over CABG to improve symptoms and reduce MACE. In CCD with diabetes and multivessel CAD involving the left anterior descending artery where patients are appropriate candidates for CABG, CABG (with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery) is recommended in preference to PCI to reduce mortality and repeat revascularizations. In CCD with diabetes who have left main stenosis and low- or intermediate-complexity CAD (eg, SYNTAX score ≤ 33), PCI may be considered as an alternative to CABG to reduce MACE.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^3301d218]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Evaluation for coronary heart disease — Cardiac ischemia is a predominant form of CVD leading to major complications and death in people with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD), and coronary artery revascularization procedures are warranted in some patients. To identify appropriate candidates, further diagnostic testing should be performed based on specific clinical indications (Table 2). The recommendations from the ADA and AHA apply to people with diabetes in general, and no guidelines have been developed for the subset of patients with diabetes and CKD; in the opinion of the Work Group, these recommendations reasonably can be extrapolated to most patients who have both diabetes and CKD stages 1 to 4.

### Evaluating the appropriate use criteria for coronary revascularization in stable ischemic heart disease using randomized data from the ISCHEMIA trial [^e0225c20]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The appropriate use criteria for revascularization of stable ischemic heart disease have not been evaluated using randomized data. Using data from the randomized ISCHEMIA trial (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches; July 2012 to January 2018, 37 countries), the health status benefits of an invasive strategy over a conservative one were examined within appropriate use criteria scenarios.

Methods

Among 1833 participants mapped to 36 appropriate use criteria scenarios, symptom status was assessed using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire-7 at 1 year for each scenario and for each of the 6 patient characteristics used to define the scenarios. Coronary anatomy and SYNTAX(Synergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with Taxus and cardiac surgery) scores were measured using coronary computed tomography angiography. Treatment effects are expressed as an odds ratio for a better health status outcome with an invasive versus conservative treatment strategy using Bayesian hierarchical proportional odds models. Differences in the primary clinical outcome were similarly examined.

Results

The mean age was 63 years, 81% were male, and 71% were White. Diabetes was present in 28% and multivessel disease in 51%. Most clinical scenarios favored invasive for better 1-year health status. The benefit of an invasive strategy on Seattle Angina Questionnaire angina frequency scores was reduced for asymptomatic patients (odds ratio [95% credible interval], 1.16 [0.66–1.71] versus 2.26 [1.75–2.80]), as well as for those on no antianginal medications. Diabetes, number of diseased vessels, proximal left anterior descending coronary artery location, and SYNTAX score did not effectively identify patients with better health status after invasive treatment, and minimal differences in clinical events were observed.

Conclusions

Applying the randomization scheme from the ISCHEMIA trial to appropriate clinical scenarios revealed baseline symptoms and antianginal therapy to be the primary drivers of health status benefits from invasive management. Consideration should be given to reducing the patient characteristics collected to generate appropriateness ratings to improve the feasibility of future data collection.

### Multidisciplinary heart team approach for complex coronary artery disease: single center clinical presentation [^905c8cb7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background The Heart Team approach is ascribed a Class I recommendation in contemporary guidelines for revascularization of complex coronary artery disease. However, limited data are available regarding the decision-making and outcomes of patients based on this strategy. Methods and Results One hundred sixty-six high-risk coronary artery disease patients underwent Heart Team evaluation at a single institution between January 2015 and November 2018. We prospectively collected data on demographics, symptoms, Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality/Synergy Between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (STS-PROM/SYNTAX) scores, mode of revascularization, and outcomes. Mean age was 70.0 years; 122 (73.5%) patients were male. Prevalent comorbidities included diabetes mellitus (51.8%), peripheral artery disease (38.6%), atrial fibrillation (27.1%), end-stage renal disease on dialysis (13.3%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (21.7%). Eighty-seven (52.4%) patients had New York Heart Association III-IV and 112 (67.5%) had Canadian Cardiovascular Society III-IV symptomatology. Sixty-seven (40.4%) patients had left main and 118 (71.1%) had 3-vessel coronary artery disease. The median STS-PROM was 3.6% (interquartile range 1.9, 8.0) and SYNTAX score was 26 (interquartile range 20, 34). The median number of physicians per Heart Team meeting was 6 (interquartile range 5, 8). Seventy-nine (47.6%) and 49 (29.5%) patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting, respectively. With increasing STS-PROM (low, intermediate, high operative risk), coronary artery bypass graft was performed less often (47.9%, 18.5%, 15.2%) and optimal medical therapy was recommended more often (11.3%, 18.5%, 30.3%). There were no trends in recommendation for coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous coronary intervention, or optimal medical therapy by SYNTAX score tertiles. In-hospital and 30-day mortality was 3.9% and 4.8%, respectively. Conclusions Integrating a multidisciplinary Heart Team into institutional practice is feasible and provides a formalized approach to evaluating complex coronary artery disease patients. The comprehensive assessment of surgical, anatomical, and other risk scores using a decision aid may guide appropriate, evidence-based management within this team-based construct.

### Revascularization strategies and survival in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease [^f2a04ddb]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

We sought to assess real-world implementation of the guidelines in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) using a prospective national registry in Israel.

Methods

All consecutive patients with left main or 2- to 3-vessel CAD involving the proximal or mid left anterior descending artery were enrolled in a dedicated multicenter registry. Patients were managed at the discretion of the treating team at each hospital and were followed for 30 months.

Results

This registry included 1,064 patients, 55% treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and 45% with coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that chronic renal failure (odds ratio [OR], 2.43; p = 0.001) and prior myocardial infarction (OR, 1.7; p = 0.024) were associated with referral to PCI versus CABG, whereas male gender (OR, 2.27; p < 0.001), prior aspirin treatment (OR, 1.72; p = 0.005), diabetes mellitus (OR, 1.51; p = 0.007), 3-vessel CAD (OR, 3.45; p < 0.001) and SYNTAX score (SS) greater than 32 (OR, 10.0; p < 0.001) were associated with referral to CABG versus PCI. Each point increment in the SS was independently associated with a 9% greater likelihood of referral to CABG (p < 0.001). Survival analysis showed that mortality risk was lower among PCI patients less than 8 months after the procedure, and CABG was associated with a significant survival benefit thereafter.

Conclusions

We found good agreement with current guidelines regarding revascularization strategies in real-world patients with multivessel CAD. The SS was the main independent predictor associated with the choice of revascularization strategy. The time-dependent association between revascularization strategy and long-term survival should be incorporated in the risk assessment of this population.

Clinical Implications

While the ease and minimal morbidity of PCI have a strong appeal to patients, families, and some physicians, current clinical approaches to the treatment of the diabetic patient with multivessel disease may exceed scientific evidence. The 2011 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology PCI guideline update recommends a "Heart Team" approach, with the implicit understanding that each patient's case takes into account surgical and interventional risks, long‐term outcomes, and patient preferences. Based on the current study, CABG is preferred for the most favorable long‐term outcomes in high‐risk SYNTAX Score patients without high surgical risk. For patients with low‐risk and possibly intermediate‐risk SYNTAX Scores, PCI may be a reasonable primary strategy, given the early increased morbidity from surgery and the higher risk of stroke with comparable long‐term MACE. The preferred strategy in diabetic patients with high surgical risk requires further study.

Case example of the non-invasive and invasive assessment using the anatomical SYNTAX score and SYNTAX Score II. A 74-year-old man with a creatinine clearance 38 mL/min and left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% without history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or peripheral vascular disease. At the top, coronary computed tomography angiography shows three-vessel disease with a coronary narrowings located at the ostium and in the proximal segment of the right coronary artery; two narrowings located in the mid segment of the left anterior descending artery; and one additional narrowing in the proximal segment of the left circumflex artery involving the bifurcation with the first obtuse marginal coronary artery. Conventional angiography revealed also a three-vessel disease with one narrowing located at the proximal segment of the right coronary artery, one narrowing at the mid segment of the left anterior descending artery, and a bifurcation lesion involving the proximal segment of the left circumflex artery and the first obtuse marginal coronary artery. Each coronary narrowing was scored according to the anatomical SYNTAX score and the final anatomical SYNTAX score derived from each modality is shown. With both imaging modalities, the SYNTAX score II recommended either coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention based on a comparable predicted 4-year mortality. At the bottom, the non-invasive fractional flow reserve derived from coronary computed tomography angiography (FFR CT) is presented. The FFR CT showed that the lesions in the right coronary artery are not haemodynamically relevant, whereas the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery have haemodynamically relevant lesions. The treatment recommendation based on coronary computed tomography angiography with FFR CT remained equipoise between coronary artery bypass graft surgery and percutaneous coronary intervention but the treatment planning changed based on the negative FFR CT results in the right coronary artery. CABG, coronary artery bypass graft surgery; LAD, left anterior descending artery; LCX, left circumflex artery; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention; RCA, right coronary artery.

This recommendation should not apply to those with severe angina symptoms, left ventricular dysfunction (e.g., ejection fraction < 35%), or left main stem disease. Comparisons between aggressive medical therapy alone and invasive interventions do not support invasive strategies to reduce death or prevent myocardial infarction, although those with frequent angina symptoms (at least weekly) gained improvement with the invasive strategy. Although antianginal benefits of an invasive strategy are apparent in the general populations, people with symptoms may still elect for an initially invasive approach after being counseled about the risks, and invasive strategies will have higher cost implications to healthcare systems, people with CKD, or both.

Patient and lesion subset

Left main and three-vessel disease

The optimal revascularization strategy in patients with advanced CAD [i.e. three-vessel disease or left main stem (LMS) disease] and in diabetic patients has been discussed in the 2018 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines on myocardial revascularization: surgical revascularization is currently the recommended treatment strategy in diabetic patients with multivessel CAD, while PCI has a IIB indication in patients with a SYNTAX score ≤ 22 and is not recommended in patients with SYNTAX score > 22.

These recommendations are in line with the findings of the Future Revascularization Evaluation in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus: Optimal Management of Multivessel Disease (FREEDOM) Follow-On study that included 1900 diabetic patients with multivessel disease that were randomized to surgical or percutaneous revascularization and reported a higher mortality rate at 8 years of follow-up in the PCI arm compared to the surgical revascularization group (24.3% vs. 18.3%, P = 0.010). Conversely, the Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) Extended Survival study that included 1689 patients with LMS or three-vessel disease did not demonstrate differences in the all-cause mortality between patients allocated to PCI and those treated surgically at 10 years of follow-up (27% vs. 24%, P = 0.092). There was, however, a treatment effect by subgroup interaction according to the presence or absence of three-vessel disease; mortality was increased in the PCI group compared to the coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) arm (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.10–1.80), while there was no differences between the two groups in patients with LMS disease (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68–1.20); conversely, there was no difference in outcomes for the two treatment strategies in diabetic and non-diabetic patients (P -for interaction 0.660). A limitation of both studies is the fact that the patients in the PCI arm were treated with a 1st generation drug-eluting stent (DES) that is not currently used in contemporary practice, and the fact that they both reported only all-cause mortality instead of patient-orientated cardiovascular endpoints.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — FREEDOM and related evidence in diabetic multivessel CAD: Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PCI with CABG in patients with multivessel CAD have included patients with diabetes or prespecified diabetes subgroups, and the FREEDOM trial compared CABG with PCI exclusively in 1900 patients with diabetes. FREEDOM inclusion required multivessel disease with stenosis of 70% in ≥ 2 major epicardial vessels involving at least 2 separate territories and without left main stenosis. After enrollment, 82% of patients in the PCI group and 85% of patients in the CABG group had 3-vessel disease, and 91% of patients had involvement of the LAD artery. At 5-year follow-up, all-cause mortality was higher with PCI than with CABG, while cardiovascular mortality was not statistically different; there was no statistical interaction between SYNTAX score, revascularization strategy, or mortality rate. In FREEDOM follow-up, all-cause mortality up to 8 years was also significantly higher with PCI, and a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 11 RCTs showed a nearly 50% higher increased 5-year mortality risk with PCI than with CABG. A Heart Team discussion may be useful for patients with less extensive disease, including double-vessel disease without involvement of the left main or LAD artery.

### Clinical outcomes of state-of-the-art percutaneous coronary revascularization in patients with de novo three vessel disease: 1-year results of the SYNTAX II study [^c8b99533]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Translation of scientific progress to clinical practice can be hampered by simultaneous developments in different domains. Clinical trials are typically designed to test the impact of a single or a reduced number of variables on patient outcomes, using outcomes associated with standard care as a reference. However, this approach can fail to depict the cumulative benefit of incremental technological advances and the application of Guideline recommended practice. The SYNTAX II strategy was developed as representative of contemporary state-of-the art of coronary revascularization. Of note, the observed differential outcomes associated with its use cannot be attributed to a single diagnostic or therapeutic approach but rather to this integrated approach.

The first step of this strategy was optimizing the decision-making process between CABG and PCI in patients with 3VD. Currently, the European guidelines recommend CABG as the preferred revascularization strategy in patients with multivessel disease (IA recommendation). In patients with low anatomical complexity (i.e. anatomic SYNTAX Score < 22) percutaneous based revascularization can be an alternative treatment (IB recommendation). However, beyond the anatomical complexity, objectively quantified by the anatomic SYNTAX score, patient's characteristic and comorbidities should be taken into consideration to individualize the decision-making process between CABG and PCI based on the long-term vital prognosis. In the present study, patients were screened on the basis of the SYNTAX score II, a clinical tool that objectively allows decision making between CABG and PCI based on 4-year mortality. Whenever the SYNTAX score II recommended PCI treatment or equipoise with CABG, the patient was considered for inclusion in the trial, patients with a recommendation for CABG were enrolled in a registry. By utilizing the SYNTAX Score II, 156 patients (45%) had an anatomical SYNTAX score above 22, of which 140 patients had an anatomical SYNTAX Score 23–32. The 1-year results demonstrated that this approach was not associated with an increase in event rates.

Data specific to people with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are lacking, but for those with either diabetes or CKD, coronary artery bypass surgery has been considered superior to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for multiple-vessel disease; the NKF-KDOQI Guidelines for CVD in Dialysis Patients reached a similar conclusion based on retrospective and observational data and recommended research including prospective controlled trials of newer stenting technologies. Much of the benefit of coronary artery bypass surgery in diabetes or CKD stage 5 appears to derive from use of the internal mammary artery.

Baseline characteristics

Patients receiving CABG

Seventy-four patients received CABG. Age was 69 ± 8 (SD) years, 92% (68) were male. Mode of admission was stratified into emergency (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), post arrest, malignant arrhythmia), acute (unstable angina, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction and elective indications (stable angina, investigation of heart failure, arrhythmia, preoperative assessment for valve intervention). Fifty-one per cent (38) received angiography electively, 43% (32) acutely and 5% (4) emergently. Ostial/Mid shaft lesion were present in 45% (33) and distal lesions were in 55% (41). Number of non-LMS vessels with significant stenosis was 1.8 ± 1.1 with SYNTAX score of 24 ± 9. Twelve per cent (9) had diabetes mellitus. Sixteen per cent (12) had chronic kidney disease (CKD) (defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate < 90 mL/min), 35% (27) had hypertension, 14% (10) had a history of smoking and 5% (4) had a documented family history of ischaemic heart disease. Four per cent (3) had respiratory disease. Mean ejection fraction determined by echo was 52 ± 13%.

Of the 74 patients that received CABG, 7% (5) patients received valve intervention as well (3 patients received tissue aortic valve replacement and 2 patients received mitral valve repair).

Seventy per cent (95%) of 74 patients underwent left internal mammary artery grafting, 3 (4%) underwent right internal mammary grafting, 72 (97%) underwent venous grafting. The number of grafts per patient was 1 in 2 (3%) patients, 2 in 17 (23%) patients, 3 in 38 (51%) patients and 4 in 17 (23%) patients.

### Variations in coronary revascularization practices and their effect on long-term outcomes [^2e505906]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Surgical and percutaneous procedures are safe and effective methods of revascularization for patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD). Since the 1990s, several studies have demonstrated an increase in percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and a decrease in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Annual volumes of both procedures have declined in recent years, possibly because of advances in medical therapy, data questioning the benefit of PCI in stable CAD, and increasing use and scrutiny of appropriateness criteria. Furthermore, results of the SYNTAX (Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery) and FREEDOM (Future Revascularization Evaluation in Patients with Diabetes mellitus: Optimal Management of Multivessel Disease) trials indicated that CABG may offer better outcomes compared with PCI in patients with multivessel CAD, particularly in patients with diabetes or complex CAD. Current guidelines suggest that both strategies are options for stable multivessel CAD, unstable angina, or non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (MI), with CABG receiving a stronger recommendation than PCI across most clinical scenarios.

The relative distribution of PCI and CABG differs markedly across regions, and the magnitude and reasons for these variations are not well understood. Although patient characteristics (diabetes, comorbidities, life expectancy) are known to influence the choice of revascularization procedure, the impact of physician and institutional factors is poorly understood. To minimize the influence of nonclinical factors in the choice of revascularization strategy, multispecialty guidelines recommend a heart team discussion for patients with multivessel CAD.

The objectives of this population‐based study were to determine (1) the presence and magnitude of variations in the rates of PCI and CABG across institutions in contemporary practice; (2) whether nonclinical factors influence the choice of revascularization; and (3) whether these nonclinical factors are associated with patient outcomes following revascularization.

### Chronic kidney disease in diabetes: guidelines from KDIGO… [^0099d2ad]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Structured diabetes self-management education programs are recommended because they improve self-efficacy and clinical outcomes.
- First-line antiglycemic treatment for type 2 diabetes and CKD with eGFR as low as 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 should include metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor to improve cardiovascular outcomes and limit CKD progression.
- ACE inhibitor or ARB treatment should be maximized in patients who have diabetes with albuminuria and hypertension unless complicated by symptomatic hypotension, uncontrolled hyperkalemia, or more than a 30% increase in creatinine level. From the AFP Editors. Diabetes mellitus affects more than 450 million people globally, which could increase to more than 700 million people by 2045.

Up to 40% of cases of diabetes are complicated by chronic kidney disease, with persistent abnormalities of kidney function demonstrated by elevated urine albumin excretion or reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes group, an international organization dedicated to nephrology clinical practice guidelines, has developed a new guideline for management of diabetes with CKD. Team-Based Care People with diabetes and CKD have high risks of CKD progression, cardiovascular disease, and mortality, which can be reduced with a comprehensive approach to lifestyle and risk factor management in combination with appropriate pharmacotherapy. Optimal care includes primary care, cardiology, nephrology, endocrinology, psychology, nutrition, and disease management nursing support.

Self-Management Education Structured education in diabetes self-management is recommended for people with diabetes and CKD because education improves long-term clinical outcomes and quality of life. Group-based education programs improve A1C level, fasting blood glucose level, body weight, self-efficacy, and patient satisfaction. Lower levels of physical activity are common and associated with worse clinical outcomes. Moderate-intensity physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week and reduction in sedentary activity are recommended. In addition to further increasing cardiovascular risk, cigarette smoking is associated with kidney disease progression, and patients should be advised to quit smoking. Glycemic Treatment For people with type 2 diabetes and CKD with an eGFR 30 mL per minute per 1.

73 m 2 or higher, metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, in combination, are recommended for first-line medical treatment because they improve glycemic control outcomes. Metformin limits weight gain and reduces cardiovascular events, whereas the SGLT2 inhibitor improves cardiovascular outcomes and limits kidney disease progression. Metformin is safe in patients with an eGFR above 45 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 unless risk for acute kidney injury is high. The dose of metformin should be reduced when eGFR is less than 45 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 and discontinued when eGFR is less than 30 mL per minute per

1. 73 m 2 or in people treated with dialysis. SGLT2 inhibitor use can cause a reversible decline in eGFR that usually does not require stopping the medication. The SGLT2 inhibitor can be continued with an eGFR below 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 if well-tolerated and dialysis is not imminent.

Results

Baseline patient and lesion characteristics

Among a total of 5516 patients, 2003 patients (36.3%) were DM population and 3513 patients (63.7%) were non-DM population (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). Patients and lesion characteristics between the DM and the non-DM populations are described in Additional file 1: Table S2. Compared to the non-DM population, the DM population was older and had higher prevalences of cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, peripheral vessel disease, prior stroke, and current smoking. The DM population was more likely to be presented as stable angina or silent ischemia than the non-DM population. Regarding the lesion complexity, the DM population had a higher rate of multivessel disease, long lesion, and small vessel disease, resulting in a higher baseline SYNTAX score than the non-DM population. Complete revascularization was achieved in 44.6% in the DM population and 52.2% in the non-DM population (p < 0.001). Patient and lesion characteristics according to the achievement of complete revascularization are described in Table 1. In the DM population, the incomplete revascularization group was more likely to have multivessel disease, long lesions, and small vessel disease than the complete revascularization group. In the non-DM population, the incomplete revascularization group was older and more likely to have chronic kidney disease, previous MI, previous stroke, and complex disease features (multivessel disease, bifurcation lesion, long lesions, and small vessel disease) than the complete revascularization group. The baseline SYNTAX score was higher in the incomplete revascularization group than in the complete revascularization group, regardless of the presence of DM (18.5 ± 8.8 vs.10.8 ± 8.0, p < 0.001 in DM population; 17.4 ± 10.1 vs. 9.5 ± 7.0, p < 0.001 in non-DM population).

Conclusion

At 5 years, clinical outcomes associated with the SYNTAX II strategy were clearly superior to those outcomes observed in predefined patients treated with PCI from the original SYNTAX trial. The exploratory comparison between CABG and PCI suggests that 5-year outcomes following revascularization are similar. These data suggest the need for a randomized clinical trial recruiting appropriately selected patients with multi-vessel CAD comparing outcomes after revascularization with either CABG or PCI using a contemporary strategic approach.

### SCAI position statement on optimal percutaneous coronary interventional therapy for complex coronary artery disease [^ce307a55]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). High credibility.

High predicted mortality and CABG ineligibility — risk tools and multidisciplinary evaluation: A significant proportion of patients with complex CAD may be at prohibitive risk for complications with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). While the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk calculator may be useful in determining the expected complication and mortality rate with CABG, it is less useful in guiding the decision between PCI and CABG, whereas the SYNTAX I score was created to help define the optimal revascularization strategy (CABG vs. PCI) for individual patients based on coronary anatomy and select comorbidities. This score, used with a multidisciplinary heart team approach, may provide a highly evidence-based approach to determine the relative merits of PCI, CABG, hybrid strategies, or medical therapy in patients with multivessel disease. Patients with multivessel or LM coronary disease declined for cardiac surgery based on high surgical risk and/or severe medical comorbidities represent a particularly high-risk subgroup of patients referred for PCI and have an increased risk of mortality out of proportion to the risk assessed by traditional PCI risk stratification tools. Randomized clinical trials comparing different revascularization strategies for such patients are lacking, and the combination of the potentially high technical complexity of PCI and compromised ability to tolerate sustained ischemia or complications make a multidisciplinary evaluation particularly valuable in such patients.

### SYNTAX score in patients with diabetes undergoing coronary revascularization in the FREEDOM trial [^f2c832fb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with complex coronary artery disease (CAD), which in turn results in increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate the utility of SYNTAX score (SS) for predicting future cardiovascular events in patients with DM and complex CAD undergoing either coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Methods

The FREEDOM (Future REvascularization Evaluation in patients with Diabetes mellitus: Optimal management of Multivessel disease) trial randomized patients with DM and multivessel CAD to undergo either PCI with drug-eluting stents or CABG. The SS was calculated retrospectively by a core laboratory. The endpoint of hard cardiovascular events (HCE) was a composite of death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, while the endpoint of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) was a composite of HCE and repeat revascularization.

Results

A total of 1,900 patients were randomized to PCI (n = 953) or CABG (n = 947). The SS was considered an independent predictor of 5-year MACCE (hazard ratio per unit of SS: 1.02; 95% confidence interval: 1.00 to 1.03; p = 0.014) and HCE (hazard ratio per unit of SS: 1.03; 95% confidence interval: 1.01 to 1.04; p = 0.002) in the PCI cohort, but not in the CABG group. There was a higher incidence of MACCE in PCI patients with low, intermediate, and high SS compared with those who underwent CABG (36.6% vs. 25.9%, p = 0.02; 43.9% vs. 26.8%, p < 0.001; 48.7% vs. 29.7%, p = 0.003, respectively).

Conclusions

In DM patients with multivessel CAD, the complexity of CAD evaluated by the SS is an independent risk factor for MACCE and HCE only in patients undergoing PCI. The SS should not be utilized to guide the choice of coronary revascularization in patients with DM and multivessel CAD.

### 2021 ACC / AHA / SCAI guideline for coronary artery revascularization: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint Committee on Clinical practice guidelines [^49ca35be]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

ACC/AHA/SCAI 2021 coronary revascularization — patients with complex disease recommends that in patients who require revascularization for significant left main CAD with high-complexity CAD, it is recommended to choose CABG over PCI to improve survival (COR 1, LOE B-R). In patients who require revascularization for multivessel CAD with complex or diffuse CAD (eg, SYNTAX score > 33), it is reasonable to choose CABG over PCI to confer a survival advantage (COR 2a, LOE B-R). Supporting evidence notes that the SYNTAX trial, which included 705 patients with left main stenoses and a range of complexity of disease, showed a significantly higher MACE and cardiac mortality rate at 5 years for the subgroup of patients with left main and high-complexity disease (defined as a SYNTAX score > 33) who were treated with PCI.

### Consensus recommendations for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [^60798f89]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical terms used in the consensus recommendation

ASCVD

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is defined somewhat differently across trials; however, all the CVOTs overall had similar inclusion criteria. These criteria generally included a history of any of the conditions mentioned hereafter: acute coronary syndrome or MI, stable or unstable angina, CAD with or without revascularization, any other arterial revascularization, peripheral artery disease, stroke assumed to be atherosclerotic in origin. The relevant conditions compatible with clinically significant atherosclerosis consisted of transient ischaemic attack, hospitalised for unstable angina, amputation, congestive heart failure New York Heart Association class II–III, arterial stenosis of more than 50%, symptomatic/asymptomatic CAD documented by imaging, chronic kidney disease (CKD) with estimated GFR (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Certain trials had included few patients without clinical ASCVD but required them to have a high burden of risk factors based on age and the presence of two or more cardiac risk factors.

MACE

In this document, three major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) are considered as primary endpoints in the CVOTs:
3-point MACE: composite of non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or cardiovascular mortality.
4-point MACE: 3-point MACE + hospitalisation for unstable angina.
5-point MACE: 3-point MACE + hospitalisation for heart failure (HF) or unstable angina.

High risk of CVD

Patients with high risk for CVD included multiple risk factors for CV disease: men 55 years of age or older or women 60 years of age or older in addition to another traditional risk factor like hypertension, dyslipidemia (defined as a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level > 130 mg/dL [3.36 mmol/L]) or the use of lipid-lowering therapies, and smoking. Furthermore, microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria [urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) higher than 30 mg/g or equivalent]; high renal risk, which included (a) eGFR of 45–75 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and UACR higher than 200 mg/g or equivalent or (b) eGFR of 15–45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 regardless of UACR. Participants with end-stage renal disease (eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2) or requiring maintenance dialysis, history of CAD; stroke or peripheral vascular disease were excluded.

### Updates to management of adults with chronic kidney disease… [^cce69d8b]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

In March 2024, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes published updated guidelines on the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease. 1 A comprehensive review of screening for and evaluation and management of CKD and its complications was published previously in American Family Physician. 2 This editorial highlights the KDIGO updates related to new medications that can delay CKD progression and recommendations for assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in patients with CKD. LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION Increasing physical activity Weight management Cessation of tobacco use Consumption of a whole-food, plant-based diet that minimizes intake of animal-based and ultra-processed foods When available, referral to a renal dietitian is beneficial for patients with CKD because of their complex dietary needs. These include adjustment in intake of sodium, potassium, phosphorus, protein, and fluids, while also accounting for comorbidities.

RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM INHIBITORS Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, which include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, have a well-established history of reducing all-cause mortality and providing renal and cardioprotective benefits in adults who have CKD with or without diabetes. 4, 5 The KDIGO guideline recommends titrating the dosage of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors to achieve a systolic blood pressure less than 120 mm Hg in patients with high blood pressure and CKD. A higher goal is reasonable for patients with frailty, at risk for falls, or with limiting factors such as symptomatic postural hypotension. For patients with nonemergent hyperkalemia, the KDIGO guideline has shifted away from recommending reflexive discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors.

Instead, management suggestions include reviewing modifiable factors such as dietary potassium intake, eliminating medications that increase serum potassium, and prescribing potassium-lowering medications such as diuretics when appropriate. The National Kidney Foundation provides a patient-friendly overview of high- and low-potassium foods in English and Spanish. Referral to a nephrologist may also be appropriate. Clinicians can initiate newer potassium-binding agents such as patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. These are well-tolerated and safe for long-term use compared with earlier agents. SODIUM-GLUCOSE COTRANSPORTER-2 INHIBITORS Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors reduce risk of acute kidney injury and progression to kidney failure and provide cardioprotective benefits for adults with CKD and type 2 diabetes.

1 A significant update in the 2024 KDIGO guideline is that these benefits have also been seen in adults with CKD without diabetes who have albuminuria or a diagnosis of heart failure. 1, 6. Similar to renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors may cause a brief, reversible decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate at initiation, which typically ranges between 3 and 5 mL/min/1. 73 m
2. 7 Depending on baseline eGFR, the decrease may represent a 10% or greater decline. This is an expected hemodynamic effect of SGLT-2 inhibition resulting in preservation of kidney function over time and generally should not warrant a change in CKD monitoring or therapy cessation. Potential adverse effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors include vulvovaginal candidiasis, perineal infection, volume depletion, and ketoacidosis.

### The future REvascularization evaluation in patients with diabetes mellitus: optimal management of multivessel disease (FREEDOM) trial: clinical and angiographic profile at study entry [^912cb5c2]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal revascularization strategy for diabetic patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (MVD) remains uncertain for lack of an adequately powered, randomized trial. The FREEDOM trial was designed to compare contemporary coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents in diabetic patients with MVD against a background of optimal medical therapy.

Methods

A total of 1,900 diabetic participants with MVD were randomized to PCI or CABG worldwide from April 2005 to March 2010. FREEDOM is a superiority trial with a mean follow-up of 4.37 years (minimum 2 years) and 80% power to detect a 27.0% relative reduction. We present the baseline characteristics of patients screened and randomized, and provide a comparison with other MVD trials involving diabetic patients.

Results

The randomized cohort was 63.1 ± 9.1 years old and 29% female, with a median diabetes duration of 10.2 ± 8.9 years. Most (83%) had 3-vessel disease and on average took 5.5 ± 1.7 vascular medications, with 32% on insulin therapy. Nearly all had hypertension and/or dyslipidemia, and 26% had a prior myocardial infarction. Mean hemoglobin A1c was 7.8 ± 1.7 mg/dL, 29% had low-density lipoprotein < 70 mg/dL, and mean systolic blood pressure was 134 ± 20 mm Hg. The mean SYNTAX score was 26.2 with a symmetric distribution. FREEDOM trial participants have baseline characteristics similar to those of contemporary multivessel and diabetes trial cohorts.

Conclusions

The FREEDOM trial has successfully recruited a high-risk diabetic MVD cohort. Follow-up efforts include aggressive monitoring to optimize background risk factor control. FREEDOM will contribute significantly to the PCI versus CABG debate in diabetic patients with MVD.

### Impact of incomplete percutaneous revascularization in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^cdf499fa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our analysis of data derived from over 150 000 patients undergoing PCI suggests that fewer than half of all patients with multivessel coronary artery disease have CR following PCI. We observe that CR is associated with decreased incidence of mortality, myocardial infarction, and MACE, irrespective of whether an anatomical or a score‐based definition of IR was used and that the magnitude of risk relates to degree of CR. The findings of our analysis have several practical implications for interventional cardiologists. Our reported associations between IR and adverse clinical outcomes suggest that in patients with MVD, consideration should be given to the degree of CR that can be achieved by PCI when discussing choice of revascularization modality within the heart team, in addition to consideration of lesion complexity, functional significance, patient characteristics, and syntax score in line with current international recommendations. 86 At the very least these data speak of the need for further carefully conducted randomized trials to address this question.

### Individualizing revascularization strategy for diabetic patients with multivessel Coronary Disease [^62ab80c3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD), the FREEDOM (Future Revascularization Evaluation in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus: Optimal Management of Multivessel Disease) trial demonstrated that, on average, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was superior to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for major acute cardiovascular events (MACE) and angina reduction. Nonetheless, multivessel PCI remains a common revascularization strategy in the real world.

Objectives

To translate the results of FREEDOM to individual patients in clinical practice, risk models of the heterogeneity of treatment benefit were built.

Methods

Using patient-level data from 1,900 FREEDOM patients, the authors developed models to predict 5-year MACE (all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke) and 1-year angina after CABG and PCI using baseline covariates and treatment interactions. Parsimonious models were created to support clinical use. The models were internally validated using bootstrap resampling, and the MACE model was externally validated in a large real-world registry.

Results

The 5-year MACE occurred in 346 (18.2%) patients, and 310 (16.3%) had angina at 1 year. The MACE model included 8 variables and treatment interactions with smoking status (c = 0.67). External validation in stable CAD (c = 0.65) and ACS (c = 0.68) demonstrated comparable performance. The 6-variable angina model included a treatment interaction with SYNTAX score (c = 0.67). PCI was never superior to CABG, and CABG was superior to PCI for MACE in 54.5% of patients and in 100% of patients with history of smoking.

Conclusions

To help disseminate the results of FREEDOM, the authors created a personalized risk prediction tool for patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD that could be used in shared decision-making for CABG versus PCI by estimating each patient's personal outcomes with both treatments.

### Clinical and quality-of-life outcomes following invasive vs conservative treatment of patients with chronic coronary disease across the spectrum of kidney function [^22c5a98d]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Prior trials of invasive vs conservative management of chronic coronary disease (CCD) have not enrolled patients with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD). As such, outcomes across kidney function are not well characterized.

Objectives

To evaluate clinical and quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes across the spectrum of CKD following conservative and invasive treatment strategies.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Participants from the International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA) and ISCHEMIA-Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) trials were categorized by CKD stage: stage 1 (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 90 mL/min/1.73m2 or greater), stage 2 (eGFR 60–89 mL/min/1.73m2), stage 3 (eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73m2), stage 4 (eGFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73m2), or stage 5 (eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m2 or receiving dialysis). Enrollment took place from July 26, 2012, through January 31, 2018, with a median follow-up of 3.1 years. Data were analyzed from January 2020 to May 2021.

Interventions

Initial invasive management of coronary angiography and revascularization with guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) vs initial conservative management of GDMT alone.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary clinical outcome was a composite of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). The primary QoL outcome was the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) summary score.

Results

Among the 5956 participants included in this analysis (mean [SD] age, 64 [10] years; 1410 [24%] female and 4546 [76%] male), 1889 (32%), 2551 (43%), 738 (12%), 311 (5%), and 467 (8%) were in CKD stages 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. By self-report, 18 participants (< 1%) were American Indian or Alaska Native; 1676 (29%), Asian; 267 (5%), Black; 861 (16%), Hispanic or Latino; 18 (< 1%), Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; 3884 (66%), White; and 13 (< 1%), multiple races or ethnicities. There was a monotonic increase in risk of the primary composite end point (3-year rates, 9.52%, 10.72%, 18.42%, 34.21%, and 38.01% respectively), death, cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke in individuals with higher CKD stages. Invasive management was associated with an increase in stroke (3-year event rate difference, 1%; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.7) and procedural MI (1.6%; 95% CI, 0.9 to 2.3) and a decrease in spontaneous MI (-2.5%; 95% CI, -3.9 to -1.1) with no difference in other outcomes; the effect was similar across CKD stages. There was heterogeneity of treatment effect for QoL outcomes such that invasive management was associated with an improvement in angina-related QoL in individuals with CKD stages 1 to 3 and not in those with CKD stages 4 to 5.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among participants with CCD, event rates were inversely proportional to kidney function. Invasive management was associated with an increase in stroke and procedural MI and a reduced risk in spontaneous MI, and the effect was similar across CKD stages with no difference in other outcomes, including death. The benefit for QoL with invasive management was not observed in individuals with poorer kidney function.

### Clinical outcomes of state-of-the-art percutaneous coronary revascularization in patients with de novo three vessel disease: 1-year results of the SYNTAX II study [^c4431540]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) were introduced 40 years ago and became the standard of care for patients with non-complex coronary artery disease (CAD) not responding to optimal medical therapy. Despite the improved efficacy of PCI with drug eluting stents (DES), in patients with three-vessel (3VD) CAD, surgery remains the recommended revascularization modality in patients with intermediate or high anatomical complexity. Among several trials comparing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with PCI in patients with 3VD, the pivotal SYNergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with TAXus and cardiac surgery (SYNTAX) trial identified CABG as the preferred revascularization strategy, compared with PCI with first-generation drug-eluting stents (DES). In the 3VD cohort, PCI was associated with a higher rate of all cause death, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization at 5 years. Subsequently, the superiority of CABG over PCI, with first-generation DES, was confirmed in patients with diabetes in the FREEDOM trial. Recently, in the BEST trial, comparing CABG with PCI in 3VD using newer generation DES, the 5-year clinical outcomes were inferior amongst patients who underwent PCI.

Outcomes of patients with complex CAD are dependent on the anatomical complexity and patient's individual clinical characteristics and comorbidities. In appropriately selected patients with less complex 3VD or high surgical risk, PCI may be considered by the heart team as an acceptable alternative. The SYNTAX Score II is a clinical tool that combines anatomical and clinical factors to aid the heart team to undertake objective decision-making between CABG and PCI based on 4-year mortality. Accordingly, patients with anatomical complexities, including those exceeding the low SYNTAX score group, are potentially appropriate for either therapy provided there is equipoise for projected 4-year mortality between CABG and PCI. Furthermore, advances in PCI [including intracoronary physiology to assess the appropriateness of revascularization, the advent of thin strut DES, intravascular imaging guided stent implantation and optimization, new techniques for revascularization of chronic total occlusions (CTO), and potent dual antiplatelet therapy] have been shown to improve patients' outcomes. We hypothesized that the use of these PCI technologies, coupled with refined patient selection, could lead to a marked improvement in outcomes of 3VD patients treated with PCI.

The present study reports the 1-year clinical follow-up of the SYNTAX II trial, which was initiated to explore how the integration of new developments in PCI practice may potentially improve patient outcomes, compared with the results obtained in the original SYNTAX-I trial.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^cde923ae]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — initial management of stable stress-test confirmed ischemic heart disease emphasizes that intensive medical therapy is a suitable initial strategy. This recommendation should not apply to those with severe angina symptoms, left ventricular dysfunction (e.g., ejection fraction < 35%), or left main stem disease as they were excluded from the definitive trials. The overall certainty of the evidence comparing coronary revascularization with optimal medical therapy among people with CKD not undergoing KRT and with heart disease is very low. The harms of invasive strategies include the risk of dialysis initiation, death, and stroke risk (stroke was interestingly not periprocedural). It is not possible to formally assess the cost-effectiveness of intensive medical therapy versus an initial invasive strategy due to mixed findings from the evidence in people with stable ischemic heart disease, and invasive strategies will have higher cost implications to healthcare systems, people with CKD, or both. Access and availability to cardiology services will facilitate implementation of intensive medical therapy. Evidence suggests that the key indication for an initial invasive strategy to manage stable ischemic heart disease is based on symptoms, and intensive medical therapy is a suitable approach if symptom control is satisfactory in people with or without CKD. Trials in CKD have not ruled out antianginal benefits in people with CKD (despite negative findings), and in CKD, the antianginal benefits of an initially invasive approach have not been demonstrated.

### Outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with multivessel disease who were recommended for but declined coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^0a53944d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients who underwent PCI were categorized into 3 distinct groups: (a) patients with multivessel disease recommended for PCI as per American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2012 appropriate use criteria recommendations (PCI‐recommended); (b) patients eligible and recommended for CABG who refused surgery despite Heart Team recommendation (CABG‐refusal); and (c) patients deemed ineligible for CABG by the heart team (CABG‐ineligible).

In general, patients without disqualifying clinical comorbidities or frailty were recommended for CABG if "surgical anatomy" was present, defined as 2‐vessel or 3‐vessel CAD with diabetes and proximal left anterior descending artery involvement, 3‐vessel CAD with SYNTAX‐I score > 22, or unprotected left main disease with SYNTAX‐I score > 32. PCI‐recommended criteria reflected societal guidelines criteria class I, IIa, and IIb recommendations in patients with multivessel or left main CAD as summarized in Table S1. These generally correlate with 2012 AUC criteria "appropriate" (generally acceptable and reasonable) or "uncertain" (may be acceptable and reasonable). Patients with prior CABG were included in the PCI‐recommended cohort given the equipoise in guidelines with regard to outcomes with PCI or repeat CABG in these patients. Patients in the PCI‐recommended cohort usually underwent ad hoc PCI following diagnostic catheterization if previous patient consent was achieved after general discussion of revascularization alternatives with the heart team. The CABG‐refusal group consisted of patients who declined surgical revascularization despite heart team recommendation and instead elected for multivessel PCI. Patient refusal of CABG was expressly documented in the hospital chart before PCI in all cases. The CABG‐ineligible group was composed of patients who underwent surgical consultation and were not considered suitable for CABG. Documented reasons for CABG ineligibility were further categorized according to a previously published taxonomy.

Data Collection

Clinical, laboratory, and angiographic findings were prospectively entered into standardized forms during the index hospitalization for the PCI. The SYNTAX‐I score was also calculated in all patients undergoing cardiac catheterization by the interventional cardiologist. PCI was performed according to standard techniques, and stent choice was per operator preference. Likewise, dual antiplatelet therapy choice and duration were based on treating physician preference. Patients were followed by clinic visit or telephone interviews by experienced research personnel including medical records review of recurrent hospitalizations up to 1 year after PCI. The study was approved by the institutional review board at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, and informed consent was obtained from all patients for anonymized data collection.

AUC and multivessel PCI — "The AUC for coronary revascularization complements practice guidelines and addresses many clinical situations encountered in daily practice for which there are insufficient data to support guideline development (Table III) [2]. However, most of the AUC evaluate only the appropriateness of revascularization without the mention of single-stage versus multistage strategies". Consistent with prior updates, "the AUC identify nonculprit vessel PCI in the context of STEMI as inappropriate in the absence of ongoing symptoms or clinical instability" and "encourage the use of testing, such as FFR, to decide if additional vessel PCI is appropriate in stable patients". Supporting diagnostics include the use "of FFR measurements (class IIa, level of evidence A) and intravascular ultrasound imaging in the context of multivessel disease to determine the need for PCI in vessels with angiographically intermediate lesions".

### Exploring new insights in coronary lesion assessment and treatment in patients with diabetes mellitus: the impact of optical coherence tomography [^00d67a9e]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidence and prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) are increasing and it has currently become the most common global metabolic disorder. DM is associated with an excess of mortality and morbidity. DM is considered an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) and people with DM are between two and four times more likely to develop CAD than those without DM. Furthermore, DM is considered a strong cardiovascular risk factor given that DM patients without myocardial infarction (MI) have a 5-year cardiovascular mortality similar to that of non-DM patients with a history of MI. Furthermore, CAD is responsible for 80% of deaths and 75% of hospital admissions in DM patients.

DM patients are at increased risk for developing acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Consequently, this increased risk has resulted in DM having a prevalence of 25–40% among patients presenting with ACS. In fact, DM appears to be the main independent predictor of death or MI in the setting of ACS. These patients are also at higher risk for advanced atherosclerosis presenting as diffuse CAD with more complex angiographical patterns, characterised by multivessel plaques, extending to mid and distal branches, which in turn makes myocardial percutaneous revascularisation more challenging. Therefore, DM patients presenting with ACS have a higher chance of poor clinical outcomes that persist after the implementation of best practice protocol mandated care.

Despite advances in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the utilisation of modern drug-eluting stents (DES), studies have continued to show a trend towards higher rates of adverse cardiovascular events in DM patients than non-DM patients presenting either with or without ACS. The outcomes of the BARI and FREEDOM trials enforced the superiority of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) over PCI in DM patients with multivessel disease presenting with stable coronary disease or stabilised ACS. Consequently, current evidence indicates that in DM patients with stable CAD suitable for both procedures with low predicted surgical mortality, CABG is superior to PCI in reducing the risk of major adverse cardiac events. However, in DM patients with a low SYNTAX score (≤ 22), PCI with modern DES has achieved outcomes similar to CABG with regard to death, MI and stroke. Therefore, PCI may represent an alternative to CABG for CAD with low complexity of coronary anatomy involvement. In addition, when these patients present with ongoing MI, the need for urgent revascularisation of the culprit lesions is easily achievable by means of PCI.

### Management of coronary artery disease in end-stage renal disease [^a8b21c55]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Despite a substantial number of patients with end-stage renal disease who have coronary artery disease, the comparative effectiveness of revascularization procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention remain unclear. Innovations in the field of coronary artery revascularization and concomitant changes in the standard of practice have improved outcomes in general. However, meaningful clinical decision-making remains difficult because it requires clinicians to extrapolate evidence derived from studies in the general population to patients with kidney disease for whom there is limited information from intervention trials. In non-randomized studies, this high-risk population for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality appear to derive substantial benefits from coronary revascularization. However, specific treatment decisions are often made based upon individual circumstances and contexts that are not well captured in these studies. This article reviews the available evidence, and its limitations, for deciding between various revascularization strategies for patients with end-stage renal disease. Several considerations that arise while making such decisions are discussed.

The pathophysiology of diabetes and systemic insulin resistance contributes to the nature of diffuse atherosclerosis and a high prevalence of multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) in diabetic patients. The optimal approach to this patient population remains a subject of an ongoing discussion. In this review, we give an overview of the unique pathophysiology of CAD in patients with diabetes, summarize the current state of therapies available, and compare modalities of revascularization that have been investigated in recent clinical trials. We conclude by highlighting the importance of a comprehensive heart team approach to every patient while accommodating both patient preference and quality-of-life decisions.

### The clinical SYNTAX score predicts survival better than the SYNTAX score in coronary revascularization [^fe7f8d25]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) trial showed that the SYNTAX score (SS) is a useful tool for customizing revascularization treatment for patients with multivessel coronary disease. In the past decade, the Clinical SS (CSS) has emerged as a comprehensive tool. This novel tool considers the SS as well as patient clinical parameters such as age, creatinine clearance, and ejection fraction, which were shown to be relevant for patient prognosis. Thus, in the current work we set out to compare the survival predictive values of the SS versus the CSS and their future application in real-world implementation of the revascularization guidelines.

Methods

This study was a subanalysis of data collected in a prospective national registry in Israel that enrolled consecutive patients with left main and/or 2- to 3-vessel coronary artery disease involving the proximal or mid-left anterior descending artery; the MULTI-vessel Coronary Artery Disease (MULTICAD). The revascularization method was chosen by the physicians taking care of the patients at each hospital and the patients were followed for 5 years. Patients were categorized according to their SS, the CSS, and their revascularization method (primary coronary intervention [PCI] vs coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) and patient survival were compared.

Results

A total of 585 patients were enrolled in the study and were followed for 5 years. The median CSS was 27, with 288 patients showing a CSS ≥ 27, with a mean CSS of 47.85 and a mean SS of 29.05. At 3 and 5 years post-treatment, the CSS ≥ 27 group had a lower survival probability, CSS ≥ 27 was associated with a lower survival probability among patients who underwent PCI compared with those who underwent CABG. More specifically, the high-CSS CABG group had a 5-year mortality rate of 16.8%, whereas the high-CSS PCI group had a 5-year mortality rate of 32.2%. In a comparison of SS with CSS for the 5-year mortality outcome prediction, CSS was superior to SS with a higher area under the curve.

Conclusions

This prospective registry of real-world revascularization strategies in patients with multivessel disease showed that CSS is a better predictive tool of postrevascularization survival than SS. Moreover, it showed that surgical revascularization in patients with CSS ≥ 27 is associated with better all-cause mortality outcome after CABG as compared with after PCI. This attests to the need for a score that considers clinical parameters in a real-world scenario.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy versus aspirin monotherapy in diabetics with multivessel disease undergoing CABG: FREEDOM insights [^fb506b51]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines recommend post-operative dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) following acute coronary syndromes (ACS).

Objectives

The authors have evaluated DAPT utilization rates and associated outcomes among post-CABG patients with diabetes.

Methods

In a post hoc, nonrandomized analysis from the FREEDOM (Future REvascularization Evaluation in patients with Diabetes mellitus: Optimal management of Multivessel disease) trial, we compared patients receiving DAPT (aspirin plus thienopyridine) and aspirin monotherapy at 30 days post-operatively. The primary outcome was the risk adjusted 5-year FREEDOM composite of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke. Safety outcomes included major bleeding, blood transfusion, and hospitalization for bleeding.

Results

At 30 days post-CABG, 544 (68.4%) patients received DAPT and 251 (31.6%) patients received aspirin alone. The median (25th, 75th percentile) duration of clopidogrel therapy was 0.98 (0.23 to 1.91) years. There was no significant difference in the 5-year primary composite outcome between DAPT- and aspirin-treated patients (12.6% vs. 16.0%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54 to 1.27; p = 0.39). The 5-year primary composite outcomes were similar for patients receiving DAPT versus aspirin monotherapy respectively, in subgroups with pre-CABG ACSs (15.2% vs. 16.5%; HR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.53 to 2.10; p = 0.88) and those with stable angina (11.6% vs. 15.8%; HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.50 to 1.343; p = 0.42). The composite outcomes of both treatment groups were also similar by SYNTAX score, duration of DAPT therapy, completeness of revascularization, and in off-pump CABG. No treatment-related differences in major bleeding (5.6% vs. 5.7%; HR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.50 to 1.99; p = 0.99), blood transfusions (4.8% vs. 4.5%; HR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.51 to 2.34; p = 0.82), or hospitalization for bleeding (2.6% vs. 3.3%; HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.34 to 2.17; p = 0.74) were observed between aspirin- and DAPT-treated patients, respectively.

Conclusions

The use of DAPT in patients with diabetes post-CABG in our cohort was high. Compared with aspirin monotherapy, no associated differences were observed in cardiovascular or bleeding outcomes, suggesting that routine use of DAPT may not be clinically warranted.

Figure 2
Study flowchart of the DECISION QFR trial. In the DECISION QFR study, two Heart Teams will be randomized to either patient information based on QFR or patient information based on FFR. Each team will have a virtual discussion and select a treatment recommendation for the revascularization strategy (percutaneous coronary intervention vs. coronary artery bypass graft). All 260 patients will be assessed by both teams with reference to the anatomical and functional SYNTAX score/SYNTAX score II 2020 derived from the allocated physiological index (QFR or FFR). FFR, fractional flow reserve; FSS, functional SYNTAX score; LAD, left anterior descending; LMCA, left main coronary artery; QFR, quantitative flow ratio; RCA, right coronary artery; SSII, SYNTAX score II.

The research ethics committee of each participating institution has approved the protocol, and all enrolled patients have provided written informed consent before being included in the study. The current trial is registered at University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN000040475).

2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The major inclusion criteria of the current trial are as follows: (1) chronic coronary syndrome requiring revascularization (PCI or CABG); and (2) multiple lesions with DS of ≥ 50% (visual assessment) located in ≥ 2 vessels including the proximal left anterior descending (LAD; SYNTAX score segment: 6 and/or 7). The exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) left main coronary artery lesion or ostial lesion of right coronary artery (RCA) disease that is not recommended for the QFR analysis; (2) history of CABG; (3) advanced chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2) or receiving hemodialysis; (4) atrial fibrillation at the time of angiography; (5) severe valvular diseases; and (6) heart failure requiring oxygen supply (Table 1). Patients will be recruited from 10 Japanese sites listed in the Supporting Information.

### Coronary computed tomography angiography for heart team decision-making in multivessel coronary artery disease [^4556bc1a]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Myocardial revascularization improves survival in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. The selection of a surgical or catheter-based therapy relies on patient's preference, clinical comorbidities, and complexity of coronary artery disease. The American and European guidelines support a heart team approach for the decision-making process regarding the revascularization strategy and recommend the evaluation of the anatomical complexity using the SYNTAX score.

Invasive coronary angiography has been the preferred diagnostic modality to assess the extent and severity of the coronary artery disease. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) has emerged as a non-invasive method able to assess the degree of epicardial coronary narrowing, and its physiological repercussion by means of fractional flow reserve derived from computed tomography (FFR CT). Moreover, the calculation of the SYNTAX score derived from coronary CTA has been shown to be accurate with respect to the one derived from invasive angiographic assessment. The integration of the anatomical SYNTAX score with patient's clinical characteristics and comorbidities using the SYNTAX Score II, provides a treatment recommendation based on the predicted 4-year mortality in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Technological advancements in the field of coronary computed tomography (CT) allowed for expanding its use to patients with known coronary artery disease. However, the diagnostic performance of the latest generation of CT scanners and the agreement on treatment decision in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease remains to be investigated. The present study sought to determine the agreement between separate heart teams on treatment recommendation based either on coronary CTA or conventional angiography in patients with left main or three-vessel coronary artery disease.

### Mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting versus percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting for coronary artery disease: a pooled analysis of individual patient data [^0dd46160]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Numerous randomised trials have compared coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patients with coronary artery disease. However, no studies have been powered to detect a difference in mortality between the revascularisation strategies.

Methods

We did a systematic review up to July 19, 2017, to identify randomised clinical trials comparing CABG with PCI using stents. Eligible studies included patients with multivessel or left main coronary artery disease who did not present with acute myocardial infarction, did PCI with stents (bare-metal or drug-eluting), and had more than 1 year of follow-up for all-cause mortality. In a collaborative, pooled analysis of individual patient data from the identified trials, we estimated all-cause mortality up to 5 years using Kaplan-Meier analyses and compared PCI with CABG using a random-effects Cox proportional-hazards model stratified by trial. Consistency of treatment effect was explored in subgroup analyses, with subgroups defined according to baseline clinical and anatomical characteristics.

Findings

We included 11 randomised trials involving 11518 patients selected by heart teams who were assigned to PCI (n = 5753) or to CABG (n = 5765). 976 patients died over a mean follow-up of 3·8 years (SD 1·4). Mean Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) score was 26·0 (SD 9·5), with 1798 (22·1%) of 8138 patients having a SYNTAX score of 33 or higher. 5 year all-cause mortality was 11·2% after PCI and 9·2% after CABG (hazard ratio [HR] 1·20, 95% CI 1·06–1·37; p = 0·0038). 5 year all-cause mortality was significantly different between the interventions in patients with multivessel disease (11·5% after PCI vs 8·9% after CABG; HR 1·28, 95% CI 1·09–1·49; p = 0·0019), including in those with diabetes (15·5% vs 10·0%; 1·48, 1·19–1·84; p = 0·0004), but not in those without diabetes (8·7% vs 8·0%; 1·08, 0·86–1·36; p = 0·49). SYNTAX score had a significant effect on the difference between the interventions in multivessel disease. 5 year all-cause mortality was similar between the interventions in patients with left main disease (10·7% after PCI vs 10·5% after CABG; 1·07, 0·87–1·33; p = 0·52), regardless of diabetes status and SYNTAX score.

Interpretation

CABG had a mortality benefit over PCI in patients with multivessel disease, particularly those with diabetes and higher coronary complexity. No benefit for CABG over PCI was seen in patients with left main disease. Longer follow-up is needed to better define mortality differences between the revascularisation strategies.

Funding

None.

### Critical appraisal of cardiology guidelines on revascularisation: clinical practice [^49c0947e]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

The 2014 ACC/AHA Guidelines on revascularisation recommend selection of coronary arterial bypass grafting (CABG) over percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patients with complex and multivessel acute coronary syndrome. The recommendation of CABG as the preferred intervention is made in three of six situations where patients have multivessel disease. These include specifically patients with:
three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) with intermediate to high CAD burden (multiple diffuse lesions, presence of chronic total occlusion (CTO) or high SYNTAX Score),
isolated left main stenosis,
left main stenosis and additional CAD with low CAD burden (one-vessel to two-vessel additional involvement and low SYNTAX Score).

PCI is ranked as a class IIa or class III/level B for all three of the above situations while CABG is ranked as a class I/level A or B in all three. The 2014 ESC guidelines make similar recommendations for patients with multivessel disease and intermediate to high CAD burden based on SYNTAX Score risk. These classifications suggest that CABG is a preferred intervention for these patients based on evidence defined in broad terms of the presence and number of studies available (table 1). Because research is not static and evidence is not absolute, a closer look at the recommendations cited evidence is warranted.

Table 1
ACCF/AHA/SCAI PCI guideline evidence definitions by class and level of recommendations

Evidence

The ACC and ESC Guideline rankings are based on the study findings from two major randomised controlled trials (RCTs): (1) the 5-year SYNTAX Trial and (2) the FREEDOM Trial. Other studies cited by the guidelines (Cardia, BARI, ARTS, MASS) pre-date the advancement of newer stents and/or are small and underpowered.

### Staging of multivessel percutaneous coronary interventions: an expert consensus statement from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^898a843c]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2012). Medium credibility.

Methods of determining significance of coronary disease — Angiographic percentage stenosis is a notorious source of variability, and because PCI of nonsignificant lesions does not decrease major adverse events or improve symptoms, functional tests should be used to decide whether PCI is warranted for angiographically stable, intermediate severity (50–70%) lesions. For physiologic assessment, an fractional flow reserve (FFR) of < 0.75 correlates well with ischemia on stress testing; for patients with an FFR between 0.75 and 0.80, angina at follow-up was less prevalent after PCI than with conservative management; and an FFR of > 0.75 or > 0.80 correlates with excellent long-term outcomes if PCI is deferred.

### Pre-procedural planning of coronary revascularization by cardiac computed tomography: an expert consensus document of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^9de94b95]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2022). High credibility.

CCTA and CT-FFR functional SYNTAX score — decision-making context is described as follows: The anatomic Syntax score quantifies the extent and anatomic complexity of CAD based on the visual assessment of a significant stenosis (> 50%) diagnosed by ICA. The functional SYNTAX score (FSS) adopting physiological parameter such as fractional flow ratio in anatomical SYNTAX score reclassifies a substantial number of patients with multivessel disease from high to lower risk of adverse events after PCI. Because of its significant prognostic value in patients with 3VD or LM disease, undergoing either PCI or CABG, the Syntax score is part of the guidelines and has been increasingly used during Heart Team discussion to decide the revascularization mode (CABG or PCI).

### Predictors of long-term outcomes after bypass grafting versus drug-eluting stent implantation for left main or multivessel coronary artery disease [^04abd444]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

Background

We assessed predictors of long-term outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) versus those after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES) in 3,230 patients with left main or multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD).

Methods and Results

Data were pooled from the BEST, PRECOMBAT, and SYNTAX trials. Age, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) were common predictors of all-cause mortality. Diabetes mellitus, previous myocardial infarction (MI), and SYNTAX score were independent predictors of all-cause mortality in the PCI group, but not in the CABG group. In the CABG group, age was the only risk factor for MI; left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension, and PAD were risk factors for stroke. On the other hand, in the PCI group, incomplete revascularization and previous MI were risk factors for MI; age and previous stroke for stroke. In addition, chronic kidney disease significantly correlated with a composite outcome of death, MI, or stroke in the CABG group, and incomplete revascularization and previous MI in the PCI group.

Conclusions

Simple clinical variables and SYNTAX score differentially predict long-term outcomes after CABG versus those after PCI with DES for left main or multivessel CAD. Those predictors might help to guide the choice of revascularization strategy. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Left main coronary artery disease (LM CAD) — prevalence and PCI vs CABG outcomes: Significant LM CAD is observed in 5–7% of diagnostic coronary angiography cases, with 80% of LM lesions occurring at the distal bifurcation. In unprotected LM with multivessel CAD, intermediate and long-term major adverse cardiovascular events are comparable between percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) provided the baseline SYNTAX score is ≤ 32, but PCI of LM lesions is associated with a higher repeat revascularization rate, especially with distal bifurcation disease, as compared with CABG.

Coronary catheterization (ICA)

A digital ICA system (AlluraXper FD10, Philips Medical System, Best, Netherlands) was used to acquire cineangiographic images. CAD was typically diagnosed when there was 50% or greater luminal narrowing in one or more major coronary arteries. The SYNTAX score (version 2.28,) was utilized to assess the complexity of CAD, particularly in patients with multivessel disease. Two cardiologists with more than five years of interventional experience independently assessed the SYNTAX score. When their scores differed, a third interventional cardiologist with more than ten years of interventional experience was involved in the evaluation process.

### Bypass grafting versus percutaneous intervention-which is better in multivessel coronary disease: lessons from SYNTAX and beyond [^96fc2302]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The landmark Synergy between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) Trial has aided in reducing the area of uncertainty in decision-making between percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in patients with complex coronary artery disease. As part of the SYNTAX Trial, quantification of the coronary artery disease burden was prospectively undertaken by the Heart Team - consisting of at least an interventional cardiologist and cardiac surgeon - utilising the anatomical SYNTAX Score (www.syntaxscore.com) as a clinical tool in order to agree that equivalent anatomical revascularisation could be achieved. The anatomical SYNTAX Score is now advocated in both European and US revascularisation guidelines to guide decision-making between CABG and PCI as part of the SYNTAX pioneered Heart Team approach. In addition, the SYNTAX Trial has lead to the development and validation of the SYNTAX Score II, in which the anatomical SYNTAX Score was augmented with clinical variables, to allow for more objective and tailored decision making for the individual patient. Prospective validation of the SYNTAX Score II tool is currently ongoing in the SYNTAX II (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02015832) and EXCEL (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01205776) trials. The present paper presents lessons learned from SYNTAX, including the development and/or validation of several SYNTAX based clinical tools, and the potential implications for current and future clinical practice.

### Multidisciplinary heart team approach for complex coronary artery disease: single center clinical presentation [^269eb942]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Determining the optimal treatment strategy for patients with complex coronary artery disease (CAD) requires assessment of each patient's presenting illness, clinical stability, coronary anatomy, comorbidities, and goals of care. An informed decision to pursue percutaneous or surgical revascularization in patients with multivessel or left main CAD may be optimized when appropriate stakeholders — primary care physicians, cardiologists, interventional cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, patients, and family members — communicate and proceed in a coordinated, interdisciplinary manner. Professional society guidelines, risk calculators, and appropriate use criteria provide a framework that may help guide management at the bedside. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 However, the complexities of integrating patient‐centered shared decision‐making with evidence‐based medicine in the context of multiple comorbid disease entities substantiate the potential benefit of a multidisciplinary team‐based approach to medical care. 6, 7

The multidisciplinary "Heart Team" (HT) approach has been espoused and deployed for multiple conditions relevant to cardiovascular medicine: valvular heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary embolism, and cardiogenic shock. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 European professional society guidelines first mandated a team‐based approach to decision‐making for multivessel CAD in 2010. 13 This was followed by American‐centered guidelines in 2014 that provided a class I recommendation for the HT strategy in managing stable ischemic heart disease. 1 These recommendations follow from the data and experience of multiple large randomized clinical trials that have compared percutaneous and surgical revascularization in patients with complex coronary disease. For instance, the Synergy Between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) trial included in its design a formalized protocol for assessment of patients by both interventional cardiology and cardiac surgery. 14

Implementation of the rich evidence base guiding CAD management to the nuances of real‐world practice can be challenging, thus supporting the role of an interdisciplinary model of care for ischemic heart disease. 14, 15, 16 In this study, we describe the structure and deployment of a multidisciplinary HT for patients with complex CAD, as well as the clinical outcomes at a single institution with the use of this approach over a 3‐year time period since its inception. Furthermore, in this team model, we created and employed a practical HT form that integrates the use of US and European practice guidelines, validated surgical and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) risk scores, and SYNTAX grading to aid in patient‐centered decision‐making. In addition, we implemented an interventional cardiology consultative service to provide formal recommendations for these patients with complex CAD presentations.

### Percutaneous coronary intervention for left main stem disease: impact of diabetes mellitus on mortality [^e69e09cf]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Our analysis of patients treated with LMS PCI showed that DM status was not an independent predictor of 30‐day in the non‐emergency setting. It had only a borderline statistical association with long‐term mortality.

When considering DM subtypes, ITDM but not NITDM was associated with mortality, with the greatest impact in the emergency setting — a finding reported previously in a large series of patients undergoing PCI to any vessel. 12 We can speculate that the higher burden of cardiovascular risk factors such as PVD and renal disease, multivessel disease and low usage of radial access may have contributed to the increased mortality seen in the ITDM group.

Previous studies have shown that DM adversely affects outcomes following PCI. 13, 14 However, our study showed a differential impact on mortality dependent on DM type. This may be the result of significant improvement in risk factor control, leading to the reduction of CAD risk in diabetes. 15 The rates of diabetes‐related macrovascular complications have also reduced significantly in the past two decades. 16 Secondary preventative strategies continue to evolve with SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrating a significant reduction in major adverse cardiac events in Type 2 DM with established CAD. 17

Left main stem disease is associated with significant myocardial jeopardy and CABG has historically been the preferred revascularization modality. In diabetic patients requiring revascularization, CABG with an internal mammary graft to the left anterior descending artery, has been associated with lower mortality compared with PCI in the setting of complex multivessel disease in randomized controlled trials. 4, 18 Current guidelines recommend CABG as the standard of care for diabetic patients with CAD of intermediate to high SYNTAX scores including in the setting of LMS disease. 2 However, DM was not an independent predictor of events once the SYNTAX score was entered in the multivariable model. 19 Consequently, DM is excluded in the SYNTAX 2 score that helps determine the preferred revascularization strategy. 20 In a pooled analysis of three randomized trials comparing CABG versus PCI in patients with DM and low or intermediate anatomic complexity (SYNTAX less or equal to 32), both groups had similar 5‐year rates of all‐cause death, cardiac death, and the composite of death, MI, or stroke. 21

Recommendations for Management of CAD

The following recommendations take an institutional approach to the management of cardiovascular disease in patients with advanced CKD based on a comprehensive review of the literature and the currently available guidelines.

Given the importance of preexistent CAD for outcomes after renal transplantation, transplantation candidates should have a thorough evaluation for CAD prior to inclusion on the waiting list, as outlined in Figure 1. Careful clinical history and baseline ECG should be performed in all patients. We perform echocardiography to assess ventricular dimensions and function, recognizing that no studies have specifically addressed appropriateness and cost‐effectiveness of this universal approach in transplant candidates. Moreover, given the presence of multiple risk factors for CAD in this patient population, noninvasive testing with dobutamine stress echocardiogram or, preferably, nuclear stress imaging with SPECT or PET are the initial tests that we use to screen for the presence of CAD. Negative results should be interpreted in the context of the pretest probability in individual patients, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus with autonomic dysfunction and microvascular complications. 37, 42, 43, 44 Patients with multiple risk factors for CAD (≥ 3 risk factors: diabetes mellitus, prior cardiovascular disease, > 1 year on dialysis, LVH, peripheral arterial disease, age > 60 years, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia) should be considered for further imaging or cardiac catheterization despite a negative stress test in some instances. In such patients, noninvasive imaging with PET is a prudent second‐line investigation if coronary angiography is to be avoided because of advanced CKD and risk of progression to RRT. A normal PET stress test with abnormal multivessel coronary flow reserve is also a consideration for coronary angiography. 36 Repeated evaluation is recommended on an annual basis in patients at high risk, with reevaluation every 3 years for low‐risk patients.

Patients with evidence of ischemia on stress test should be referred for left heart catheterization to identify prognostically significant CAD. Revascularization by PCI or CABG for 3‐vessel disease should be pursued if indicated. The choice to place a BMS or a DES should be individualized to each patient. BMSs or polymer‐ and carrier‐free DESs may be used in patients who require more urgent renal transplantation and a shorter course of DAPT. 61 Stent placement with intravascular imaging guidance is recommended to optimize the intervention as imaging guidance has been shown to result in a larger final minimal stent area, minimizing the risk of restenosis and stent thrombosis. 69

### Ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention: a consensus statement from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^a879aa9a]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Medium credibility.

Ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) decision flow and intraprocedural assessment are depicted, outlining a pathway that asks whether the "Target Lesion [is] Consistent with Noninvasive Study or Angiographically Significant?" and, if not, considers "FFR/IVUS or Defer to Perform Noninvasive Study", with a "Trial of Medical Therapy" option included in the flow. Additional decision points include "Patient on Maximal Medical Therapy?", assessment of "High Risk Anatomy? (eg, left main disease, 3 vessel disease with high SYNTAX score",), the need for consent or team input via "Need Additional Consent for Lesion Subset or Need for Heart Team/Shared Decision Making?", and safety considerations ("Excess Radiation? Excess Contrast? Peri-procedural Complications? Operator/Patient Fatigue?"). Fractional flow reserve (FFR) performed immediately after diagnostic angiography "can help distinguish lesions that are hemodynamically significant and, therefore, appropriate for ad hoc PCI", while intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) "may be useful in assessing the severity of coronary lesions, but it is not able to assess functional or hemodynamic significance, and there is no consensus on the criteria that define a hemodynamically significant lesion". In multivessel CAD, "Decisions about ad hoc PCI… are complex since angiography may overestimate and stress imaging may underestimate the number of significant lesions", and "FFR-guided PCI produces better outcomes than angiographically guided PCI for multivessel CAD".

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk pathway — definitions and endpoints are specified as follows: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is defined as a history of an acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction (MI), stable or unstable angina, coronary heart disease with or without revascularization, other arterial revascularization, stroke, or peripheral artery disease assumed to be atherosclerotic in origin. Cardiovascular (CV) disease includes ASCVD, HF, and CV-related death. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a clinical diagnosis marked by a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the presence of albuminuria, or both in a patient with diabetes. Heart failure (HF) is defined per criteria outlined in referenced ACC/AHA documents, and an HF event, including hospitalization, is defined by the 2014 ACC/AHA Key Data Elements and Definitions for Cardiovascular Endpoint Events in Clinical Trials. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is defined as clinical diagnosis of HF and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%. High risk for ASCVD includes patients with end organ damage such as left ventricular hypertrophy or retinopathy, or multiple risk factors (e.g., age, hypertension, smoking, obesity, dyslipidemia). Major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) is either a "3-point MACE" composite of nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or CV death or a "4- point MACE" composite of nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or CV death.
