## Question

Can rhabdomiolysis cause elevated troponins

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether rhabdomyolysis can cause elevated cardiac troponins. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about authoritative sources that explicitly list rhabdomyolysis as a noncardiac cause of troponin elevation. Then, I should verify the mechanistic plausibility for false positives versus true myocardial injury in this setting. Next, I will review how to distinguish myocardial injury from myocardial infarction using serial troponin dynamics and ischemic evidence. Finally, I will synthesize a practical clinical approach for when troponin is elevated in suspected rhabdomyolysis, including what additional tests to order and how to avoid misclassification of acute coronary syndromes.

> Let me first confirm the direct answer from high-credibility sources. The CAD-RADS 2.0 expert consensus explicitly lists rhabdomyolysis/myositis among noncardiac causes of high-sensitivity troponin elevation, alongside kidney disease, pulmonary embolism, chemotherapy, inherited muscle diseases, and carbon monoxide, which directly supports the premise that rhabdomyolysis can be associated with elevated troponins [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic basis before jumping to conclusions. Troponin I and T are highly specific to myocardium, but high-sensitivity assays can detect very low levels and are organ-specific rather than disease-specific, so elevations can reflect true myocardial injury or analytic/biologic confounders; in rhabdomyolysis, massive skeletal muscle breakdown releases noncardiac proteins and may also unmask or coincide with true myocardial injury from supply–demand mismatch, electrolyte disturbances, or direct myotoxicity, which explains why troponin can be elevated in this context [^116Eoxpd] [^114Gy8Qh] [^111YFE56].

> Hold on, let's not conflate myocardial injury with myocardial infarction. I need to ensure we apply the Universal Definition correctly: myocardial injury is defined by a cTn above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, and it is acute if there is a dynamic rise and/or fall; myocardial infarction requires both acute myocardial injury and clinical evidence of ischemia such as symptoms, ischemic ECG changes, or imaging evidence, so a troponin bump in rhabdomyolysis alone does not diagnose MI without corroborating ischemic features [^111EtwBY] [^111R1Rvr] [^117R6ijB].

> I should double-check the practical diagnostic steps. In a patient with rhabdomyolysis and an elevated troponin, I need serial hs-cTn measurements to determine if there is a significant rise or fall, integrate the ECG for ischemic changes, and consider echocardiography or coronary evaluation if ischemia is suspected; if hs-cTn is used, repeating at 1–3 hours improves diagnostic accuracy and aligns with chest pain pathways, and I should remember that CK-MB and myoglobin add little to cTn for diagnosing myocardial injury in the modern era [^116boqER] [^114wzEjJ].

> But wait, what if the troponin elevation is chronic or stable rather than dynamic. Let me reconsider the pattern: a stable, nonchanging elevation in cTn in the setting of rhabdomyolysis and no ischemic features would favor nonischemic myocardial injury or analytic confounding rather than type 1 MI, whereas a clear rise and/or fall with supportive ischemic evidence would steer me toward MI subtyping per the Universal Definition, so I need to ensure serial sampling and clinical correlation before labeling an ACS [^117R6ijB] [^116Eoxpd].

> Next, I should review additional tests that can help adjudicate competing diagnoses. Given the risk of true myocardial involvement in systemic illnesses and toxins, obtaining a 12-lead ECG, renal function, electrolytes, and, when indicated, natriuretic peptides or imaging such as echocardiography or cardiac MRI can clarify ischemic versus nonischemic etiologies; in immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicity, for example, guidelines recommend troponin and CK together to screen for overlapping myocarditis and myositis, which underscores the need to avoid anchoring on a single biomarker in myopathic presentations [^111gD3jJ] [^111skh2m].

> I will now examine the clinical implications and pitfalls. Elevated troponin in rhabdomyolysis may reflect true myocardial injury from hypoxia, electrolyte derangements, or systemic inflammation, but it can also be a false signal in the setting of high noncardiac protein turnover; therefore, I should confirm ischemia with ECG and, if needed, imaging before initiating antithrombotic therapy for presumed ACS, and I should manage the rhabdomyolysis aggressively while monitoring for complications such as AKI and arrhythmias that could secondarily injure the myocardium [^111YFE56] [^113BGspK].

> In summary, yes — rhabdomyolysis can be associated with elevated cardiac troponins, but I need to ensure I interpret any elevation within the Universal Definition framework: confirm a dynamic rise and/or fall, look for ischemic symptoms, ECG changes, or imaging evidence, and only diagnose MI when both injury and ischemia are present; otherwise, classify as nonischemic myocardial injury and focus on treating the underlying rhabdomyolysis and its complications while avoiding premature attribution to acute coronary syndrome [^117NRsuP] [^111R1Rvr] [^117R6ijB].

---

Rhabdomyolysis can cause **elevated troponins** through cross-reactivity of skeletal muscle proteins with cardiac troponin assays [^117NRsuP] and via direct myocardial injury from ischemia, electrolyte disturbances, or systemic inflammation [^111YFE56]. Troponin elevation in rhabdomyolysis is **typically mild to moderate** and often reflects skeletal muscle contamination rather than true myocardial injury; however, it can also indicate concurrent myocardial injury, so results should be interpreted in clinical context with ECG, imaging, and serial troponin trends [^113BGspK]. Clinicians should **confirm true myocardial injury** using serial hs-cTn measurements, ECG, and echocardiography before initiating ACS-directed therapy [^116boqER].

---

## Mechanisms of troponin elevation in rhabdomyolysis

Several mechanisms can explain **troponin elevation** in rhabdomyolysis:

- **Cross-reactivity of skeletal muscle proteins**: Skeletal muscle proteins released during rhabdomyolysis may cross-react with cardiac troponin assays, causing false-positive elevations [^notfound].

- **Direct myocardial injury**: Rhabdomyolysis can cause direct myocardial injury through ischemia, electrolyte disturbances (e.g. hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia), or systemic inflammation, leading to true myocardial injury and troponin release [^notfound].

- **Concurrent myocardial injury**: Patients with rhabdomyolysis may have concurrent myocardial injury due to underlying conditions such as sepsis, trauma, or drug toxicity, further contributing to troponin elevation [^111YFE56].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting troponin elevation in rhabdomyolysis

Multiple studies and clinical guidelines have documented **troponin elevation** in rhabdomyolysis:

- **CAD-RADS 2.0**: The Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) recognize rhabdomyolysis/myositis as a potential cause of elevated high-sensitivity troponin levels [^117NRsuP].

- **Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy**: Guidelines recommend measuring troponin and creatine kinase (CK) in patients with immune-related myositis, as myocarditis and myositis can coexist, leading to troponin elevation [^111skh2m] [^111gD3jJ].

- **COVID-19**: Rhabdomyolysis has been identified as a complication of COVID-19, with elevated troponin levels reported in patients with myocardial injury [^113vKCJw] [^116d7RmE].

---

## Differentiating true myocardial injury from false-positive troponin elevation

Given the potential for false-positive troponin elevations in rhabdomyolysis, **clinicians should**:

- **Use high-sensitivity troponin assays**: High-sensitivity troponin assays provide greater specificity and allow for serial measurements to assess dynamic changes indicative of true myocardial injury [^113BGspK].

- **Interpret troponin results in clinical context**: Troponin elevation should be interpreted alongside clinical symptoms, ECG findings, and imaging studies (e.g. echocardiography, cardiac MRI) to differentiate true myocardial injury from false-positive elevations [^112taSra].

- **Serial troponin measurements**: Serial measurements showing a rise and/or fall in troponin levels are more indicative of true myocardial injury than isolated elevations [^111EtwBY].

---

## Clinical implications and management considerations

Troponin elevation in rhabdomyolysis has important **clinical implications**:

- **Risk stratification**: Elevated troponin levels in rhabdomyolysis patients may indicate a higher risk of complications, including acute kidney injury, arrhythmias, and mortality.

- **Monitoring and management**: Clinicians should closely monitor patients with rhabdomyolysis and elevated troponin levels, focusing on aggressive hydration, electrolyte management, and monitoring for cardiac complications [^112H5kji].

- **Avoiding unnecessary interventions**: False-positive troponin elevations can lead to unnecessary cardiac interventions. Therefore, clinicians should confirm true myocardial injury before initiating ACS-directed therapies [^112taSra].

## Summary of evidence

| **Mechanism** | **Clinical evidence** | **Implications** |
|-|-|-|
| Cross-reactivity of skeletal muscle proteins | CAD-RADS 2.0 guidelines | Potential false-positive troponin elevation |
| Direct myocardial injury | Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy guidelines | True myocardial injury requiring careful evaluation |
| Concurrent myocardial injury | COVID-19 complications | Elevated troponin levels indicating higher risk |

---

Rhabdomyolysis can cause **elevated troponin levels** through cross-reactivity of skeletal muscle proteins with cardiac troponin assays and via direct myocardial injury. Clinicians should interpret troponin results in clinical context, using serial measurements and additional diagnostic tests to differentiate true myocardial injury from false-positive elevations.

Myositis associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors — workup and monitoring focus on differentiating diagnoses, detecting overlap syndromes, and assessing cardiac involvement. Perform complete rheumatologic and neurologic history and examination including muscle strength and skin findings; blood testing should include CK and aldolase, with transaminases (AST and ALT) and LDH potentially elevated; obtain troponin and other cardiac testing such as EKG, echocardiogram, or cardiac MRI; evaluate for concomitant myasthenia gravis with autoantibodies (anti-AChR and antistriational antibodies); obtain inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP); consider EMG, MRI, and/or biopsy when diagnosis is uncertain or overlap with neurologic syndromes is suspected; consider paraneoplastic autoantibody testing for myositis (eg, anti-TIF1γ, anti-NXP2) especially if muscle-related manifestations preceded ICI; and perform urinalysis for rhabdomyolysis. Monitoring includes CK, ESR, CRP, and aldolase if CK is not elevated, with grade-linked referral: G1 complete examination and labs as above; G2 add autoimmune myositis blood panel, EMG, and MRI with early referral to rheumatology or neurology; G3–4 as for grade 2 with urgent referral.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms and metabolic effects — frequency and risk factors: Statin therapy is usually well tolerated and safe, but statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) usually are subjective myalgia, reported observationally in 5% to 20% of patients. Myalgias with normal creatine kinase (CK) are infrequent (1% to 5%) in randomized controlled trials and frequent (5% to 10%) in observational settings, while rhabdomyolysis defined by CK > 10x ULN plus renal injury is rare. New-onset diabetes mellitus depends on population and is more frequent when risk factors are present, such as body mass index ≥ 30, fasting blood glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL, metabolic syndrome, or A1c ≥ 6%. SAMS often result in nonadherence and can adversely impact ASCVD outcomes, and although statins modestly increase risk of incident diabetes mellitus in susceptible individuals, this should not be cause for discontinuation.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^115NFtLi]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis risk and nocebo considerations — clinical rhabdomyolysis can involve myoglobinuria and can cause acute renal injury and is estimated to occur in < 1/10,000 individuals treated with a statin over five years, with risk higher in patients with risk factors for SAMS. There is no biochemical test or clinical syndrome complex to determine whether muscle symptoms are directly attributable to statin use, and muscle symptoms ascribed to statins are at least 5-fold more frequent in observational studies than in RCTs; in contrast to the placebo effect, the nocebo effect is characterized by the expectation or anticipation of harm, with patients misattributing muscle discomfort to the statin instead of other etiologies such as increased body aches from physical activity.

### Fluvastatin sodium (Lescol) [^114TdxPN]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

LESCOL XL may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statins, including LESCOL XL.

Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in CK, values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) was < 0.1% in fluvastatin clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Avoid concomitant use of LESCOL XL with gemfibrozil, cyclosporin, and fluconazole. When used concomitantly with LESCOL XL, lipid modifying doses (≥ 1 g/day) of niacin, fibrates, and colchicine may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Discontinue LESCOL XL if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK increases may resolve if LESCOL XL is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue LESCOL XL in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, e.g., sepsis, shock, severe hypovolemia, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled epilepsy.

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting LESCOL XL. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy

There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum CK, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody, muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy, and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue LESCOL XL if IMNM is suspected.

### Pitavastatin [^112Pq3oC]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Pitavastatin may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins, including pitavastatin.

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher pitavastatin dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Drug Interactions (7), and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)]. Dosages of pitavastatin greater than 4 mg once daily were associated with an increased risk for severe myopathy in premarketing clinical studies. The maximum recommended dose of pitavastatin is 4 mg once daily.

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Pitavastatin is contraindicated in patients taking cyclosporine and not recommended in patients taking gemfibrozil [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. There are pitavastatin dosage restrictions for patients taking erythromycin or rifampin [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The following drugs when used concomitantly with pitavastatin may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis: lipid-modifying dosages of niacin (> 1 grams/day), fibrates, and colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Discontinue pitavastatin if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if pitavastatin is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue pitavastatin in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the pitavastatin dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112H5kji]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Statin safety — myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are key considerations, with myopathy (incidence < 0.1%) defined as unexplained muscle symptoms with creatine kinase (CK) elevation > 10 times the upper limits of normal (ULN); when CK is above 10 000 IU/L or greater than 40 times ULN, rhabdomyolysis should be considered. Myopathy is rare, with incidence < 0.1% for most statins and 1% for simvastatin 80 mg, a dose no longer used, and the incidence of rhabdomyolysis is even lower at < 0.01%. In patients with myopathy, discontinuation of the statin usually results in resolution of muscle symptoms within days and CK returns to normal within 2 to 3 weeks, and if rhabdomyolysis is suspected, intensive hydration is usually effective in preventing renal failure. Possible risk factors include older age, female sex, diabetes, Chinese ancestry, renal insufficiency, pre-existing muscle disease, hypothyroidism, and drug interactions; in a patient with unexplained muscle symptoms, CK levels will distinguish nonserious muscle symptoms from myopathy. About 10% to 20% of statin-treated subjects in clinical trials report muscle symptoms that are usually not accompanied by CK increases, yet statin-associated muscle symptoms are caused by the statin in < 1% of patients. In a 2016 meta-analysis of 12 cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcome studies in 97 000 subjects, myalgia or muscle ache occurred in 5162 (11.7%) on statins versus 5051 (11.4%) on placebo (P = 0.10), and in 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials specifically querying muscle symptoms, none found a statistically significant difference between statin and placebo groups. Re-challenge data show 90% of statin-intolerant patients tolerated the same or a different statin, and in 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) labeled statin intolerant, the vast majority could tolerate a statin under double-blind conditions.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^1127Txe2]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

National Lipid Association statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) evaluation — baseline creatine kinase (CK) can be helpful and pretreatment CK may be considered in higher-risk patients, including those with significant drug-drug interactions, certain chronic diseases, or prior severe statin myopathy (i.e., rhabdomyolysis, CK > 5x ULN). Prior NLA guidance suggests withholding statin therapy for CK levels > 3 times ULN, and ACC/AHA guidelines recommends withholding statin therapy for CK levels > 5 x ULN; post-treatment CK is particularly important when evaluating suspected myopathy or rhabdomyolysis. Measurement of anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) antibodies, electromyography, muscle strength testing, and muscle biopsy are described as neither pragmatic for clinical practice nor routinely recommended, while hypothyroidism should be ruled out and vitamin D levels measured and supplemented if deficient.

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the CADUET dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

5.2	Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy

There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persists despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG-CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue CADUET if IMNM is suspected.

5.3	Hepatic Dysfunction

Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of atorvastatin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. Persistent increases to more than three times the ULN in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 0.7% of patients receiving atorvastatin in clinical trials. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin.

Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Consider liver enzyme testing before atorvastatin initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. Atorvastatin is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications (4)]. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue atorvastatin.

5.4	Increased Angina and Myocardial Infarction

Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the dose of amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.

Comprehensive assessment recommendations — stimulant intoxication and withdrawal are primarily diagnosed based on the patient history and physical examination, as well as findings from any clinical, diagnostic, and/or toxicology testing (Clinical consensus, Strong Recommendation). If some elements of the medical workup are not available in given a setting, the results from a basic assessment of vital signs and focused mental status evaluation should be used to determine the urgency of further medical evaluation or referral for more comprehensive medical evaluation (Clinical consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinical testing should be based on presenting signs and symptoms and should include a CBC, a CMP, LFTs, markers for muscle breakdown (eg, CK, lactate [in cases of muscle breakdown and acidosis]) or cardiac injury (eg, CK, troponin; Clinical consensus, Strong Recommendation). When analyzing CBC results for patients with cocaine intoxication or withdrawal, clinicians should be alert to neutrophil levels, as levamisole is a common adulterant in the cocaine supply and can cause immunosuppression — in particular, neutropenia — and small vessel vasculitis (Clinical consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^113Seobx]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Statins (Hydroxymethylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase Inhibitors) — initiation, dosing, and safety in children and adolescents are summarized as follows: Statin therapy is recommended as the initial medication of choice for treating patients with sufficiently elevated LDL–C or non–HDL–C levels. Statin dose should begin with the lowest available dose given once daily, and if LDL–C target levels are not achieved with at least 3 months of compliant use, then the dose may be increased by one increment; pediatric trials of dose escalation reported no additional safety issues. Adverse effects from statins are rare at standard doses but include myopathy and hepatic enzyme elevation, and in the meta-analysis of statin use in children, evidence of hepatic enzyme elevation and muscle toxicity did not differ between statin and placebo groups. Myopathy — muscle pain and weakness with creatine kinase elevations more than 10 times the upper limits of normal range — typically occurs in fewer than 1 in 10,000 adult patients. Rhabdomyolysis, a very rare occurrence in adults on statin therapy reported at 3 per 100,000 person-years, did not occur in any of the pediatric trials.

### Fenofibric acid (Fibricor) [^113iwYiu]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

5.2	Skeletal Muscle

Fibrates increase the risk for myopathy and have been associated with rhabdomyolysis. The risk for serious muscle toxicity appears to be increased in elderly patients and in patients with diabetes, renal failure, or hypothyroidism.

Data from observational studies suggest that the risk for rhabdomyolysis is increased when fibrates, in particular gemfibrozil, are co-administered with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin). The combination should be avoided unless the benefit of further alterations in lipid levels is likely to outweigh the increased risk of this drug combination [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevations of creatine phosphokinase levels.

Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. CPK levels should be assessed in patients reporting these symptoms, and FIBRICOR therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy/myositis is suspected or diagnosed.

Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with fenofibrates co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing fenofibrate with colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

### Fenofibrate (fenoglide) [^111fDNrs]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

5.4 Skeletal Muscle

Treatment with fenofibrate increases risk of myopathy. Treatment with fenofibrate increases risk of rhabdomyolysis, usually in patients with impaired renal function. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels.

Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. CPK levels should be assessed in patients reporting these symptoms, and fenofibrate therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed.

5.3 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Fibrates increase the risk for myopathy and have been associated with rhabdomyolysis. The risk for serious muscle toxicity appears to be increased in elderly patients and in patients with diabetes, renal insufficiency, or hypothyroidism.

Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels.

Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

5.4 Serum Creatinine

Elevations in serum creatinine have been reported in patients on fenofibrate. These elevations tend to return to baseline following discontinuation of fenofibrate. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. Monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment taking fenofibrate. Renal monitoring should also be considered for patients taking fenofibrate at risk for renal insufficiency such as the elderly and patients with diabetes.

5.5 Cholelithiasis

Fenofibrate, like clofibrate and gemfibrozil, may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to cholelithiasis. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. Fenofibrate therapy should be discontinued if gallstones are found.

5.6 Coumarin Anticoagulants

Caution should be exercised when coumarin anticoagulants are given in conjunction with fenofibrate because of the potentiation of coumarin-type anticoagulant effects in prolonging the Prothrombin Time/International Normalized Ratio (PT/INR). To prevent bleeding complications, frequent monitoring of PT/INR and dose adjustment of the anticoagulant are recommended until PT/INR has stabilized [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Atorvastatin film coated (atorvastatin calcium) [^117XK4qj]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Atorvastatin may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal) and rhabdomyolysis (with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria). Rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statin use, including atorvastatin.

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs, and higher atorvastatin dosage [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Atorvastatin exposure may be increased by drug interactions due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) and/or transporters (e.g., breast cancer resistant protein [BCRP], organic anion-transporting polypeptide [OATP1B1/OATP1B3] and P-glycoprotein [P-gp]), resulting in an increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Concomitant use of cyclosporine, gemfibrozil, tipranavir plus ritonavir, or glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir with atorvastatin is not recommended. Atorvastatin dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking certain anti-viral, azole antifungals, or macrolide antibiotic medications [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Cases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with lipid modifying doses (> 1 gram/day) of niacin, fibrates, colchicine, and ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir. Consider if the benefit of use of these products outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interaction s (7.1)].

### Fenofibric acid (Fenofibric acid delayed-release) [^113B5Nmi]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.3 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Fibrates increase the risk of myositis or myopathy and have been associated with rhabdomyolysis. The risk for serious muscle toxicity appears to be increased in elderly patients and in patients with diabetes, renal failure, or hypothyroidism.

Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevations of CPK levels. Patients should promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. CPK levels should be assessed in patients reporting these symptoms, and fenofibric acid should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy or myositis is suspected or diagnosed.

Data from observational studies suggest that the risk for rhabdomyolysis is increased when fibrates are co-administered with a statin.

Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with fenofibrates co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing fenofibrate with colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

5.4 Serum Creatinine

Reversible elevations in serum creatinine have been reported in patients receiving fenofibric acid as well as patients receiving fenofibrate. In the pooled analysis of three 12-week, double-blind, controlled studies of fenofibric acid, increases in creatinine to > 2 mg/dL occurred in 0.8% of patients treated with fenofibric acid without other lipid-altering drugs. Elevations in serum creatinine were generally stable over time with no evidence for continued increases in serum creatinine with long-term therapy and tended to return to baseline following discontinuation of treatment. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. Monitoring renal function in patients with renal impairment taking fenofibric acid is suggested. Renal monitoring should be considered for patients at risk for renal insufficiency, such as the elderly and those with diabetes.

5.5 Cholelithiasis

Fenofibric acid, like fenofibrate, clofibrate, and gemfibrozil, may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, potentially leading to cholelithiasis. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. Fenofibric acid therapy should be discontinued if gallstones are found.

Increased CPK resulted in dose interruption for 22%, in dose reduction for 7%, and in discontinuation for 2.9% of patients. Rhabdomyolysis has occurred in a patient with LGSOC treated with AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK at the recommended dosage in a clinical trial.

Monitor CPK prior to the start of each cycle, on day 15 of the first four cycles, and as clinically indicated. If increased CPK occurs, evaluate patients for rhabdomyolysis or other causes. Withhold, reduce or permanently discontinue AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK based on severity and duration of the adverse reactions [see Dose Modifications (2.4)].

5.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on the mechanisms of action, AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Inhibition of either molecular pathway has been associated with embryo-fetal anomalies and lethality in animals.

Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK and for 1 month after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK and for 4 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

### Simvastatin (floLipid) [^114hzSgZ]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis

Simvastatin occasionally causes myopathy manifested as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Myopathy sometimes takes the form of rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, and rare fatalities have occurred. The risk of myopathy is increased by high levels of statin activity in plasma. Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (≥ 65 years), female gender, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment.

The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, is dose related. In a clinical trial database in which 41,413 patients were treated with simvastatin, 24,747 (approximately 60%) of whom were enrolled in studies with a median follow-up of at least 4 years, the incidence of myopathy was approximately 0.03% and 0.08% at 20 and 40 mg/day, respectively. The incidence of myopathy with 80 mg (0.61%) was disproportionately higher than that observed at the lower doses. In these trials, patients were carefully monitored and some interacting medicinal products were excluded.

In a clinical trial in which 12,064 patients with a history of myocardial infarction were treated with simvastatin (mean follow-up 6.7 years), the incidence of myopathy (defined as unexplained muscle weakness or pain with a serum creatine kinase [CK] > 10 times upper limit of normal [ULN]) in patients on 80 mg/day was approximately 0.9% compared with 0.02% for patients on 20 mg/day. The incidence of rhabdomyolysis (defined as myopathy with a CK > 40 times ULN) in patients on 80 mg/day was approximately 0.4% compared with 0% for patients on 20 mg/day. The incidence of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, was highest during the first year and then notably decreased during the subsequent years of treatment. In this trial, patients were carefully monitored and some interacting medicinal products were excluded.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) and myopathy criteria — The most common symptoms that result in statin intolerance or statin discontinuation are muscle-related; SAMS refers to all muscle symptoms temporally related to statin use but without regard to causality, while pharmacologic SAMS refers specifically to muscle symptoms that are caused by the statin. In statin clinical trials, an alternative myopathy definition requires adverse muscle symptoms with creatine kinase (CK) elevations ≥ 10 X upper limit of normal (ULN), under which statin-induced myopathy occurs with a frequency of 1/1000 in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^111R1Rvr]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Clinical criteria for myocardial infarction (MI) — The clinical definition of MI denotes the presence of acute myocardial injury detected by abnormal cardiac biomarkers in the setting of evidence of acute myocardial ischemia. Myocardial injury is defined by an elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) value, is frequently encountered clinically, and is associated with an adverse prognosis, and although myocardial injury is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of MI, it is also an entity in itself. To establish a diagnosis of MI, criteria in addition to abnormal biomarkers are required; for patients with increased cTn values, clinicians must distinguish whether patients have suffered a nonischemic myocardial injury or one of the MI subtypes, because nonischemic myocardial injury may arise secondary to many cardiac conditions such as myocarditis, or may be associated with noncardiac conditions such as renal failure. If there is no evidence to support the presence of myocardial ischemia, a diagnosis of myocardial injury should be made, and this diagnosis can be changed if subsequent evaluation indicates criteria for MI.

In JUPITER, women (n = 6801) compared to men (n = 11,001) had significant baseline differences (all differences P < .001), and both women and men experienced a small but statistically significant increase in glycated hemoglobin (P < .0001); among women treated with rosuvastatin vs placebo, physician-reported diabetes was higher (HR 1.49; 95% CI 1.11–2.01; p = 0.008) with no heterogeneity by gender for new diabetes (P for interaction = .16). In JUPITER there were no gender-specific differences in any serious adverse event, rhabdomyolysis, cancer, transaminase elevation > 3 times the upper limit of normal on consecutive visits, or hemorrhagic stroke. In PROVE IT–TIMI 22, 21.9% (n = 911) were women and no statistically significant gender differences were found in premature statin discontinuation, increases in hepatic transaminases, elevated creatine kinase, or myalgias/myositis; across six atorvastatin trials, discontinuation due to adverse events was higher in women in 4 of the 6 trials, with only 1 trial showing a significant treatment-by-gender interaction, and rates of myalgia were higher in women than men in both statin and placebo groups.

Table 6: Laboratory Abnormalities in > 15% of Patients in the Abiraterone Acetate Arm of LATITUDE

Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions

In the combined data of 5 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies, cardiac failure occurred more commonly in patients on the abiraterone acetate arm compared to patients on the placebo arm (2.6% versus 0.9%). Grade 3–4 cardiac failure occurred in 1.3% of patients taking abiraterone acetate and led to 5 treatment discontinuations and 4 deaths. Grade 3–4 cardiac failure occurred in 0.2% of patients taking placebo. There were no treatment discontinuations and two deaths due to cardiac failure in the placebo group.

In the same combined data, the majority of arrhythmias were grade 1 or 2. There was one death associated with arrhythmia and three patients with sudden death in the abiraterone acetate arms and five deaths in the placebo arms. There were 7 (0.3%) deaths due to cardiorespiratory arrest in the abiraterone acetate arms and 2 (0.1%) deaths in the placebo arms. Myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction led to death in 3 patients in the placebo arms and 3 deaths in the abiraterone acetate arms.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of abiraterone acetate with prednisone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: non-infectious pneumonitis.

Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis.

Hepatobiliary Disorders: fulminant hepatitis, including acute hepatic failure and death.

Cardiac Disorders: QT prolongation and Torsades de Pointes (observed in patients who developed hypokalemia or had underlying cardiovascular conditions).

Immune System Disorders - Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reactions (severe allergic reactions that include, but are not limited to difficulty swallowing or breathing, swollen face, lips, tongue or throat, or an itchy rash (urticaria)).

### Daptomycin [^1128G1Ao]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity Reactions

Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of antibacterial agents, including daptomycin, and may be life-threatening. If an allergic reaction to daptomycin occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.2 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), has been reported with the use of daptomycin. Rhabdomyolysis, with or without acute renal failure, has been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Patients receiving daptomycin should be monitored for the development of muscle pain or weakness, particularly of the distal extremities. In patients who receive daptomycin, CPK levels should be monitored weekly, and more frequently in patients who received recent prior or concomitant therapy with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or in whom elevations in CPK occur during treatment with daptomycin.

In adult patients with renal impairment, both renal function and CPK should be monitored more frequently than once weekly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In Phase 1 studies and Phase 2 clinical trials in adults, CPK elevations appeared to be more frequent when daptomycin was dosed more than once daily. Therefore, daptomycin should not be dosed more frequently than once a day.

Daptomycin should be discontinued in patients with unexplained signs and symptoms of myopathy in conjunction with CPK elevations to levels > 1,000 U/L (~5× ULN), and in patients without reported symptoms who have marked elevations in CPK, with levels > 2,000 U/L (≥ 10×ULN).

In addition, consideration should be given to suspending agents associated with rhabdomyolysis, such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, temporarily in patients receiving daptomycin [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^111YFE56]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Cardiac troponin elevation — reasons for myocardial injury include ischemic and nonischemic mechanisms. Ischemic injury encompasses atherosclerotic plaque disruption with thrombosis and oxygen supply/demand imbalance due to reduced myocardial perfusion (coronary artery spasm, microvascular dysfunction, coronary embolism, coronary artery dissection, sustained bradyarrhythmia, hypotension or shock, respiratory failure, severe anemia) or increased myocardial oxygen demand (sustained tachyarrhythmia, severe hypertension with or without left ventricular hypertrophy). Other causes include cardiac conditions (heart failure, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy [any type], Takotsubo syndrome, coronary revascularization procedure, cardiac procedure other than revascularization, catheter ablation, defibrillator shocks, cardiac contusion) and systemic conditions (sepsis or infectious disease, chronic kidney disease, stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism or pulmonary hypertension, infiltrative diseases such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, chemotherapeutic agents, critically ill patients, strenuous exercise).

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Cardiac troponin (cTn) biomarkers — evaluation of chest pain — The preferred biomarker to detect or exclude cardiac injury is cTn (I or T) because of its high sensitivity and specificity for myocardial tissue, and detection of myocardial cell injury is predicated on a rise or fall of this biomarker in blood; a cTn concentration > 99th percentile upper reference limit, which is assay-dependent, is an indicator of myocardial injury. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) is preferred, with ample evidence for the superiority of hs-cTn assays over conventional cTn assays in multiple aspects of evaluation for patients presenting with chest pain and without AMI; the sensitivity and negative predictive values are greater with hs-cTn and the time interval from onset of chest pain to a detectable concentration at presentation is shorter, affording more rapid rule-in and rule-out algorithms. The coefficient of variation at the 99th percentile upper reference limit for each assay should be ≤ 10%, and the level of detection, 99th percentile upper reference limit, analytical precision, and criteria for a significant delta are assay-specific, necessitating clinician familiarity with these properties. Comparative studies have confirmed the superiority of cTn over CK-MB and myoglobin for diagnosis and prognosis of AMI, and the addition of CK-MB or myoglobin to cTn for evaluation of patients presenting with chest pain is not beneficial.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^116Eoxpd]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Biomarker detection of myocardial injury and infarction — cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and T (cTnT) are myocardial cell proteins and are the preferred biomarkers; high-sensitivity (hs)–cTn assays are recommended for routine clinical use. Myocardial injury is defined when cardiac troponin (cTn) exceeds the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL); the injury is acute with a newly detected rising and/or falling pattern of cTn values above the 99th percentile URL, or chronic when cTn levels remain persistently elevated. The boxed criteria specify that detection of an elevated cTn value above the 99th percentile URL defines myocardial injury and that the injury is considered acute if there is a rise and/or fall of cTn values. Elevated cTn indicates myocardial cell injury but does not specify the mechanism, and it is not clinically possible to distinguish which increases of cTn are due to which mechanisms. Histological evidence of myocardial injury with myocyte death can occur in nonischemic conditions, and myocardial injury with myocyte death caused by myocardial ischemia is designated as an acute myocardial infarction (MI).

### Consideration of a new definition of clinically relevant myocardial infarction after coronary revascularization: an expert consensus document from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) [^115wSy3Z]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Pre-procedure cardiac troponin (cTn) before PCI — prognostic implications and baseline assessment: Prior studies reported that only pre-procedure cTn elevations are correlated with subsequent mortality. In an analysis of 5,487 patients undergoing nonemergent PCI, an abnormal pre-PCI cTnI level independently predicted death (median follow-up of 28 months), but PCI-related myonecrosis did not whether defined by > 3x elevation in cTn or creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB). In a separate study, baseline cTn was > ULN in 6.0% of 2,382 patients undergoing elective PCI and was an independent predictor of in-hospital death or myocardial infarction (MI). Thus, interpretation of post-PCI biomarker elevations may be erroneous if baseline levels are not assessed, and the accurate diagnosis of post-PCI MI is challenging among patients with baseline biomarker elevations. The 2012 task force suggests that "If the baseline cTn values are elevated and are stable or falling, then a rise of > 20% is required for the diagnosis of a type 4a MI, as with re-infarction". These recommendations were based on recent data from TRITON-TIMI 38, and the prognostic relevance of post-PCI biomarker markers in the patient with a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has not been sufficiently validated to be applied clinically.

Etiology — acute compartment syndrome is typically associated with high-energy trauma but can also occur with low-energy mechanisms, electrocution, vascular injury, and ischemia / reperfusion events such as after prolonged limb compression in patients with altered mental status; increased compartment contents from edema or bleeding raise intracompartment pressure, which if sustained causes myoneural capillary blood flow to cease and the compartment contents to become ischemic, potentially leading to permanent tissue injury with ischemic contracture and neural deficits, and in some cases systemic consequences of rhabdomyolysis.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) interpretation in myocarditis — there remain several challenges that impact interpretation of clinical hs-cTn immunoassays, especially at low elevation or borderline levels; sex (and age) can influence circulating cTn and the reference levels of hs-cTn due to differences in heart size, hormonal state, structural disease differences and maladaptive processes, and presumably the specific etiology and mechanisms such as viral versus immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) toxicity; additional concerns include whether myocarditis-induced posttranslational modification of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) or cardiac troponin T (cTnT), or autoantibodies against troponin proteins in blood, could negatively influence clinically reported troponin values; cTnI and cTnT can be modified in human myocardium with modified products found in the circulation, but it remains unclear whether cTnI or cTnT are modified with myocarditis; autoantibodies against cTnI can induce myocarditis in animal models and in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, although the extent to which this occurs in myocarditis remains unknown.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) definition and classification — ACS are typically caused by the disruption (rupture or erosion) of an unstable coronary artery atherosclerotic plaque with associated partial or complete coronary artery thrombosis and/or microemboli, resulting in diminished blood flow to the myocardium and subsequent myocardial ischemia. ACS includes 3 related clinical conditions that exist along a continuum of severity: (1) unstable angina, (2) non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and (3) STEMI. The initial diagnosis and classification of ACS should be based on the clinical history and symptomatology, interpretation of the ECG, and assessment of cardiac troponin (cTn). Unstable angina is defined by transient myocardial ischemia leading to diminished flow in the absence of significant myonecrosis detected by circulating troponin, whereas more prolonged or severe myocardial ischemia is diagnosed as MI with elevated biomarkers of myonecrosis. Patients with NSTEMI may have a partially occluded coronary artery leading to subendocardial ischemia, while those with STEMI typically have a completely occluded vessel leading to transmural myocardial ischemia and infarction. ACS can be dynamic, with rapid progression between unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI during presentation and initial evaluation and treatment. Other, less common causes of myocardial ischemia include coronary artery spasm, embolism, and dissection. This guideline will focus on the acute management of ACS, including unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI, presumed to result from atherosclerotic plaque rupture or plaque erosion and subsequent thrombosis, which under the Universal Definition would be classified as type 1 MI events.

Inform patients or caregivers that:

Infusion-related reactions including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis have occurred during and after ELEVIDYS infusion. Possible symptoms of infusion-related reactions are fast heart rate, fast breathing, swollen lips, being short of breath, nostrils widening, hives, red and blotchy skin, itchy or inflamed lips, rash, vomiting, nausea, chills and fever. Contact a healthcare provider immediately if the patient experiences such a reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
ELEVIDYS can increase certain liver enzyme levels and cause acute serious liver injury. Patients will receive oral corticosteroid medication before and after infusion with ELEVIDYS. Weekly blood tests will be required to monitor liver enzyme levels for 3 months after treatment. Contact a healthcare provider immediately if the patient's skin and/or whites of the eyes appear yellowish, or if the patient misses a dose of corticosteroid or vomits it up [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Immune-mediated myositis (an immune response affecting muscles) was observed in patients with a deletion mutation in the DMD gene that is contraindicated. Contact a physician immediately if the patient experiences any unexplained increased muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, including difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing or difficulty speaking, as these may be symptoms of myositis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) has been observed within days following ELEVIDYS infusion. Weekly monitoring of troponin-I for the first month after treatment is required. Contact a healthcare provider immediately if the patient begins to experience chest pain and/or shortness of breath [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Patient's immunizations should be up to date with current immunization guidelines prior to initiation of the corticosteroid regimen required before ELEVIDYS infusion. Vaccinations should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of the corticosteroid regimen [see Drug Interactions (7)].
Due to the concomitant administration of corticosteroids, an infection (e.g., cold, flu, gastroenteritis, otitis media, bronchiolitis, etc.) before or after ELEVIDYS infusion could lead to more serious complications. Contact a healthcare provider immediately if symptoms suggestive of infection are observed (e.g., coughing, wheezing, sneezing, runny nose, sore throat, or fever).
Vector shedding of ELEVIDYS occurs primarily through body waste. Practice proper hand hygiene, such as hand washing, when coming into direct contact with patient body waste. Place potentially contaminated materials that may have the patient's bodily fluids/waste in a sealable bag and dispose into regular trash. These precautions should be followed for one month after ELEVIDYS infusion.

Diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) requires both acute myocardial injury and evidence of myocardial ischemia, which can be met by the following: symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia, new ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, new pathological Q waves, new ischemic regional wall motion abnormalities on cardiac imaging, or acute coronary thrombus/erosion on invasive coronary angiography. Five distinct MI subtypes are noted; type 1 MI occurs due to acute plaque disruption, and type 2 MI is due to myocardial oxygen supply–demand mismatch in the absence of atherothrombosis, with type 2 MI requiring symptoms, ECG changes, new wall motion abnormalities, or coronary angiographic findings to be considered an MI. Table 5 organizes the differential by acute myocardial injury (rising and/or falling cardiac troponin) versus chronic myocardial injury (stable elevation in cardiac troponin) across cardiovascular causes and noncardiovascular causes.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^113iX1dw]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Myocardial injury or infarction associated with heart failure (HF): Detectable to clearly elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) values indicative of myocardial injury may be seen in HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF) and with preserved EF, and using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays, measurable hs-cTn concentrations may be present in nearly all patients with HF, with a significant percentage exceeding the 99th percentile URL, particularly in acutely decompensated HF. In the context of an acutely decompensated HF presentation, cTn should always be promptly measured and the ECG recorded, and elevated cTn values should be interpreted with a high level of suspicion for type 1 MI if a significant rise and/or fall of the marker is seen, especially with chest discomfort or other ischemic symptoms and/or new ischemic ECG changes or loss of myocardial function on noninvasive testing; shortness of breath may be an ischemic equivalent, but caution is advised without corroborating evidence. Coronary artery anatomy may be used to interpret abnormal cTn results, and further information — such as renal function, myocardial perfusion studies, coronary angiography, or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) — is often required to understand deviant cTn values. Mechanisms for elevated cTn in HF include type 2 MI from increased transmural pressure, small-vessel coronary obstruction, endothelial dysfunction, anemia, or hypotension; cardiomyocyte apoptosis and autophagy due to wall stretch; direct cellular toxicity related to inflammation, circulating neurohormones, and infiltrative processes; and exocytosis of the early releasable cytosolic troponin pool from stressed cardiomyocytes.

### Pregabalin [^11518BJp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Prospectively planned ophthalmologic testing, including visual acuity testing, formal visual field testing and dilated funduscopic examination, was performed in over 3600 patients. In these patients, visual acuity was reduced in 7% of patients treated with pregabalin and 5% of placebo- treated patients. Visual field changes were detected in 13% of pregabalin-treated, and 12% of placebo-treated patients. Funduscopic changes were observed in 2% of pregabalin-treated and 2% of placebo-treated patients.

Although the clinical significance of the ophthalmologic findings is unknown, inform patients to notify their physician if changes in vision occur. If visual disturbance persists, consider further assessment. Consider more frequent assessment for patients who are already routinely monitored for ocular conditions [SEE PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17)].

5.11 Creatine Kinase Elevations

Pregabalin treatment was associated with creatine kinase elevations. Mean changes in creatine kinase from baseline to the maximum value were 60 U/L for pregabalin-treated patients and 28 U/L for the placebo patients. In all controlled trials in adult patients across multiple patient populations, 1.5% of patients on pregabalin and 0.7% of placebo patients had a value of creatine kinase at least three times the upper limit of normal. Three pregabalin-treated subjects had events reported as rhabdomyolysis in premarketing clinical trials. The relationship between these myopathy events and pregabalin is not completely understood because the cases had documented factors that may have caused or contributed to these events. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if these muscle symptoms are accompanied by malaise or fever. Discontinue treatment with pregabalin if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected or if markedly elevated creatine kinase levels occur.

Cardiac troponin (cTn) assays for chest pain — biomarker selection and assay performance: The preferred biomarker to detect or exclude cardiac injury is cTn (I or T), and a cTn concentration > 99th percentile upper reference limit is an indicator of myocardial injury; the coefficient of variation at the 99th percentile upper reference limit for each assay should be ≤ 10%. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays show superiority over conventional cTn and shorten the time interval to a detectable concentration at presentation, enabling more rapid rule-in and rule-out algorithms. The level of detection, 99th percentile upper reference limit, analytical precision, and criteria for a significant delta are assay-specific, and clinicians must be familiar with these analytical performance properties for the assay(s) that they use in their practice. cTn is organ-specific but not disease-specific, and interpretation of cTn results requires integration with all clinical information. Comparative studies have confirmed the superiority of cTn over CK-MB and myoglobin for diagnosis and prognosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and the addition of CK-MB or myoglobin to cTn for evaluation of patients presenting with chest pain is not beneficial. Although multiple other cardiovascular biomarkers, including natriuretic peptides, have been associated with adverse outcomes in chest pain, none have sufficient diagnostic accuracy for myocardial injury to be recommended for that purpose.

Cardiogenic shock biomarkers — creatine kinase and troponin note that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a common cause of CS and may follow any acute coronary syndrome but occurs most frequently in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); if AMI is suspected, serum markers include creatine kinase (CK) and CKMB and troponin (I and T), and troponin T is an independent prognostic indicator of adverse outcomes.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^111gD3jJ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO guideline update — cardiovascular toxicities (myocarditis, pericarditis, arrhythmias, impaired ventricular function with heart failure, and vasculitis) — workup and evaluation include ECG; troponin and CPK to rule out concurrent myositis with serial troponin monitoring if elevated and awareness of triple M irAEs — myositis, myasthenia, and myocarditis; BNP; echocardiogram; chest X-ray; and additional testing guided by cardiology including stress test, cardiac catheterization, and cardiac MRI. Grading defines G1 as abnormal cardiac biomarker testing without symptoms and with no ECG abnormalities, G2 as abnormal cardiac biomarker testing with mild symptoms or new ECG abnormalities without conduction delay, G3 as abnormal cardiac biomarker testing with either moderate symptoms or new conduction delay, and G4 as moderate to severe decompensation, IV medication or intervention required, life-threatening conditions. All grades warrant workup and intervention; for G1 elevated troponin, hold ICPI and recheck troponin 6 hours later with potential resumption once normalized or if believed not to be related to ICPI, whereas for ≥ G2 hold ICPI and discontinue. For patients with grade ≥ 2, early (ie, within 24 hours) initiation of high-dose corticosteroids (1–2 mg/kg/d of prednisone, oral or IV depending on symptoms) should be considered; admit for cardiology consultation and manage cardiac symptoms according to ACC/AHA guidelines with guidance from cardiology. Immediate transfer to a coronary care unit should be considered for patients with elevated troponin or conduction abnormalities, and for new conduction delay consider a pacemaker. In patients without an immediate response to high-dose corticosteroids, consider early institution of cardiac transplant rejection doses of corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 g every day) with addition of either mycophenolate, infliximab, or antithymocyte globulin, and consider abatacept or alemtuzumab as additional immunosuppression in life-threatening cases; holding checkpoint inhibitor therapy is recommended for all grades of complications, the appropriateness of rechallenging remains unknown, and infliximab is contraindicated at high doses (ie, > 5 mg/kg) in patients with moderate-severe heart failure.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^1156S99x]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Biochemical approach for diagnosing myocardial injury and infarction — Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) are the preferred biomarkers recommended to both rule-in and rule-out myocardial injury, and thus to define MI and each specific subtype of MI. Detection of a rise and/or fall of cTn values is essential and a key early component along with other clinical elements to establish the diagnosis of acute MI. Criteria for determining a pathological rise between 2 serial cTn values are assay-dependent and continue to evolve.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

COVID-19 myocardial involvement and injury — definitions indicate that myocardial involvement includes myocardial abnormalities noted to occur in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection that do not meet criteria for possible, probable, or definite myocarditis, and affected individuals may or may not have cardiac symptoms with wide variation in presentation, ranging from asymptomatic individuals (eg, athletes screened with cardiac magnetic resonance [CMR]) to those evaluated at autopsy. Myocardial injury is defined by a cTn (cardiac troponin) level (preferably using a high-sensitivity assay) above the 99th percentile upper reference limit; this may be related to widely varying mechanisms, and regardless of the etiology, myocardial injury with COVID-19 carries a worse prognosis.

Immune System Disorders: hypersensitivity

Infections and Infestations: genital herpes, herpes zoster

Psychiatric Disorders: depression (particularly in subjects with a pre-existing history of psychiatric illness), including suicidal ideation and behaviors

Renal and Urinary Disorders: nephrolithiasis, renal failure

Selected Adverse Events - Adults

Cancers were reported in treatment-experienced subjects who initiated ISENTRESS or placebo, both with OBT, and in treatment-naïve subjects who initiated ISENTRESS or efavirenz, both with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir; several were recurrent. The types and rates of specific cancers were those expected in a highly immunodeficient population (many had CD4+ counts below 50 cells/mm³ and most had prior AIDS diagnoses). The risk of developing cancer in these studies was similar in the group receiving ISENTRESS and the group receiving the comparator.

Grade 2–4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in subjects treated with ISENTRESS (see TABLE 7). Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients at increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, such as patients receiving concomitant medications known to cause these conditions and patients with a history of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy or increased serum creatine kinase.

Selected Adverse Events - Adults

In studies of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily, cancers were reported in treatment-experienced subjects who initiated ISENTRESS or placebo, both with OBT, and in treatment-naïve subjects who initiated ISENTRESS or efavirenz, both with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; several were recurrent. The types and rates of specific cancers were those expected in a highly immunodeficient population (many had CD4+ counts below 50 cells/mm³and most had prior AIDS diagnoses). The risk of developing cancer in these studies was similar in the group receiving ISENTRESS and the group receiving the comparator.

Grade 2–4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in subjects treated with ISENTRESS and ISENTRESS HD (see Tables 6 and 8). Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with ISENTRESS. Use with caution in patients at increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, such as patients receiving concomitant medications known to cause these conditions and patients with a history of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy or increased serum creatine kinase.

Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced subjects receiving regimens containing ISENTRESS + darunavir/ritonavir compared to subjects receiving ISENTRESS without darunavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir without ISENTRESS. However, rash that was considered drug related occurred at similar rates for all three groups. These rashes were mild to moderate in severity and did not limit therapy; there were no discontinuations due to rash.

### Pramipexole dihydrochloride (Mirapex) [^112ts4Jp]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis

A single case of rhabdomyolysis occurred in a 49-year-old male with advanced Parkinson's disease treated with MIRAPEX tablets. The patient was hospitalized with an elevated CPK (10,631 IU/L). The symptoms resolved with discontinuation of the medication.

Renal

Since pramipexole is eliminated through the kidneys, caution should be exercised when prescribing Mirapex® (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets to patients with renal insufficiency (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Dyskinesia

MIRAPEX tablets may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of levodopa and may cause or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia. Decreasing the dose of levodopa may ameliorate this side effect.

Retinal Pathology in Albino Rats

Pathologic changes (degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells) were observed in the retina of albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study. While retinal degeneration was not diagnosed in pigmented rats treated for 2 years, a thinning in the outer nuclear layer of the retina was slightly greater in rats given drug compared with controls. Evaluation of the retinas of albino mice, monkeys, and minipigs did not reveal similar changes. The potential significance of this effect in humans has not been established, but cannot be disregarded because disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (i.e., disk shedding) may be involved (see ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY).

Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy

Although the events enumerated below may not have been reported in association with the use of pramipexole in its development program, they are associated with the use of other dopaminergic drugs. The expected incidence of these events, however, is so low that even if pramipexole caused these events at rates similar to those attributable to other dopaminergic therapies, it would be unlikely that even a single case would have occurred in a cohort of the size exposed to pramipexole in studies to date.

Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion

Although not reported with pramipexole in the clinical development program, a symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in antiparkinsonian therapy.

### Antithrombotic therapy in arterial thrombosis and thromboembolism in COVID-19: an American College of Chest Physicians expert panel report [^111P9Ci6]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

COVID-19 and elevated cardiac troponins without acute coronary syndrome (ACS) — clinical context and DAPT considerations: Elevation of cardiac troponins consistent with myocardial injury has been identified in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 with variable frequency (7%-41%), and a systematic review and meta-analysis found that an elevated level of cardiac troponins was associated with a 10-fold increased risk of adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19; elevated troponins were observed in 42.3% of patients in the ICU with non-COVID-19 acute respiratory disease. Troponin elevation in COVID-19 could result from entities other than acute plaque disruption, including myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, acute heart failure, and direct injury from SARS-CoV-2, and a documented increase in the risk of bleeding when dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is used occurs. In the setting of isolated cardiac troponins elevation, no evidence supports that DAPT would decrease the risk of cardiac events, and potential causes other than ACS should be considered.

Stage B myocarditis — definition, supportive evidence, and detection scenarios — is outlined as follows: In the proposed classification, stage B includes asymptomatic persons with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) features of myocarditis or elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn), the latter in conjunction with additional supportive evidence of this diagnosis. The level of supportive evidence for an elevated hs-cTn without CMR depends upon the clinical context and which stage A risk factor is operative; for example, if receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, an acute rise and markedly elevated troponin in the absence of coronary artery disease may suffice for the diagnosis, whereas if the risk factor is a connective tissue disease, additional features such as echocardiographic findings would be needed, and in some presentations a CMR would be required to distinguish stage B myocarditis from alternatives such as stress cardiomyopathy. Patients in stage B are by definition asymptomatic, and scenarios for identification include: 1) patients with stage C or D myocarditis who resolve symptoms but have ongoing inflammation by biomarkers or imaging during follow-up; 2) patients exposed to a cardiotoxin (eg, ICI therapy) under surveillance; 3) patients hospitalized with a viral illness with elevated cTn or abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission prompting testing; 4) patients with other stage A risk factors with an abnormal ECG on routine screening; and 5) patients undergoing cardiac screening for other indications who are found to have an abnormal ECG or arrhythmia on Holter monitoring, depressed ventricular function on echocardiography, or inflammation on CMR. It is not yet known how many patients with symptomatic myocarditis had a preceding asymptomatic phase or its duration.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Top 10 take-home messages — evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain emphasize that chest pain means more than pain in the chest; pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity troponins are preferred for biomarker diagnosis; high-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Early care for acute symptoms is stressed; patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9–1–1, and although most patients will not have a cardiac cause, the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes.

Cardiac troponin (cTn) serial change criteria and assay precision — In most studies, conjoint analytical and biological variation is in the range of 50% to 60%, and this percentage has been suggested for use when initial baseline values are less than or equal to the 99th percentile URL. For individuals with an initial value greater than the 99th percentile URL, an expert consensus group has recommended serial changes > 20% be used in this situation; absolute changes are assay dependent but appear superior to relative percent changes with high-sensitivity cTn (hs-cTn) assays. An imprecision of ≤ 10% coefficient of variation (CV) at the 99th percentile URL is also mandatory for hs-cTn assays; assays with CVs between 10% and 20% are acceptable for clinical use, whereas assays with CVs > 20% at the 99th percentile URL should not be used. If a cTn assay is not available, the best alternative is CK-MB measured by a mass assay, and as with cTn, an increased CK-MB value is defined as a measurement above the 99th percentile URL, which is designated as the decision level for the diagnosis of MI; sex-specific CK-MB values should be employed.

5.9 Retinal Pathology

Human Data

A two-year open-label, randomized, parallel-group safety study of retinal deterioration and vision compared pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and immediate-release ropinirole. Two hundred thirty four Parkinson's disease patients (115 on pramipexole, mean dose 3 mg/day and 119 on ropinirole, mean dose 9.5 mg/day) were evaluated using a panel of clinical ophthalmological assessments. Of 234 patients who were evaluable, 196 had been treated for two years and 29 were judged to have developed clinical abnormalities that were considered meaningful (19 patients in each treatment arm had received treatment for less than two years). There was no statistical difference in retinal deterioration between the treatment arms; however, the study was only capable of detecting a very large difference between treatments. In addition, because the study did not include an untreated comparison group (placebo treated), it is unknown whether the findings reported in patients treated with either drug are greater than the background rate in an aging population.

Animal Data

Pathologic changes (degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells) were observed in the retina of albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study. While retinal degeneration was not diagnosed in pigmented rats treated for 2 years, a thinning in the outer nuclear layer of the retina was slightly greater in rats given drug compared with controls. Evaluation of the retinas of albino mice, monkeys, and minipigs did not reveal similar changes. The potential significance of this effect in humans has not been established, but cannot be disregarded because disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (i.e., disk shedding) may be involved [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

COVID-19 cardiovascular complications — postacute injury and thromboembolism are described with proposed mechanisms and imaging/biomarker findings. Mechanisms for long-term cardiovascular complications include direct and indirect viral-mediated damage, procoagulant state, immune effects on the myocardium/pericardium/conduction system, and downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme–2 (ACE2). Myocardial abnormalities and injury have been reported on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cardiac troponin elevations have occurred in some patients > 2 months after diagnosis of COVID-19. Myocardial fibrosis or scar associated with cardiomyopathy from viral infection can lead to arrhythmias, and the risk for thromboembolic complications in the postacute phase is possibly associated with the duration and severity of hyperinflammatory state.

Electrocardiographic detection of myocardial injury — initial distinction from acute ischemia is limited. It is stated that it is not possible to initially distinguish ECG manifestations of acute or chronic myocardial injury from acute myocardial ischemia, but rapidly developing dynamic ECG changes that match the clinical presentation may be helpful in diagnosing a symptomatic patient with elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) as having acute myocardial ischemia resulting in myocardial infarction (MI), while ECG abnormalities are also common in patients with myocardial injury such as myocarditis or takotsubo syndrome (TTS).

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Acute chest pain and suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) — troponin sampling, prior testing, and single-sample rule-out: In patients for whom serial troponins are indicated to exclude myocardial injury, repeat measurements after the initial sample are 1 to 3 hours for high-sensitivity troponin and 3 to 6 hours for conventional troponin assays. Institutions should implement a clinical decision pathway (CDP) with a protocol for troponin sampling based on their particular assay, and previous testing when available should be considered and incorporated into CDPs. For patients with a normal ECG and symptoms suggestive of ACS that began at least 3 hours before ED arrival, a single hs-cTn concentration that is below the limit of detection on initial measurement (time zero) is reasonable to exclude myocardial injury.
