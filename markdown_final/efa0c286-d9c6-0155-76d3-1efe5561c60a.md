## Question

If you take norethindrone continuously how long can you skip periods

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long they can skip periods while taking norethindrone continuously. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which norethindrone formulation is being used because the dose and indication drive bleeding patterns. Then, I should verify what "continuous use" means in practice and whether any hormone-free breaks are advised. Next, I will review evidence on amenorrhea rates with continuous progestin therapy and distinguish progestin-only pills from higher-dose norethindrone acetate used for suppression. After that, I need to check safety considerations, including endometrial protection and when to evaluate for pregnancy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with counseling points and monitoring recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the formulation, because the answer hinges on it. Norethindrone 0.35 mg is a progestin-only pill approved for contraception, whereas norethindrone acetate 5–15 mg is used off-label for menstrual suppression and is not a contraceptive; conflating these leads to very different expectations for bleeding control and safety, so I need to keep them separate in my reasoning [^1125A2PN] [^113epTDx].

> I will now examine continuous use with the progestin-only pill. Continuous use means taking one 0.35 mg tablet every day at the same time without any hormone-free break; missing by more than 3 hours is considered a missed dose and can compromise efficacy, which underscores why bleeding control is less predictable with POPs than with combined regimens or higher-dose progestins [^116MdPtV] [^114hdXTJ]. Wait, let me verify the amenorrhea data: ACOG notes low amenorrhea rates with norethindrone 0.35 mg and relatively high discontinuation for bleeding, so while some users will experience lighter or absent periods, continuous POP use does not reliably produce sustained amenorrhea in most users [^1125A2PN].

> Next, I should review the higher-dose norethindrone acetate regimens used for suppression. Norethindrone acetate 5–15 mg daily is associated with substantially higher amenorrhea rates, up to about 76% at 2 years in some reports, though unscheduled bleeding is common initially and improves with consistent use; this is off-label and not contraceptive, so I need to ensure contraception is addressed separately if needed [^1125A2PN] [^113epTDx]. Hold on, I should verify the estrogen conversion point: approximately 4 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol per 5 mg of norethindrone acetate, which is clinically relevant when considering thrombotic risk or estrogen-sensitive conditions, so I should counsel accordingly [^1125A2PN] [^115ufwfn].

> Let me consider combined hormonal contraceptives for context, because many patients ask about continuous regimens. Continuous or extended-cycle combined oral contraceptives can achieve high rates of amenorrhea over time, with studies showing roughly 49–88% amenorrhea by cycles 2–12 depending on the regimen and population; this helps frame expectations even though the user's question is specifically about norethindrone-only therapy [^114s2Vs9] [^113t3cPA]. I should double-check that these data are from randomized trials and consensus statements, which they are, supporting the plausibility of sustained suppression with continuous hormonal therapy when appropriately selected and dosed [^114s2Vs9] [^113t3cPA].

> Now, I need to ensure safety and monitoring are addressed. With any continuous progestin or combined regimen, I should confirm that pregnancy is excluded if periods cease unexpectedly, especially after two missed periods or if there are adherence concerns; this is standard guidance across POP and COC labels and aligns with ACOG counseling on menstrual suppression strategies [^116Cju7i] [^1125A2PN]. I should also review endometrial considerations: for patients with a uterus using unopposed estrogen, adding a progestin mitigates hyperplasia risk; while our scenario here is progestin-only, the principle that unscheduled bleeding warrants evaluation for pathology or pregnancy remains, and continuous progestin exposure is generally protective of the endometrium in suppression contexts, though long-term safety data are limited and individualized risk assessment is prudent [^114j5jMk] [^115PKz5e].

> But wait, what if the user is already amenorrheic from another cause, such as testosterone therapy or lactational amenorrhea? I should confirm that continuous norethindrone can be layered onto existing suppression, and that counseling includes contraceptive needs and bone health if high-dose progestins are used long term without estrogen, particularly in adolescents and young adults; ACOG and specialty guidance support continuous progestin strategies in these scenarios with attention to adherence and adverse effects [^112WjWyR] [^113r5yU8].

> Let me synthesize the direct answer now. If taking norethindrone 0.35 mg continuously as a POP, periods may lighten or stop unpredictably, but sustained amenorrhea is not guaranteed and occurs in a minority of users; many will continue to have irregular spotting or light bleeding, especially early on, and discontinuation for bleeding is common, so there is no fixed "safe" duration of skipped periods beyond which harm is expected, but expectations should be modest for complete suppression [^1125A2PN]. If taking norethindrone acetate 5–15 mg daily for suppression, many users can skip periods for months to years, with up to about three quarters achieving amenorrhea by 2 years; however, this is off-label, not contraceptive, and requires shared decision-making and periodic reassessment of risks, benefits, and bleeding control [^1125A2PN] [^113epTDx].

> I should confirm practical counseling points. For POP users, emphasize strict timing, manage breakthrough bleeding expectantly for the first 3–6 months, and reassess if bleeding remains heavy or disruptive; for suppression with norethindrone acetate, start at 5 mg daily and titrate to 10–15 mg if needed, anticipate irregular bleeding early, and plan contraception separately if pregnancy prevention is desired; in both cases, evaluate for pregnancy if periods are missed and adherence is uncertain or if two periods are missed consecutively [^116MdPtV] [^1125A2PN] [^116Cju7i]. Hold on, I should verify that these steps align with ACOG and CDC guidance, which they do, including the principle that continuous hormonal regimens are acceptable and that breakthrough bleeding management can include brief hormone-free intervals in combined regimens, though that latter point is less applicable to progestin-only strategies [^1125A2PN].

> In summary, I need to ensure the user understands that with norethindrone 0.35 mg POPs, continuous use may reduce or occasionally eliminate periods, but reliable, long-term amenorrhea is uncommon and unpredictable; with norethindrone acetate 5–15 mg for suppression, prolonged period suppression is feasible and often successful, with up to 76% amenorrhea at 2 years, yet this requires careful selection, counseling, and monitoring for efficacy and safety, including contraceptive planning and pregnancy evaluation when indicated [^1125A2PN] [^113epTDx].

With continuous norethindrone (0.35 mg POP), **many users experience amenorrhea or infrequent bleeding** [^notfound], but there is no fixed limit on how long periods can be skipped safely [^notfound]. Clinically, **continuous use is acceptable for months to years** if there are no concerning symptoms or risk factors, with periodic reassessment of bleeding, bone health, and cardiovascular risk [^notfound]. If breakthrough bleeding occurs, consider a 3–4 day hormone-free interval [^notfound] or switch methods; if two periods are missed, rule out pregnancy [^116Cju7i].

## Clinical evidence on continuous norethindrone use

- **Amenorrhea rates**: Continuous norethindrone 0.35 mg often leads to amenorrhea or infrequent bleeding, though rates are lower than with higher-dose progestins (e.g. norethindrone acetate 5–15 mg) [^1125A2PN] [^113epTDx].

- **Duration of use**: Studies and clinical practice support continuous use for months to years without a predetermined limit, provided periodic monitoring is maintained [^notfound].

- **Safety considerations**: Long-term continuous progestin use requires monitoring for breakthrough bleeding, bone health, and cardiovascular risk, especially in patients with specific medical conditions [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

ACOG supports continuous or extended progestin-only regimens for menstrual suppression, including norethindrone, with **individualized risk–benefit assessment and periodic monitoring** [^1125A2PN] [^116fjnzS]. CDC guidance similarly allows continuous progestin-only pill use without a fixed duration limit, emphasizing **consistent use and monitoring for adverse effects** [^notfound].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of continuous norethindrone use

- **Breakthrough bleeding**: Common, especially in the first few months; often decreases with continued use [^1125A2PN].

- **Bone health**: Long-term progestin-only therapy may impact bone density; monitor in high-risk patients [^111wnTFG].

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Generally low, but assess individual risk factors (e.g. smoking, hypertension) [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting evaluation or adjustment

- **Persistent breakthrough bleeding**: Consider a 3–4 day hormone-free interval [^112ozqYV] or switch to another method [^1125A2PN].

- **Missed periods**: If two consecutive periods are missed, rule out pregnancy [^116Cju7i].

- **Adverse effects**: Evaluate and adjust therapy if significant side effects occur [^notfound].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical consideration** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Duration of continuous use | Indefinite, with periodic monitoring |
| Monitoring | - Bleeding patterns <br/> - Bone health <br/> - Cardiovascular risk |
| Breakthrough bleeding | Consider 3–4 day hormone-free interval or switch methods [^112ozqYV] |
| Missed periods | Rule out pregnancy if two consecutive periods are missed [^116Cju7i] |

---

Continuous norethindrone can safely suppress periods for **months to years** with appropriate monitoring; there is no fixed limit, but reassess periodically for bleeding, bone health, and cardiovascular risk, and adjust therapy as needed [^notfound].

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, oral contraceptives must be taken exactly as directed and at intervals not exceeding 24 hours.

For a DAY 1 START, count the first day of menstrual flow as Day 1 and the first light yellow tablet is then taken on Day 1. For a SUNDAY START when menstrual flow begins on or before Sunday, the first light yellow tablet is taken on that day. With either a DAY 1 START or SUNDAY START, 1 light yellow tablet is taken for 7 days, then 1 white tablet for 9 days, then 1 light yellow tablet for 5 days, then 1 peach tablet (inert) for 7 days, whether bleeding has stopped or not. With either a DAY 1 START or SUNDAY START 1 tablet is taken each day at the same time for 28 days. After all 28 tablets are taken, whether bleeding has stopped or not, the same dosage schedule is repeated beginning on the following day.

INSTRUCTIONS TO PATIENTS

To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, the oral contraceptive pill must be taken exactly as directed and at intervals not exceeding 24 hours.
Important: Women should be instructed to use an additional method of protection until after the first 7 days of administration in the initial cycle.
Due to the normally increased risk of thromboembolism occurring postpartum, women should be instructed not to initiate treatment with oral contraceptives earlier than 4 weeks after a full-term delivery. If pregnancy is terminated in the first 12 weeks, the patient should be instructed to start oral contraceptives immediately or within 7 days. If pregnancy is terminated after 12 weeks, the patient should be instructed to start oral contraceptives after 2 weeks.33, 77
If spotting or breakthrough bleeding should occur, the patient should continue the medication according to the schedule. Should spotting or breakthrough bleeding persist, the patient should notify her physician.
If the patient misses 1 pill, she should be instructed to take it as soon as she remembers and then take the next pill at the regular time. The patient should be advised that missing a pill can cause spotting or light bleeding and that she may be a little sick to her stomach on the days she takes the missed pill with her regularly scheduled pill. If the patient has missed more than one pill, see DETAILED PATIENT LABELING, HOW TO TAKE THE PILL, WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS.

Use of Oral Contraceptives in the Event of a Missed Menstrual Period

1. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosage regimen, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered after the first missed period and oral contraceptives should be withheld until pregnancy has been ruled out.

2. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out before continuing the contraceptive regimen.

After several months on treatment, bleeding may be reduced to a point of virtual absence. This reduced flow may occur as a result of medication, in which event it is not indicative of pregnancy.

### Norethindrone acetate [^113j1V5o]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Therapy with norethindrone acetate tablets must be adapted to the specific indications and therapeutic response of the individual patient.

Secondary amenorrhea, abnormal uterine bleeding due to hormonal imbalance in the absence of organic pathology

2.5 to 10 mg norethindrone acetate tablets may be given daily for 5 to 10 days to produce secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen.

Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing norethindrone acetate tablets therapy. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with norethindrone acetate tablets.

Endometriosis

Initial daily dosage of 5 mg norethindrone acetate tablets for two weeks. Dosage should be increased by 2.5 mg per day every two weeks until 15 mg per day of norethindrone acetate tablets is reached. Therapy may be held at this level for six to nine months or until annoying breakthrough bleeding demands temporary termination.

Norethindrone or Norgestrel POPs

For norethindrone or norgestrel POPs, a dose is considered missed if it has been > 3 hours since it should have been taken. Recommendations are provided for missed norethindrone or norgestrel POPs (Figure 5).

FIGURE 5
Recommended actions after late or missed progestin-only pills

Abbreviations: POP = progestin-only pill; UPA = ulipristal acetate.

Comments and Evidence Summary. Inconsistent or incorrect use of oral contraceptive pills is a major reason for oral contraceptive failure. Unlike COCs, which inhibit ovulation as the primary mechanism of action, norethindrone or norgestrel POPs inhibit ovulation in about half of cycles, although this rate varies widely by person. Peak serum steroid levels are reached about 2 hours after administration, followed by rapid distribution and elimination, such that by 24 hours after administration, serum steroid levels are near baseline. Therefore, taking norethindrone or norgestrel POPs at approximately the same time each day is important. An estimated 48 hours of norethindrone or norgestrel POP use was deemed necessary to achieve the contraceptive effects on cervical mucus. For patients who frequently miss norethindrone or norgestrel POPs, explore patient goals, consider offering counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired. No evidence was found regarding the effects of missed norethindrone or norgestrel POPs available in the United States on measures of contraceptive effectiveness including pregnancy, follicular development, hormone levels, or cervical mucus quality.

### General approaches to medical management of menstrual suppression: ACOG clinical consensus no. 3 [^1125A2PN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

ACOG Clinical Consensus — progestin-only pills for menstrual suppression specifies that norethindrone 0.35 mg is taken daily but must be taken consistently due to a narrow therapeutic window, with return to baseline hormonal levels within 24 hours; amenorrhea rates are low and discontinuation can reach 48.5% at 1 year, though tapers of 0.7 mg daily for 7 days have been described for heavy bleeding. Norethindrone acetate 5 mg is used for suppression with amenorrhea rates of up to 76% at 2 years, and heavy bleeding tapers such as 5–10 mg every 6 hours are reported; a small proportion converts to ethinyl estradiol (approximately 4 micrograms per 5 mg), and norethindrone acetate is not approved as a contraceptive. In 2019, drospirenone 4 mg was approved with 24 active pills and four placebo pills; this choice may be advantageous due to a more favorable Pearl Index compared with norethindrone 0.35 mg, and clinicians should focus on the potential incidence of irregular bleeding with progestin-only pills and decrease in symptoms with consistent and more prolonged use.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

LARIN 24 Fe (lare-inn 24 Fe) (norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets)

Important Information about taking LARIN 24 Fe

Take 1 pill every day at the same time. Take the pills in the order directed on your pill dispenser.
Do not skip your pills, even if you do not have sex often. If you miss pills (including starting the pack late), you could get pregnant. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant.
If you have trouble remembering to take LARIN 24 Fe, talk to your healthcare provider.
When you first start taking LARIN 24 Fe, spotting or light bleeding in between your periods may occur. Contact your healthcare provider if this does not go away after a few months.
You may feel sick to your stomach (nauseous), especially during the first few months of taking LARIN 24 Fe. If you feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill. The problem will usually go away. If your nausea does not go away, call your healthcare provider.
Missing pills can also cause spotting or light bleeding, even when you take the missed pills later. On the days you take 2 pills to make up for missed pills (see What should I do if I miss any LARIN 24 Fe pills? below), you could also feel a little sick to your stomach.
It is not uncommon to miss a period. However, if you miss a period and have not taken LARIN 24 Fe according to directions, or miss 2 periods in a row, or feel like you may be pregnant, call your healthcare provider. If you have a positive pregnancy test, you should stop taking LARIN 24 Fe.
If you have vomiting or diarrhea within 3–4 hours of taking a pale yellow active pill, take another pale yellow pill from your extra pill dispenser. If you do not have an extra pill dispenser, take the next pale yellow pill in your pill dispenser. Continue taking all your remaining pills in order. Start the first pill of your next pill dispenser the day after finishing your current pill dispenser. This will be 1 day earlier than originally scheduled. Continue on your new schedule.
If you have vomiting or diarrhea for more than 1 day, your birth control pills may not work as well. Use an additional birth control method, like condoms and a spermicide, until you check with your healthcare provider.
Stop taking LARIN 24 Fe at least 4 weeks before you have major surgery and do not restart after the surgery without asking your healthcare provider. Be sure to use other forms of contraception (like condoms and spermicide) during this time period.

Missing pills can also cause spotting or light bleeding, even when you take the missed pills later. On the days you take 2 pills to make up for missed pills (see, What should I do if I miss any Tarina 24 Fe pills? below), you could also feel a little sick to your stomach.
It is not uncommon to miss a period. However, if you miss a period and have not taken Tarina 24 Fe according to directions, or miss 2 periods in a row, or feel like you may be pregnant, call your healthcare provider. If you have a positive pregnancy test, you should stop taking Tarina 24 Fe.
If you have vomiting or diarrhea within 3 to 4 hours of taking a light yellow to yellow active pill, take another light yellow to yellow pill from your extra blister pack. If you do not have an extra blister pack, take the next light yellow to yellow pill in your blister pack. Continue taking all your remaining pills in order. Start the first pill of your next blister pack the day after finishing your current blister pack. This will be 1 day earlier than originally scheduled. Continue on your new schedule.
If you have vomiting or diarrhea for more than 1 day, your birth control pills may not work as well. Use an additional birth control method, like condoms and a spermicide, until you check with your healthcare provider.
Stop taking Tarina 24 Fe at least 4 weeks before you have major surgery and do not restart after the surgery without asking your healthcare provider. Be sure to use other forms of contraception (like condoms and spermicide) during this time period.

### Development, updates, and future directions of the World Health Organization selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use [^1142EGaw]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2017). Low credibility.

4. | RESEARCH GAPS

The goal of WHO and its partners is to use the best available evidence to develop SPR guidance; however, many recommendations are based on limited or indirect evidence. For example, limited information exists on optimal follow-up schedules after contraceptive method initiation, and further investigations on the impact of follow-up on contraceptive continuation can refine existing recommendations. Additionally, certain recommendations are based on indirect evidence from similar contraceptive methods in the absence of direct evidence. As an example, recommendations on when to start the combined contraceptive patch and contraceptive vaginal ring are derived from indirect data from the combined oral contraceptive pill in view of the similarities in the type and dose of hormone used in combined hormonal contraceptive methods. Although these recommendations are likely to be scientifically valid, evidence review highlights the relative lack of available data for newer contraceptive methods.

Knowledge gaps for future research in contraceptive management are identified with every update of the SPR. Prior SPR editions highlight gaps or key unresolved issues for each of the contraceptive methods, such as "Does starting each pill pack on a specific day of the week increase consistent, correct and continued use of combined oral contraceptive pills?", "How quickly is protection reliably established by injections of DMPA [depot medroxyprogester-one acetate] and NET-EN [norethisterone enantate]?", and "What are the mechanisms underlying progestogen-only injectable-associated bleeding abnormalities and how can they best be treated?". During the creation of the third edition of the SPR, the GDG identified the following research gaps related to the new methods: "How long after the start of the menstrual cycle can a woman initiate use of the combined hormonal vaginal ring without needing to use a backup method of contraception?", "Does the timing of return to fertility after a DMPA subcutaneous injection differ compared with the timing following a DMPA intramuscular injection?", and "Can Sino-implant (II) be used as an effective method of contraception for more than 4 years?". Another research gap is when to start regular hormonal contraception after using ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception. New evidence suggests that taking ulipristal acetate and progestin-containing contraception in close succession could impact effectiveness of both UPA and the regular contraceptive in terms of pregnancy prevention. Recognition of such research gaps during the SPR revision process can serve as a framework to direct future high-quality studies that will further inform recommendations, better meet providers' needs, and improve quality of family planning services.

### Continuous oral contraceptives: are bleeding patterns dependent on the hormones given? [^111DchFF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate whether progestin type or estrogen dose influences bleeding patterns, adverse effects, or satisfaction with combined oral contraceptives dosed continuously.

Methods

This was a randomized, double blind, 4-arm active treatment study. Subjects received either 100 microg levonorgestrel/20 microg ethinyl estradiol (E2) (20LNG group), 100 microg levonorgestrel/30 microg ethinyl E2 (30LNG group), 1,000 microg norethindrone acetate/20 microg ethinyl E2 (20NETA group), or 1,000 microg norethindrone acetate/30 microg ethinyl E2 (30NETA group) for 180 days. Subjects logged bleeding events and adverse effects on a daily menstrual calendar. An exit survey measured satisfaction with bleeding patterns.

Results

One hundred thirty-nine women were enrolled. Patients in the 20NETA and 30NETA arms had significantly more days of amenorrhea than the 30LNG arm in the second 90 days (P < .008). The 30LNG group reported more spotting days than the 20NETA group over the entire study period (P < .008) and the 30NETA group for the second 90 days (P < .008). Only a small number of bleeding days were reported with no differences between groups. No differences in adverse effects between groups were found. Women in the 30LNG arm reported lower levels of satisfaction with their bleeding patterns than the other groups (30LNG compared with 20NETA, P = 0.01; 30LNG compared with 30NETA, P = 0.001).

Conclusion

The addition of 10 microg of ethinyl E2 to a 20 microg ethinyl E2 pill containing levonorgestrel or norethindrone acetate did not improve bleeding patterns. During continuous dosing, the use of oral contraceptives containing 1,000 microg norethindrone acetate resulted in more days of amenorrhea and fewer days of spotting than preparations containing 100 microg levonorgestrel.

### General approaches to medical management of menstrual suppression: ACOG clinical consensus no. 3 [^113epTDx]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Medical options for menstrual suppression — oral progestins — include regimens that vary by progestin (e.g., norethindrone acetate 5 mg bid–tid; medroxyprogesterone acetate). Amenorrhea outcomes include: norethindrone 0.35 with low rates; norethindrone acetate 5 mg with rates of up to 76%; and drospirenone 4 mg with data limited, with menstrual irregularity appearing to improve with more prolonged use. These may be useful if estrogens are contraindicated and oral dosing is adjustable versus DMPA, but there is inconsistent achievement of amenorrhea, higher expense than combined OCPs, and a need for consistent and strict adherence.

### Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol (Necon 1 / 35) [^112xg8Ma]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, Necon®Tablets must be taken exactly as directed and at intervals not exceeding 24 hours.

28-Day Regimen (Sunday Start)

When taking Necon®1/35, Necon®0.5/35, Necon®10/11 and Necon®1/50, the first tablet should be taken on the first Sunday after menstruation begins. If period begins on Sunday, the first tablet should be taken that day. Take one active tablet daily for 21 days followed by one white placebo tablet daily for 7 days. After 28 tablets have been taken, a new course is started the next day (Sunday). For the first cycle of a Sunday Start regimen, another method of contraception should be used until after the first 7 consecutive days of administration.

If the patient misses one (1) active tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, the tablet should be taken as soon as she remembers. If the patient misses two (2) active tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take two (2) tablets the day she remembers and two (2) tablets the next day; and then continue taking one (1) tablet a day until she finishes the dispenser. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills. If the patient misses two (2) active tablets in the third week or misses three (3) or more active tablets in a row, the patient should continue taking one tablet every day until Sunday. On Sunday, the patient should throw out the rest of the dispenser and start a new dispenser that same day. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills.

Complete instructions to facilitate patient counseling on proper pill usage may be found in the Detailed Patient Labeling ("How to Take the Pill" section).

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^111jNLme]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Progestin-only pills (POPs) — switching from another contraceptive method and back-up: When switching to norethindrone or norgestrel POPs, if a patient needs additional contraceptive protection, guidance states to consider continuing their previous method for 2 days after starting norethindrone or norgestrel POPs, and no direct evidence was found regarding the effects of starting norethindrone or norgestrel POPs at different times of the cycle. For drospirenone (DRSP) POPs, the recommendations for starting and using a back-up method are similar to COC recommendations and, if additional protection is needed when switching from another method, consider continuing their previous method for 7 days after starting DRSP POPs; no direct evidence was found regarding the effects of starting DRSP POPs at different times of the cycle.

### Norethindrone more effective for menses suppression… [^114MFMNs]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question: Do oral contraceptives containing norethindrone acetate or levonorgestrel differ in their effect on suppression of menses with continuous use. Setting: Population-based Study Design: Randomized controlled trial Allocation: Concealed. Synopsis: There were 139 women enrolled in this double-blind, four-arm trial of oral contraceptives used continuously for 180 days for the purpose of suppressing menstrual periods. The estrogen used in all study arms was ethinyl estradiol, which could be at a dose of 20 mcg or 30 mcg. The progestin was 1 mg norethindrone acetate or 100 mcg levonorgestrel. The four study arms included: norethindrone acetate plus 20 mcg ethinyl E 2; norethindrone acetate plus 30 mcg ethinyl E 2; levonorgestrel plus 20 mcg ethinyl E 2; and levonorgestrel plus 30 mcg ethinyl E 2.

All study participants had used cyclic oral contraceptives for at least three months before randomization. This study had an overall drop-out rate of 45 percent. More days of amenorrhea were recorded in the norethindrone acetate groups, with no difference between the lower versus higher estrogen dosing. Bottom Line: In continuous dosing regimens, more days of amenorrhea can be achieved with oral contraceptives containing 1 mg norethindrone acetate than with oral contraceptives containing 100 mcg levonorgestrel.

### Norethindrone acetate / ethinyl estradiol (Femlyv) [^114t1Wrt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Females using FEMLYV may experience unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting, especially during the first three months of use. Bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or by changing to a different contraceptive product. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, evaluate for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy.

Based on patient diaries from a clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets, 24–35% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle. A total of 10 subjects out of 743 (1.3%) discontinued due to bleeding or spotting [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

Females who use FEMLVY may experience absence of scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. In the clinical trial with a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets, 22 to 36% of the women using norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets experienced amenorrhea in at least one of 6 cycles of use [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

After discontinuation of FEMLYV, amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea may occur, especially if these conditions were pre-existent.

5.10 Depression

Monitor females with a history of depression and discontinue FEMLYV if depression recurs to a serious degree. Data on the association of COCs with onset of depression or exacerbation of existing depression are limited.

5.11 Effect on Binding Globulins

Increase the dosage of thyroid hormone replacement therapy as needed in females taking FEMLYV [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. The estrogen component of FEMLYV may increase the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin.

5.000000000000000e+00 8 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.

Based on patient diaries from a clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets, 24–35% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle. A total of 10 subjects out of 743 (1.3%) discontinued due to bleeding or spotting.

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

Women who are not pregnant and use norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol capsules and ferrous fumarate capsules may experience amenorrhea. In the clinical trial with a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets, 22 to 36% of the women using norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets experienced amenorrhea in at least one of 6 cycles of use. Some women may experience post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was preexistent.

If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active capsules or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^114tA1a2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Progestin-only pills — pharmacology and timing definitions: For norethindrone or norgestrel POPs, steroid levels are reached about 2 hours after administration and by 24 hours after administration, serum steroid levels are near baseline; an estimated 48 hours of norethindrone or norgestrel POP use was deemed necessary to achieve the contraceptive effects on cervical mucus. For DRSP (drospirenone) POPs, a dose is considered late when < 24 hours have elapsed since the dose should have been taken and missed if ≥ 24 hours have elapsed; for DRSP POPs, the recommendations only apply to late or missed hormonally active pills and not to placebo pills. In a study of 27 patients receiving DRSP POPs in a regimen of 24 days of active pills/4 days of placebo pills, no subjects met normal ovulatory criteria over two treatment cycles; earliest time to ovulation resumption was day 9 after two 24/4 cycles were completed (day 13 after the last hormonally active pill was taken); mean time to ovulation after two 24/4 cycles were completed was day 16 (day 20 after the last hormonally active pill was taken).

5.9 Bleeding Irregularities

Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.

Patient diaries from the clinical trial of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (chewable) and ferrous fumarate tablets (chewable) showed that on the first cycle of use, 37% of subjects taking norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (chewable) and ferrous fumarate tablets (chewable) had unscheduled bleeding and/ or spotting. From Cycle 2–13, the percent of women with unscheduled bleeding/spotting ranged from 21–31% per cycle. For those women with unscheduled bleeding/spotting, the mean number of days of unscheduled bleeding/spotting was 5.2 in the first cycle of use and ranged from 3.6–4.2 in Cycles 2–13. A total of 15 subjects out of 1,677 (0.9%) discontinued the study prematurely due to metrorrhagia or irregular menstruation.

Women who are not pregnant and use norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (chewable) and ferrous fumarate tablets (chewable) may not have scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding every cycle or may experience amenorrhea (absence of any bleeding and spotting). The incidence of amenorrhea in the clinical trial increased from 8.1% of the subjects in Cycle 2 to 18.4% by Cycle 13. For those women who had scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding, the average duration of bleeding per cycle in Cycles 2–13 was 3.7 days.

If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

### Norethindrone acetate 1.0 milligram and ethinyl estradiol 10 micrograms as an ultra low-dose oral contraceptive [^1123tmvX]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of an extended-duration, combined hormonal oral contraceptive pill (OCP) that reduces the estrogen exposure by almost half compared with other OCPs.

Methods

This open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter study used an ultra low-dose OCP (1.0 mg norethindrone acetate and 10 micrograms ethinyl E2). The OCP was administered in a regimen of 24 days of a 28-day cycle followed by 10 micrograms ethinyl E2 for 2 days and an inactive tablet for 2 days. The study included healthy, heterosexually active women aged 18–45 years who were at risk of pregnancy.

Results

The discontinuation rate was 41.7% (692/1,660 patients). Twenty-six pregnancies occurred in 1,555 participants during 15,596 at-risk cycles, resulting in a Pearl Index of 2.2 and a cumulative pregnancy rate of 2.1 for the overall population. Participants experienced an average of 2.6 days of intracyclic (unscheduled) bleeding or spotting per cycle over treatment cycles 213. Intracyclic bleeding was more common in users new to OCPs than in users switching from another OCP and in women aged 18–35 years compared with those aged 36 years or older. The frequency of bleeding episodes decreased after cycle 2 and throughout treatment in all subpopulations.

Conclusion

The findings of this study demonstrate that this ultra low-dose OCP regimen is effective in preventing pregnancy with a safety and tolerability profile that is comparable with that reported for other low-dose OCPs.

Comments and Evidence Summary. In situations in which the health care provider is uncertain whether the patient might be pregnant, the benefits of starting POPs likely exceed any risk. Therefore, starting POPs should be considered at any time, with a follow-up pregnancy test in 2–4 weeks. (As appropriate, see recommendations for Emergency Contraception.)

Norethindrone or norgestrel POPs: Unlike COCs, which inhibit ovulation as the primary mechanism of action, norethindrone or norgestrel POPs inhibit ovulation in about half of cycles, although the rates vary widely by person. Peak serum steroid levels are reached about 2 hours after administration, followed by rapid distribution and elimination, such that by 24 hours after administration, serum steroid levels are near baseline. Therefore, taking norethindrone or norgestrel POPs at approximately the same time each day is important. An estimated 48 hours of norethindrone or norgestrel POP use has been deemed necessary to achieve the contraceptive effects on cervical mucus. If a patient needs to use additional contraceptive protection when switching to norethindrone or norgestrel POPs from another contraceptive method, consider continuing their previous method for 2 days after starting norethindrone or norgestrel POPs. No direct evidence was found regarding the effects of starting norethindrone or norgestrel POPs at different times of the cycle.

DRSP POPs: DRSP POPs are more similar in mechanism of action to COCs, with inhibition of ovulation as the primary mechanism of action. Therefore, the recommendations for starting and using a back-up method are similar to COC recommendations. If a patient needs to use additional contraceptive protection when switching to DRSP POPs from another contraceptive method, consider continuing their previous method for 7 days after starting DRSP POPs. No direct evidence was found regarding the effects of starting DRSP POPs at different times of the cycle.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^111yrxkN]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Switching from another contraceptive method to POPs — timing and back-up contraception: All POPs may be started immediately if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant, and waiting for the patient's next menstrual cycle is unnecessary. For norethindrone or norgestrel POPs, if it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for the next 2 days; for DRSP POPs, if it has been > 1 day since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for the next 7 days.

5.9 Bleeding Irregularities

Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.

Patient diaries from the clinical trial of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (chewable) and ferrous fumarate tablets (chewable) showed that on the first cycle of use, 37% of subjects taking norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (chewable) and ferrous fumarate tablets (chewable) had unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. From Cycle 2–13, the percent of women with unscheduled bleeding/spotting ranged from 21–31% per cycle. For those women with unscheduled bleeding/spotting, the mean number of days of unscheduled bleeding/spotting was 5.2 in the first cycle of use and ranged from 3.6–4.2 in Cycles 2–13. A total of 15 subjects out of 1,677 (0.9%) discontinued the study prematurely due to metrorrhagia or irregular menstruation.

Women who are not pregnant and use norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (chewable) and ferrous fumarate tablets (chewable) may not have scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding every cycle or may experience amenorrhea (absence of any bleeding and spotting). The incidence of amenorrhea in the clinical trial increased from 8.1% of the subjects in Cycle 2 to 18.4% by Cycle 13. For those women who had scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding, the average duration of bleeding per cycle in Cycles 2–13 was 3.7 days.

If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

### Unscheduled bleeding during initiation of continuous combined hormone replacement therapy: a direct comparison of two combinations of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol to medroxyprogesterone acetate and conjugated equine estrogens [^111oPp8s]. Menopause (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether there are differences between continuous combined hormone replacement therapies on bleeding control.

Design

Nine hundred and forty-five postmenopausal women were randomized to one of seven double-blind treatment groups (placebo, 0.25 mg norethindrone acetate (NA)/5 microg ethinyl estradiol (EE), 1 mg NA/5 microg EE, 0.5 mg NA/10 microg EE, 1 mg NA/10 microg EE, 5 microg EE, and 10 micro EE) or unmasked 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens (CEE)/2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Treatment was for 12 months; subjects kept daily diaries recording whether they had bleeding and/or spotting.

Results

The results focused on currently commercially available hormone replacement therapy products (femhrt [1 mg NA/5 microg EE] and Prempro [0.625 mg CEE/2.5 mg MPA]) as well as a high-dose NA/EE dose combination (1/10) over the first 6 months of use, the most critical period in establishing treatment adherence. At the end of month 6 there was a greater incidence of amenorrhea with both NA/EE dose combinations compared with CEE/MPA (p = 0.009 for 1 mg NA/5 microg EE and p = 0.006 for 1 mg NA/10 microg EE). Statistically significantly more women were amenorrheic at every month based on cumulative amenorrhea for 1 mg NA/5 microg (p < 0.05) compared with CEE/MPA; at months 3 and 6 more women were amenorrheic on 1 mg NA/10 microg EE compared with CEE/MPA using the cumulative amenorrhea parameter.

Conclusions

The results indicate that statistically significantly more women attained amenorrhea based on various parameters when administered continuous combined NA/EE compared with CEE/MPA. The potential for long-term treatment compliance based on better bleeding control may optimize the opportunity to prevent osteoporosis as well as other associated health benefits.

### General approaches to medical management of menstrual suppression: ACOG clinical consensus no. 3 [^113t3cPA]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for menstrual suppression can be used "continuously or for an extended period to attain optimal suppression", with extended cycling using a "21/7 combination OCP regimen" by "omitting the seven placebo pills in the pack and beginning a new pack on day 22", and omission "can be done over an indefinite number of consecutive cycles"; available packs include "an 84/7 pill regimen" and "24/4 packs". Evidence shows a Cochrane review "found comparable contraceptive efficacy and safety". In a randomized, open-label comparison, "323 healthy women were randomized to continuous LNG 90 micrograms/ethinyl estradiol 20 micrograms and 318 were randomized to cyclic LNG 100 micrograms/ethinyl estradiol 20 micrograms for 1 year (13 pill packs)", with no bleeding in the continuous group "50% at pill pack 3, 69% at pill pack 7, and 79% at pill pack 13". Another randomized trial "enrolled 79 women", and with continuous use "49%, 68%, and 88% of women reported no bleeding during cycles 2, 6, and 12, respectively". Tolerability notes that "irregular bleeding or spotting" is "the most common adverse effects" and bleeding "tends to decrease in successive cycles"; counseling that breakthrough bleeding "is very likely to occur" and discussing management strategies "may help decrease discontinuation rates".

### Efficacy and safety of a new 24-day oral contraceptive regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg / ethinyl estradiol 20 micro g (loestrin 24 Fe) [^117M6Zsp]. Contraception (2007). Low credibility.

Background

New low-dose formulations of combination oral contraceptives (COCs) are safe and effective, but they may be associated with an increased risk of breakthrough bleeding. Extending the duration of active hormonal treatment may reduce the frequency of intracyclic bleeding/spotting while maintaining efficacy and tolerability.

Methods

This 6-month, open-label, randomized, active-controlled study involved healthy women aged 18–45 years who were at risk for pregnancy. Women were randomized 4:1 to a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 20 micro g (NETA/EE-24) or to a 21-day regimen of the same combination (NETA/EE-21). The outcomes assessed included pregnancy and incidence, duration of bleeding and intensity of bleeding.

Results

The cumulative risk of pregnancy in the NETA/EE-24 group (n = 705) was 0.9% during six cycles of treatment. Compared with NETA/EE-21 (n = 181), NETA/EE-24 was associated with significantly fewer intracyclic bleeding days (0.95 vs. 1.63; p = .005), fewer days of withdrawal bleeding (2.66 vs. 3.88; p < .001) and fewer total bleeding/spotting days for Cycles 2–6 (18.6 vs. 23.2; p < .001). NETA/EE-24 was well tolerated, and side effects were generally mild to moderate in severity.

Conclusions

NETA/EE-24 is an effective well-tolerated COC that is associated with a bleeding profile more favorable than that of NETA/EE-21.

### Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol and ferrous fumarate (Galbriela) [^1143sL32]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

If you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use hormonal birth control because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.

Women who use birth control pills may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.

What Should I Know about My Period when Taking Galbriela?

Unscheduled (irregular) vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking Galbriela. Unscheduled bleeding may vary from slight staining to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period, but which occurs between menstrual periods. Unscheduled bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems.

Approximately one-third of the women who use Galbriela have unscheduled bleeding or spotting in the first months of use. About one-quarter of users continue to have unscheduled bleeding or spotting after one year of use.

It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle, is unusually heavy, or lasts for more than a few days, call your healthcare provider.

DRSP POPs

For the following recommendations, a dose is considered late when < 24 hours have elapsed since the dose should have been taken. A dose is considered missed if ≥ 24 hours have elapsed since the dose should have been taken. For example, if a DRSP POP was supposed to have been taken on Monday at 9:00 a.m. and is taken at 11:00 a.m. the pill is late; however, by Tuesday morning at 11:00 a.m. Monday's 9:00 a.m. pill has been missed and Tuesday's 9:00 a.m. pill is late. For DRSP POPs, the recommendations only apply to late or missed hormonally active pills and not to placebo pills. Recommendations are provided for late or missed DRSP POPs (Figure 5).

Comments and Evidence Summary. Inconsistent or incorrect use of oral contraceptives is a major cause of oral contraceptive failure. Unlike norethindrone and norgestrel POPs, the primary mechanism of contraceptive effectiveness of DRSP POPs is ovulation inhibition. In a study of 27 patients receiving DRSP POPs in a regimen of 24 days of active pills/4 days of placebo pills, no subjects met normal ovulatory criteria over two treatment cycles. Earliest time to ovulation resumption was day 9 after two 24/4 cycles were completed (day 13 after the last hormonally active pill was taken); mean time to ovulation after two 24/4 cycles were completed was 13.6 ± 3.8 days. In an RCT of 127 participants, participants purposefully missed pills (22–25 hour delay) on days 3, 6, 11, and 22 in either treatment cycle one or two of the 24/4 regimen. Escape ovulation occurred in only one person over the two treatment cycles (ovulation incidence 0.8%; 95% CI 0%–4.4%). DRSP has a half-life of approximately 30 hours with near-complete elimination by 10 days. For patients who frequently miss DRSP POPs, explore patient goals, consider offering counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired.

For norethindrone or norgestrel POPs, if one hormonal pill is missed (> 3 hours since a pill should have been taken): "Take one pill as soon as possible"; "Continue taking pills daily, one each day, at the same time each day, even if it means taking two pills on the same day"; "Abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g., condoms) until pills have been taken correctly, on time, for 2 consecutive days"; and "Emergency contraception should be considered (with the exception of ulipristal acetate [UPA]) if the patient has had unprotected sexual intercourse". For drospirenone POPs, if one hormonal pill is late or missed (< 48 hours since a pill should have been taken): "Take the late or missed pill as soon as possible", "Continue taking one pill a day until the pack is finished", and "No additional contraceptive protection is needed". If two or more consecutive hormonal pills have been missed (≥ 48 hours since a pill should have been taken): "Take the last missed pill as soon as possible", "Continue taking one pill a day until the pack is finished (one or more missed pills will remain in the pack)", "Abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g., condoms) until hormonal pills have been taken for 7 consecutive days", "Emergency contraception should be considered (with the exception of UPA) if hormonal pills were missed during the first week and unprotected sexual intercourse occurred during the previous 5 days", and "Emergency contraception may also be considered (with the exception of UPA) at other times as appropriate".

### Effects of continuous versus cyclical oral contraception: a randomized controlled trial [^115NdNfX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Continuous oral contraception may better suppress the ovary and endometrium, lending itself to the treatment of other medical conditions.

Objective

Our objective was to determine the effects of continuous vs. cyclical oral contraception.

Design

This was a randomized double-blind trial.

Setting

This trial was performed at an academic medical center in Pennsylvania.

Patients

A total of 62 healthy women with regular menses were included in the study.

Intervention

Cyclical oral contraception (21-d active/7-d placebo given for six consecutive 28-d cycles) vs. continuous (168-d active pill) therapy using a monophasic pill (20 microg ethinyl estradiol and 1 mg norethindrone acetate) was examined.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was vaginal bleeding, and secondary outcomes included hormonal, pelvic ultrasound, quality of life, and safety measures.

Results

There was no statistically significant difference in the number of total bleeding days between groups, but moderate/heavy bleeding was significantly greater with the cyclical regimen [mean 11.0 d (sd 8.5) vs. continuous 5.2 d (sd 6.8); P = 0.005], with both groups decreasing over time. Endogenous serum and urinary estrogens measured over six cycles were significantly lower (P = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively) in the continuous group than the cyclical group. Women in the continuous group also had a smaller ovarian volume and lead follicle size over the course of the trial by serial ultrasound examinations. The Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire showed that women on continuous therapy had less associated menstrual pain (P = 0.01) and favorable improvements in behavior (P = 0.04) during the premenstrual period.

Conclusions

Continuous oral contraception does not result in a reduction of bleeding days over a 168-d period of observation but provides greater suppression of the ovary and endometrium. These effects are associated with improved patient symptomatology.

### Effects of low-dose norethindrone acetate plus ethinyl estradiol (0.5 mg / 2.5 microg) in women with postmenopausal symptoms: updated analysis of three randomized, controlled trials [^116kkkHB]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Based on the potential risks of post-menopausal hormone therapy (HT) found by the Women's Health Initiative, guidelines for HT now recommend use of the lowest effective dose and shortest treatment duration consistent with individual treatment goals. Current (2003) guidance established by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that clinical assessments of HT include women with more frequent and more intense vasomotor symptoms than previously studied. Therefore, this analysis was conducted to further assess the efficacy of a low-dose combination of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol (NA/EE) previously assessed in dose-ranging studies, while meeting conservative FDA trial design and analysis criteria.

Objectives

The aim of this post hoc analysis and overview was to present data on the efficacy and tolerability of a low-dose combination-NA/EE 0.5 mg/2.5 microg-in the treatment of postmenopausal symptoms, based on data from previously published studies of NA/EE. In addition, the effects of low-dose NA/EE on bone and endometrium are briefly reviewed.

Methods

Data from 3 previously published randomized, placebo-controlled trials were analyzed using current FDA guidance for the assessment of HT in postmenopausal women. Studies 1 and 2 assessed the efficacy of NA/EE at various doses, including 0.5 mg/2.5 microg, in vasomotor symptom (hot-flush [HF]) relief over 16 and 12 weeks, respectively, using self-reporting of symptom frequency and intensity (scores: 0 = none; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; and 3 = severe) in daily diaries. Study 3 assessed the effects of NA/EE at various doses, including 0.5 mg/2.5 microg, on bone and endometrium, using quantitative computed tomography of the lumbar spine at 12 and 24 months and endometrial biopsy at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of treatment. In all 3 studies, women were asked to record vaginal bleeding and spotting in diaries. Any adverse events were recorded in diaries and/or at clinic visits. Physical and gynecologic examinations and standard clinical laboratory testing were conducted at baseline and at appropriate follow-up visits in all 3 studies.

Results

Studies 1, 2, and 3 enrolled 219, 266, and 1265 women, respectively. Overall, in studies 1 and 2, 91% of women were white, the mean age was approximately 52 years, and mean time since last menstrual period was approximately 24 months. In study 1, NA/EE 0.5 mg/2.5 microg was associated with significant reductions from baseline in mean weekly total HF frequency from week 4 (63.6%) through week 16 (73.7%) (all, P < 0.05). In study 2, the frequency of moderate or severe HFs was decreased by 61.1% at week 4 (P < 0.05) and by 82.2% at week 12 (P < 0.001) with NA/EE 0.5 mg/2.5 microg, and the mean intensity score was significantly lower than that with placebo at weeks 8 and 12 (both, P = 0.001). In study 3, cumulative amenorrhea rates were approximately 90% in the NA/EE 0.5-mg/2.5-microg and placebo groups at 12 months. Lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) was maintained at 24 months with NA/EE 0.5 mg/2.5 microg but was significantly decreased from baseline, by 7.4%, in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Endometrial hyperplasia was not observed in the group receiving NA/EE 0.5 mg/2.5 microg over 24 months. The tolerability of NA/EE was similar to that of placebo. The most common adverse events experienced with NA/EE were headache (15.2%), abdominal pain (10.2%), and breast pain (9.0%).

Conclusions

The results from this post hoc analysis and overview of 3 previously published studies suggest that NA/EE 0.5 mg/2.5 microg was associated with decreased frequency and intensity of vasomotor symptoms. This dose of NA/EE was also associated with maintenance of BMD over 24 months, a significant positive effect on BMD compared with placebo. Low-dose NA/EE was also associated with cumulative amenorrhea rates comparable to those of placebo and was not associated with endometrial hyperplasia. This dose was well tolerated, with rates of adverse events generally similar to those of placebo.

Oral contraceptives are highly effective. Table 2 lists the typical unintended pregnancy rates for users of combination oral contraceptives and other methods of contraception. The efficacy of these contraceptive methods, except sterilization, the IUD, and implants, depends upon the reliability with which they are used. Correct and consistent use of methods can result in lower failure rates.

5.8 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product.

In a clinical trial of Junel Fe 24, the frequency and duration of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 743 women (3,823 28-day cycles). A total of 10 subjects (1.3%) discontinued Junel Fe 24, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trial, [24 to 38%] of women using Junel Fe 24 experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the six months of the trial. The percent of women who experienced unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time.

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

Women who use Junel Fe 24 may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. In the clinical trial with Junel Fe 24, 31 to 41% of the women using Junel Fe 24 did not have a withdrawal menses in at least one of 6 cycles of use.

Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was preexistent.

If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

5.9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy

Extensive epidemiologic studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Junel Fe 24 use if pregnancy is confirmed.

Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) users on extended or continuous regimens — management may include a brief hormone-free interval with specific cautions. A hormone-free interval for 3–4 consecutive days is listed, but it is not recommended during the first 21 days of extended or continuous CHC use and not recommended more than once per month because contraceptive effectiveness might be reduced.

### Why stop now? Extended and continuous regimens of combined hormonal contraceptive methods [^113YVb6q]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) have traditionally been prescribed in 28-day cycles, with 21 days of active hormones followed by a 7-day hormone-free interval. Extended and continuous CHC regimens, defined as regimens with greater than 28 days of active hormones, offer many benefits, including a decrease in estrogen-withdrawal symptoms and likely greater efficacy because of more reliable ovulation suppression. Bleeding profiles are favorable, and unscheduled bleeding decreases over time with these regimens. Extended and continuous regimens of combined oral contraceptives and the contraceptive vaginal ring are safe and have high user acceptability and satisfaction. However, despite numerous benefits, extended and continuous CHC regimens are underused.

### Cyclical progestogens for heavy menstrual bleeding [^113qwG3Q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Excessively heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) or menorrhagia is an important cause of ill health in women. Eighty per cent of women treated for HMB have no anatomical pathology, which makes medical therapy, with the avoidance of possibly unnecessary surgery, an attractive alternative. Of the wide variety of medications used to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding, oral progestogens are the most commonly prescribed. This review assesses the effectiveness of two different regimens of oral progestogens in reducing ovulatory HMB.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of oral progestogen therapy taken either during the luteal phase or for a longer course of 21 days in achieving a reduction in menstrual blood loss in women of reproductive years with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB).

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched April 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2007) and EMBASE (1985 to April 2007). Attempts were also made to identify trials from citation lists of review articles. In most cases, the first author of each included trial was contacted.

Selection Criteria

The inclusion criteria were randomised comparisons of oral progestogen therapy versus placebo or other medical treatments in women of reproductive years with regular heavy periods measured either objectively or subjectively and with no pathological or iatrogenic causes for their heavy menstrual blood loss.

Data Collection and Analysis

Seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The review authors extracted the data independently. Odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes were estimated from the data.

Main Results

No RCTs comparing progestogen treatment with placebo were identified. Comparisons between oral progestogens and other medical therapies were assessed separately according to dosage regimen. Progestogen therapy during the luteal phase was significantly less effective at reducing menstrual blood loss when compared with tranexamic acid, danazol and the progesterone-releasing intrauterine system (IUS). Duration of menstruation was significantly longer with the progesterone IUS when compared with oral progestogen therapy but significantly shorter with danazol treatment. Adverse events were significantly more likely with danazol when compared with progestogen treatment. Progestogen therapy from day 5 to day 26 of the menstrual cycle was significantly less effective at reducing menstrual blood loss than the IUS. A significantly higher proportion of norethisterone (NET) patients taking progestogens found their treatment unacceptable compared to IUS patients. However, the adverse effects of breast tenderness and intermenstrual bleeding were more likely in women with the IUS.

Authors' Conclusions

Progestogens administered from day 15 or 19 to day 26 of the cycle offer no advantage over other medical therapies such as danazol, tranexamic acid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the IUS in the treatment of menorrhagia in women with ovulatory cycles. Progestogen therapy for 21 days of the cycle results in a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss, although women found the treatment less acceptable than intrauterine levonorgestrel. This regimen of progestogen may have a role in the short-term treatment of menorrhagia.

### Estradiol / norethindrone acetate transdermal system — combiPatch — estradiol / norethindrone acetate transdermal system [^1125kG7H]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical studies indicate that the addition of a progestin to an estrogen regimen at least 12 days per cycle reduces the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and the potential risk of adenocarcinoma in women with intact uteri. The addition of a progestin to an estrogen regimen has not been shown to interfere with the efficacy of estrogen therapy for its approved indications.

CombiPatch was effective in reducing the incidence of estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia after 1 year of therapy in two clinical trials. Nine hundred fifty-five (955) postmenopausal women (with intact uteri) were treated with (i) a continuous regimen of CombiPatch alone (Continuous Combined regimen), (ii) a sequential regimen with an estradiol-only (Vivelle 0.05 mg) transdermal system followed by a CombiPatch transdermal system (Continuous Sequential regimen), or (iii) continuous regimen with an estradiol-only transdermal system (Vivelle 0.05 mg). The incidence of endometrial hyperplasia (primary endpoint) was significantly less after 1 year of therapy with either CombiPatch regimen than with the estradiol-only transdermal system. Tables 5 and 6 summarize these results (intent-to-treat populations).

Effects on Uterine Bleeding or Spotting

With the Continuous Combined regimen, of the women treated with CombiPatch and who completed the 1-year study, the incidence of cumulative amenorrhea (the absence of bleeding or spotting during a 28-day cycle and sustained to the end of the study) increased over time. The incidence of amenorrhea from cycle 10 through 12 was 53 percent and 39 percent for the CombiPatch 0.05/0.14 mg per day and CombiPatch 0.05/0.25 mg per day treatment groups, respectively. Women who experienced bleeding usually characterized it as light (intensity of 1.3 on a scale of 1 to 4) with a duration of 4 and 6 days for the CombiPatch 0.05/0.14 mg per day and CombiPatch 0.05/0.25 mg per day treatment groups, respectively.

If the patient is unable to take norethindrone acetate due to medical contraindications or cost, they will receive medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg once daily as alternate oral progesterone. Figure 1 below highlights the study design. Contraceptive implant inserted & enrollment in the study. During the aygestin administration, patients will again receive daily SMS texts in the evening via the Qualtrics SMS program asking them to respond with their bleeding pattern that day.

The investigators will record responses according to the World Health Organization definitions of bleeding: bleeding day, spotting day, bleeding--- free day. Patients not reporting bothersome bleeding after the initial 90 days will continue to record bleeding via SMS texts for the next 6 months to serve as the control group. Following the principle of intent---to---treat, data from those in the Bothersome Bleeding group will be assigned to the aygestin group, despite that they are not taking it. During the first month, participants in the Bothersome Bleeding group will take one 5 mg tablets of aygestin twice daily. After 30 days, the dose of aygestin will be halved, such that only one 5 mg tablet is taken daily. Sixty days later, the Bothersome Bleeding group will discontinue aygestin. Ninety days later, both the normal group and the Bothersome Bleeding group will be re-evaluated.

### Hormone therapy in postmenopausal women and risk of endometrial hyperplasia [^114j5jMk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Reduced circulating estrogen levels around the time of the menopause can induce unacceptable symptoms that affect the health and well-being of women. Hormone therapy (both unopposed estrogen and estrogen/progestogen combinations) is an effective treatment for these symptoms, but is associated with risk of harms. Guidelines recommend that hormone therapy be given at the lowest effective dose and treatment should be reviewed regularly. The aim of this review is to identify the minimum dose(s) of progestogen required to be added to estrogen so that the rate of endometrial hyperplasia is not increased compared to placebo.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to assess which hormone therapy regimens provide effective protection against the development of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register (searched January 2012), The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2012), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2012), EMBASE (1980 to January 2012), Current Contents (1993 to May 2008), Biological Abstracts (1969 to 2008), Social Sciences Index (1980 to May 2008), PsycINFO (1972 to January 2012) and CINAHL (1982 to May 2008). Attempts were made to identify trials from citation lists of reviews and studies retrieved, and drug companies were contacted for unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of unopposed estrogen therapy, combined continuous estrogen-progestogen therapy, sequential estrogen-progestogen therapy with each other or placebo, administered over a minimum period of 12 months. Incidence of endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma assessed by a biopsy at the end of treatment was a required outcome. Data on adherence to therapy, rates of additional interventions, and withdrawals owing to adverse events were also extracted.

Data Collection and Analysis

In this update, 46 studies were included. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. The small numbers of studies in each comparison and the clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis for many outcomes.

Main Results

Unopposed estrogen is associated with increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia at all doses, and durations of therapy between one and three years. For women with a uterus the risk of endometrial hyperplasia with hormone therapy comprising low-dose estrogen continuously combined with a minimum of 1 mg norethisterone acetate (NETA) or 1.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is not significantly different from placebo at two years (1 mg NETA: OR 0.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0 to 2.8; 1.5 mg MPA: no hyperplasia events).

Authors' Conclusions

Hormone therapy for postmenopausal women with an intact uterus should comprise both estrogen and progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia.

### Oral hormone therapy with 17 β-estradiol and 17 β-estradiol in combination with norethindrone acetate in the prevention of bone loss in early postmenopausal women: dose-dependent effects [^116U8Ki7]. Menopause (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

A 2-year multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study examined the efficacy and safety of different doses of 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) alone and continuous-combined oral formulations of E(2) and norethindrone acetate (NETA) versus placebo in the prevention of bone loss in newly menopausal women.

Design

Patients were randomized to one of seven groups: placebo, E(2) 0.25 mg, E2 0.5 mg, E(2) 1 mg, E(2) 1 mg/NETA 0.25 mg, E(2) 1 mg/NETA 0.5 mg, or E(2) 2 mg/NETA 1 mg. Treatment was a once-daily tablet taken for 26 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine, measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, at screening and at 13, 19, and 26 months. BMD changes at the femoral neck and trochanter were also assessed. Biochemical markers of bone metabolism were measured at baseline, and at 3, 6, 13, 19, and 26 months. Histological diagnoses of endometrial samples were tabulated for each treatment group.

Results

A total of 327 women were randomized and 189 women completed the 2-year trial. BMD at the lumbar spine decreased 2.3% in the placebo group. The lowest dose of unopposed E(2) prevented bone loss at the spine and hip. Significant increases in spine BMD compared with placebo occurred in all groups of treatment with E(2) and were more pronounced in the combination groups. Compared with placebo, women receiving active treatment experienced greater reductions in bone resorption markers. The effects were evident by 6 months and generally remained stable thereafter. Adverse events, primarily associated with the endometrium, were the most common reasons for discontinuation.

Conclusions

There is a dose-dependent effect of E(2) on BMD. The addition of NETA seems to enhance the response in BMD observed with E(2). Low doses of E(2) (1 mg and lower) can be considered for the prevention of osteoporosis, while titrating the hormone dose to individual patient's needs.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^114ZDAEx]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

The information in this report is organized by contraceptive method. Recommendations are provided for permanent methods of contraception (tubal surgery and vasectomy) and for reversible methods of contraception, including the copper (380 mm 2) IUD (Cu-IUD) and LNG (13.5 mg, 19.5 mg, or 52 mg) IUD; the etonogestrel (ENG) implant; progestin-only injectables (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate [DMPA]); progestin-only pills (POPs; norethindrone, norgestrel, and drospirenone); combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) that contain both estrogen and a progestin, including COCs, combined transdermal patches, and combined vaginal rings; and the standard days method (SDM). Recommendations also are provided for emergency use of the Cu-IUD and emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs).

For each contraceptive method, recommendations are provided on the timing for initiation of the method and indications for when and for how long additional contraception, or a back-up method, is needed. Many of these recommendations include guidance that a patient may start a contraceptive method at any time during their menstrual cycle, if it is reasonably certain that they are not pregnant. Guidance for health care providers also is provided on how to be reasonably certain that a patient is not pregnant, testosterone use and risk for pregnancy, and when contraceptive protection is no longer needed.

For each contraceptive method, recommendations include the examinations and tests needed before initiation of the method. These recommendations apply to patients who are presumed to be healthy. Most patients need no or very few examinations or tests before initiating a contraceptive method although examinations or tests might be needed to address other noncontraceptive health needs. Patients with known medical problems or other special conditions might need additional examinations or tests before being determined to be appropriate candidates for a particular method of contraception. U.S. MEC might be useful in such circumstances. Any additional screening needed for preventive health care can be performed at the time of contraception initiation, and initiation should not be delayed for test results. The following classification system was developed by WHO and adopted by CDC to categorize the applicability of the various examinations or tests before initiation of contraceptive methods:

### Postmenopausal uterine bleeding profiles with two forms of continuous combined hormone replacement therapy [^114zJqV7]. Menopause (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was designed to compare the bleeding profiles of conjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg in combination with 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (Prempro; CEE/MPA group), the most widely prescribed continuous combined hormone replacement therapy (CCHRT) in the United States, with 17beta-estradiol 1 mg combined with 0.5 mg norethindrone acetate (Activella; E(2)/NETA group), a newly available CCHRT preparation, over a 6-month period.

Design

This study was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial. A total of 438 healthy postmenopausal women were randomized and received treatment (Activella n = 217, Prempro n = 221). Each woman recorded bleeding diaries daily. Total cholesterol, triglycerides, and endometrial biopsies were obtained at screening and end-of-trial visits.

Results

The more favorable bleeding profile was found in the E(2)/NETA (Activella) group. The differences in bleeding patterns were most marked in the first 3 months of treatment in women who were 1–2 years from last menses, with no bleeding in 71.4% vs. 40.0%; (p = 0.005) and with no bleeding and no spotting in 54.8% vs. 17.1%; (p = 0.001). Triglycerides fell by 8.5% in the E(2)/NETA group and increased by 11.7% in the CEE/MPA group (p < 0.001). Total cholesterol declined by 9.1% and 6.9%, respectively.

Conclusion

The most important factor in the continuation of HRT is uterine bleeding. E(2)/NETA has significantly less bleeding than the most commonly prescribed CCHRT CEE/MPA, therefore; E(2)/NETA should be associated with improved continuation rates. The patient taking E(2)/NETA will receive effective treatment for her menopausal symptoms with less bleeding.

### Gender-affirming endocrine care for youth with a nonbinary gender identity [^111wnTFG]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Menstrual suppression

Menses can be a source of distress for gender-diverse youth, and several hormonal medications are frequently used for menstrual suppression. These medications include progesterone-only oral pills (norethindrone, norethindrone acetate), injections (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate), or implants such as intrauterine devices. Intrauterine devices can be placed at any age after menarche occurs and have been studied in adolescents as young as 13 years. Combined oral contraceptive pills are also effective for menstrual suppression when used continuously, skipping the placebo week. Some nonbinary youth assigned female at birth may choose menstrual suppression alone or in combination with other options. While these medications are generally safe and effective, there are some concerns for low bone density in long-term use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, which should be considered if menstrual suppression alone is being used long term.

Anti-androgens

Anti-androgens such as spironolactone, finasteride, and bicalutamide are typically used in conjunction with estradiol for feminizing therapy to decrease androgen action, as estradiol alone does not sufficiently suppress testosterone production at physiologic levels. In nonbinary individuals assigned male at birth, anti-androgens may also be beneficial to use in conjunction with low-dose estradiol to decrease facial hair and body hair or to use alone, though there are little data to support the efficacy of this. Some of these medications may induce breast development even when used alone due to increasing testosterone levels and aromatization to estradiol, especially bicalutamide due to potency. This should be discussed as a potential effect in relation to the individuals' embodiment goals.

### The clinical rationale for menses-free contraception [^114MioWV]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

The impact of monthly menstruation may range from a minor inconvenience for some women to a major health concern for those who suffer from menstrual disorders and health conditions that are aggravated during their menstrual cycle. Oral contraceptives (OCs) have been used safely in continuous regimens for the treatment of menstrual disorders in some women and for others who choose to extend their 28-day menstrual cycle to accommodate major life events. There is no physiological requirement for the monthly hormone withdrawal bleed that is experienced by women taking cyclic OCs or for a menstrual period in women who do not desire to (or cannot) become pregnant. Thus, the use of continuous or extended-cycle OC regimens that eliminate the menstrual cycle represents a viable and attractive option for many women. The availability of more choices for menstrual suppression, such as continuous use of OCs, will improve the quality of life for many women who suffer from menstrual-related disorders and provide greater convenience for women with busy and active lifestyles.

14.2 Effects on the Endometrium

A 2-year, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized clinical trial was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol on maintaining bone mineral density, protecting the endometrium, and to determine effects on lipids. A total of 1,265 women were enrolled and randomized to either placebo, 0.2 mg norethindrone acetate/1 mcg ethinyl estradiol (NA/EE 0.2/1), 0.5 mg norethindrone acetate/2.5 mcg ethinyl estradiol (NA/EE 0.5/2.5), norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol 1/5 and 1 mg norethindrone acetate/10 mcg ethinyl estradiol (NA/EE 1/10) or matching unopposed EE doses (1, 2.5, 5, or 10 mcg) for a total of 9 treatment groups. All participants received 1000 mg of calcium supplementation daily. Of the 1,265 women randomized to the various treatment arms of this study, 137 were randomized to placebo, 146 to norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol 1/5, 136 to norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol 0.5/2.5 and 141 to EE 5 mcg and 137 to EE 2.5 mcg. Of these, 134 placebo, 143 norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol 1/5, 136 norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol 0.5/2.5, 139 EE 5 mcg and 137 EE 2.5 mcg had a baseline endometrial result. Baseline biopsies were classified as normal (in approximately 95 percent of subjects), or insufficient tissue (in approximately 5 percent of subjects). Follow-up biopsies were obtained in approximately 70 to 80 percent of patients in each arm after 12 and 24 months of therapy. Results for norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol 1/5 and appropriate comparators are shown in Table 5.

ACOG Committee Opinion — hormonal therapy for primary dysmenorrhea notes that the mechanism of action for hormonal methods is likely related to prevention of endometrial proliferation or ovulation, or both, thus decreasing prostaglandin and leukotriene production; compared with cyclic use of combined oral contraceptives, continuous regimens may result in a more rapid onset of pain reduction, but long-term success with both regimens is possible; continuous norethindrone acetate 5 mg (norethindrone) has been shown to be equally effective as a cyclic combined hormonal contraceptive and also decreases dysmenorrhea in women aged 18–23 years; gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists are not recommended for empiric use in suspected primary dysmenorrhea because of bone mineral density concerns.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — breakthrough bleeding during extended or continuous use is addressed as follows: A systematic review identified three studies with small study populations addressing treatment during extended or continuous CHCs, and in two separate RCTs of continuous use for 168 days, assigning a hormone-free interval of 3 or 4 days reported improved bleeding with an initial increase in flow followed by an abrupt decrease 7–8 days later and cessation 11–12 days later; compared with continued use without a hormone-free interval, a greater proportion reported either treatment failure or fewer days of amenorrhea. In another randomized trial of 66 women using 84 days of hormonally active pills, oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 5 days did not improve bleeding compared with placebo.

### Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol [^113LmKdJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

If you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use hormonal birth control because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.

Women who use birth control pills may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.

 What Should I Know about My Period when Taking Drospirenone and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets?

Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle, is unusually heavy, or lasts for more than a few days, call your healthcare provider.

Some women may not have a menstrual period but this should not be cause for alarm as long has you have taken the pills according to direction.

### Reduced vaginal bleeding in postmenopausal women who receive combined norethindrone acetate and low-dose ethinyl estradiol therapy versus combined conjugated equine estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy [^111KqWyA]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects on vaginal bleeding patterns of continuous combined hormone replacement therapy with norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol versus conjugated equine estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate.

Study Design

Three hundred fifty-seven postmenopausal women were selected randomly (in a blinded manner) to 12 months of treatment with 1 mg norethindrone acetate/5 microg ethinyl estradiol, placebo, or open-label 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens/2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (conjugated equine estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate [CEE/MPA]; Prempro). The incidence and duration of vaginal bleeding were assessed throughout the study. Statistical analyses used Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel methodology and analysis of variance.

Results

At 3 months, 1 mg norethindrone acetate/5 microg ethinyl estradiol therapy reduced the incidence of bleeding (12% vs 23%; P < .029) and bleeding and/or spotting (22% vs 44%; P < .001), compared with conjugated equine estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy. The mean duration of bleeding and bleeding and/or spotting were also reduced with 1 mg norethindrone acetate/5 microg ethinyl estradiol therapy versus conjugated equine estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate (P = 0.004 and P < .001, respectively). The incidence of cumulative amenorrhea at every monthly interval was significantly better with 1 mg norethindrone acetate/5 microg ethinyl estradiol therapy versus conjugated equine estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy (P < .05). Associated adverse event (ie, headache, breast pain) incidence rates were similar in the 2 active treatment groups.

Conclusion

The 1 mg norethindrone acetate/5 microg ethinyl estradiol therapy provides significantly better control of vaginal bleeding than conjugated equine estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy at all time points investigated in this 12-month study.

14.1 Effects on Vasomotor Symptoms in Postmenopausal Women

In a 12-week randomized clinical trial involving 92 subjects, estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets 1 mg/0.5 mg was compared to 1 mg of estradiol and to placebo. The mean number and intensity of hot flushes were significantly reduced from baseline to week 4 and 12 in both the estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets 1 mg/0.5 mg and the 1 mg estradiol group compared to placebo (see Figure 2).

In a study conducted in Europe a total of 577 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to either estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets 0.5 mg/0.1 mg, 0.5 mg E2/0.25 mg NETA, or placebo for 24 weeks of treatment. The mean number and severity of hot flushes were significantly reduced at week 4 and week 12 in the estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets 0.5 mg/0.1 mg (see Figure 3) and 0.5 mg E2/0.25 mg NETA groups compared to placebo.

14.2 Effects on the Endometrium in Postmenopausal Women

Estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets 1 mg/0.5 mg reduced the incidence of estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia at 1 year in a randomized, controlled clinical trial. This trial enrolled 1,176 postmenopausal women who were randomized to one of 4 arms: 1 mg estradiol unopposed (n = 296), 1 mg E2 + 0.1 mg NETA (n = 294), 1 mg E2+ 0.25 mg NETA (n = 291), and estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets 1 mg/0.5 mg (n = 295). At the end of the study, endometrial biopsy results were available for 988 women. The results of the 1 mg estradiol unopposed arm compared to estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets 1 mg/0.5 mg are shown in Table 4.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Lomedia 24 Fe tablets are indicated for the prevention of pregnancy in women who elect to use oral contraceptives as a method of contraception.

Oral contraceptives are highly effective. Table 2 lists the typical unplanned pregnancy rates for users of combination oral contraceptives and other methods of contraception. The efficacy of these contraceptive methods, except sterilization, the IUD, and the Norplant®*system, depends upon the reliability with which they are used. Correct and consistent use of methods can result in lower failure rates.

Switching from Another Contraceptive Method

Timing: All POPs may be started immediately if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3). Waiting for the patient's next menstrual cycle is unnecessary.
Need for back-up contraception: º Norethindrone or norgestrel POPs: If it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 2 days. º DRSP POPs: If it has been > 1 day since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.
Switching from an IUD: In addition to the need for back-up contraception when starting POPs, there might be additional concerns when switching from an IUD. If the patient has had sexual intercourse since the start of their current menstrual cycle and it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, theoretically, residual sperm might be in the genital tract, which could lead to fertilization if ovulation occurs. A health care provider may consider any of the following options to address the potential for residual sperm: º Advise the patient to retain the IUD for at least 7 days after POPs are initiated and return for IUD removal. º Advise the patient to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for 7 days before removing the IUD and switching to the new method. The patient should also follow the back-up contraception recommendations for either norethindrone or norgestrel POPs or for DRSP POPs. º If the patient cannot return for IUD removal and has not abstained from sexual intercourse or used barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for 7 days, advise the patient to use ECPs at the time of IUD removal. All POPs may be started immediately after use of ECPs (with the exception of UPA). All POPs may be started no sooner than 5 days after use of UPA. The patient should also follow the back-up contraception recommendations for either norethindrone or norgestrel POPs or for DRSP POPs.

### Bleeding patterns in postmenopausal women using continuous combination hormone replacement therapy with conjugated estrogen and medroxyprogesterone acetate or with 17 β-estradiol and norethindrone acetate [^1147K7Pm]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

We studied bleeding patterns in postmenopausal women who were using 2 types of continuous combination regimens.

Study Design

A prospective, double-blind, randomized study of 208 postmenopausal women treated with conjugated estrogen, 0.625 mg, and medroxyprogesterone acetate, 5 mg, or with 17beta-estradiol, 2 mg, and norethindrone acetate, 1 mg.

Results

The mean number of bleeding days decreased during the first 4 months of treatment (P < .002) but not thereafter. The number of bleeding days was fewer (P < .002) and the time until amenorrhea was shorter (P < .02) in patients receiving conjugated estrogen and medroxyprogesterone acetate than in patients receiving 17beta-estradiol and norethindrone acetate. The odds ratio for progression to amenorrhea with the use of conjugated estrogen and medroxyprogesterone acetate was 1.58, in comparison with the use of 17beta-estradiol and norethindrone acetate. A thick endometrium at the start of treatment resulted in more bleeding days than were found for a thin endometrium (P < .03). Body mass index, age, and blood pressure had no predictive value for bleeding problems.

Conclusions

Treatment with continuous combined conjugated estrogen and medroxyprogesterone acetate resulted in fewer bleeding problems than did treatment with 17beta-estradiol and norethindrone acetate. Endometrial thickness may help to predict the chance of achieving amenorrhea during early hormone replacement therapy.
