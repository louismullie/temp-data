## Question

whats glucagons role in this treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what glucagon's role is in this treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where glucagon is used. Then, I should verify the core pharmacology and mechanism of action. Next, I will examine approved indications and guideline-backed uses. After that, I need to review emerging or investigational roles. Then, I should compare formulations and delivery systems. Finally, I will assess safety, contraindications, and synthesize a concise clinical takeaway with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts in which glucagon is therapeutically relevant, because I need to ensure I'm not conflating different scenarios. The main buckets are acute hypoglycemia rescue, diabetes pathophysiology and therapy, and non-glycemic emergencies such as beta-blocker toxicity and radiologic GI motility inhibition, with additional investigational metabolic roles in obesity and liver disease, so I will keep these distinct as I proceed [^116bfwdk] [^114MHkee] [^112kpbJM] [^115KTDPF] [^1171oZjN].

> I will now examine the core pharmacology to anchor mechanism-based reasoning. Glucagon binds the hepatic glucagon receptor, activates adenylate cyclase, increases cAMP, and via PKA drives glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to raise blood glucose; it also has clinically relevant effects on energy expenditure, appetite, and lipid metabolism, which explains its expanding therapeutic footprint beyond hypoglycemia rescue [^113Zxzix] [^1138m4Gx] [^11794Wwv].

> Next, I should review the primary, guideline-endorsed indication: severe hypoglycemia rescue. Hold on, let me verify the standards of care. ADA 2025 recommends prescribing glucagon for all individuals with diabetes on insulin or at high risk for hypoglycemia, with education of caregivers and preference for formulations that do not require reconstitution; Endocrine Society similarly recommends ready-to-use glucagon for outpatients with severe hypoglycemia, and FDA labeling confirms use for severe hypoglycemia when oral carbohydrates are not feasible [^114MHkee] [^111xVEMh] [^113v9i2Q] [^115KTDPF].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiologic rationale in insulin-treated diabetes, because I need to ensure the indication is mechanistically coherent. In T1D and advanced T2D, the normal counterregulatory glucagon response to falling glucose is impaired, so exogenous glucagon restores hepatic glucose output when endogenous defenses fail; this is precisely why guidelines mandate access to glucagon for people on insulin therapy [^115GdowE] [^114MHkee].

> I should confirm dosing and practicalities, and I need to check pediatric nuances. Standard adult dosing is 1 mg IM/IV/SC or 3 mg intranasally, with pediatric dosing 0.5 mg if under 20 kg; newer ready-to-use options (nasal, autoinjector, prefilled pen) reduce administration time and caregiver burden compared with reconstituted kits, which is clinically meaningful in emergencies [^1135ceAh] [^112zYN4c] [^115VXUQ4].

> Now, let me consider non-glycemic emergency uses, and I should double-check the strength of evidence. Glucagon is recommended to consider in beta-blocker–associated refractory bradycardia or anaphylaxis due to its cAMP-mediated inotropy/chronotropy independent of beta-receptors; ACC/AHA/HRS and allergy guidelines support its use when epinephrine fails or is insufficient, though data are limited and it is typically a bridge therapy [^112kpbJM] [^112KqVTP] [^116wMbQd].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic indication, and I need to ensure dosing accuracy. For GI radiology, glucagon is used to temporarily inhibit motility; typical doses are 0.2–0.5 mg IV for stomach/small bowel and 0.5–0.75 mg IV for colon, or 1–2 mg IM depending on the segment, aligning with FDA labeling for diagnostic aid [^115KTDPF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about chronic glucagon use; I should verify the investigational metabolic roles. Emerging strategies co-agonize glucagon with GLP-1 (and sometimes GIP) to leverage weight loss and hepatic lipid effects while mitigating hyperglycemia risk; early clinical data with dual/triple agonists show substantial weight loss and NASH improvements, but long-term safety and optimal balance of signaling remain under study [^1171oZjN] [^116bfwdk].

> I need to check the diabetes pathophysiology angle because it informs why glucagon is both rescued and targeted. Hyperglucagonemia contributes to fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia in T2D, and therapies that suppress glucagon (GLP-1 RAs, DPP-4 inhibitors, metformin) derive part of their glycemic benefit from this mechanism; conversely, impaired alpha-cell counterregulation in T1D underlies hypoglycemia risk, necessitating rescue glucagon [^111tfSgn] [^117HnJhe].

> Let me review formulation evolution, and I should confirm comparative advantages. Traditional kits require reconstitution and are slower to administer; ready-to-use options (nasal baqsimi, autoinjector gvoke, prefilled zegalogue) reduce administration time by roughly 30–60 seconds in simulations, which can be decisive in severe hypoglycemia, and guidelines prefer these formulations for ease of use and speed [^112zYN4c] [^112GeyNd] [^114MHkee].

> I should confirm safety and limitations, and I need to ensure I flag key caveats. Glucagon is ineffective if hepatic glycogen is depleted (starvation, adrenal insufficiency, chronic hypoglycemia), can cause nausea/vomiting, and may transiently raise heart rate; in neonates, evidence for glucagon in hypoglycemia is limited and recurrent hypoglycemia is common, so it is a short-term adjunct while definitive therapy is arranged [^1135ceAh] [^1114nSzA].

> But wait, what about chronic glucagon agonism for obesity — does it remain metabolically favorable over time? Acute studies show increased energy expenditure without compensatory intake, but longer infusions suggest tachyphylaxis of thermogenic effects; thus, sustained weight benefits likely require careful receptor balancing in multi-agonists rather than chronic glucagon monotherapy, which remains investigational [^1136sCuv] [^1171oZjN].

> Let me synthesize the clinical takeaway, and I should double-check that it aligns with guidelines and evidence. Glucagon's primary, evidence-based role is as a rescue therapy for severe hypoglycemia in insulin-treated diabetes, with strong guideline support and clear advantages of ready-to-use formulations; secondary roles include beta-blocker toxicity and GI motility inhibition, while metabolic applications in obesity and NASH are promising but not yet standard of care, pending definitive long-term safety and efficacy data [^114MHkee] [^112kpbJM] [^115KTDPF] [^1171oZjN].

Glucagon is used in diabetes care for two main purposes: **emergency treatment of severe hypoglycemia** [^114cw85c] and **adjunct therapy in artificial pancreas systems**. It rapidly raises blood glucose by stimulating **hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis** [^111rQbZa], making it essential when oral carbohydrates are not feasible [^114cw85c]. In closed-loop systems, **mini-dose glucagon** helps prevent or treat impending hypoglycemia without the caloric load of carbohydrates [^113LVobs]. It is not used for routine glycemic control because of its **hyperglycemic effect** [^113LVobs] [^111rQbZa]; instead, it is reserved for rescue and select adjunctive uses, with ready-to-use formulations preferred for ease and speed of administration [^112GeyNd] [^112zYN4c].

## Clinical indications for glucagon in diabetes treatment

### Emergency treatment of severe hypoglycemia

- **Primary indication**: Glucagon is indicated for severe hypoglycemia when the patient is unconscious, unable to swallow, or cannot safely receive oral carbohydrates [^114cw85c] [^115KTDPF].

- **Mechanism of action**: Glucagon binds hepatic receptors, activating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to rapidly raise blood glucose [^113Zxzix] [^111rQbZa].

- **Clinical guidelines**: ADA 2025 recommends prescribing glucagon to all insulin-treated or high-risk patients, with education for caregivers on use; ready-to-use formulations are preferred [^111xVEMh] [^114MHkee].

- **Formulations**: Ready-to-use options (nasal, autoinjector, prefilled pen) enable faster, simpler administration than reconstituted kits [^112zYN4c].

---

### Adjunct therapy in artificial pancreas systems

In dual-hormone artificial pancreas systems, **mini-dose glucagon** is delivered to prevent or treat impending hypoglycemia, reducing hypoglycemia exposure and improving time in range [^113LVobs]. These systems coordinate insulin and glucagon delivery to mimic physiologic counterregulation, enhancing safety during intensive insulin therapy [^116t4jx6].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Hyperglycemic risk**: Glucagon can cause hyperglycemia, so it is not used for routine glycemic control [^112zYN4c].

- **Contraindications**: Use is limited in patients with pheochromocytoma or insulinoma due to potential adverse effects.

- **Patient education**: Caregivers must be trained to recognize hypoglycemia and administer glucagon promptly [^114cw85c].

### The role of glucagon in the pathophysiology and management of diabetes [^117HnJhe]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

There is general recognition that insulin and glucagon are the main hormones involved in the pathophysiology of diabetes, but the role of glucagon in diabetes is complex and in some circumstances controversial. The increasing appreciation of the role of glucagon in currently used hypoglycemic agents and the ongoing development of glucagon-targeted therapies underscores glucagon's important contribution in optimizing diabetes management. The current review provides a background on glucagon physiology and pathophysiology and an update for investigators, endocrinologists, and other healthcare providers on glucagon-modulating therapies.

Methods

A literature review was conducted utilizing published literature in PubMed and AccessMedicine including the years 1922–2015 using the following key words: glucagon, bihormonal, diabetes mellitus, glucagon antagonists, glucagon-targeted therapies.

Results

Glucagon is a counterregulatory hormone that promotes hepatic glucose production, thus preventing hypoglycemia in normal physiology. In patients with diabetes mellitus, glucagon secretion may be unregulated, which contributes to problems with glucose homeostasis. Several of the most effective therapies for diabetes have been found to suppress glucagon secretion or action, which may contribute to their success. Additionally, glucagon-specific targeted therapies, such as glucagon receptor antagonists, are being studied at a basic and clinical level.

Conclusion

Glucagon plays an important role in contributing to hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes. Utilizing hypoglycemic agents that decrease glucagon secretion or inhibit glucagon action can help improve glycemic control, making these agents a valuable resource in diabetes therapy.

### Clinical pharmacology of glucagon [^114zWw7x]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Glucagon was discovered about a hundred years ago and its role in health and disease is under continuous investigation. Glucagon is a counter regulatory hormone secreted by alpha cells of the pancreas in response to multiple stimuli. Although some of glucagon's actions and its clinical application have been described, clinical experience with glucagon has been historically overshadowed by that of insulin. To date, the role of glucagon's actions in pharmacotherapy has been under explored. Glucagon plays a considerable role as a hormonal regulator via its known actions on the liver. The rise in obesity and diabetes mellitus prevalence is bringing focus to glucagon's known physiological roles and possible clinical applications. Six glucagon products and a glucagon analog are approved for use in the United States. Clinical pharmacology studies provide crucial support of glucagon's actions as evident from comprehensive pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics evaluations in humans. Here, we briefly describe the established physiological role of glucagon in humans and its known relationship with disease. We later summarize the clinical pharmacology of available glucagon products with different routes of administration.

### Repositioning glucagon action in the physiology and pharmacology of diabetes [^111YQhH1]. Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

Glucagon is historically described as the counterregulatory hormone to insulin, induced by fasting/hypoglycemia to raise blood glucose through action mediated in the liver. However, it is becoming clear that the biology of glucagon is much more complex and extends beyond hepatic actions to exert control on glucose metabolism. We discuss the inconsistencies with the canonical view that glucagon is primarily a hyperglycemic agent driven by fasting/hypoglycemia and highlight the recent advances that have reshaped the metabolic role of glucagon. These concepts are placed within the context of both normal physiology and the pathophysiology of disease and then extended to discuss emerging strategies that incorporate glucagon agonism in the pharmacology of treating diabetes.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1: are its roles as endogenous hormone and therapeutic wizard congruent? [^114nGJZy]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a peptide derived from differential processing of the precursor for the hormone glucagon. It is secreted predominantly by endocrine cells in the gut epithelium in response to nutrient stimulation. Studies from the last 35 years have given us an idea about its physiological functions. On the basis of some of its many actions, it has also been developed into a pharmaceutical agent for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). It is currently positioned as the most effective anti-obesity agent available and is recommended in both national and international guidelines as an effective second-in line treatment for T2DM, in particular in patients with increased cardiovascular risk. In this review, I first discuss whether the processing of proglucagon may also result in GLP-1 formation in the pancreas and in glucagon in the gut. Next, I discuss the relationship between the physiological actions of GLP-1 and the therapeutic effects of the GLP-1 receptor agonists, which are far from being congruent and generally poorly understood. These relationships illustrate both the difficulties and the benefits of bridging results obtained in the laboratory with those emerging from the clinic.

Conclusions

In summary, the relevance of dysfunctional glucagon secretion to the pathogenesis of diabetes has been widely recognized and, for that reason, targeting glucagon and not only insulin secretion abnormalities in the treatment of T2D has gained increased interest. The well-established actions of GLP-1 as a negative regulator of glucagon and as a positive regulator of insulin and the availabitily of GLP-1RA and DPP-4i provide the opportunity of targeting both main hormones implicated in diabetes pathophysiology. Whether these drugs allow a possible recovery of beta-to-alpha cell mass is a new open avenue for researching.

### The past, present, and future physiology and pharmacology of glucagon [^11794Wwv]. Cell Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The evolution of glucagon has seen the transition from an impurity in the preparation of insulin to the development of glucagon receptor agonists for use in type 1 diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, glucagon receptor antagonists have been explored to reduce glycemia thought to be induced by hyperglucagonemia. However, the catabolic actions of glucagon are currently being leveraged to target the rise in obesity that paralleled that of diabetes, bringing the pharmacology of glucagon full circle. During this evolution, the physiological importance of glucagon advanced beyond the control of hepatic glucose production, incorporating critical roles for glucagon to regulate both lipid and amino acid metabolism. Thus, it is unsurprising that the study of glucagon has left several paradoxes that make it difficult to distill this hormone down to a simplified action. Here, we describe the history of glucagon from the past to the present and suggest some direction to the future of this field.

### The role of dysregulated glucagon secretion in type 2 diabetes [^111tfSgn]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Excessive production of glucose by the liver contributes to fasting and postprandial hyperglycaemia, hallmarks of type 2 diabetes. A central feature of this pathologic response is insufficient hepatic insulin action, due to a combination of insulin resistance and impaired β-cell function. However, a case can be made that glucagon also plays a role in dysregulated hepatic glucose production and abnormal glucose homeostasis. Plasma glucagon concentrations are inappropriately elevated in diabetic individuals, and α-cell suppression by hyperglycaemia is blunted. Experimental evidence suggests that this contributes to greater rates of hepatic glucose production in the fasting state and attenuated reduction after meals. Recent studies in animal models indicate that reduction of glucagon action can have profound effects to mitigate hyperglycaemia even in the face of severe hypoinsulinaemia. While there are no specific treatments for diabetic patients yet available that act specifically on the glucagon signalling pathway, newer agents including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors reduce plasma glucagon and this is thought to contribute to their action to lower blood glucose. The α-cell and glucagon receptor remain tempting targets for novel diabetes treatments, but it is important to understand the magnitude of benefit new strategies would provide as preclinical models suggest that chronic interference with glucagon action could entail adverse effects as well.

### Glucagon antagonism as a potential therapeutic target in type 2 diabetes [^1153R7yC]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Glucagon is a hormone secreted from the alpha cells of the pancreatic islets. Through its effect on hepatic glucose production (HGP), glucagon plays a central role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), abnormal regulation of glucagon secretion has been implicated in the development of fasting and postprandial hyperglycaemia. Therefore, new therapeutic agents based on antagonizing glucagon action, and hence blockade of glucagon-induced HGP, could be effective in lowering both fasting and postprandial hyperglycaemia in patients with T2DM. This review focuses on the mechanism of action, safety and efficacy of glucagon antagonists in the treatment of T2DM and discusses the challenges associated with this new potential antidiabetic treatment modality.

### Islet α cells and glucagon – critical regulators of energy homeostasis [^1163dGuX]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Glucagon is secreted from islet α cells and controls blood levels of glucose in the fasting state. Impaired glucagon secretion predisposes some patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) to hypoglycaemia; whereas hyperglycaemia in patients with T1DM or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is often associated with hyperglucagonaemia. Hence, therapeutic strategies to safely achieve euglycaemia in patients with diabetes mellitus now encompass bihormonal approaches to simultaneously deliver insulin and glucagon (in patients with T1DM) or reduce excess glucagon action (in patients with T1DM or T2DM). Glucagon also reduces food intake and increases energy expenditure through central and peripheral mechanisms, which suggests that activation of signalling through the glucagon receptor might be useful for controlling body weight. Here, we review new data that is relevant to understanding α-cell biology and glucagon action in the brain, liver, adipose tissue and heart, with attention to normal physiology, as well as conditions associated with dysregulated glucagon action. The feasibility and safety of current and emerging glucagon-based therapies that encompass both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches for the treatment of T1DM, T2DM and obesity is discussed in addition to developments, challenges and critical gaps in our knowledge that require additional investigation.

### Glucagon in type 2 diabetes: friend or foe? [^115oyT3C]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyperglucagonemia is one of the 'ominous' eight factors underlying the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Glucagon is a peptide hormone involved in maintaining glucose homoeostasis by increasing hepatic glucose output to counterbalance insulin action. Long neglected, the introduction of dual and triple agonists exploiting glucagon signalling pathways has rekindled the interest in this hormone beyond its classic effect on glycaemia. Glucagon can promote weight loss by regulating food intake, energy expenditure, and brown and white adipose tissue functions through mechanisms still to be fully elucidated, thus its role in T2D pathogenesis should be further investigated. Moreover, the role of glucagon in the development of T2D micro- and macro-vascular complications is elusive. Mounting evidence suggests its beneficial effect in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, while few studies postulated its favourable role in peripheral neuropathy and retinopathy. Contrarily, glucagon receptor agonism might induce renal changes resembling diabetic nephropathy, and data concerning glucagon actions on the cardiovascular system are conflicting. This review aims to summarise the available findings on the role of glucagon in the pathogenesis of T2D and its complications. Further experimental and clinical data are warranted to better understand the implications of glucagon signalling modulation with new antidiabetic drugs.

### The metabolic actions of glucagon revisited [^1138m4Gx]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2010). Medium credibility.

The initial identification of glucagon as a counter-regulatory hormone to insulin revealed this hormone to be of largely singular physiological and pharmacological purpose. Glucagon agonism, however, has also been shown to exert effects on lipid metabolism, energy balance, body adipose tissue mass and food intake. The ability of glucagon to stimulate energy expenditure, along with its hypolipidemic and satiating effects, in particular, make this hormone an attractive pharmaceutical agent for the treatment of dyslipidemia and obesity. Studies that describe novel preclinical applications of glucagon, alone and in concert with glucagon-like peptide 1 agonism, have revealed potential benefits of glucagon agonism in the treatment of the metabolic syndrome. Collectively, these observations challenge us to thoroughly investigate the physiology and therapeutic potential of insulin's long-known opponent.

### The role of self-monitoring of blood glucose in glucagon-like peptide-1-based treatment approaches: a European expert recommendation [^115dBg1P]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2012). Low credibility.

The role of glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1-based treatment approaches for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing. Although self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) has been performed in numerous studies on GLP-1 analogs and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, the potential role of SMBG in GLP-1-based treatment strategies has not been elaborated. The expert recommendation suggests individualized SMBG strategies in GLP-1-based treatment approaches and suggests simple and clinically applicable SMBG schemes. Potential benefits of SMBG in GLP-1-based treatment approaches are early assessment of treatment success or failure, timely modification of treatment, detection of hypoglycemic episodes, assessment of glucose excursions, and support of diabetes management and diabetes education. Its length and frequency should depend on the clinical setting and the quality of metabolic control. It is considered to play an important role for the optimization of diabetes management in T2DM patients treated with GLP-1-based approaches.

### The emerging role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the management of NAFLD [^113fRrQo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Context

The burden of cirrhosis from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is reaching epidemic proportions in the United States. This calls for greater awareness among endocrinologists, who often see but may miss the diagnosis in adults with obesity or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) who are at the highest risk. At the same time, recent studies suggest that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are beneficial vs nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in this population. This minireview aims to assist endocrinologists to recognize the condition and recent work on the role of GLP-1RAs in NAFLD/NASH.

Evidence acquisition

Evidence from observational studies, randomized controlled trials, and meta-analyses.

Evidence synthesis

Endocrinologists should lead multidisciplinary teams to implement recent consensus statements on NAFLD that call for screening and treatment of clinically significant fibrosis to prevent cirrhosis, especially in the high-risk groups (ie, people with obesity, prediabetes, or T2D). With no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents, weight loss is central to successful management, with pharmacological treatment options limited today to vitamin E (in people without T2D) and diabetes medications that reverse steatohepatitis, such as pioglitazone or GLP-1RA. Recently, the benefit of GLP-1RAs in NAFLD, suggested from earlier trials, has been confirmed in adults with biopsy-proven NASH. In 2021, the FDA also approved semaglutide for obesity management.

Conclusion

A paradigm change is developing between the endocrinologist's greater awareness about their critical role to curve the epidemic of NAFLD and new clinical care pathways that include a broader use of GLP-1RAs in the management of these complex patients.

### Mechanisms of action and therapeutic application of glucagon-like peptide-1 [^1138JBP5]. Cell Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) released from gut enteroendocrine cells controls meal-related glycemic excursions through augmentation of insulin and inhibition of glucagon secretion. GLP-1 also inhibits gastric emptying and food intake, actions maximizing nutrient absorption while limiting weight gain. Here I review the circuits engaged by endogenous versus pharmacological GLP-1 action, highlighting key GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R)-positive cell types and pathways transducing metabolic and non-glycemic GLP-1 signals. The role(s) of GLP-1 in the benefits and side effects associated with bariatric surgery are discussed and actions of GLP-1 controlling islet function, appetite, inflammation, and cardiovascular pathophysiology are highlighted. Refinement of the risk-versus-benefit profile of GLP-1-based therapies for the treatment of diabetes and obesity has stimulated development of orally bioavailable agonists, allosteric modulators, and unimolecular multi-agonists, all targeting the GLP-1R. This review highlights established and emerging concepts, unanswered questions, and future challenges for development and optimization of GLP-1R agonists in the treatment of metabolic disease.

### Glucagon for hypoglycaemia treatment in type 1 diabetes [^114PneCt]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

To achieve strict glycaemic control and avoid chronic diabetes complications, individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are recommended to follow an intensive insulin regimen. However, the risk and fear of hypoglycaemia often prevent individuals from achieving the treatment goals. Apart from early insulin suspension in insulin pump users, carbohydrate ingestion is the only option for preventing and treating non-severe hypoglycaemic events. These rescue treatments may give extra calories and cause overweight. As an alternative, the use of low-dose glucagon to counter hypoglycaemia has been proposed as a tool to raise glucose concentrations without adding extra calories. Previously, the commercially available glucagon formulations required reconstitution from powder to a solution before being injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly-making it practical only for treating severe hypoglycaemia. Several companies have developed more stable formulations that do not require the time-consuming reconstitution process before use. As well as treating severe hypoglycaemia, non-severe and impending hypoglycaemia can also be treated with lower doses of glucagon. Once available, low-dose glucagon can be either delivered manually, as an injection, or automatically, by an infusion pump. This review focuses on the role and perspectives of using glucagon to treat and prevent hypoglycaemia in T1D.

### The role of glucagon on type 2 diabetes at a glance [^112tWYGG]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

The opposite effects of insulin and glucagon in fuel homeostasis, the paracrine/endocrine inhibitory effects of insulin on glucagon secretion and the hyperglucagonemia in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) have long been recognized. Inappropriately increased alpha-cell function importantly contributes to hyperglycemia and reflects the loss of tonic restraint normally exerted by high local concentrations of insulin on alpha-cells, possibly as a result of beta-cell failure and alpha-cell insulin resistance, but additional mechanisms, such as the participation of incretin hormones in this response, have also been suggested. Three classes of drugs already available for clinical use address the abnormalities of glucagon secretion in T2D, namely, the GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), the inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4i) and the amylin agonist pramlintide; it has been proposed that the glucagonostatic and insulinotropic effects of GLP-1RA equally contribute to their hypoglycemic efficacy. In this review, the control of glucagon secretion and its participation in T2D pathogenesis are summarized.

### Glucagon, from past to present: a century of intensive research and controversies [^116bfwdk]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

2022 corresponds to the 100th anniversary of the discovery of glucagon. This TimeCapsule aims to recall the main steps leading to the discovery, characterisation, and clinical importance of the so-called second pancreatic hormone. We describe the early historical findings in basic research (ie, discovery, purification, structure, α-cell origin, radioimmunoassay, glucagon gene [GCG], and glucagon receptor [GLR]), in which three future Nobel Prize laureates were actively involved. Considered as an anti-insulin hormone, glucagon was rapidly used to treat insulin-induced hypoglycaemic coma episodes in people with type 1 diabetes. A key step in the story of glucagon was the discovery of its role and the role of α cells in the physiology and pathophysiology (ie, paracrinopathy) of type 2 diabetes. This concept led to the design of different strategies targeting glucagon, among which GLP-1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists were a major breakthrough, and combination of inhibition of glucagon secretion with stimulation of insulin secretion (both in a glucose-dependent manner). Taking advantage of the glucagon-induced increase in energy metabolism, biased coagonists were developed. Besides the GLP-1 receptor, these coagonists also target the glucagon receptor to further promote weight loss. Thus, the 100-year story of glucagon has most probably not come to an end.

### Taking aim at islet hormones with GLP-1: is insulin or glucagon the better target? [^113kmeFR]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Do the questions raised about the results in this paper diminish the importance of the results to the clinical application of GLP-1 in diabetes? Probably not. The work of Hare et al. is interesting and informative and, given the current techniques for studying human subjects, it gives as close an approximation of GLP-1 effects on islet secretion as we could ask for. At the least, these results reinforce the potential of glucagon suppression as a useful adjunct to the more conventional insulin–action approaches to treating diabetes. It is probable that the contribution of glucagon to hyperglycemia varies among diabetic patients, and tailored therapy focused on glucagon lowering might be especially effective in some individuals. The ability to target both islet hormones has been one of the novel additions that GLP-1r agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors bring to the therapeutic profile for diabetes. GLP-1 has been an exciting bench-to-bedside success, and taking observations from the clinical application of GLP-1 back to the lab for reexamination seems like a fruitful approach for revising and extending these advances.

### Glucagon in artificial pancreas systems: potential benefits and safety profile of future chronic use [^113LVobs]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

The role of glucagon in the pathophysiology of diabetes has long been recognized, although its approved clinical use has so far been limited to the emergency treatment of severe hypoglycaemia. A novel use of glucagon as intermittent mini-boluses is proposed in the dual-hormone version (insulin and glucagon) of the external artificial pancreas. Short-term studies suggest that the incorporation of glucagon into artificial pancreas systems has the potential to further decrease hypoglycaemic risk and improve overall glucose control; however, the potential long-term safety and benefits also need to be investigated given the recognized systemic effects of glucagon. In the present report, we review the available animal and human data on the physiological functions of glucagon, as well as its pharmacological use, according to dosing and duration (acute and chronic). Along with its main role in hepatic glucose metabolism, glucagon affects the cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary and gastrointestinal systems. It has a potential role in weight reduction through its central satiety function and its role in increasing energy expenditure. Most of the pharmacological studies investigating the effects of glucagon have used doses exceeding 1 mg, in contrast to the mini-boluses used in the artificial pancreas. The available data are reassuring but comprehensive human studies using small but chronic glucagon doses that are close to the physiological ranges are lacking. We propose a list of variables that could be monitored during long-term trials of the artificial pancreas.

Treatment of hypoglycaemia

Glucagon should be prescribed for all individuals at increased risk of level 2 hypoglycaemia, defined as blood glucose < 3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL), so that it is available in emergency situations. 6 In a study of people with insulin‐treated diabetes who were admitted to the emergency department with severe hypoglycaemia, less than 10% filled a glucagon prescription within 90 days of their emergency department visit. 54 However, severe hypoglycaemia events may not be apparent to HCPs, because 33%–50% of people with diabetes do not discuss their most recent severe hypoglycaemia event with their HCP; additionally, more than 40% of people wait more than a month to discuss the severe hypoglycaemia event. 55 Caregivers, school personnel or family members of these individuals should be informed as to where glucagon is stored and know when and how to administer it. Importantly, glucagon administration is not limited to HCPs.

### The emerging role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the management of NAFLD [^114xj7Bz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition to lifestyle changes, such as adoption of a Mediterranean diet and regular exercise to promote weight loss in obesity, management includes becoming familiar with treatment options already included in recent consensus statements and several guidelines. Although many drugs are in development for the treatment of NASH, currently no treatment is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved. However, vitamin E has been shown in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to induce liver histological benefit in adults with NASH without diabetes with results that were more mixed in patients with T2D. Pioglitazone improves steatohepatitis, and to a lesser extent fibrosis, both in patients with and without diabetes. However, as discussed next, this review hopes to increase the awareness among endocrinologists about the role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) not only as a valuable asset to manage diabetes and obesity, but also as effective for the management of NASH.

### Shared mechanistic pathways of glucagon signalling: unlocking its potential for treating obesity, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, and other cardio-kidney-metabolic conditions [^1171oZjN]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Glucagon is a pancreatic peptide hormone whose receptor (GCGR) is expressed in the liver, kidney, and, to a lesser extent, various other tissues. Glucagon is well known as the counterpart to insulin in glucose homeostasis. However, recent evidence has revealed other potential roles of glucagon, which include the regulation of amino acid metabolism via a liver-pancreatic alpha cell axis, stimulation of lipolysis and mitochondrial fat oxidation in the liver (and possibly in other tissues), reduction of caloric intake, and an increase in energy expenditure (at least in animal models). These advances in basic science-together with clinical trials that found GCGR antagonists increased body weight, hepatic fat, and serum lipids in people with type 2 diabetes-are driving the development of GCGR-based agonists for the treatment of obesity, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), and other cardio-kidney-metabolic diseases. Due to the hyperglycaemic effects of glucagon, these unimolecular compounds also incorporate moieties that activate the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor, which stimulates insulin secretion to lower blood glucose levels. In early clinical trials, several GCGR-based multi-agonists (mazdutide, survodutide [being developed by the sponsor of this review], retatrutide) demonstrated substantial efficacy for eliciting weight loss in people with obesity while improving liver health in those with MASLD. However, the physiological and molecular pathways modulated by chronic pharmacological activation of the GCGR in humans remain to be delineated, as do its potential risks. Thus, there is great interest in the ongoing phase 3 clinical trials of these compounds. As data for their safety and efficacy emerge, glucagon's role in energy regulation and lipid metabolism will become clearer, along with warranting a potential new therapeutic option for obesity and MASLD.

### Revisiting the role of glucagon in health, diabetes mellitus and other metabolic diseases [^113S3rpo]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Insulin and glucagon exert opposing effects on glucose metabolism and, consequently, pancreatic islet β-cells and α-cells are considered functional antagonists. The intra-islet hypothesis has previously dominated the understanding of glucagon secretion, stating that insulin acts to inhibit the release of glucagon. By contrast, glucagon is a potent stimulator of insulin secretion and has been used to test β-cell function. Over the past decade, α-cells have received increasing attention due to their ability to stimulate insulin secretion from neighbouring β-cells, and α-cell-β-cell crosstalk has proven central for glucose homeostasis in vivo. Glucagon is not only the counter-regulatory hormone to insulin in glucose metabolism but also glucagon secretion is more susceptible to changes in the plasma concentration of certain amino acids than to changes in plasma concentrations of glucose. Thus, the actions of glucagon also include a central role in amino acid turnover and hepatic fat oxidation. This Review provides insights into glucagon secretion, with a focus on the local paracrine actions on glucagon and the importance of α-cell-β-cell crosstalk. We focus on dysregulated glucagon secretion in obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Lastly, the future potential of targeting hyperglucagonaemia and applying dual and triple receptor agonists with glucagon receptor-activating properties in combination with incretin hormone receptor agonism is discussed.

### Glucagon orchestrates stress-induced hyperglycaemia [^116ksCEK]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Hyperglycaemia is commonly observed on admission and during hospitalization for medical illness, traumatic injury, burn and surgical intervention. This transient hyperglycaemia is referred to as stress-induced hyperglycaemia (SIH) and frequently occurs in individuals without a history of diabetes. SIH has many of the same underlying hormonal disturbances as diabetes mellitus, specifically absolute or relative insulin deficiency and glucagon excess. SIH has the added features of elevated blood levels of catecholamines and cortisol, which are not typically present in people with diabetes who are not acutely ill. The seriousness of SIH is highlighted by its greater morbidity and mortality rates compared with those of hospitalized patients with normal glucose levels, and this increased risk is particularly high in those without pre-existing diabetes. Insulin is the treatment standard for SIH, but new therapies that reduce glucose variability and hypoglycaemia are desired. In the present review, we focus on the key role of glucagon in SIH and discuss the potential use of glucagon receptor blockers and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in SIH to achieve target glucose control.

### Glucagon orchestrates stress-induced hyperglycaemia [^112Z1zPz]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Under normal physiological conditions, glucagon produced in the α cells of the pancreas acts primarily on the liver to increase hepatic glucose output to maintain an adequate supply of fuel to the brain and other vital organs 1, 2. In uncontrolled type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), hyperglucagonaemia is universally present, suggesting aberrant glucagon secretion 3, 4, 5. Several lines of evidence indicate that the hyperglucagonaemia of diabetes is the direct result of loss of insulin‐induced suppression of pancreatic α‐cell glucagon secretion 6, 7, 8. Glucagon‐induced hepatic glucose output has been implicated as a major cause of uncontrolled diabetes. In subjects with T1D, suppression of glucagon secretion by somatostatin without changing insulin levels ameliorates hyperglycaemia 9, 10. In patients with T2D, glucagon receptor blockers decrease fasting and postprandial glucose 11, 12, 13. Preclinical studies in glucagon receptor knockout mice have demonstrated protection from diabetes after complete β‐cell destruction, providing support for the hypothesis that excess glucagon secretion is directly responsible for many of the metabolic perturbations of diabetes 14, 15, 16.

Relative insulin deficiency, insulin resistance and concomitant increases in the counter‐regulatory hormones (i.e.g.lucagon, epinephrine and cortisol) are present in medically ill patients with hyperglycaemia and, under experimental conditions, administration of this hormonal cocktail to normal healthy subjects produces metabolic changes resembling stress‐induced hyperglycaemia (SIH) 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. Although the individual effects of insulin, glucagon, cortisol and epinephrine on normal glucose metabolism are well described, the contribution of each to metabolic changes in the setting of medical illness is more difficult to define. In this review, we will focus on what is known about hyperglucagonaemia in the context of the complex hormonal milieu of SIH. We will also discuss the potential for glucagon receptor blockers and glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonists to treat SIH, with the goal of causing less glucose variability and hypoglycaemia than with insulin, the standard of care.

### Role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in achieving weight loss and improving cardiovascular outcomes in people with overweight and obesity [^115PHSfP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The evidence discussed in this article demonstrates that GLP‐1 RAs should be strongly considered as an option for use in clinical practice for the treatment of obesity and reduction of CVD risk in people with T2D (Figure). Because cardiologists frequently see patients with overweight or obesity and T2D, they have a crucial role in initiating and managing weight loss in these patients to reduce their risk of CVD. If ongoing and future research prove GLP‐1 RAs to be effective in reducing the risk of CVD in patients with obesity, irrespective of T2D status, it will herald a new treatment paradigm in this setting, and now is the time for cardiologists to better recognize the benefits of these agents.

### Inhibiting or antagonizing glucagon: making progress in diabetes care [^115yYQe6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Absolute or relative hyperglucagonaemia has been recognized for years in all experimental or clinical forms of diabetes. It has been suggested that excess secretion of glucagon by the islet α cells is a direct consequence of intra-islet insulin secretory defects. Recent studies have shown that knockout of the glucagon receptor or administration of a monoclonal specific glucagon receptor antibody make insulin-deficient type 1 diabetic rodents thrive without insulin. These observations suggest that glucagon plays an essential role in the pathophysiology of diabetes and that targeting the α cell and glucagon are innovative approaches in the management of diabetes. Despite active research and identification of promising compounds, no one selective glucagon antagonist is presently used in the treatment of diabetes. Interestingly, besides insulin, several drugs used today in the management of diabetes appear to exert their effects, in part, by inhibiting glucagon secretion (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, α-glucosidase inhibitors and, possibly, sulphonylureas) or glucagon action (metformin). The potential risks associated with total glucagon suppression include α-cell hyperplasia, increased mass of the pancreas, increased susceptibility to hepatosteatosis and hepatocellular injury and increased risk of hypoglycaemia, and these should be considered in the search and development of new compounds reducing glucagon receptor signalling. More than 40years after its initial description, hyperglucagonaemia in diabetes can no longer be ignored or minimized, and its correction represents an attractive way to improve diabetes management.

### Targeting the incretin / glucagon system with triagonists to treat diabetes [^1121NQ1M]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Bariatric surgery has proven to be both efficacious and sustainable for the treatment of T2D. Originally developed specifically for morbidly obese individuals, independent of metabolic dysfunction, it quickly became clear that bariatric surgery can induce rapid improvements in hyperglycemia. Available pharmaceutical interventions are not able to replicate the magnitude of the benefits associated with surgery. On the other hand, it is not economically feasible to perform bariatric surgery as a primary treatment option for the number of people with T2D, creating a significant need for the development of pharmaceutical agents that achieve similar efficacy as surgical options, working noninvasively to target several tissues in a complimentary, synergistic manner.

Incretin hormones, glucagonlike peptide-1 (GLP-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) have recently garnered attention for their broad effects on target tissues of diabetes. Most notably, these factors are crucial for postprandial rises in insulin secretion. In fact, 50% to 70% of insulin secretion following a meal is a result of incretin action. Yet in T2D, the incretin effect is significantly blunted, suggesting that lesions in this axis may be key in the development of the disease and that restoration of incretin signaling could be particularly effective as a treatment strategy. In addition to incretin peptides, glucagon has reemerged as a significant contributor to glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism. Physiologically, glucagon opposes insulin action and increases glycemia, sparking numerous efforts to inhibit its action and lower glucose. However, the impact of glucagon on energy metabolism is becoming more evident, with increasing efforts now being put forth to agonize the glucagon receptor in an effort to treat metabolic dysfunction. What is clear is that both incretin peptides and glucagon are substantially increased following bariatric surgery, igniting interests in these peptides as the mechanism for the improvements in metabolic dysfunction. This has also made clear that our understanding of how these gut-derived peptides influence systemic metabolism is not completely understood. This review will discuss the controversies currently presiding over these peptides, and attempt to reconcile their contribution to both the pathogenesis of T2D and their potential to contribute to the next generation of therapeutic agents for the treatment of the disease.

### Taking aim at islet hormones with GLP-1: is insulin or glucagon the better target? [^11328JrT]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Suppression of glucagon secretion by GLP-1 was described soon after the peptide was discovered and was demonstrable in cultured cells, animals, and humans. There remains some question as to whether the effects of GLP-1 to reduce plasma glucagon in vivo is a direct effect mediated through GLP-1r on α-cells, or whether this effect is indirect via neural or paracrine mechanisms. However, there is no doubt that some of the most influential observations advancing GLP-1 as a model therapeutic were the demonstrations that intravenous administration to fasting subjects with diabetes lowered blood glucose coincident with reductions in plasma glucagon. This effect was particularly compelling in a study of type 1 diabetic patients in whom the absence of endogenous insulin secretion supported reduction of glucagon as the primary mechanism by which GLP-1 reduced blood glucose. Importantly, these effects have been borne out clinically, since both GLP-1r agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors reduce plasma glucagon as part of their pharmacologic activity.

### Glucagon-like peptide agonists: a prospective review [^113vE9fY]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The increasing number of clinical trials and the subsequent approval of multiple GLP1RAs on the market reflect these agents' growing importance and recognition in diabetes care. Semaglutide, as a frontrunner in this class, has paved the way for improved glycemic control and overall patient outcomes since 2017. In summary, the advent of GLP1RAs has expanded the therapeutic landscape. These medications offer patients various treatment choices, each with its unique benefits and mechanisms of action. As research continues to unravel the potential of GLP1RAs, patients and healthcare providers have access to a range of practical and well‐tolerated options, leading to better management and improved quality of life for individuals with these conditions.

### Taking aim at islet hormones with GLP-1: is insulin or glucagon the better target? [^112h5in4]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

The last decade has seen a shift in the therapeutics of type 2 diabetes from insulin-centric to more multifarious approaches. Whereas previously drug treatment was based almost entirely on increasing insulin action — either by giving drugs to raise plasma insulin levels or to increase tissue responsiveness to insulin — it is now clear that addressing other processes controlling glucose metabolism is also fruitful. To wit, drugs that delay gastric emptying or carbohydrate digestion or promote renal glucose elimination have been shown to be effective for treating hyperglycemia. Compounds that affect hepatic glucose production directly or act through the central nervous system to lower blood glucose are in various phases of development. Moreover, glucagon, long known to contribute to abnormal glucose regulation in diabetes, is now amenable to therapeutic manipulation using drugs based on the naturally occurring hormones islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP, also known as amylin) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1).

GLP-1 is an essential component of the system regulating blood glucose and has been the basis for two new classes of drugs to treat diabetes, GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1r) agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. GLP-1r activation has a broad reach that affects islet hormone secretion, gastrointestinal motility, food intake, and glucose production, all in a manner that lowers blood glucose. While enhanced β-cell function is generally accepted to be central in the glycemic response to GLP-1, it is noteworthy that plasma levels of insulin and C-peptide in patients treated with GLP-1r agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors are not dramatically increased. This is due in part to the overall effect of GLP-1 signaling to lower blood glucose, reducing the glycemic stimulus to the β-cells. With sophisticated modeling of plasma C-peptide levels, the insulinotropic effects of GLP-1–based drugs are clear, but the subtlety of the effect has raised questions about other mechanisms for glucose lowering. Thus, there has been a clear reason to focus on other responses to GLP-1r signaling.

### Targeting the incretin / glucagon system with triagonists to treat diabetes [^114ynRqR]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

The incorporation of glucagon into multiagonists aimed at treating T2D patients was initially controversial because of the hyperglycemic liability, but opinion has largely changed and is supported by its effects on energy expenditure and lipolysis. Glucagon stimulates hepatic glucose output, and as such glucagon receptor agonism had not been pursued. Even the current success of coagonists utilizing glucagon biology solely focuses on the GLP-1-independent central benefits of glucagon on energy expenditure and thermogenesis. However, there are likely unappreciated roles that contribute to glucagon's efficacy. Most notable, glucagon is a potent insulin secretagogue. One hypothesis for the primary physiologic role of glucagon is that it functions to maintain normal levels of amino acids, and its glycemic effects are a byproduct of amino acid metabolism. During hypoglycemia, amino acids are synthesized from muscle and fat, stimulating glucagon and promoting hepatic glucose production. Conversely, when glycemia is elevated, such as in overnutrition or in response to a protein-rich meal, elevated amino acids stimulate glucagon and in turn glucagon elevates insulin secretion in a paracrine manner. The largely beneficial effects of glucagon incorporation into unimolecular peptide agonist strategies support the notion that glucagon may have beneficial effects beyond its stimulation of GCGR in the brain.

Taken together, the similar peptide sequences of GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon, coupled with their diverging activities in a broad range of target tissues, position triagonists as a unique drug class that could recapitulate the vast benefits of bariatric surgery for T2D. Although monoagonism of GLP-1R has yielded important benefits for weight management and glucose control clinically, the potential for triagonism could vastly improve clinical outcomes for T2D patients, beyond what is even purported for dual-receptor agonists. Triagonism offers the benefit of substantial weight loss from glucagon action, with reduced hyperglycemic risk from the addition of GIP action in addition to the reported actions of GLP-1. Yet in a broader context, the synergistic effects observed by multireceptor agonists have provided new lines of inquiry for understanding incretin/glucagon biology, which opens the possibility for further optimization and translation of therapies into the clinic in the future.

### Glucagon orchestrates stress-induced hyperglycaemia [^111pdygf]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Stress‐induced hyperglycaemia is a major medical problem requiring prompt treatment of the hyperglycaemia to decrease morbidity and mortality. The complex interplay between relative insulin deficiency in early stages of severe illness, combined with evidence that the elevated levels of glucagon, epinephrine and cortisol sustain hyperglycaemia, suggest that insulin moderates only some of the hormonal dysregulation observed in SIH. Thus, insulin alone may not be an optimum treatment strategy for SIH and may in fact contribute to increased morbidity and mortality by causing hypoglycaemia and increased glucose variability. GLP‐1 and GLP‐1 receptor agonists approved for the treatment of T2D have shown some promise in hospitalized patients with hyperglycaemia when infused continuously. Given that glucagon receptor blockers are in development for T2D, consideration of these agents for SIH deserves exploration in future clinical trials as they may address the hyperglycaemia, while resulting in less glucose variability and insignificant hypoglycaemia, and requiring less intensive glucose monitoring. It remains to be seen whether the transient increase in liver enzymes and other adverse effects will stall further development of this class of agents.

Conclusion

SST has a key physiological role in the inhibition of insulin and glucagon secretion from the pancreatic β-cells and δ-cells respectively, hence the use of its analogues in the treatment of different forms of HH. The precise molecular mechanisms involved in the inhibition of insulin and glucagon secretion are not known. Due to SST's short half-life SST analogues have been developed which are used to treat various conditions, including different forms of HH in children and adults. Both octreotide and the long-acting formulations are effective in the management of patients with HH. In the neonatal period, octreotide must be used with caution as there is a risk of developing NEC.

### Changing the care pathway for type 2 diabetes at the time of diagnosis: the role of the multidisciplinary team [^116Zdwhc]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conventionally, specialists become involved in the later stages of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, whereas evidence supports the role of time‐limited specialist input at the start of the treatment journey 1. The diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes should be seen as a key opportunity for multidisciplinary teams to intensify therapy aimed at quickly correcting underlying metabolic dysfunction.

Insulin resistance can precede diabetes for a decade 2, during which time β‐cell dysfunction and a higher cardiovascular risk have accrued 2. Over half of people with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes have evidence of diabetes‐related tissue damage 3; therefore, by the time of diagnosis, many years of metabolic dysfunction may have elapsed. Further treatment delay, in the belief that the condition is 'new' or 'mild', cannot be justified.

Current guidelines persist with the concept of a stepwise process to achieve glycaemic control: initial lifestyle intervention, followed by oral agents as monotherapy and then in combination, and finally insulin or glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist therapy 4. This paradigm is responsive to poor metabolic control after it has developed and mitigates against proactive intensification early in the disease trajectory. The National Institute for Clinical and Health Excellence (NICE) advocates continuation of pharmacological treatment until HbA 1c levels are ≥ 59 mmol/mol (7.5%) 4, which has been dubbed a 'treatment to failure' approach 5.

### Glucagon delivery-an overview of current and future devices [^115VXUQ4]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Glucagon is crucial in the treatment of Type 1 diabetes mellitus due to the prevalence of hypoglycemia in patients with this disorder. Hypoglycemia can be life-threatening, leading to loss of consciousness, and requiring emergency glucagon to reverse the effects. Emergency kits are difficult to use, requiring reconstitution of glucagon, which itself is not stable for lengthy periods. Approaches have aimed to improve stability which has allowed for use in pens or pumps. Glucagon can now also be delivered intranasally. This review discusses the history of glucagon, its current delivery methods as well as some modern approaches being introduced.

3 CURRENT TREATMENTS FOR SEVERE HYPOGLYCAEMIA

In people with insulin‐treated diabetes, plasma insulin concentrations cannot be regulated because of passive absorption of the injected insulin; as glucose levels fall, plasma insulin concentrations do not decline. 45 Additionally, as blood glucose falls, glucagon secretion does not increase. 46 Glucagon raises blood glucose concentration in the fasting state by increasing the hepatic production of glucose, initially via glycogenolysis and subsequently via gluconeogenesis. In the fed state in a person without diabetes, secretion of glucagon from α‐cells is inhibited by insulin, which signals to the liver to stop producing endogenous glucose. 47 In people with T1D or advanced T2D, hypoglycaemia arises from a combination of relative or absolute insulin excess and impaired physiological defences against a fall in plasma glucose. 48

Treatment of hypoglycaemia depends upon the severity and duration of the hypoglycaemia event, and is represented by a spectrum of increasing therapeutic complexity. 49 At one end of the spectrum is self‐administration of oral carbohydrate, and at the other extreme is the administration of intravenous dextrose or glucagon, often in a hospital setting (Table 2). Current ADA standards of care for glycaemic control provide guidance regarding the prevention and treatment of hypoglycaemia. The ADA has recommended that people at risk of hypoglycaemia should be asked by their HCP about the occurrence of symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia at each consultation. 6 Oral glucose (15–20 g) is the preferred treatment for the fully conscious individual with impending hypoglycaemia, measured as a blood glucose concentration of ≤ 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). 6 The ADA recommends that HCPs advise people to treat hypoglycaemia with fast‐acting carbohydrates. 6 Furthermore, the acute glycaemic response is better associated with the glucose content of food rather than the carbohydrate content; thus pure glucose is the preferred treatment but any carbohydrate that contains glucose can increase blood glucose. 6 Treatment of hypoglycaemia by consuming 15–20 g of fast‐acting carbohydrates will usually raise blood glucose levels within 15 minutes. 50, 51, 52, 53 Fifteen minutes after treatment, if self‐monitored blood glucose shows persisting hypoglycaemia, the treatment should be repeated until capillary blood glucose returns to normal, and should be followed by a meal or snack containing complex carbohydrate (slow‐acting) to prevent hypoglycaemia recurring. 6 When an individual is unconscious or unable to swallow, glucagon should be administered. 6

### Neonatal hypoglycaemia [^1114nSzA]. BMJ Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Glucagon

For infants whose glucose concentrations are difficult to stabilise with intravenous dextrose, or who have repeated episodes of hypoglycaemia, other treatments should be considered. Glucagon is a peptide hormone that counteracts the effects of insulin by stimulating production of hepatic glucose. Thus glucagon is a potentially useful intervention for infants when insulin secretion is inadequately suppressed because it targets the underlying pathophysiology of the hypoglycaemia. A recent systematic review of the use of glucagon for treatment of hypoglycaemia included seven studies (none randomised trials) with a total of 348 infants. The review reported that glucagon probably increased blood glucose concentrations by about 2.3 mmol/L after 1–2 hours, and that ≥ 80% of infants treated achieved euglycaemia within four hours, but recurrent hypoglycaemia was common (55%). The certainty of evidence was very low and few data on adverse effects or long term outcomes were available. The effects did not seem to change with the dose used or the route of administration (intramuscular or intravenous bolus or infusion). Although glucagon has be given subcutaneously or intranasally in adults for emergency management of hypoglycaemia, these forms of administration have not been reported in neonates.

So far, the evidence of the role of glucagon in the management of neonatal hypoglycaemia is inadequate. Glucagon is potentially useful as a short term option, however, in circumstances where alternatives are not immediately available (eg, while arranging transfer to the neonatal intensive care unit, or when intravenous access is difficult to establish). Glucagon might also be useful to reduce the need for admission to the neonatal intensive care unitor as an adjunct treatment to reduce the intensity of secondary interventions (eg, length of intravenous infusion).

Glucocorticoids

Cortisol is a naturally occurring corticosteroid that has numerous actions on glucose metabolism, mainly by suppressing the peripheral actions of insulin and stimulating gluconeogenesis. Although secretion of cortisol is normally stimulated by physiological stress, including hypoglycaemia, neonates with hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia might not generate an adequate cortisol counter-regulatory response. Replacement doses of cortisol are sometimes recommended if this effect is suspected.

### Emergency treatment of hypoglycaemia: a guideline and evidence review [^113JJnBt]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

To examine the current treatment guidelines for the emergency management of hypoglycaemia and the evidence underpinning recommendations.

Methods

International diabetes agencies were searched for hypoglycaemia treatment guidelines. Guidelines were assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument. An electronic database search was conducted for evidence regarding emergency treatment of hypoglycaemia in adults, and relevant articles were critically appraised.

Results

Of the international diabetes agencies, six sets of guidelines were deemed relevant and of sufficient detail for appraisal by AGREE II. The evidence search returned 2649 articles, of which 17 pertaining to the emergency management of hypoglycaemia were included. High-quality evidence for the management of hypoglycaemia was lacking, limiting treatment recommendations. In general, guidelines and studies were somewhat concordant and recommended 15–20 g of oral glucose or sucrose, repeated after 10–15 min for treatment of the responsive adult, and 10% intravenous dextrose or 1 mg intramuscular glucagon for treatment of the unresponsive adult. No evidence was found for other treatment approaches.

Conclusion

Evidence for the emergency treatment of hypoglycaemia in adults is limited, is often low grade and mostly pre-dates contemporary management of diabetes. Guideline recommendations are limited by the lack of randomized trials. Further high-quality studies are required to inform the optimum management of this frequently occurring emergency condition.

### Intra-islet α-cell Gs signaling promotes glucagon release [^115nsMyT]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Pancreatic α-cells, which are contained within the islets of Langerhans, store and release glucagon, a 29 amino acid peptide hormone that plays a key role in regulating glucose homeostasis and various other metabolic functions –. Numerous studies have shown that glucagon release is dysregulated in diabetes and that this deficit contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetes –. In type 1 diabetes (T1D), impaired glucagon release in response to low blood glucose levels (e.g. after an insulin injection) can lead to severe hypoglycemia and even death. In type 2 diabetes (T2D), plasma glucagon levels are inappropriately high, thus contributing to the hyperglycemia phenotype that is the major hallmark of T2D –.

Two major actions of glucagon are to stimulate hepatic glucose production to maintain blood glucose levels under fasting conditions and to counteract the effects of insulin on the liver and other organs or cell types. In addition, more recent studies suggest that glucagon released from pancreatic α-cells can act in a paracrine fashion on adjacent β-cells to promote the release of insulin when glucose levels are high (e.g. after a meal) –. This glucagon effect is mediated to a major extent by activation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors (GLP-1Rs) that are expressed at relatively high levels by pancreatic β-cells –.

Taken together, these findings suggest that glucagon can have multiple effects on blood glucose homeostasis and that the nature of these effects depends on specific nutritional and other physiological conditions. These observations raise the possibility that drugs capable of modulating glucagon release from pancreatic α-cells or glucagon receptor (GCGR) agonists or antagonists may prove useful for the treatment of various metabolic disorders. In fact, several GCGR/GLP-1R dual agonists are currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of diabetes, obesity, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Preclinical studies suggest that GCGR/GLP-1R/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor triple agonists may also prove useful for the therapy of diabetes and obesity.

While glucose is a key determinant of glucagon secretion –, considerable gaps exist in our knowledge of the extracellular signals and α-cell signaling pathways that regulate glucagon release. However, a detailed understanding of these mechanisms may lead to the identification of new strategies aimed at modulating glucagon secretion for therapeutic purposes.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114MHkee]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Additional recommendations for all individuals with diabetes — monitoring insulin therapy, prescribing glucagon, and addressing cost barriers — are as follows: 9.27 Monitor for signs of overbasalization during insulin therapy, such as significant bedtime-to-morning or postprandial-to-preprandial glucose differential, occurrences of hypoglycemia (aware or unaware), and high glycemic variability. When overbasalization is suspected, a thorough re-evaluation should occur promptly to further tailor therapy to the individual's needs. E. 9.28 Glucagon should be prescribed for all individuals requiring insulin therapy or at high risk for hypoglycemia. Family, caregivers, school personnel, and others providing support to these individuals should know its location and be educated on how to administer it. Glucagon preparations that do not require reconstitution are preferred. B. 9.29 Routinely assess all people with diabetes for financial obstacles that could impede their diabetes management. Clinicians, members of the diabetes care team, and social services professionals should work collaboratively, as appropriate and feasible, to address these barriers and reduce costs, thereby improving access to evidence-based care. E. 9.30 In adults with diabetes and cost-related barriers, consider use of lower-cost medications for glycemic management (i.e., metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and human insulin) within the context of their risks for hypoglycemia, weight gain, cardiovascular and kidney events, and other adverse effects.

### The potential role of glucagon-like peptide-1 or its analogues in enhancing glycaemic control in critically ill adult patients [^114H4hyd]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Intravenous insulin therapy is the gold standard therapy for glycaemic control in hyperglycaemic critically ill adult patients. However, hypoglycaemia remains a major concern in critically ill patients, even in some populations who are not receiving infused insulin. Furthermore, the influence of factors such as glycaemic variability and nutritional support may conceal any benefit of strict glycaemic control on morbidity and mortality in these patients. The recently revised guidelines of the American Diabetic Association/American College of Clinical Endocrinologists no longer advocate very tight glycaemic control or normalization of glucose levels in all critically ill patients. In the light of various concerns over the optimal glucose level and means to achieve such control, the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 or its analogues administered intravenously may represent an interesting therapeutic option.

### Dual-hormone treatment with insulin and glucagon in patients with type 1 diabetes [^116t4jx6]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Intensive insulin treatment in type 1 diabetes reduces the incidence and slows the progression of microvascular and macrovascular complications; however, it is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain. In this review, we propose dual-hormone treatment with insulin and glucagon as a method for achieving near normalization of blood glucose levels without increasing hypoglycaemia frequency and weight gain. We briefly summarize glucagon pathophysiology in type 1 diabetes as well as the current applications of glucagon for the treatment of hypoglycaemia. Until now, the use of glucagon has been limited by the need for reconstitution immediately before use, because of instability of the available compounds; however, stabile compounds are soon to be launched and will render long-term intensive dual-hormone treatment in type 1 diabetes possible.

### Targeting the incretin / glucagon system with triagonists to treat diabetes [^112KrwBk]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Incretin/Glucagon Biology

The purpose of this chapter is to provide a cursory review of relevant pathways modulated by GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptor activation to support their potential for use in multireceptor agonism. The review is limited to these three peptides due to their complimentary activities and similar structures at the N-terminal region that have allowed for the development of sequence-intermixed peptide therapies. GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon exert their effects through similar mechanisms of action, all acting on class B G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) of the G s family and typically mediating signal transduction through the stimulation of cAMP. However, the tissue-specific distribution of the incretin/glucagon cognate receptors is unique, and likely plays a role in the variation in their respective functions (Fig. 1). For example, whereas GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon all have insulinotropic effects on the pancreatic β cell, only glucagon can stimulate hepatic glucose production, whereas the GLP-1R and GIP receptor (GIPR) are not expressed in hepatocytes. Furthermore, even within a tissue type that expresses all three receptors (e.g. β cells), there appear to be unique characteristics for each receptor. Together, this raises the intriguing possibility for synergistic interactions, both at the cellular, tissue, and systemic levels. Herein, we describe the relevant activities of each peptide, highlighting areas of activity that are more appropriately addressed through combinatorial treatment strategies.

Figure 1.
Glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP have unique activities at different tissue beds. Blue arrows show the effects of glucagon, green arrows show GLP-1 effects, and red arrows show GIP effects. Although there are overlapping activities of these peptides in the brain and pancreas, the majority of tissues have nonoverlapping receptor expression, yielding unique activities of each peptide at different tissues. Therefore, multireceptor agonists demonstrate additive effects, in part, by engaging a broader range of activities.

### Glycemic goals and hypoglycemia: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114cw85c]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Glucagon — indication, prescribing, training, and safe use are specified as follows: The use of glucagon is indicated for the treatment of hypoglycemia in people unable or unwilling to consume carbohydrates by mouth, and all individuals treated with insulin or who are at high risk of hypoglycemia should be prescribed glucagon. An individual does not need to be a health care professional to safely administer glucagon, and those in close contact or with custodial care should be instructed on where the product is kept and when and how to administer it. It is essential that they be explicitly educated to never administer insulin to individuals experiencing hypoglycemia. Newer packaged preparations are preferred due to ease of administration and more rapid correction versus reconstituted powder, products should be replaced at expiration and stored per instructions, and clinicians should check insurance coverage since formularies may prefer select products; see Table 6.6 for currently available glucagon products and associated costs.

### The acute effect of glucagon on components of energy balance and glucose homoeostasis in adults without diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1136sCuv]. International Journal of Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

In contrast to its effect on energy intake, the mean intervention effect of acute glucagon administration on energy expenditure was a moderate-to-large increase, which was consistent across all included studies, and congruent with prior research in rodents. Mechanisms responsible for this increase in energy expenditure may include futile substrate cycling, characterised by a repeated conversion between glucose and glucose-6-phosphate, but are unlikely related to changes in brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. The absence of any corresponding increase in energy intake of a similar magnitude therefore suggests that acute glucagon administration would have a favourable effect on energy balance in the short-term.

Challenging the acute data on glucagon administration, recent evidence has suggested that chronic administration (72 hours) of glucagon may not raise energy expenditure. This could explain why the smallest effect in our meta-analysis was observed in the study with the longest infusion duration (10 hours), but also questions the efficacy of chronic glucagon administration and/or GCGR receptor agonism for weight loss via increased energy expenditure. Moreover, most studies (3/5 in this review) measuring energy expenditure following acute glucagon administration report pre-post measurements, preventing any investigation of temporal trends (and thus determining the time point at which energy expenditure is no longer raised). However, it remains to be fully elucidated whether the relative conservation of energy expenditure following weight loss would aid weight loss maintenance with a drug that had a glucagonergic element.

### Glucagon and heart in type 2 diabetes: new perspectives [^113CEaXh]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Increased levels of glucagon in type 2 diabetes are well known and, until now, have been considered deleterious. However, glucagon has an important role in the maintenance of both heart and kidney function. Moreover, in the past, glucagon has been therapeutically used for heart failure treatment. The new antidiabetic drugs, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors, are able to decrease and to increase glucagon levels, respectively, while contrasting data have been reported regarding the glucagon like peptide 1 receptors agonists. The cardiovascular outcome trials, requested by the FDA, raised some concerns about the possibility that the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors can precipitate the heart failure, while, at least for empagliflozin, a positive effect has been shown in decreasing both cardiovascular death and heart failure. The recent LEADER Trial, showed a significant reduction of cardiovascular death with liraglutide, but a neutral effect on heart failure. A possible explanation of the results with the DPPIV inhibitors and empagliflozin might be related to their divergent effect on glucagon levels. Due to unclear effects of glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonists on glucagon, the possible role of this hormone in the Leader trial remains unclear.

### Minimizing morbidity of hypoglycemia in diabetes: a review of mini-dose glucagon [^111UjEak]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2015). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is a common chronic disease of childhood and one of the most difficult conditions to manage. Advances in insulin formulations and insulin delivery devices have markedly improved the ability to achieve normal glucose homeostasis. However, hypoglycemia remains the primary limiting factor in achieving normoglycemia and is a frequent complication in children with acute gastroenteritis and/or poor oral intake. In situations of impaired carbohydrate intake or absorption, glucagon therapy is the only out-of-hospital treatment option available to families and caregivers. Glucagon is recommended for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia and rapidly increases blood glucose by increasing hepatic glucose production from glycogenolysis. Mini-dose glucagon is a widely utilized off-label treatment for managing mild or impending hypoglycemia and is administered as a small subcutaneous injection. It was initially described for use in children who were unable to tolerate or absorb oral carbohydrates but not in need of advanced medical care. Yet, mini-dose glucagon may be useful in any individual with relative insulin excess. The regimen aims to prevent severe hypoglycemic episodes and is safe, effective, and easily administered by patients and caregivers in the out-of-hospital setting. By empowering patients and their families, this important tool could help to alleviate the physical, psychosocial, and financial burden evolving from impending hypoglycemia.

Hypoglycemia

Glucose (15–20 g) is the preferred treatment for the conscious individual with hypoglycemia, although any form of carbohydrate that contains glucose may be used. If SMBG 15 min after treatment shows continued hypoglycemia, the treatment should be repeated. Once SMBG glucose returns to normal, the individual should consume a meal or snack to prevent recurrence of hypoglycemia. (E)
Glucagon should be prescribed for all individuals at significant risk of severe hypoglycemia, and caregivers or family members of these individuals should be instructed in its administration. Glucagon administration is not limited to health care professionals. (E)
Individuals with hypoglycemia unawareness or one or more episodes of severe hypoglycemia should be advised to raise their glycemic targets to strictly avoid further hypoglycemia for at least several weeks to partially reverse hypoglycemia unawareness and reduce risk of future episodes. (B)

2 SEVERE HYPOGLYCAEMIA

2.1 Pathophysiology

In β‐cell failure, as occurs in T1D and in advanced T2D, normal physiology is disrupted, whereby a decrease in plasma glucose does not suppress β‐cell insulin secretion, and the signal to increase pancreatic α‐cell glucagon secretion during hypoglycaemia is absent. 10, 11 Additionally, the sympathoadrenal response is reduced with diminished release of catecholamines, which would normally be secreted to raise blood glucose and thus compensate for a deficiency of glucagon; this results in compromised glucose counter‐regulation and is also associated with impairment of hypoglycaemia awareness. 10, 11 Although excess insulin per se is sufficient to cause hypoglycaemia, the influence of both relative or absolute therapeutic hyperinsulinaemia, and compromised physiological and behavioural defences against falling plasma glucose concentrations, ultimately contribute to iatrogenic hypoglycaemia. 12

Hypoglycaemia can induce a myriad of pathophysiological adverse effects including oxidative stress, 13 result in life‐threatening events such as cardiac arrhythmias, 14 contribute to sudden cardiovascular death, 14 and cause ischaemic cerebral damage. 15, 16 These responses may potentially exert adverse effects via various mechanisms whereby acute and chronic hypoglycaemia events could increase cardiovascular risk. 17 Evidence suggests an association between severe hypoglycaemia and mortality among patients with diabetes. 18, 19 In the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease (ADVANCE) trial, death from cardiovascular and non‐cardiovascular causes was associated with severe hypoglycaemia. 19 That trial included 11 140 patients with T2D, and 19.5% of those who reported severe hypoglycaemia died versus 9.0% of those who did not. 19 Of those who died, 49% died from cardiovascular causes in those who reported severe hypoglycaemia compared with 53% in those who reported no hypoglycaemia. 19 Possible reasons for the impact of hypoglycaemia upon cardiovascular death were assumed to be sympathoadrenal activation, increased thrombogenesis or inflammation. 19 Additionally, while 16.8% and 11.5% of patients who had reported severe hypoglycaemia experienced major subsequent macro‐ and microvascular events, respectively, only 10.2% and 10.1% of patients who had no reported severe hypoglycaemia experienced events. 19 However, the authors cautioned that hypoglycaemia should not be causally linked to the outcomes reported in the ADVANCE trial, rather that hypoglycaemia might instead indicate a vulnerability to adverse events. 19 Similar results were reported in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes trial, whereby a history of severe hypoglycaemia was associated with higher mortality, and the authors cautioned that hypoglycaemia might be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease or an indicator of patient vulnerability. 18

### Treatment and prevention of severe hypoglycaemia in people with diabetes: current and new formulations of glucagon [^1149BCzH]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

7 CONCLUSIONS

Hypoglycaemia is a major limiting factor in the glycaemic management of T1D and T2D. Risk factors for severe hypoglycaemia are well known and risk assessment tools are available for use in clinical practice. However, severe hypoglycaemia remains a substantial clinical problem. It is important that those who are at risk of severe hypoglycaemia have access to rescue treatments for emergency use.

Currently available treatments for severe hypoglycaemia are limited to intravenous dextrose, injectable glucagon, nasal glucagon and liquid glucagon. Intravenous dextrose requires administration by HCPs or medically trained professionals, so injectable glucagon, nasal glucagon and liquid glucagon are the only treatment options for caregivers outside hospital or emergency medical settings. However, injectable glucagon is currently not available in a ready‐to‐use formulation and can be cumbersome for caregivers to administer in emergency situations. Nasal glucagon is a ready‐to‐use drug/device combination that is simple and easy for the caregivers of people with diabetes to use. Other treatments currently in development, such as dasiglucagon, may also potentially provide a portable, easy‐to‐use drug/device requiring no reconstitution, which caregivers can administer during emergency severe hypoglycaemia events. Simplifying the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia will greatly improve the emergency management of this potentially life‐threatening adverse effect of insulin therapy.

### Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in biology and pathology [^115WYq2H]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Post-translational proteolytic processing of the preproglucagon gene in the gut results in the formation of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). Owing to its glucose-dependent insulinotropic effect, this hormone was postulated to primarily act as an incretin, i.e. to augment insulin secretion after oral glucose or meal ingestion. In addition, GLP-1 decelerates gastric emptying and suppresses glucagon secretion. Under physiological conditions, GLP-1 acts as a part of the 'ileal brake', meaning that is slows the transition of nutrients into the distal gut. Animal studies suggest a role for GLP-1 in the development and growth of the endocrine pancreas. In light of its multiple actions throughout the body, different therapeutic applications of GLP-1 are possible. Promising results have been obtained with GLP-1 in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but its potential to reduce appetite and food intake may also allow its use for the treatment of obesity. While rapid in vivo degradation of GLP-1 has yet prevented its broad clinical use, different pharmacological approaches aiming to extend the in vivo half-life of GLP-1 or to inhibit its inactivation are currently being evaluated. Therefore, antidiabetic treatment based on GLP-1 may become available within the next years. This review will summarize the biological effects of GLP-1, characterize its role in human biology and pathology, and discuss potential clinical applications as well as current clinical studies.

### Potential role for the use of gliptins in cystic fibrosis-related diabetes [^111LU6V9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited disease among Caucasians and is often lethal. CF-related diabetes (CFRD) is now the most common comorbidity in those with CF as the life expectancy of people with CF continues to improve. This condition is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and the prevalence appears to increase with age, affecting about 2% of children, 20% of adolescents, and about 40% to 50% of adults, with a higher prevalence seen in women.

CFRD primarily affects those with pancreatic insufficiency who develop reduced β-cell secretory capacity compared to those without. Although the genetic and etiological factors that contribute to CF have largely been established, the treatment options for CFRD remain limited with subcutaneous insulin being the mainstay for treatment. This treatment option, however, can be burdensome, often requiring both intense dosing and monitoring, along with a high risk for hypoglycemia.

The earliest insulin defect seen in CF is loss of first-phase insulin response, followed by a progressively decreasing total insulin response to an oral glucose load. In addition, there appears to be an element of dysregulated glucagon secretion from α-cells. An inadequate glucagon response to arginine and to hypoglycemia has been reported along with low total glucagon levels. Further, impaired glucagon suppression following an oral glucose tolerance test has been shown and thought to contribute to the development of glucose intolerance.

The incretin axis is another hormonal system thought to contribute to the development of CFRD. Studies have shown that people with CFRD have lower levels of the incretin hormones glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide1 (GLP-1) than those without diabetes. These hormones normally enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion following food ingestion as well as glucagon suppression. In CFRD, lower levels of these hormone levels are thought to contribute to impairment of both insulin secretion and glucagon suppression.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1: modulator of β-cell dysfunction and death [^116QZ8EP]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is one of the hormones responsible for the incretin effect, a term that refers to the observation that orally administered glucose results in a larger increase in plasma insulin levels and insulin-dependent decrease in blood glucose concentration when compared to the same amount of glucose given intravenously. GLP-1 is secreted mainly by gut endocrine L-cells and is released under the control of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. Upon secretion, GLP-1 targets different cell types and exerts a wide variety of actions such as potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, reduction of appetite, delay of gastric emptying and increase in β-cell mass. These beneficial effects have resulted in the application of GLP-1-based therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes, but also exploitation of its effects in type 1 diabetes is being envisaged. In this review, we focus on the different, short- and long-term action mechanisms of GLP-1 with specific emphasis on its role as a modulator of β-cell function and survival.

### The acute effect of glucagon on components of energy balance and glucose homoeostasis in adults without diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1137om1G]. International Journal of Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Visual inspection of changes in glucose and insulin over time following acute glucagon administration (Supplementary Appendix J) suggest the effect of glucagon on glucose homoeostasis is transient, with values returning to baseline within 200 min of administration. Importantly, insulin and glucose levels return to baseline despite glucagon levels remaining elevated via infusion, implying that acute supraphysiological doses of glucagon do not result in chronically elevated blood glucose concentrations. If it is assumed that the release of stored liver glycogen followed by endogenous insulin release (futile substrate cycling) is the primary driver of increased energy expenditure following acute glucagon administration, then a glucagonergic agent may not have therapeutic benefit as a long-acting preparation. However, if the energy-expenditure rise outlives the acute glucose raising effects (for example, due to effects on amino acid metabolism), then the absence of chronic hyperglycaemia with glucagon treatment is reassuring. Further research is needed to confirm if the increase in energy expenditure following acute glucagon administration is lost when administered chronically, to establish how energy expenditure changes over time following acute administration, and to firmly establish the mechanism by which glucagon acutely and chronically elevates energy expenditure in humans. Given glucagon's effect on the catecholaminergic system, this research should also investigate possible negative effects of chronic glucagon administration such as changes in heart rate and blood pressure.

### The ascending GLP-1 road from clinical safety to reduction of cardiovascular complications [^115J3zLw]. Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) was originally identified as a gut-derived incretin hormone that lowered glycemia through potentiation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Subsequent studies expanded the actions of GLP-1 to include inhibition of glucagon secretion, gastric emptying, and appetite, collectively useful attributes for a glucose-lowering agent. The introduction of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists for the treatment of diabetes was associated with questions surrounding their safety, principally with regard to medullary thyroid cancer, pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer, yet cardiovascular outcome trials subsequently revealed reductions in rates of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death with a paucity of major safety signals. We discuss the controversies, unanswered questions, and established use of GLP-1R agonists from a mechanistic and clinical perspective. We highlight methods for detection and cellular sites of GLP-1R expression, key uncertainties, recent insights, and experimental caveats surrounding the use of GLP-1R agonists for the treatment of diabetes and the reduction of diabetes-related complications.

### Why does GLP-1 agonist combined with GIP and / or GCG agonist have greater weight loss effect than GLP-1 agonist alone in obese adults without type 2 diabetes? [^112AAPVj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a chronic condition demanding effective treatment strategies, among which pharmacotherapy plays a critical role. As glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for long-term weight management in adults with obesity, liraglutide and semaglutide have great weight loss effect through reducing food intake and delaying gastric emptying. The emergence of unimolecular polypharmacology, which utilizes single molecules to simultaneously target multiple receptors or pathways, marked a revolutionary improvement in GLP-1-based obesity pharmacotherapy. The dual agonist tirzepatide activates both GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors and has shown enhanced potency for weight loss compared to conventional GLP-1 mono agonist. Furthermore, emerging data suggests that unimolecular GLP-1/glucagon (GCG) dual agonist, as well as GLP-1/GIP/GCG triple agonist, may offer superior weight loss efficacy over GLP-1 agonist. This review summarizes the comprehensive mechanisms underlying the pronounced advantages of GLP-1/GIP dual agonist, GLP-1/GCG dual agonist and GLP-1/GIP/GCG triple agonist over GLP-1 mono agonist in weight reduction in obese adults without type 2 diabetes. A deeper understanding of these unimolecular multitargeting GLP-1-based agonists will provide insights for their clinical application and guide the development of new drugs for obesity treatment.

### Direct cardiovascular effects of glucagon like peptide-1 [^116FTWXW]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Current gold standard therapeutic strategies for T2DM target insulin resistance or β cell dysfunction as their core mechanisms of action. However, the use of traditional anti-diabetic drugs, in most cases, does not significantly reduce macrovascular morbidity and mortality. Among emerging anti-diabetic candidates, glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) based therapies carry special cardiovascular implications, exerting both direct as well as indirect effects. The direct cardiovascular effects of GLP-1 and its analogs remain the focus of this review.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists: differentiating the new medications [^114L9vWf]. Diabetes Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Differentiating the GLP-1 Agonists

Successful treatment of T2DM requires an understanding of the disease pathogenesis, as well as a willingness to individualize and appropriately intensify therapy. As such, clinicians should always consider treatment as soon as possible, at as low a dose as possible, and as safely, as long, and as rationally as possible. In contrast to many other antidiabetic agents that increase the risk of hypoglycemia and/or weight gain, weight loss occurs with GLP-1 agonists while the risk of hypoglycemia is low, unless combined with an insulin secretagogue, such as a sulfonylurea. Within the class of GLP-1 agonists, multiple pharmacologic differences exist that may influence which medication is ultimately prescribed for a given individual. To address these differences, the two commercially available GLP-1 agonists — exenatide and liraglutide — will be discussed according to the systems that are affected by their use.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Glucagon is effective in treating hypoglycemia only if sufficient liver glycogen is present. Because glucagon is of little or no help in states of starvation, adrenal insufficiency, or chronic hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia in these conditions should be treated with glucose.

Information for Patients

Refer patients and family members to the attached Information for the User for instructions describing the method of preparing and injecting glucagon. Advise the patient and family members to become familiar with the technique of preparing glucagon before an emergency arises. Instruct patients to use 1 mg for adults and 1/2 the adult dose (0.5 mg) for pediatric patients weighing less than 44 lb (20 kg).

Patients and family members should be informed of the following measures to prevent hypoglycemic reactions due to insulin:

Reasonable uniformity from day to day with regard to diet, insulin, and exercise.

Careful adjustment of the insulin program so that the type (or types) of insulin, dose, and time (or times) of administration are suited to the individual patient.

Frequent testing of the blood or urine for glucose so that a change in insulin requirements can be foreseen.

Routine carrying of sugar, candy, or other readily absorbable carbohydrate by the patient so that it may be taken at the first warning of an oncoming reaction.

### Regulation of hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism by INSP3R1 [^115s486k]. Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

With the rising epidemics of obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its downstream consequences including steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and type 2 diabetes in the U.S. and worldwide, new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed to treat these devastating conditions. Glucagon, known for a century to be a glucose-raising hormone and clearly demonstrated to contribute to fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, represents an unlikely target to improve health in those with metabolic syndrome. However, recent work from our group and others' identifies an unexpected role for glucagon as a potential means of treating NAFLD, improving insulin sensitivity, and improving the lipid profile. We propose a unifying, calcium-dependent mechanism for glucagon's effects both to stimulate hepatic gluconeogenesis and to enhance hepatic mitochondrial oxidation: signaling through the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (INSP3R1), glucagon activates phospholipase C (PKC)/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling to enhance adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL)-dependent intrahepatic lipolysis and, in turn, increase cytosolic gluconeogenesis by allosteric activation of pyruvate carboxylase. Simultaneously in the mitochondria, calcium transferred through mitochondria-associated membranes activates several dehydrogenases in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, correlated with an increase in mitochondrial energy expenditure and reduction in ectopic lipid. This model suggests that short-term, cyclic treatment with glucagon or other INSP3R1 antagonists could hold promise as a means to reset lipid homeostasis in patients with NAFLD.

### Systematic literature review and indirect treatment comparison of three ready-to-use glucagon treatments for severe hypoglycemia [^112zYN4c]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to the risk of rebound hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia and the time to treatment success, the time required to administer glucagon can play an important role in the overall success of glucagon treatment. Severe hypoglycemia is a life-threatening condition and needs to be treated as quickly and effectively as possible. In previous simulated use studies, the time to administer each ready-to-use glucagon treatment option was shorter when compared to reconstituted IG individually. Specifically, trained users successfully administered Baqsimi in a mean time of 47.3 s, while IG was successfully administered in 81.8 s. Similarly, Gvoke autoinjector was administered in 47.9 s compared to IG in 109 s. Finally, time to administer Zegalogue was 75 s versus 133 s for IG.

The efficacy and safety of the available glucagon options are essential factors for patients and healthcare providers to consider when making therapy decisions. To our knowledge, there are no studies directly comparing the preferences of patients for these ready-to-use glucagon options. A previous discrete choice experiment study conducted in Spain compared the attributes associated with Baqsimi to those associated with IG. The results indicated that patients prefer a glucagon treatment with higher success rates, wider storage temperatures and a nasal delivery method when the efficacy of both treatments is similar. However, the differences in availability and cost of these therapies between geographies and insurance programs must also be considered when making treatment decisions.

This study did have some limitations. First, the trials were not all designed or reported in a consistent manner. Therefore, not all variables, namely time variables, could be compared between all groups. Second, the total number of trials that met the inclusion criteria for this analysis was small. Also, the sample of adults with T2D was small and came from one Baqsimi trial. In fact, Baqsimi is the only glucagon option to include T2D in the identified trials. Third, baseline glucose values were not included in this analysis as not all included trials reported this parameter. However, the included trials did target at a baseline glucose value of < 55 mg/dl, and therefore it was reasonable to assume similar baseline glucose values between glucagon options. Finally, the analysis was not a direct comparison, and the results must be interpreted with caution.

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background

Glucagon is a hormone that works with other hormones and bodily functions to control glucose levels in the blood. It is made in the alpha cells of the pancreas, scattered in small clusters throughout the organ, known as the Islets of Langerhans. It is a single‐chain polypeptide composed of 29 amino acids (H‐His‐Ser‐Gln‐Gly‐Thr‐Phe‐Thr‐Ser‐Asp‐Tyr‐Ser‐Lys‐Tyr‐Leu‐Asp‐Ser‐Arg‐Arg‐Ala‐Gln‐Asp‐Phe‐Val‐Gln‐Trp‐Leu‐Met‐Asn‐Thr‐OH) and plays a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels. The primary role of glucagon is to prevent blood glucose levels from dropping too low by promoting the conversion of stored glycogen (from liver cells) into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream through glycogenolysis. When necessary, glucagon also promotes the synthesis of glucose from amino acids through gluconeogenesis. Thus, glucagon is an emergency product in diabetes to prevent hypoglycemia. In addition, glucagon has a role in signalling the body to break down stored fat (triglycerides) into fatty acids for use as energy in cells. This occurs when the body's glucose level is too low to meet its energy needs.

Glucagon exerts its effects by binding to its specific receptor, the glucagon receptor (GCGR), primarily expressed in the liver and kidneys. A specific receptor for glucagon was inferred from physiological studies carried out in the mid‐20th century. Still, the gene encoding the glucagon receptor was not identified until modern molecular biology techniques were invented. The gene for the glucagon receptor (GCGR) was cloned in the 1990s, which allowed for a better understanding of its structure and function. This receptor belongs to a more prominent family of proteins known as G‐protein‐coupled receptors (GPCRs)that activate an intracellular protein called a G protein. This G protein, in its activated form, triggers the production of a second messenger molecule called cyclic AMP (cAMP) from ATPthat activates a type of enzyme called Protein Kinase A (PKA). The PKA phosphorylates various target proteins, leading to several downstream effects. For instance, in the liver, PKA phosphorylates and activates an enzyme known as glycogen phosphorylase, which breaks down glycogen into glucose. PKA also inhibits an enzyme called glycogen synthase, preventing further synthesis of glycogen; both actions contribute to the release of glucose into the bloodstream.

### Glucagon-like peptide analogues for type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115rpgbr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Glucagon-like peptide analogues are a new class of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes that mimic the endogenous hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 is an incretin, a gastrointestinal hormone that is released into the circulation in response to ingested nutrients. GLP-1 regulates glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and biosynthesis, and by suppressing glucagon secretion, delayed gastric emptying and promoting satiety.

Objectives

To assess the effects of glucagon-like peptide analogues in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Search Strategy

Studies were obtained from electronic searches of The Cochrane Library (last search issue 1, 2011), MEDLINE (last search March 2011), EMBASE (last search March 2011), Web of Science (last search March 2011) and databases of ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials of a minimum duration of eight weeks comparing a GLP-1 analogue with placebo, insulin, an oral anti-diabetic agent, or another GLP-1 analogue in people with type 2 diabetes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction and quality assessment of studies were done by one reviewer and checked by a second. Data were analysed by type of GLP-1 agonist and comparison treatment. Where appropriate, data were summarised in a meta-analysis (mean differences and risk ratios summarised using a random-effects model).

Main Results

Seventeen randomised controlled trials including relevant analyses for 6899 participants were included in the analysis. Studies were mostly of short duration, usually 26 weeks. In comparison with placebo, all GLP-1 agonists reduced glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels by about 1%. Exenatide 2 mg once weekly and liraglutide 1.8 mg reduced it by 0.20% and 0.24% respectively more than insulin glargine. Exenatide 2 mg once weekly reduced HbA1c more than exenatide 10 μg twice daily, sitagliptin and pioglitazone. Liraglutide 1.8 mg reduced HbA1c by 0.33% more than exenatide 10 μg twice daily. Liraglutide led to similar improvements in HbA1c compared to sulphonylureas but reduced it more than sitagliptin and rosiglitazone. Both exenatide and liraglutide led to greater weight loss than most active comparators, including in participants not experiencing nausea. Hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently in participants taking concomitant sulphonylurea. GLP-1 agonists caused gastrointestinal adverse effects, mainly nausea. These adverse events were strongest at the beginning and then subsided. Beta-cell function was improved with GLP-1 agonists but the effect did not persist after cessation of treatment. None of the studies was long enough to assess long-term positive or negative effects.

Authors' Conclusions

GLP-1 agonists are effective in improving glycaemic control.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Atrioventricular block — acute care synopsis emphasizes initial cause correction and bridging therapy. The acute treatment of bradycardia attributable to atrioventricular block will often begin with timely identification and removal of potential causative factors as well as medical therapy, and atropine has a long track record of use for this indication because of ease of administration and relatively low risk of adverse reactions. It is more likely to be useful for atrioventricular block at the atrioventricular nodal level and for bradycardia attributable to excess vagal tone, and because of its short duration of action it is generally used as a bridge to longer-lasting therapy, such as infusion of a beta-adrenergic drug or temporary pacing. Aminophylline and glucagon have a possible role in treatment of atrioventricular block in the setting of acute MI and beta-blocker toxicity, respectively, but data are sparse.

### The role of the glucagon-FGF21 axis in improving beta cell function during glucose intolerance and SGLT2 inhibition [^113wvsNr]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

This study investigated the glucagon‐FGF21 interaction's role in the metabolic benefits of SGLT2i treatment. Our results showed that FGF21 enhances glucose‐stimulated insulin secretion assay (GSIS) in islets from glucose‐intolerant donors. Chronic dapagliflozin treatment in mice elevated FGF21 and glucagon levels, improving glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and lipid metabolism. These findings highlight the potential of targeting the glucagon‐FGF21 axis to enhance SGLT2i therapy for prediabetes.

### Treatment and prevention of severe hypoglycaemia in people with diabetes: current and new formulations of glucagon [^116EEbnG]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

In children and adolescents, severe hypoglycaemia is defined by the International Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) as an event associated with severe cognitive impairment (including coma and convulsions) requiring external assistance from another person to actively administer carbohydrates, glucagon or other corrective actions. 56 A subgroup of severe hypoglycaemia is severe hypoglycaemic coma, which is defined as a severe hypoglycaemia event resulting in coma or seizure requiring parenteral therapy. ISPAD guidelines recommend that glucagon should be readily accessible to all parents and caregivers, especially when there is a high risk of severe hypoglycaemia. 56 Additionally, the guidelines note that education on how glucagon should be administered is essential.

Currently available treatments for severe hypoglycaemia, when a person is unable to safely swallow oral carbohydrates, are limited to intravenous dextrose, injectable glucagon emergency kits, and recently approved nasal glucagon (United States approval was granted in July 2019) and liquid glucagon rescue pen (FDA approval was granted in September 2019). Intravenous dextrose requires administration by HCPs or medically trained professionals within a hospital or emergency medical setting. 57, 58 Different concentrations of dextrose are used in prehospital and hospital settings (ie, 5%–50%). 57, 58 Stronger concentrations can cause rebound hyperglycaemia, and localized tissue damage if it leaks out of the vein 59; thus, injectable glucagon and nasal glucagon are the only therapeutic options for caregivers to use outside of these settings. When delivered correctly, glucagon is efficacious as a rescue therapy for severe hypoglycaemia. 60 The Glucagon Emergency Kit (Eli Lilly and Co, Indianapolis, IN) 61 and the GlucaGen HypoKit (Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsværd, Denmark) 62 are the currently available glucagon kits administered by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. 48

Glucagonostatic Effects of‐1

Glucagon is secreted from pancreatic α cells and opposes the action of insulin by regulating hepatic glucose production 19. In healthy subjects, oral or intravenous glucose induces suppression of glucagon secretion 20. In T2D, defective glucagon suppression produces hyperglucagonaemia, both in the fasting and post‐nutrient state 20. Paradoxically, a rise in glucagon is often observed in subjects with T2D after nutrient ingestion, and it has been postulated that reduced sensitivity of α cells to glucose (and insulin) may be responsible for this hyperglucagonemia 21. Incretin hormones also have significant roles in the regulation of glucagon release, and GLP‐1 appears to be a physiological inhibitor of glucagon secretion 7. By contrast, GIP can (under certain circumstances) stimulate glucagon secretion and antagonize GLP‐1‐mediated suppression of glucagon release 22, 23. In T2D, supraphysiological doses of GLP‐1 can fully restore α‐cell glucose sensitivity, facilitating normal glucose‐induced inhibition of glucagon secretion 7, 17. The mechanisms underlying these glucagonostatic effects are not entirely clear, but may involve direct α‐cell inhibition 24 or indirect inhibition via stimulation of somatostatin release from neighbouring δ cells 25. Clinical studies have indicated that GLP‐1‐induced inhibition of glucagon secretion contributes significantly to the glucose‐lowering capacity of GLP‐1‐based therapies and may be as important as their insulinotropic effects 26.

Abstract

Glucagonlike peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have been efficacious for the treatment of type 2 diabetes due to their ability to reduce weight and attenuate hyperglycemia. However, the activity of glucagonlike peptide 1 receptor–directed strategies is submaximal, and the only potent, sustainable treatment of metabolic dysfunction is bariatric surgery, necessitating the development of unique therapeutics. GLP-1 is structurally related to glucagon and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), allowing for the development of intermixed, unimolecular peptides with activity at each of their respective receptors. In this review, we discuss the range of tissue targets and added benefits afforded by the inclusion of each of GIP and glucagon. We discuss considerations for the development of sequence-intermixed dual agonists and triagonists, highlighting the importance of evaluating balanced signaling at the targeted receptors. Several multireceptor agonist peptides have been developed and evaluated, and the key preclinical and clinical findings are reviewed in detail. The biological activity of these multireceptor agonists are founded in the success of GLP-1-directed strategies; by including GIP and glucagon components, these multireceptor agonists are thought to enhance GLP-1's activities by broadening the tissue targets and synergizing at tissues that express multiple receptors, such at the brain and pancreatic islet β cells. The development and utility of balanced, unimolecular multireceptor agonists provide both a useful tool for querying the actions of incretins and glucagon during metabolic disease and a unique drug class to treat type 2 diabetes with unprecedented efficacy.

### SGLT2 inhibition increases fasting glucagon but does not restore the counterregulatory hormone response to hypoglycemia in participants with type 1 diabetes [^115rNd4T]. Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

Individuals with type 1 diabetes have an impaired glucagon counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia. Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors increase glucagon concentrations. We evaluated whether SGLT inhibition restores the glucagon counterregulatory hormone response to hypoglycemia. Adults with type 1 diabetes (n = 22) were treated with the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin (5 mg daily) or placebo for 4 weeks in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. After each treatment phase, participants underwent a hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp. Basal glucagon concentrations were 32% higher following dapagliflozin versus placebo, with a median within-participant difference of 2.75 pg/mL (95% CI 1.38–12.6). However, increased basal glucagon levels did not correlate with decreased rates of hypoglycemia and thus do not appear to be protective in avoiding hypoglycemia. During hypoglycemic clamp, SGLT2 inhibition did not change counterregulatory hormone concentrations, time to recovery from hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia symptoms, or cognitive function. Thus, despite raising basal glucagon concentrations, SGLT inhibitor treatment did not restore the impaired glucagon response to hypoglycemia. We propose that clinical reduction in hypoglycemia associated with these agents is a result of changes in diabetes care (e.g., lower insulin doses or improved glycemic variability) as opposed to a direct, physiologic effect of these medications on α-cell function.
