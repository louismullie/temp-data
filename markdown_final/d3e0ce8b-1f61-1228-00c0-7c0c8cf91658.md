## Question

Treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection in adults (treatment-experienced + with darunavir resistance-associated substitutions) - Darunavir ethanolate 600 mg PO q12h

What is the recommended dosage for: Treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection in adults (treatment-experienced + with darunavir resistance-associated substitutions)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage of darunavir ethanolate for treatment-experienced adults with HIV-1 who have darunavir resistance-associated substitutions, and whether 600 mg orally every 12 hours is correct. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact clinical scenario and how it differs from treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced patients without DRV resistance. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled dosing for this specific population. Next, I will check whether ritonavir boosting is required and confirm the food requirement. After that, I should review the resistance-associated substitutions that trigger this dose. Finally, I will reconcile any conflicting sources and ensure the regimen is aligned with current guidelines and key trials before concluding with a clear recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario so I don't misapply dosing. Treatment-experienced adults with HIV-1 who harbor darunavir resistance-associated substitutions are a distinct group in whom standard once-daily darunavir/ritonavir is not appropriate, and they require a boosted twice-daily regimen to overcome reduced susceptibility, unlike treatment-naïve patients or treatment-experienced patients without DRV resistance, who generally receive once-daily dosing [^34ceb9e5] [^852ca299].

> I should confirm the labeled dose next. Multiple FDA sources consistently state that for treatment-experienced adults with at least one darunavir resistance-associated substitution, the recommended dose is darunavir 600 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily with food, which corresponds to 600 mg orally every 12 hours with ritonavir boosting and food [^3c3636c4] [^34ceb9e5] [^a0dab4ab].

> Wait, let me verify the boosting requirement because unboosted darunavir is not effective. Darunavir must be coadministered with ritonavir to achieve therapeutic exposure; failure to boost results in subtherapeutic levels and altered drug interactions, so the correct regimen is darunavir 600 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg twice daily with food, not darunavir monotherapy [^34ceb9e5] [^3de64a88].

> I need to check which resistance-associated substitutions trigger this dose. The FDA lists V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54L, I54M, T74P, L76V, I84V, and L89V as the key substitutions associated with reduced darunavir response; presence of these substitutions supports the 600 mg twice-daily regimen rather than once-daily dosing [^34ceb9e5] [^a1af2f6b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about once-daily options in this population. I initially wondered if a once-daily fixed-dose combination like darunavir/cobicistat could be used here, but I should double-check the label. Prezcobix (darunavir/cobicistat) is indicated only when there are no darunavir resistance-associated substitutions, so it is not appropriate for patients with DRV resistance mutations; thus, the twice-daily ritonavir-boosted regimen remains the standard in this scenario [^b4889e1c] [^81e7da0e].

> Next, I should review supportive clinical evidence to ensure this dosing aligns with outcomes. In POWER 1 and 2, darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily produced significantly higher virologic response rates than comparator protease inhibitors in heavily treatment-experienced patients, supporting the efficacy of this dose in resistance settings, and TITAN demonstrated noninferiority versus lopinavir/ritonavir with fewer emergent resistance mutations, reinforcing the role of this regimen in treatment-experienced patients [^a597b3fd] [^3e07df20].

> I should confirm practical administration details. The tablets should be taken with food to optimize absorption, and patients who cannot swallow tablets may use the oral suspension with appropriate ritonavir coadministration; baseline genotypic testing is recommended when feasible to guide dose selection, but when testing is not available, the 600 mg twice-daily regimen is still recommended for treatment-experienced patients [^34ceb9e5] [^231945a3].

> Putting this together, I can conclude with confidence that the recommended dosage for treatment-experienced adults with HIV-1 who have darunavir resistance-associated substitutions is darunavir 600 mg orally every 12 hours (i.e., 600 mg twice daily) with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily and with food, and this is the correct interpretation of the 600 mg PO q12h phrasing in the question [^3c3636c4] [^34ceb9e5] [^852ca299].

---

The recommended dose of darunavir ethanolate for treatment-experienced adults with HIV-1 who have darunavir resistance-associated substitutions is **600 mg orally twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg and food** [^3c3636c4] [^34ceb9e5]. This twice-daily regimen is supported by clinical trials showing sustained virologic suppression and a favorable safety profile in this population [^a597b3fd] [^3e07df20]. Once-daily dosing is **not appropriate** when darunavir resistance-associated substitutions are present [^b4889e1c].

---

## Recommended dosage regimen

- **Standard regimen**: Darunavir 600 mg orally twice daily (every 12 hours) with ritonavir 100 mg and food [^3c3636c4] [^34ceb9e5].
- **Rationale**: Boosting with ritonavir is required to achieve therapeutic darunavir exposure and overcome resistance [^34ceb9e5].
- **Administration**: Take with food to optimize absorption and minimize gastrointestinal side effects [^34ceb9e5].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the recommended dosage

- **POWER trials**: Darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily achieved superior virologic response versus comparator protease inhibitors in heavily treatment-experienced patients [^a597b3fd].
- **TITAN trial**: Darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily was noninferior to lopinavir/ritonavir in treatment-experienced patients, with fewer treatment-emergent resistance mutations [^3e07df20].
- **ODIN trial**: Once-daily darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg was noninferior to twice-daily dosing in patients without darunavir resistance-associated substitutions, but is not recommended when such substitutions are present [^5afe3d1b] [^b4889e1c].

---

## Darunavir resistance-associated substitutions

The following substitutions are associated with reduced darunavir susceptibility and guide the need for twice-daily dosing: **V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54L, I54M, T74P, L76V, I84V, L89V** [^34ceb9e5] [^a1af2f6b].

---

## Clinical outcomes and efficacy

- **Virologic suppression**: The 600 mg twice-daily regimen achieves high rates of HIV-1 RNA suppression (< 50 copies/mL) in treatment-experienced patients with resistance [^a597b3fd] [^3e07df20].
- **Resistance barrier**: Darunavir has a high genetic barrier to resistance, and the twice-daily regimen maintains activity despite multiple baseline protease inhibitor mutations [^a597b3fd] [^3e07df20].
- **Safety**: The regimen is generally well tolerated, with gastrointestinal events and lipid elevations as the most common adverse effects [^a597b3fd] [^3e07df20].

| Darunavir 600 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg | Treatment-experienced patients with darunavir resistance-associated substitutions | Superior efficacy in this population [^a597b3fd] [^3e07df20] | Recommended regimen [^3c3636c4] [^852ca299] |

---

## Special considerations and precautions

- **Drug interactions**: Darunavir/ritonavir is a CYP3A inhibitor; review concomitant medications for interactions and adjust as needed [^dd56eb24].
- **Hepatic impairment**: Use caution in patients with hepatic impairment; monitor liver function tests regularly [^231945a3].
- **Pregnancy**: The same twice-daily regimen is recommended during pregnancy, with close monitoring [^34ceb9e5].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Recommended dose**: Darunavir 600 mg orally twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg and food [^3c3636c4] [^34ceb9e5].
- **Indication**: Treatment-experienced adults with HIV-1 who have darunavir resistance-associated substitutions [^3c3636c4].
- **Rationale**: Supported by robust clinical evidence demonstrating sustained virologic suppression and favorable safety [^a597b3fd] [^3e07df20].

---

The recommended dose of darunavir ethanolate for treatment-experienced adults with HIV-1 who have darunavir resistance-associated substitutions is **600 mg orally twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg and food**, a regimen supported by strong clinical evidence and current guidelines [^3c3636c4] [^852ca299].

Cross-resistance

Cross-resistance among PIs has been observed. Darunavir has a less than 10-fold decreased susceptibility in cell culture against 90% of 3309 clinical isolates resistant to amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and/or tipranavir showing that viruses resistant to these PIs remain susceptible to darunavir. A less than 10-fold decreased susceptibility was observed for the other PIs in 26% to 96% of these PI resistant clinical isolates [nelfinavir (26%), ritonavir (34%), lopinavir (46%), indinavir (57%), atazanavir (59%), saquinavir (64%), amprenavir (70%), and tipranavir (96%)].

Cross-resistance between darunavir and nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, fusion inhibitors, CCR5 co-receptor antagonists, or integrase strand transfer inhibitors is unlikely because the viral targets are different.

Baseline Genotype/Phenotype and Virologic Outcome Analyses

Baseline International AIDS Society (IAS)-defined PI resistance substitutions confer reduced virologic response to darunavir. Please refer to the "Baseline Genotype/Phenotype and Virologic Outcome Analyses" section in the darunavir full prescribing information.

### Efficacy and safety of darunavir-ritonavir at week 48 in treatment-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection in POWER 1 and 2: a pooled subgroup analysis of data from two randomised trials [^a597b3fd]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

The continuing, randomised, multinational, phase IIB POWER 1 and 2 studies aim to evaluate efficacy and safety of darunavir in combination with low-dose ritonavir in treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients. We did a pooled subgroup analysis to update results at week 48 for patients receiving the recommended dose of darunavir-ritonavir compared with those receiving other protease inhibitors (PIs).

Methods

After 24-week dose-finding phases and primary efficacy analyses, patients randomised to receive darunavir-ritonavir were given 600/100 mg twice daily, and patients receiving control PIs continued on assigned treatment into the longer-term, open-label phase; all patients continued on optimised background regimen. We assessed patients who had reached week 48 or discontinued earlier at the time of analysis; for the darunavir-ritonavir group, only patients who received 600/100 mg twice daily from baseline were included. Analyses were intention-to-treat. The POWER 2 study (TMC114-C202) is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00071097).

Findings

At week 48, 67 of 110 (61%) darunavir-ritonavir patients compared with 18 of 120 (15%) of control PI patients had viral load reductions of 1 log10 copies per mL or greater from baseline (primary endpoint; difference in response rates 46%, 95% CI 35%-57%, p < 0.0001). Based on a logistic regression model including stratification factors (baseline number of primary PI mutations, use of enfuvirtide, baseline viral load) and study as covariates, the difference in response was 50% (odds ratio 11.72, 95% CI 5.75–23.89). In the darunavir-ritonavir group, rates of adverse events were mostly lower than or similar to those in the control group when corrected for treatment exposure. No unexpected safety concerns were identified.

Interpretation

Efficacy responses with darunavir-ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily plus optimised background regimen were greater than those with control PI and were sustained to at least week 48, with favourable safety and tolerability in treatment-experienced patients. This regimen could expand the treatment options available for such patients.

Gender

Darunavir: In participants with HIV-1 taking darunavir co-administered with ritonavir, population pharmacokinetic analysis showed higher mean darunavir exposure in females compared to males. This difference is not clinically relevant.

Cobicistat: No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences have been observed between men and women for cobicistat.

Race

Darunavir: Population pharmacokinetic analysis of darunavir in participants with HIV-1 taking darunavir co-administered with ritonavir indicated that race had no apparent effect on the exposure to darunavir.

Cobicistat: Population pharmacokinetic analysis of cobicistat in participants with HIV-1 indicated that race had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of cobicistat.

Geriatric Patients

Darunavir: In participants with HIV-1 taking darunavir co-administered with ritonavir, population pharmacokinetic analysis showed no considerable differences in darunavir pharmacokinetics for ages 18 to 75 years compared to ages greater than or equal to 65 years (n = 12) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Cobicistat: Insufficient data are available to determine whether potential differences exist in the pharmacokinetics of cobicistat in geriatric (65 years of age and older) participants compared to younger participants.

Pediatrics Weighing at Least 25 kg

Available pharmacokinetic data for the different components of PREZCOBIX indicate that there were no clinically relevant differences in darunavir exposure between adults and adolescents or children weighing at least 25 kg (see Table 4). Cobicistat exposures were similar between adults and adolescents but higher in children aged 6 to less than 12 years, weighing at least 25 kg. The difference observed in children for cobicistat is not considered clinically relevant.

2.3 Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients

Darunavir tablets must be co-administered with ritonavir to exert its therapeutic effect. Failure to correctly co-administer darunavir tablets with ritonavir will result in plasma levels of darunavir that will be insufficient to achieve the desired antiviral effect and will alter some drug interactions.

Patients who have difficulty swallowing darunavir tablets can use the 100 mg per mL darunavir oral suspension.

Treatment-Naïve Adult Patients

The recommended oral dose of darunavir is 800 mg (one 800 mg tablet or 8 mL of the oral suspension) taken with ritonavir 100 mg (one 100 mg tablet or capsule or 1.25 mL of a 80 mg per mL ritonavir oral solution) once daily and with food. An 8 mL darunavir dose should be taken as two 4 mL administrations with the included oral dosing syringe.

Treatment-Experienced Adult Patients

The recommended oral dosage for treatment-experienced adult patients is summarized in Table 1.

Baseline genotypic testing is recommended for dose selection. However, when genotypic testing is not feasible, darunavir 600 mg taken with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is recommended.

2.4 Recommended Dosage During Pregnancy

The recommended dosage in pregnant patients is darunavir 600 mg taken with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily with food.

Darunavir 800 mg taken with ritonavir 100 mg once daily should only be considered in certain pregnant patients who are already on a stable darunavir 800 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily regimen prior to pregnancy, are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL), and in whom a change to twice daily darunavir 600 mg with ritonavir 100 mg may compromise tolerability or compliance.

Hepatic Impairment

Darunavir: Darunavir is primarily metabolized by the liver. The steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of darunavir were similar after multiple dose co-administration of darunavir 600 mg co-administered with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily to participants with normal hepatic function (n = 16), mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, n = 8), and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B, n = 8). The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of darunavir has not been evaluated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Cobicistat: Cobicistat is primarily metabolized by the liver. A trial evaluating the pharmacokinetics of cobicistat was performed in participants with moderate hepatic impairment. No clinically relevant differences in cobicistat pharmacokinetics were observed between participants with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and healthy participants. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of cobicistat has not been evaluated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C Virus Co-Infection

Darunavir: In participants with HIV-1 taking darunavir co-administered with ritonavir, the 48 week analysis of the data from clinical studies in participants with HIV-1 indicated that hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection status had no apparent effect on the exposure of darunavir.

The effect of hepatitis B and/or C virus infection on the pharmacokinetics of PREZCOBIX have not been evaluated.

Renal Impairment

Darunavir: Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the pharmacokinetics of darunavir were not significantly affected in participants with HIV-1 with moderate renal impairment taking darunavir co-administered with ritonavir (creatinine clearance between 30–60 mL/min, n = 20). There are no pharmacokinetic data available in participants with HIV-1 with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease taking darunavir co-adminstered with either ritonavir or cobicistat [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Cobicistat: A trial of the pharmacokinetics of cobicistat was performed in non-HIV participants with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min). No clinically relevant differences in cobicistat pharmacokinetics were observed between participants with severe renal impairment and healthy participants [see Use in Special Populations (8.7)].

Cell Culture

Darunavir: HIV-1 isolates with a decreased susceptibility to darunavir have been selected in cell culture and obtained from participants treated with darunavir co-administered with ritonavir. Darunavir-resistant virus derived in cell culture from wild-type HIV-1 had 21- to 88-fold decreased susceptibility to darunavir and developed 2 to 4 of the following amino acid substitutions S37D, R41E/T, K55Q, H69Q, K70E, T74S, V77I, or I85V in the protease. Selection in cell culture of darunavir resistant HIV-1 from nine HIV-1 strains harboring multiple PI resistance-associated substitutions resulted in the overall emergence of 22 mutations in the protease gene, coding for amino acid substitutions L10F, V11I, I13V, I15V, G16E, L23I, V32I, L33F, S37N, M46I, I47V, I50V, F53L, L63P, A71V, G73S, L76V, V82I, I84V, T91A/S, and Q92R, of which L10F, V32I, L33F, S37N, M46I, I47V, I50V, L63P, A71V, and I84V were the most prevalent. These darunavir-resistant viruses had at least eight protease substitutions and exhibited 50- to 641-fold decreases in darunavir susceptibility with final EC50values ranging from 125 nM to 3461 nM.

Clinical Studies

The resistance profile of PREZCOBIX is driven by darunavir. Cobicistat does not select any HIV resistance substitutions, due to its lack of antiviral activity. For the clinical resistance profile of darunavir, refer to the darunavir full prescribing information.

Darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) once-daily dosing for children aged ≥ 3 years to < 12 years — initial therapy and switching: Whereas modeling studies identified a once-daily DRV/r schedule approved by the FDA, the Panel is concerned about the lack of direct PK studies for individuals aged ≥ 3 years to < 12 years; therefore, the data are not sufficient to recommend once-daily dosing for initial therapy in this age group. For older children on a twice-daily DRV/r-based regimen with undetectable viral loads, practitioners can consider switching to once-daily DRV/r if no darunavir-associated resistance mutations are present.

### A week-48 randomized phase-3 trial of darunavir / cobicistat / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide in treatment-naive HIV-1 patients [^9cf17c02]. AIDS (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens for HIV-1-infected patients are now more effective, safe and convenient. However, treatment adherence, emergence of resistant virus with virologic failure, and tolerability remain important challenges. Convenient once-daily, single-tablet regimens (STR) can facilitate treatment adherence and improve treatment effectiveness.

Since its initial approval in 2006, substantial clinical trial data and clinical experience with darunavir have accumulated, demonstrating the potent and durable virologic response, high genetic barrier to resistance, and favorable safety profile in ART-naive, HIV-1-infected patients. A substantial proportion of newly diagnosed patients in the United States and Europe are treated with a boosted protease inhibitor, and darunavir is the recommended protease inhibitor in treatment guidelines. United States guidelines recommend two nucleoside or nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) combined with an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), or in certain clinical situations boosted darunavir 800 mg once daily or a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Boosted darunavir is recommended for patients with uncertain adherence, those who require a regimen with a high-resistance barrier, or those patients without available resistance results. European guidelines recommend two NRTIs combined with either an INSTI, boosted darunavir or an NNRTI for all ART-naive patients, with both darunavir and atazanavir as recommended protease inhibitors in the BHIVA guidelines.

### Week 48 analysis of once-daily vs. twice-daily darunavir / ritonavir in treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients [^5afe3d1b]. AIDS (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

ODIN (Once-daily Darunavir In treatment-experieNced patients) was a phase III, 48-week, open-label study comparing once-daily vs. twice-daily darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) in treatment-experienced patients with no DRV resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) at screening.

Methods

Patients with no DRV RAMs and receiving stable HAART for at least 12 weeks were stratified by HIV-1 RNA (≤ or > 50 000 copies/ml) and randomized to once-daily DRV/r 800/100 mg or twice-daily DRV/r 600/100 mg and an optimized background regimen (≥ 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors). Primary objective was to demonstrate noninferiority of once-daily vs. twice-daily DRV/r in confirmed virologic response (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml) at week 48.

Results

Five hundred and ninety patients received once-daily (n = 294) or twice-daily (n = 296) DRV/r. Mean baseline HIV-1 RNA was 4.16 log10 copies/ml; median CD4 cell count was 228 cells/μl; and 53.9% had previously used at least one protease inhibitor. At week 48, 72.1% of once-daily and 70.9% of twice-daily patients achieved HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml (intent-to-treat/time-to-loss of virologic response). The difference in response between once-daily and twice-daily arms was 1.2% (95% confidence interval -6.1 to 8.5%; P < 0.001), establishing noninferiority of once-daily DRV/r versus twice-daily DRV/r. Median CD4 cell count increase was 100 (once-daily) and 94 cells/μl (twice-daily). Virologic failure rate was low and similar for both arms; only one patient (once-daily arm) developed primary protease inhibitor mutations. Once-daily DRV/r had a lower incidence of grade 2–4 triglyceride increases (5.2 vs. 11.0%, P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Once-daily DRV/r 800/100 mg was noninferior in virologic response to twice-daily DRV/r 600/100 mg at 48 weeks in treatment-experienced patients with no DRV RAMs, and with a more favorable lipid profile. These findings support use of once-daily DRV/r in this population.

### Efficacy and safety of darunavir-ritonavir compared with that of lopinavir-ritonavir at 48 weeks in treatment-experienced, HIV-infected patients in TITAN: a randomised controlled phase III trial [^3e07df20]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

The protease inhibitor darunavir has been shown to be efficacious in highly treatment-experienced patients with HIV infection, but needs to be assessed in patients with a broader range of treatment experience. We did a randomised, controlled, phase III trial (TITAN) to compare 48-week efficacy and safety of darunavir-ritonavir with that of lopinavir-ritonavir in treatment-experienced, lopinavir-naive patients.

Methods

Patients received optimised background regimen plus non-blinded treatment with darunavir-ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily or lopinavir-ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was non-inferiority (95% CI lower limit for the difference in treatment response -12% or greater) for HIV RNA of less than 400 copies per mL in plasma at week 48 (per-protocol analysis). TITAN (TMC114-C214) is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00110877.

Findings

Of 595 patients randomised and treated, 187 (31%) were protease inhibitor naive; 476 of 582 (82%) were susceptible to four or more protease inhibitors. At week 48, significantly more darunavir-ritonavir than lopinavir-ritonavir patients had HIV RNA of less than 400 copies per mL (77% [220 of 286] vs 68% [199 of 293]; estimated difference 9%, 95% CI 2–16). Fewer virological failures treated with darunavir-ritonavir than with lopinavir-ritonavir developed primary protease inhibitor mutations (21% [n = 6] vs 36% [n = 20]) and nucleoside analogue-associated mutations (14% [n = 4] vs 27% [n = 15]). Safety data were generally similar between the groups; grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 80 (27%) darunavir-ritonavir and 89 (30%) lopinavir-ritonavir patients.

Interpretation

In lopinavir-naive, treatment-experienced patients, darunavir-ritonavir was non-inferior to lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in terms of our virological endpoint, and should therefore be considered as a treatment option for this population.

### Darunavir (darunavir 600 and 800 mg) [^7c9a67e2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the 48-week analysis of the Phase 3 trial TMC114-C229, the number of virologic failures (including those who discontinued before suppression after Week 4) was 26% (75/294) in the group of subjects receiving darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily compared to 19% (56/296) of subjects receiving darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily. Examination of isolates from subjects who failed on darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily and had post-baseline genotypes showed that 8 subjects (8/60; 13%) had isolates that developed IAS-USA defined PI resistance-associated substitutions compared to 5 subjects (5/39; 13%) on darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily. Isolates from 2 subjects developed PI resistance associated substitutions associated with decreased susceptibility to darunavir; 1 subject isolate in the darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily arm, developed substitutions V32I, M46I, L76V and I84V associated with a 24-fold decreased susceptibility to darunavir, and 1 subject isolate in the darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily arm developed substitutions L33F and I50V associated with a 40-fold decreased susceptibility to darunavir. In the darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily and darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily groups, isolates from 7 (7/60; 12%) and 4 (4/42; 10%) virologic failures, respectively, developed decreased susceptibility to an NRTI included in the treatment regimen.

Darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (D/C/F/TAF) 800/150/200/10 mg is an oral, once-daily STR for treatment of naïve and ART-experienced, virologically suppressed patients with HIV-1 infection. The efficacy and safety of D/C/F/TAF have been demonstrated in the phase 3 AMBER and EMERALD studies, in which high proportions of participants (> 91%) achieved HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL. Few participants (< 2% in each study) had adverse events (AEs) leading to study discontinuation, and only 1 participant (of 1866 in total) had an emergent resistance-associated mutation (RAM) to a study drug (emtricitabine [AMBER]). Darunavir has demonstrated a high genetic barrier to resistance and is recommended for cases in which resistance testing records are unavailable, when ART needs to be started prior to the availability of resistance testing results, or when poor adherence is suspected. In the DIAMOND study, D/C/F/TAF was prospectively assessed in a rapid-initiation scenario in newly diagnosed, HIV-1–infected, treatment-naïve participants.

See "What are the possible side effects of darunavir tablets?" for more information about side effects.

What are darunavir tablets?

Darunavir tablets are prescription HIV-1 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus-type 1) medicine used with ritonavir and other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1 infection in adults and children 3 years of age and older. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).

Darunavir should not be used in children under 3 years of age.

When used with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1 infection, darunavir tablets may help:

reduce the amount of HIV-1 in your blood. This is called "viral load".
increase the number of CD4+ (T) cells in your blood that help fight off other infections.

Reducing the amount of HIV-1 and increasing the CD4+ (T) cells in your blood may improve your immune system. This may reduce your risk of death or getting infections that can happen when your immune system is weak (opportunistic infections).

Darunavir tablet does not cure HIV-1 infection or AIDS. You must keep taking HIV-1 medicines to control HIV-1 infection and decrease HIV-related illnesses.

### Darunavir: a nonpeptidic antiretroviral protease inhibitor [^61242acd]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Protease inhibitors were a major therapeutic breakthrough in the mid-1990s for the treatment of HIV infection, which resulted in improved life expectancy for patients who had failed previous therapies. With time and evolution of the virus, however, there is a new population of patients with treatment-resistant disease and few treatment options. Darunavir is a synthetic nonpeptidic analogue of amprenavir with enhanced activity against resistant virus that became available in 2006.

Objectives

The purpose of this review was to describe the clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, and clinical efficacy of darunavir. Also discussed are the published clinical experience with darunavir, its adverse events, drug interactions, pharmacoeconomics, and dosing and administration.

Methods

A MEDLINE and EMBASE search (English-language only) was performed from January 1996 through April 2007 using the key words darunavir and TMC114. Abstracts from relevant scientific meetings were searched for the years 2000 through 2007. Additionally, the US Food and Drug Administration Web site was accessed to review the new drug application summary and data presented therein.

Results

Darunavir was found to maintain antiretroviral activity against HIV with protease inhibitor mutations in 6 studies. Clinical efficacy and safety data are limited to 4 controlled and 2 uncontrolled trials. In 2 large Phase IIb clinical studies, viral suppression at 48 weeks to undetectable levels in heavily pretreated patients was achieved in 45% of patients compared with 10% of patients in the control group (P < 0.001). The addition of enfuvirtide enhanced this response rate to 58% compared with 11% of the patients who did not receive enfuvirtide (P < 0.001). Gastrointestinal symptoms, nausea, and headache were the most commonly reported events.

Conclusions

Darunavir has improved activity against resistant HIV isolates in patients with few treatment choices, particularly when enfuvirtide is added. The safety profile of darunavir is comparable to other protease inhibitors based on early data.

Gender

Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed higher mean darunavir exposure in HIV-1-infected females compared to males. This difference is not clinically relevant.

Race

Population pharmacokinetic analysis of darunavir in HIV-1-infected subjects indicated that race had no apparent effect on the exposure to darunavir.

Geriatric Patients

Population pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV-1-infected subjects showed that darunavir pharmacokinetics are not considerably different in the age range (18 to 75 years) evaluated in HIV-1-infected subjects (n = 12, age greater than or equal to 65) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Pediatric Patients

Darunavir/ritonavir administered twice daily

The pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir in 93 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects 3 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 10 kg showed that the administered weight-based dosages resulted in similar darunavir exposure when compared to the darunavir exposure achieved in treatment-experienced adults receiving darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

### Antiretroviral treatment of adult HIV infection: 2014 recommendations of the international antiviral society-USA panel [^7581edfe]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

New data and antiretroviral regimens expand treatment choices in resource-rich settings and warrant an update of recommendations to treat adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Objective

To provide updated treatment recommendations for adults with HIV, emphasizing when to start treatment; what treatment to start; the use of laboratory monitoring tools; and managing treatment failure, switches, and simplification.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Synthesis

An International Antiviral Society-USA panel of experts in HIV research and patient care considered previous data and reviewed new data since the 2012 update with literature searches in PubMed and EMBASE through June 2014. Recommendations and ratings were based on the quality of evidence and consensus.

Results

Antiretroviral therapy is recommended for all adults with HIV infection. Evidence for benefits of treatment and quality of available data increase at lower CD4 cell counts. Recommended initial regimens include 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs; abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine) and a third single or boosted drug, which should be an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (dolutegravir, elvitegravir, or raltegravir), a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (efavirenz or rilpivirine) or a boosted protease inhibitor (darunavir or atazanavir). Alternative regimens are available. Boosted protease inhibitor monotherapy is generally not recommended, but NRTI-sparing approaches may be considered. New guidance for optimal timing of monitoring of laboratory parameters is provided. Suspected treatment failure warrants rapid confirmation, performance of resistance testing while the patient is receiving the failing regimen, and evaluation of reasons for failure before consideration of switching therapy. Regimen switches for adverse effects, convenience, or to reduce costs should not jeopardize antiretroviral potency.

Conclusions and Relevance

After confirmed diagnosis of HIV infection, antiretroviral therapy should be initiated in all individuals who are willing and ready to start treatment. Regimens should be selected or changed based on resistance test results with consideration of dosing frequency, pill burden, adverse toxic effect profiles, comorbidities, and drug interactions.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of darunavir or cobicistat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Darunavir and cobicistat are present in the milk of lactating rats (see Data). Potential risks of breastfeeding include: (1) HIV-1 transmission (in infants without HIV-1), (2) developing viral resistance (in infants with HIV-1), and (3) serious adverse reactions in breastfed infant similar to those seen in adults.

Data

Animal Data

Darunavir: Studies in rats (with darunavir alone or with ritonavir) have demonstrated that darunavir is excreted in milk. In the rat pre- and postnatal development study, a reduction in pup body weight gain was observed due to exposure of pups to drug substances via milk. The maximal maternal plasma exposures achieved with darunavir (up to 1000 mg/kg with ritonavir) were approximately 50% of those obtained in humans at the recommended clinical dose of darunavir with ritonavir.

Cobicistat: During the pre/postnatal developmental toxicology study at doses up to 75 mg/kg/day, mean cobicistat milk to plasma ratio of up to 1.9 was measured 2 hours after administration to rats on lactation day 10.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Contraception

Additional or alternative (non-hormonal) forms of contraception should be considered when estrogen-containing contraceptives are co-administered with PREZCOBIX. For co-administration with drospirenone, clinical monitoring is recommended due to the potential for hyperkalemia. No data are available to make recommendations on co-administration with other hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

### Darunavir / cobicistat / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide in a rapid-initiation model of care for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection: primary analysis of the DIAMOND study [^67e287c8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Most guidelines recommend rapid treatment initiation for patients with newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, but prospective US data are limited. The DIAMOND (NCT03227861) study using darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (D/C/F/TAF) 800/150/200/10 mg is a phase 3 prospective study evaluating efficacy/safety of a single-tablet regimen in a rapid-initiation model of care.

Methods

Adults aged ≥ 18 years began D/C/F/TAF ≤ 14 days from diagnosis without screening/baseline results; as results became available, participants not meeting predefined safety/resistance stopping rules continued. Primary endpoint was virologic response (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL; intent-to-treat; US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] snapshot) at week 48; participant satisfaction was measured via the HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire status version (HIVTSQs).

Results

Of 109 participants, 87% were male, 32% black/African American, median (range) age was 28 (range, 19–66) years, 25% of participants had HIV-1 RNA ≥ 100 000 copies/mL, 21% had CD4+ cell count < 200 cells/µL, and 31% enrolled ≤ 48 hours from diagnosis. At week 48, 97 (89%) participants completed the study and 92 (84%) achieved HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL (FDA snapshot). There were no protocol-defined virologic failures; incidences of adverse events (AEs) and adverse drug reactions (33%) were low, no serious AEs were study drug related, and 1 (< 1%) participant discontinued due to study drug related AE(s). The overall HIVTSQs score at week 48 was 58 (maximum: 60).

Conclusions

At week 48, a high proportion of participants starting D/C/F/TAF achieved HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL and very few discontinued therapy. D/C/F/TAF was well tolerated, no participants discontinued due to baseline resistance stopping criteria, and high treatment satisfaction among participants was recorded.

### Darunavir (darunavir 600 and 800 mg) [^c6509455]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the 96-week as-treated analysis of the Phase 3 trial TMC114-C214, the percent of virologic failures (never suppressed, rebounders and discontinued before achieving suppression) was 21% (62/298) in the group of subjects receiving darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily compared to 32% (96/297) of subjects receiving lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily. Examination of subjects who failed on darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily and had post-baseline genotypes and phenotypes showed that 7 subjects (7/43; 16%) developed PI substitutions on darunavir/ritonavir treatment resulting in decreased susceptibility to darunavir. Six of the 7 had baseline PI resistance-associated substitutions and baseline darunavir phenotypes greater than 7. The most common emerging PI substitutions in these virologic failures were V32I, L33F, M46I or L, I47V, I54L, T74P and L76V. These amino acid substitutions were associated with 59- to 839-fold decreased susceptibility to darunavir at failure. Examination of individual subjects who failed in the comparator arm on lopinavir/ritonavir and had post-baseline genotypes and phenotypes showed that 31 subjects (31/75; 41%) developed substitutions on lopinavir treatment resulting in decreased susceptibility to lopinavir (greater than 10-fold) and the most common substitutions emerging on treatment were L10I or F, M46I or L, I47V or A, I54V and L76V. Of the 31 lopinavir/ritonavir virologic failure subjects, 14 had reduced susceptibility (greater than 10-fold) to lopinavir at baseline.

### Safety and efficacy of darunavir / ritonavir in treatment-experienced pediatric patients: week 48 results of the ARIEL trial [^9bd0a58c]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

ARIEL (Darunavir in treatment-experienced pediatric population) was a phase II, open-label study assessing safety and antiviral activity of darunavir/ritonavir twice daily with an optimized background regimen (OBR) in treatment-experienced, HIV-1-infected pediatric patients (3 to < 6 years, weighing 10 to < 20 kg).

Methods

The study consisted of an initial 4-week screening period, 48 weeks of treatment and a 4-week follow-up period. Patients initially received darunavir/ritonavir 20/3 mg/kg twice-daily for 2 weeks. Following review of pharmacokinetic, safety and antiviral data, the doses of darunavir/ritonavir were adjusted to 25/3 mg/kg twice-daily for patients < 15 kg, and 375/50 mg twice-daily for patients 15 to < 20 kg.

Results

Of the 34 patients screened, 21 were treated (median treatment duration 48.6 weeks). Darunavir plus an OBR was well tolerated over 48 weeks, with no new safety concerns, and a comparable safety profile to that seen in older children and adults. All treatment-emergent lipid-related and glucose-related laboratory abnormalities were grade 1 or 2. At week 48, 17 of 21 patients (81.0%) had a confirmed virologic response (intent-to-treat, time-to-loss of virologic response). Improvements in height and weight were seen during the study.

Conclusions

No new safety concerns were observed over a 48 week period. These results led to lowering the age to 3 years at which darunavir/ritonavir is indicated for use in treatment-experienced pediatric patients. This study also established doses of darunavir to use in treatment-experienced, HIV-1-infected patients aged 3 to < 6 years. A high virologic response was observed with this dose. No development of resistance was observed in patients who experienced virologic failure.

### Pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of darunavir / ritonavir in treatment-experienced children and adolescents [^b1c2099e]. AIDS (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) and optimized background regimen in treatment-experienced patients (6–17 years).

Design

Forty-eight-week, open-label, two-part, phase II study.

Methods

In part I, 44 patients were randomized (1: 1 ratio) to receive a body weight-adjusted, adult-equivalent dose (group A) or a 20–33% higher DRV/r twice daily (b.i.d.) dose (group B). Pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy were assessed following 2-week dosing (part I), which determined dosing for part II (evaluated 48-week safety and efficacy).

Results

In part I, both groups met the protocol-specified criteria for pharmacokinetics and showed favorable tolerability and efficacy. The following body-weight doses were selected: DRV/r 375/50 mg b.i.d. (20- < 30 kg), 450/60 mg b.i.d. (30- < 40 kg) and 600/100 mg b.i.d. (≥ 40 kg); these gave an AUC24h, C0h and Cmax of 102, 114 and 112%, respectively, versus the corresponding mean adult pharmacokinetic parameter. In part II, 80 patients received DRV/r (median age: 14 years, mean baseline HIV-1 RNA: 4.64 log(10)copies/ml). One patient (1%) discontinued (treatment-unrelated grade 3 anxiety). An abnormal mean baseline triglyceride level was normalized at 48 weeks (P < 0.01). At week 48, 65% had at least 1.0 log(10)HIV-1 RNA reduction; 59 and 48% achieved HIV-1 RNA less than 400 and less than 50 copies/ml, respectively (time-to-loss-of-virologic response). Mean age-adjusted weight z-score increased by 0.2 (P = 0.003).

Conclusion

In treatment-experienced children and adolescents, DRV/r showed comparable exposure to adults with appropriate dose selection, favorable safety and tolerability, improved body weight and significant virologic response. DRV/r is a valuable therapeutic option for this population.

The clinical experience with the protease inhibitor darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) was retrospectively evaluated in a cohort of 173 HIV+ patients who initiated antiretroviral treatment including DRV/r (period 2007–2015). The 43.2% had a CD4 nadir ≤ 100cells/mm 3, 64.1% were treatment-experienced, and 36.5% had failed to > 3 lines of antiretroviral therapy. Nonetheless, the rate of virological suppression (HIV-RNA < 50copies/ml) in naïve patients was 63%, 66.7%, and 63.6% at 48, 96, and 144 weeks, respectively. The rate of virological suppression in treatment-experienced patients was 62.7%, 78.7%, and 79.1% at 48, 96, and 144 weeks, respectively. No differences were observed according to the immunovirological status neither dosage of DRV/r. Most of them (82.6%) maintained DRV/r treatment. Causes for DRV/r discontinuation were mainly gastrointestinal and cutaneous adverse events (10.5%), switch to simplification treatment strategies (3.5%) and virological failure (1.7%). These findings demonstrate the prolonged efficacy and tolerability of DRV/r even in multi-treated HIV+ patients with an unfavorable immunovirological status. J. Med.

### A week-48 randomized phase-3 trial of darunavir / cobicistat / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide in treatment-naive HIV-1 patients [^28f7c847]. AIDS (2018). Low credibility.

As in other recent phase-3 trials in ART-naive patients, study limitations were inclusion of more than 80% white patients and a comparatively small proportion of female or older (> 50 years) participants or who had high viral loads. The latter most likely reflects earlier initiation of ART based on current guideline recommendations. Phase-3 studies often lack power to detect rare clinical safety events; however, the large clinical safety database for darunavir and substantial clinical experience counterbalance this limitation. Renal and bone safety were assessed using surrogate markers rather than clinical events, and bone safety was assessed in a smaller number of patients.

In conclusion, D/C/F/TAF was noninferior to a regimen of darunavir/cobicistat co-administered with F/TDF at week 48, with a high virologic response (91.4%) in ART-naive, HIV-1-infected adults. D/C/F/TAF was associated with a better bone and renal safety profile than control, with few moderate, severe, or serious adverse events. Changes in HDL-cholesterol favored D/C/F/TAF and remaining lipid increases favored control. D/C/F/TAF is a novel STR that combines the known efficacy and high-genetic barrier to resistance of darunavir with the safety advantages of TAF to provide a new option for the treatment of ART-naive, HIV-1-infected patients.

### Switching to darunavir / ritonavir 800 / 100 mg once-daily containing regimen maintains virological control in fully suppressed pre-treated patients infected with HIV-1 [^34138ef1]. Journal of Medical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the switch to once-daily darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg in treatment-experienced patients with suppressed HIV-1 replication on a twice-daily ritonavir-boosted protease-inhibitor (bid PI/r) containing regimen, that is in a setting where genotypic resistance test cannot be performed. In this open label, non-comparative, multicenter study, patients on a bid PI/r-containing triple combination, with suppressed viral replication, were switched to once-daily darunavir/r 800/100 mg containing triple combination. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-RNA < 50 copies/ml 24 weeks after the switch. Intensive darunavir pharmacokinetic evaluation was performed at Week 4 (W4) in 11 patients. Eighty-five patients were enrolled. All had HIV-RNA < 50 copies/ml at screening with a pre-exposure to a median of 2 PI/r (1–5). By intent-to-treat analysis (missing = failure), 78/85 patients (92%, 95% CI [83;96]) maintained an HIV-RNA < 50 copies/ml at W24. Seven patients experienced protocol-defined treatment failure between baseline and W24: Two had confirmed low-level viral rebound, one discontinued study treatment for adverse event, three withdrew their consent, and one was lost to follow-up. By on-treatment analysis, 78/80 patients (97%, 95% CI [91;99]) maintained an HIV-RNA < 50 copies/ml at W24. Results were similar at Week 48. The median area under the darunavir plasma concentration-time curve measured in 11 patients was 61,380 ng hr/ml; darunavir median trough concentration 1,340 ng/ml and darunavir half-life was 12.2 hr. Tolerability of once-daily darunavir/r 800/100 mg was excellent. Optimally suppressed, treatment-experienced patients can switch safely from a twice-daily PI/r regimen to a once-daily darunavir/r 800/100 mg containing regimen.

### Darunavir (Prezista) [^ef68391c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

TMC114-C229

TMC114-C229 is a randomized, open-label trial comparing PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily to PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily in treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients with screening genotype resistance test showing no darunavir resistance associated substitutions (i.e. V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54L, I54M, T74P, L76V, I84V, L89V) and a screening viral load of greater than 1,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL. Both arms used an optimized background regimen consisting of greater than or equal to 2 NRTIs selected by the investigator.

HIV-1-infected subjects who were eligible for this trial were on a highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen (HAART) for at least 12 weeks. Virologic response was defined as a confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load less than 50 copies/mL. Analyses included 590 subjects who had completed 48 weeks of treatment or discontinued earlier.

Table 21 compares the demographic and baseline characteristics between subjects in the PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily arm and subjects in the PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily arm in trial TMC114-C229. No imbalances between the 2 arms were noted.

Week 48 outcomes for subjects on PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily from trial TMC114-C229 are shown in Table 22.

The mean increase from baseline in CD4+ cell counts was comparable for both treatment arms (108 cells/mm3and 112 cells/mm3in the PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily arm and the PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily arm, respectively).

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^8478fcad]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV — darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) frequency of administration: In February 2013, the FDA approved the use of once-daily darunavir (DRV) for treatment-naive children and for treatment-experienced children without DRV resistance–associated mutations, but the Panel generally recommends dosing DRV/r twice daily in children aged ≥ 3 years to < 12 years. The Panel recommends that once-daily DRV/r be used only in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced adolescents weighing ≥ 40 kg who do not have mutations that are associated with DRV resistance. If DRV and ritonavir (RTV) are used once daily in children aged < 12 years, the Panel recommends conducting a pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation of plasma concentrations of DRV and closely monitoring viral load. Population PK modeling and simulation were used to develop recommendations for once-daily dosing in younger pediatric subjects aged ≥ 3 years to < 12 years and weighing 10 kg to < 40 kg, and limited data exist on the efficacy of once-daily DRV/r dosing in children aged < 6 years.

### A week-48 randomized phase-3 trial of darunavir / cobicistat / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide in treatment-naive HIV-1 patients [^f116fddc]. AIDS (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this investigational phase-3, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, the D/C/F/TAF once-daily STR was virologically noninferior to darunavir/cobicistat co-administered with F/TDF in ART-naive patients. Response rates were similar across age, sex, race, and baseline HIV characteristics including CD4 + cell count less than 200 cells/μl and viral load greater than 100 000 copies/ml. Although INSTI-based regimens have rapidly moved up in global treatment guidelines, there are still many patients who might benefit from the established characteristics of the protease inhibitor darunavir, such as high genetic barrier to resistance, efficacy in the face of resistance and uncertain adherence, provider comfort, and experience. Well powered, phase-3, double-blinded, randomized studies provide the most rigorous evidence to drive treatment guidelines. The week-48 virologic response rate (FDA-snapshot analysis) of 91.4% for D/C/F/TAF was among the highest achieved by a STR in phase-3 trials (range 80–93%) of ART-naive patients, and higher than in prior phase-3 trials with darunavir.

### Dolutegravir or darunavir in combination with zidovudine or tenofovir to treat HIV [^213eaac7]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization recommends dolutegravir with two nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) for second-line treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Evidence is limited for the efficacy of this regimen when NRTIs are predicted to lack activity because of drug resistance, as well as for the recommended switch of an NRTI from tenofovir to zidovudine.

Methods

In a two-by-two factorial, open-label, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned patients for whom first-line therapy was failing (HIV-1 viral load, ≥ 1000 copies per milliliter) to receive dolutegravir or ritonavir-boosted darunavir and to receive tenofovir or zidovudine; all patients received lamivudine. The primary outcome was a week 48 viral load of less than 400 copies per milliliter, assessed with the Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm (noninferiority margin for the between-group difference in the percentage of patients with the primary outcome, 12 percentage points).

Results

We enrolled 464 patients at seven sub-Saharan African sites. A week 48 viral load of less than 400 copies per milliliter was observed in 90.2% of the patients in the dolutegravir group (212 of 235) and in 91.7% of those in the darunavir group (210 of 229) (difference, -1.5 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] -6.7 to 3.7; P = 0.58; indicating noninferiority of dolutegravir, without superiority) and in 92.3% of the patients in the tenofovir group (215 of 233) and in 89.6% of those in the zidovudine group (207 of 231) (difference, 2.7 percentage points; 95% CI, -2.6 to 7.9; P = 0.32; indicating noninferiority of tenofovir, without superiority). In the subgroup of patients with no NRTIs that were predicted to have activity, a viral load of less than 400 copies per milliliter was observed in more than 90% of the patients in the dolutegravir group and the darunavir group. The incidence of adverse events did not differ substantially between the groups in either factorial comparison.

Conclusions

Dolutegravir in combination with NRTIs was effective in treating patients with HIV-1 infection, including those with extensive NRTI resistance in whom no NRTIs were predicted to have activity. Tenofovir was noninferior to zidovudine as second-line therapy. (Funded by Janssen; NADIA ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03988452.).

### Once-daily maraviroc versus tenofovir / emtricitabine each combined with darunavir / ritonavir for initial HIV-1 treatment [^008215ea]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of maraviroc along with darunavir/ritonavir, all once daily, for the treatment of antiretroviral-naive HIV-1 infected individuals.

Design

MODERN was a multicentre, double-blind, noninferiority, phase III study in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral-naive adults with plasma HIV-1 RNA at least 1000copies/ml and no evidence of reduced susceptibility to study drugs.

Methods

At screening, participants were randomized 1:1 to undergo either genotypic or phenotypic tropism testing. Participants with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 were randomized 1:1 to receive maraviroc 150mg once daily or tenofovir/emtricitabine once daily each with darunavir/ritonavir once daily for 96 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA less than 50copies/ml (Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm) at Week 48. A substudy evaluated bone mineral density, body fat distribution and serum bone turnover markers.

Results

Seven hundred and ninety-seven participants were dosed (maraviroc, n = 396; tenofovir/emtricitabine, n = 401). The Data Monitoring Committee recommended early study termination due to inferior efficacy in the maraviroc group. At Week 48, the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA less than 50copies/ml was 77.3% for maraviroc and 86.8% for tenofovir/emtricitabine [difference of -9.54% (95% confidence interval: -14.83 to -4.24)]. More maraviroc participants discontinued for lack of efficacy, which was not associated with non-R5 tropism or resistance. Discontinuations for adverse events, Category C events, Grade 3/4 adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were similar between groups.

Conclusion

A once-daily nucleos(t)ide-sparing two-drug regimen of maraviroc and darunavir/ritonavir was inferior to a three-drug regimen of tenofovir/emtricitabine and darunavir/ritonavir in antiretroviral-naive adults.

### Darunavir / cobicistat / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide in a rapid-initiation model of care for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection: primary analysis of the DIAMOND study [^c3de1ee3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2016, only 64% of people living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in the United States received care, 49% were retained in care, and 53% were virologically suppressed. The US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines recommend that certain laboratory testing be performed to help guide initial treatment selection; some (eg, genotypic resistance testing, testing for HLA-B✱5701) may require several days or weeks for results, which may contribute to patient attrition and delayed treatment. In rapid-initiation models of care, therapy is started prior to the availability of baseline laboratory assessments, sometimes on the day of diagnosis. Improved retention, reduced time to virologic suppression, and decreased morbidity and mortality have been observed with this model in low-income countries and select US centers. World Health Organization (WHO) and International Antiviral Society–USA guidelines recommend rapid initiation for the majority of newly diagnosed patients. Although the US DHHS considers this approach investigational, the guidelines recognize the importance of prompt antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation for some patients. Moreover, while US DHHS guidelines recommend an integrase inhibitor (INI)–based regimen as initial ART, in certain clinical situations such as those encountered when rapidly initiating therapy, a boosted protease inhibitor (PI)–based regimen is a recommended option.

As less clinical information is available in a rapid-initiation model of care, it is important to consider a regimen's effectiveness in the setting of possible transmitted resistance, safety profile, and convenience. The potential for adherence is particularly meaningful, as patients newly diagnosed with HIV-1 infection may be hesitant to rapidly begin ART due to concerns regarding the need for lifelong therapy, side effects, and dosing requirements, as well as psychological considerations associated with the diagnosis. An optimal ART regimen for rapid initiation is an abacavir-sparing, single-tablet regimen (STR) that is well tolerated and has a proven high genetic barrier to resistance. No prospective clinical study of rapid initiation with such a regimen has been conducted to date. Furthermore, data on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are lacking in rapid-initiation scenarios.

### Antiretroviral treatment of adult HIV infection: 2012 recommendations of the international antiviral society-USA panel [^d525359e]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context

New trial data and drug regimens that have become available in the last 2 years warrant an update to guidelines for antiretroviral therapy (ART) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults in resource-rich settings.

Objective

To provide current recommendations for the treatment of adult HIV infection with ART and use of laboratory-monitoring tools. Guidelines include when to start therapy and with what drugs, monitoring for response and toxic effects, special considerations in therapy, and managing antiretroviral failure.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

Data that had been published or presented in abstract form at scientific conferences in the past 2 years were systematically searched and reviewed by an International Antiviral Society-USA panel. The panel reviewed available evidence and formed recommendations by full panel consensus.

Data Synthesis

Treatment is recommended for all adults with HIV infection; the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence increase with decreasing CD4 cell count and the presence of certain concurrent conditions. Recommended initial regimens include 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (tenofovir/emtricitabine or abacavir/lamivudine) plus a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (efavirenz), a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (atazanavir or darunavir), or an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (raltegravir). Alternatives in each class are recommended for patients with or at risk of certain concurrent conditions. CD4 cell count and HIV-1 RNA level should be monitored, as should engagement in care, ART adherence, HIV drug resistance, and quality-of-care indicators. Reasons for regimen switching include virologic, immunologic, or clinical failure and drug toxicity or intolerance. Confirmed treatment failure should be addressed promptly and multiple factors considered.

Conclusion

New recommendations for HIV patient care include offering ART to all patients regardless of CD4 cell count, changes in therapeutic options, and modifications in the timing and choice of ART in the setting of opportunistic illnesses such as cryptococcal disease and tuberculosis.

### Efficacy and safety of darunavir / ritonavir at 48 weeks in treatment-naïve, HIV-1-infected adolescents: results from a phase 2 open-label trial (DIONE) [^e03d8826]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Twice-daily darunavir/ritonavir is indicated in treatment-experienced children (≥ 3 years). This study assessed once-daily administration in treatment-naïve adolescents.

Methods

Phase 2, 48-week, open-label, single-arm study evaluating pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of once-daily darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg in treatment-naïve, HIV-1-infected adolescents (≥ 12 to < 18 years, ≥ 40 kg) with zidovudine/lamivudine or abacavir/lamivudine.

Results

Twelve patients (67% female; median 14.4 years) were enrolled. After 24 and 48 weeks, respectively, 11 of 12 (92%) and 10 of 12 (83%) patients achieved viral load < 50 copies/mL (intent-to-treat time-to-loss of virologic response); all had ≥ 1 log10 drop in viral load versus baseline. Median CD4 cell count increased by 175 and 221 cells/mm (intent-to-treat-noncompleter = failure) after 24 and 48 weeks, respectively. Eighty-three percent of patients were adherent to darunavir/ritonavir. One patient was never suppressed and 1 patient rebounded. No patients developed darunavir resistance-associated mutations or lost phenotypic susceptibility to any commercially available protease inhibitor or any background nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Eleven patients (92%) reported ≥ 1 adverse event (AE), considered in 2 patients to be at least possibly related to darunavir (gastrointestinal-related events and dizziness). Four patients had ≥ 1 serious AE. Three patients reported ≥ 1 grade 3/4 AE; no serious or grade 3/4 AEs were considered darunavir related. No patients discontinued because of AEs.

Conclusions

Over 48 weeks, once-daily darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg plus NRTIs was effective and well-tolerated for treatment of HIV-1-infected, antiretroviral-naïve adolescents (≥ 12 to < 18 years). These findings support use of once-daily darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg in this population.

Diminished virologic responses were observed in subjects with 5 or more baseline IAS-defined primary protease inhibitor resistance-associated substitutions (D30N, V32I, L33F, M46I/L, I47A/V, G48V, I50L/V, I54L/M, L76V, V82A/F/L/S/T, I84V, N88S, L90M) (see Table 17).

IAS Primary PI Substitutions (2008): D30N, V32I, L33F, M46I/L, I47A/V, G48V, I50L/V, I54L/M, L76V, V82A/F/L/S/T, I84V, N88S, L90M

The presence at baseline of two or more of the substitutions V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54L or M, T74P, L76V, I84V or L89V was associated with a decreased virologic response to darunavir/ritonavir. In subjects not taking enfuvirtide de novo, the proportion of subjects achieving viral load less than 50 plasma HIV-1 RNA copies/mL at 96 weeks was 59%, 29%, and 12% when the baseline genotype had 0–1, 2 and greater than or equal to 3 of these substitutions, respectively.

Baseline darunavir phenotype (shift in susceptibility relative to reference) was shown to be a predictive factor of virologic outcome. Response rates assessed by baseline darunavir phenotype are shown in Table 18. These baseline phenotype groups are based on the select patient populations in the trials TMC114-C213, TMC114-C202, and TMC114-C215, and are not meant to represent definitive clinical susceptibility breakpoints for darunavir/ritonavir. The data are provided to give clinicians information on the likelihood of virologic success based on pre-treatment susceptibility to darunavir.

Darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) once-daily in children aged 6 to 12 years — A small study "involved 12 treatment-experienced children aged 6 to 12 years" receiving once-daily DRV/r with abacavir and lamivudine, and "participants had maintained HIV plasma viral loads < 50 copies/mL for at least 6 months prior to beginning this regimen". Weight-based doses were "600 mg/100 mg for patients weighing 15 to 30 kg, 675 mg/100 mg for patients weighing 30 to 40 kg, and 800 mg/100 mg for patients weighing > 40 kg". The "geometric mean AUC0-24h was below the study target of 80% of the value seen in adults (63.1 mg·h/L)", yet "trough values that were observed at 23.1 hours to 25.1 hours after the previous dose exceeded the trough plasma concentration recommended for treatment-experienced adults (0.55 mg/L)". One child developed "neuropsychiatric symptoms (anxiety and hallucinations)" and "the AUC0-24h was 47.8 mg·h/L".

### Characterization of virologic failure patients on darunavir / ritonavir in treatment-experienced patients [^83d053b6]. AIDS (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Characterization of resistance development in virologic failure patients on the protease inhibitor darunavir administered with low-dose ritonavir (DRV/r) in the 48-week analysis of TMC114/r In Treatment-experienced pAtients Naive to lopinavir (TITAN).

Design

TITAN is a randomized, controlled, open-label, phase III, noninferiority trial comparing the efficacy and safety of DRV/r with that of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in HIV-1-infected, treatment-experienced, LPV-naive patients. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies/ml at week 48.

Methods

Patients received DRV/r 600/100 mg twice daily (n = 298) or LPV/r 400/100 mg twice daily (n = 297), and an optimized background regimen. Patients who lost or never achieved HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies/ml after week 16 were considered virologic failure patients. Genotyping and phenotyping were performed.

Results

The virologic failure rate in the DRV/r arm (10%, n = 31) was lower than in the LPV/r arm (22%, n = 65). Furthermore, fewer virologic failure patients in the DRV/r arm than in the LPV/r arm developed primary protease inhibitor mutations (6 vs. 20) or nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance-associated mutations (4 vs. 15). In addition, fewer virologic failure patients on DRV/r than on LPV/r lost susceptibility to the protease inhibitor (3 vs. 13) or nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor(s) (3 vs. 14) used in the treatment regimen or to other protease inhibitors. Most DRV/r-treated virologic failure patients retained susceptibility to all protease inhibitors.

Conclusion

In treatment-experienced, LPV-naive patients, the overall virologic failure rate in the DRV/r arm was low and was associated with limited resistance development. These findings showed that the use of DRV/r in earlier lines of treatment was less likely to lead to cross-resistance to other protease inhibitors compared with LPV/r.

### Pattern and impact of emerging resistance mutations in treatment experienced patients failing darunavir-containing regimen [^0517de56]. AIDS (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Ritonavir-boosted darunavir (DRV/r) has proven potent efficacy when used in heavily pretreated patients, harboring protease inhibitor-associated resistance mutations. Limited data are available on resistance pattern emerging in patients failing DRV/r and on subsequent remaining protease inhibitor options.

Methods

Analysis of baseline and failure resistance genotypes were performed in patients experiencing virologic failure (> 200 copies/ml) after at least 3 months on a DRV/r (600/100 mg twice daily)-containing regimen.

Results

Twenty-five highly protease inhibitor-experienced patients were included. Baseline median human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA was 5 log10 copies/ml and number of total-protease inhibitor, major-protease inhibitor and DRV-associated-resistance mutations was 13, 4 and 3, respectively. Median viral replication duration on DRV/r selective pressure was 34 weeks. Emergence of DRV-associated-resistance mutations was observed in 72% (18/25) of patients, at codons L89I/M/V (32%), V32I (28%), V11I (20%), I47V/A (20%), I54L/M (20%), L33F/I (16%) and I50V (16%). A high risk of DRV resistance was observed in patients with 2 and 3 baseline DRV-associated-resistance mutations and in patients with more than 24 weeks of ongoing viral replication. According to 2007 ANRS algorithm, isolates classified as susceptible to ritonavir-boosted tipranavir decreased from baseline to failure from 76 to 60% and susceptible to DRV/r from 32 to 12%.

Conclusion

Emerging mutations observed after DRV/r failure were those already described to impact the DRV efficacy. Our study provided recommendations to firstly, reconsider lowering the cutoff number of DRV mutations to two; secondly, avoid keeping patients on a DRV-failing regimen for more than 24 weeks and thirdly, to examine the efficacy of using tipranavir after DRV failure.

7.1 Potential for Darunavir/ritonavir to Affect Other Drugs

Darunavir co-administered with ritonavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A, CYP2D6, and P-gp. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2D6 or are transported by P-gp may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse events. Darunavir co-administered with ritonavir with drugs that have active metabolite(s) formed by CYP3A may result in reduced plasma concentrations of these active metabolite(s), potentially leading to loss of their therapeutic effect (see Table 10).

7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Darunavir

Darunavir and ritonavir are metabolized by CYP3A. In vitro data indicate that darunavir may be a P-gp substrate. Drugs that induce CYP3A activity would be expected to increase the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir, resulting in lowered plasma concentrations of darunavir and ritonavir. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and other drugs that inhibit CYP3A, or P-gp may decrease the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir and may result in increased plasma concentrations of darunavir and ritonavir (see Table 10).

7.3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions

Table 10 provides dosing recommendations as a result of drug interactions with darunavir/ritonavir. These recommendations are based on either drug interaction studies or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse events or loss of efficacy. The table includes examples of potentially significant interactions but is not all inclusive [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)],)], and therefore the label of each drug that is co-administered with darunavir/ritonavir should be consulted for information related to the route of metabolism, interaction pathways, potential risks, and specific actions to be taken with regard to co-administration.

Participant Disposition

Overall, 97 (89%) participants completed the study and 12 (11%) discontinued by week 48 (see Table 3 for reasons). No participants discontinued due to protocol-defined resistance stopping rules. Among participants with early discontinuation who completed a retention assessment, 6 of 7 (86%) remained engaged in care. Three of 5 participants with confirmed transaminase elevations ≥ 2.5 times the upper limit of normal at the screening/baseline visit, prior to starting D/C/F/TAF, discontinued due to safety stopping criteria. The remaining 2 participants continued based on the investigator's clinical assessment and agreement of the sponsor. Aminotransferase levels appeared to normalize while either receiving up to 16 days of treatment with D/C/F/TAF (for those who discontinued the study) or continuing D/C/F/TAF through the study period (see Supplementary Table 2 for clinical summaries).

Table 3.
Participant Disposition Through Week 48

Efficacy

At week 48, 92 of 109 (84%) participants achieved HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL (FDA snapshot [ITT]); 9 (8%) participants had HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL (including 5 who discontinued early due to other reasons; the remaining 4 participants had HIV-1 RNA < 200 copies/mL), and 8 (7%) participants did not have viral load (VL) data in the week 48 window (Figure 1A). No participants discontinued due to lack of efficacy or developed PDVF. Both participants with M184V/I mutations at screening/baseline achieved HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL by week 4; thereafter, 1 participant discontinued early as a result of switching ART regimen (due to D/C/F/TAF food requirements) and the other participant had a VL that remained undetectable through week 48.

### Efficacy of darunavir / ritonavir maintenance monotherapy in patients with HIV-1 viral suppression: a randomized open-label, noninferiority trial, MONOI-ANRS 136 [^a6b3eadf]. AIDS (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Darunavir/ritonavir (darunavir/r) maintenance strategy, in patients with suppressed HIV RNA viremia, is a potential long-term strategy to avoid nucleoside analogue toxicities and to reduce costs.

Methods

MONOtherapy Inhibitor protease is a prospective, open-label, noninferiority, 96-week safety and efficacy trial in virologically suppressed patients on triple therapy who were randomized to a darunavir/r triple drug regimen or darunavir/r monotherapy. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with HIV RNA less than 400 copies/ml at week 48; treatment failure was defined as two consecutive HIV RNA more than 400 copies/ml (time to loss of virologic response) or any change in treatment. The trial had 80% power to show noninferiority for the monotherapy arm (delta = -10%, 90% confidence interval).

Results

A total of 242 patients were screened, 225 of whom were randomized. In the per protocol efficacy analysis, treatment success was 99% on darunavir/r triple drug versus 94% on darunavir/r monotherapy (delta = -4.9%, 90% confidence interval, from -9.1 to -0.8). Similar results were found in intent-to-treat population (92 versus 87.5%, delta = -4.5%, 90% confidence interval from -11.2 to 2.1). Three patients experienced virologic failure on darunavir/monotherapy and none on darunavir/r triple drug. No resistance to protease inhibitor emerged in patients with plasma viral load above 50 copies/ml. The two groups did not differ in the number of serious adverse events.

Conclusion

Darunavir/r monotherapy exhibited efficacy rate over 85% with concordant results in the magnitude of difference with darunavir/r triple drug regimen in both intent-to-treat and per protocol analyses, but discordant conclusions with respect to the noninferiority margin. Patients failing on darunavir/r monotherapy had no emergence of new darunavir resistance mutations preserving future treatment options.

Materials and methods

Study design and population

MODERN was designed as a 96-week, multicentre, international, double-blind, randomized, comparative, phase III study conducted between September 2011 and January 2014 at 138 sites in Europe, the United States, Australia and Canada (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01345630). It was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and all local regulatory requirements were followed. The protocol was approved by institutional review boards/independent ethics committees at all sites and written informed consent was provided by all individuals. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) reviewed the data every 4 months with a formal interim analysis for futility when nearly 50% of individuals reached Week 24. Participants were antiretroviral-naive, HIV-1 infected, at least 18 years old and had HIV-1 RNA at least 1000 copies/ml, R5 HIV-1, no evidence of active hepatitis B virus infection and no resistance to DRV/r, TDF or FTC. As the study was also designed to prospectively compare genotypic versus phenotypic tropism testing results to predict response to MVC, all participants were initially randomized to undergo tropism testing with one of two assays [a genotypic tropism test (GTT) (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Berkeley, California, USA), or the phenotypic Trofile test from Monogram Biosciences (South San Francisco, California, USA)]. Participants identified as having R5 virus were then randomized to treatment with MVC (150 mg q.d.) or TDF/FTC (300/200 mg q.d.) both combined with DRV/r (800/100 mg q.d.) and stratified by screening plasma HIV-1 RNA (≥ or < 100 000 copies/ml).

Acquisition of HIV during or after CAB-LA as PrEP — while awaiting integrase genotype results, the use of an INSTI-based regimen is not recommended (AIII). The recommended regimen, until resistance testing confirms the absence of INSTI-resistance mutations, is a cobicistat (COBI)- or ritonavir (RTV)-boosted darunavir (DRV) with (TAF or TDF) plus (FTC or 3TC) (AIII). A pharmacologically boosted protease inhibitor (PI)–based regimen is an option because resistance to PIs emerges slowly and clinically significant transmitted resistance to PIs is uncommon; therefore, boosted DRV plus (TAF or TDF) plus (FTC or 3TC) is generally recommended in this setting.

A limitation of this study is that participants were motivated to start ART and had access to clinical trial–related services (eg, transportation, no-cost ART). Additional work is needed to better understand and mitigate systemic barriers to treatment faced by patients in clinical experience. Notably, while overall retention in DIAMOND was high, participants who started treatment within 24–48 hours of enrollment were more likely than those who started later to be retained in care. Additional study limitations that limit generalizability include the nonrandomized, noncomparative design; variations in treatment implementation by study site; that the number of patients unwilling to participate could not be quantified; and the exclusion of patients with certain AIDS-related conditions and the small proportion of women who enrolled.

In DIAMOND, 12 weeks after rapid initiation of D/C/F/TAF, a majority of participants with available data (> 80%) achieved HIV-1 RNA < 200 copies/mL, a threshold recognized by multiple organizations, such as the Prevention Access Campaign's "Undetectable = Untransmittable" and the US DHHS, as the threshold at which patients are unable to transmit HIV to uninfected sexual partners. Moreover, as an STR, D/C/F/TAF may improve treatment adherence, a critical component of maintaining viral suppression and reducing transmission. Taken together, the efficacy, safety, and PRO results from DIAMOND support D/C/F/TAF as a recommended regimen for rapid initiation in most treatment guidelines.

### Interactions of antiretroviral drugs with food, beverages, dietary supplements, and alcohol: a systematic review and meta-analyses [^fe970da9]. AIDS and Behavior (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Introducing combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) to the management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection not only did significantly reduce morbidity and mortality rates but also improved the quality of patients' life. However, multiple factors may alter the effectiveness and safety of antiretroviral treatment, e.g. potential cumulative toxicity, suboptimal patients' adherence, drug-induced resistance, autoinduction, and inter-individual or inter-ethnical variability in drug response.

cART does not eradicate HIV, hence lifelong antiretroviral therapy is necessary. Newer classes of antiretroviral agents are better tolerated by patients with temporary gastrointestinal discomfort and fatigue as the most commonly reported side effects.

Nevertheless, chronic HIV treatment and aging may both contribute to the greater risk of metabolic disorders (e.g. dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus), cardiovascular diseases, hepatotoxicity, and renal impairment in people living with HIV (PLWH). Both temporary and prolonged adverse effects may entail therapy discontinuation and patients' poor adherence.

The causes of poor adherence to cART are diverse: starting from the individual (such as forgetting, depression, alcohol misuse), through treatment-related (e.g. the complexity of dosing regimen, side effects), ending with health-service barriers (such as poor patient-physician relationship, distance to the clinic). Prolonged suboptimal adherence to the cART may result in disease progression, a higher plasma viral load (that implies the increased risk of HIV transmission), and the development of drug-resistant HIV strains.

There are to main types of HIV drug resistance: pretreatment or acquired. Pretreatment HIV drug resistance occurs approximately in 10 percent of PLWH receiving initial treatment and its prevalence is the highest in low- and middle-income countries. Acquired HIV drug resistance develops during the virus replication in the systemic presence of antiretroviral medications. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) global report from 2019, the levels of resistance to commonly used nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) may range from 21 to 91% and from 50 to 97%, respectively. Medications like dolutegravir, lopinavir, or darunavir are characterized by higher genetic barriers to drug resistance.

### Pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of maraviroc in treatment-experienced pediatric patients infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 [^faa5219e]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Study A4001031 was designed to evaluate the PK in pediatric patients (≥ 2 to < 18 years of age), allow for dosing recommendations and assess the safety of maraviroc in this population. Efficacy was a secondary endpoint, as the course of HIV infection and the effects of ARV drugs are considered sufficiently similar in pediatric and adult patients to allow for extrapolation of efficacy data.

The BSA-based dosing strategy utilized in study A4001031 achieved similar concentrations to those observed in adults receiving recommended BID doses of maraviroc, using both tablet and oral solution formulations. Forty-nine of 50 participants entering Stage 2 from Stage 1 achieved the target C avg of ≥ 100 ng/mL, which was associated with near-maximal efficacy in TE adults in the MOTIVATE studies. The range of exposures achieved in the pediatric patients in this study fell within the ranges seen in adults receiving similar background therapies, supporting the bridging between adult and pediatric populations.

Evaluation of safety data through Week 48 demonstrated that maraviroc treatment in combination with other ARVs was generally well tolerated in these pediatric patients with a safety profile comparable to that in adults. Overall, the results raise no new safety concerns specific to the pediatric population and, together with the well-established safety profile in adults, support the safety of maraviroc treatment (using oral solution or tablets) as part of combination ARV treatment in HIV-1–infected children.

As this was a noncomparative study where maraviroc was administered in combination with an OBT regimen containing at least 3 other ARVs, it was not designed to evaluate efficacy. However, the virologic and immunologic efficacy, as well as mechanisms of viral escape, were similar to that seen in adult patients in the MOTIVATE studies. Lack of response appeared to be primarily driven by poor or erratic adherence, consistent with observations in other studies. The lower response rate in the adolescent patients is similar to what was observed in the DELPHI study with darunavir. This is not unexpected given that older children have generally been infected with HIV for a longer time and are therefore likely to have been treated for longer with a higher likelihood of archived resistance mutations. Furthermore, adherence to ARVs has been identified as a key concern in the adolescent population.

Resistance testing may be helpful in identifying drug-resistance mutations, even if the person has been off ART; keep in mind that resistance mutations may not be detected in the absence of drug pressure. Consider restarting the old regimen with careful monitoring of virologic response and early resistance testing if inadequate virologic suppression. If no ARV history is available, consider initiating a regimen with drugs with high genetic barriers to resistance (e.g., dolutegravir [DTG], bictegravir [BIC], and/or boosted darunavir [DRV]) with careful monitoring of virologic response and early resistance testing, if inadequate suppression. Goal: resuppression.

Atorvastatin — interactions with protease inhibitors (PIs) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) — Use the lowest starting dose and titrate with safety monitoring because risk for myopathy/rhabdomyolysis can be increased with some PIs; do not coadminister with atazanavir/cobicistat; the maximum dose of atorvastatin is 20 mg with darunavir/cobicistat or darunavir + ritonavir. With NNRTIs, acceptable with appropriate dosing and monitoring; there are no data for nevirapine and a higher atorvastatin starting dose may be needed, and doravirine does not affect levels of atorvastatin.

### Efficacy and safety of once-daily ritonavir-boosted darunavir and abacavir / lamivudine for treatment-naïve patients: a pilot study [^4f277bda]. AIDS (2012). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of once-daily darunavir/ritonavir and fixed-dose abacavir/lamivudine was examined in 22 treatment-naïve patients with HIV-1 infection. Three patients discontinued antiretroviral therapy due to mild adverse events. Among 18 patients who continued therapy, 66.7% had viral load less than 50 copies/ml at week 48. Only two patients experienced virologic failure with the emergence of resistant virus. This pilot study demonstrated the viral efficacy and safety of darunavir/ritonavir and abacavir/lamivudine.

### Key amprenavir resistance mutations counteract dramatic efficacy of darunavir in highly experienced patients [^aad8704e]. AIDS (2007). Low credibility.

In highly experienced HIV-1-infected patients, a ritonavir-boosted darunavir-containing regimen was associated with dramatic immunological and virological efficacy. Patients harbouring viruses with amprenavir-specific resistance profiles, such as I50V or V32I + I47V, failed on a darunavir/ritonavir-containing regimen. These key amprenavir mutations were also selected at the time of failure, suggesting their impact on darunavir efficacy.

### HIV / AIDS: the management of treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients: new drugs and drug combinations [^89c18345]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The recent availability of new antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has increased treatment options and has improved the durability, tolerability, and long-term efficacy of antiretroviral therapy, even among patients with extensive treatment experience and high levels of drug resistance. This expansion of therapeutic options has led to a revision of current treatment guidelines, which now state that the goal of antiretroviral therapy in all patients is suppression of the plasma HIV RNA level to < 50 copies/mL. Successful management of infection for treatment-experienced patients with the new agents requires an understanding of their pharmacology and resistance patterns and the appropriate use of laboratory testing to optimize regimen selection. This review discusses the use of recently approved antiretroviral agents in the management of HIV infection in treatment-experienced patients.

### Antiretroviral drug resistance testing in adult HIV-1 infection: 2008 recommendations of an International Aids Society-USA panel [^50e7471c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Resistance to antiretroviral drugs remains an important limitation to successful human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) therapy. Resistance testing can improve treatment outcomes for infected individuals. The availability of new drugs from various classes, standardization of resistance assays, and the development of viral tropism tests necessitate new guidelines for resistance testing. The International AIDS Society-USA convened a panel of physicians and scientists with expertise in drug-resistant HIV-1, drug management, and patient care to review recently published data and presentations at scientific conferences and to provide updated recommendations. Whenever possible, resistance testing is recommended at the time of HIV infection diagnosis as part of the initial comprehensive patient assessment, as well as in all cases of virologic failure. Tropism testing is recommended whenever the use of chemokine receptor 5 antagonists is contemplated. As the roll out of antiretroviral therapy continues in developing countries, drug resistance monitoring for both subtype B and non-subtype B strains of HIV will become increasingly important.

### Antiretroviral drug resistance testing in adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1: 2003 recommendations of an International Aids Society-USA panel [^7840251f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

New information about the benefits and limitations of testing for resistance to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) drugs has emerged. The International AIDS Society-USA convened a panel of physicians and scientists with expertise in antiretroviral drug management, HIV-1 drug resistance, and patient care to provide updated recommendations for HIV-1 resistance testing. Published data and presentations at scientific conferences, as well as strength of the evidence, were considered. Properly used resistance testing can improve virological outcome among HIV-infected individuals. Resistance testing is recommended in cases of acute or recent HIV infection, for certain patients who have been infected as long as 2 years or more prior to initiating therapy, in cases of antiretroviral failure, and during pregnancy. Limitations of resistance testing remain, and more study is needed to refine optimal use and interpretation.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^7e86c461]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV-2 infection — key considerations and recommendations emphasize that the clinical course is generally characterized by a longer asymptomatic stage, lower plasma viral loads, and lower mortality rate than HIV-1 infection, yet without treatment, the majority of individuals with HIV-2 will progress to AIDS and death; no randomized controlled trials define optimal timing or regimens, but existing data suggest that antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be started at or soon after HIV-2 diagnosis to prevent disease progression and transmission of HIV-2 to others (AIII), and quantitative plasma HIV-2 RNA viral load testing for clinical care is available and should be performed before initiating ART (AIII). For ART-naive patients with HIV-2 mono-infection or HIV-1/HIV-2 coinfection, antiretroviral (ARV) regimens should include an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (AII), with a recommended alternative of a boosted protease inhibitor (PI) active against HIV-2 (darunavir or lopinavir) plus two NRTIs (BII). Because HIV-2 is intrinsically resistant to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), NNRTI-based regimens, including long-acting injectable rilpivirine (given with the INSTI cabotegravir), are not recommended for treatment of HIV-2 (AIII). In hepatitis B virus (HBV)/HIV-2 coinfection, ART should contain drugs with activity against both HIV-2 and HBV (AIII). Treatment response should be assessed using HIV-2 RNA, CD4 T lymphocyte cell counts, and clinical status (AIII), and people with HIV-2 should continue periodic CD4 testing even with persistently suppressed viral loads because disease progression can occur despite an undetectable viral load (AIII). Resistance-associated viral mutations to INSTIs, PIs, or NRTIs may develop while on ART, but no validated HIV-2 genotypic or phenotypic antiretroviral resistance assays are approved for clinical use; in the event of virologic, immunologic, or clinical failure, a new ARV regimen should be constructed in consultation with an expert in HIV-2 management. In vitro studies demonstrate that HIV-2 is intrinsically resistant to enfuvirtide and limited data also show intrinsic resistance to fostemsavir; therefore, these drugs are not recommended for people with HIV-2 (AIII). For multidrug-resistant virus, ibalizumab and lenacapavir demonstrate in vitro potency against HIV-2 and may be considered (BIII).

Genotypic and phenotypic-resistance assays — practice recommendations and ratings state: "All prior and current drug-resistance test results, when available, should be reviewed and considered when constructing a new regimen (AIII)". Additionally, "When the use of a CCR5 antagonist is being considered, a co-receptor tropism assay should be performed (AI)". Rating categories are defined as "Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Weak" and "Rating of Evidence: I = Data from randomized controlled trials; II = Data from well-designed nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; III = Expert opinion".

Boosted protease inhibitor (PI) plus lamivudine (3TC) — as a 2-drug optimization option — "is a reasonable 2-drug optimization option in individuals without resistance who are suppressed on a current regimen and who do not have active HBV infection". Pill burden and potential drug interactions are limitations compared to the above 2-drug regimens. Effective clinical-trial regimens include darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) (BI), darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c) (BIII), atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) (CI), and LPV/r (CI). For active HBV infection, individuals need to be on a potent HBV drug with a high barrier to resistance (i.e. TAF, TDF, or entecavir), and 3TC or FTC monotherapy is not considered standard of care for HBV treatment because of a high risk of emerging resistance.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^87c50a39]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Adults and Adolescents With HIV — designing a new regimen after virologic failure — notes that when designing a new antiretroviral (ARV) regimen for a person with virologic failure, it is important to consider the factors outlined above and, if possible, consider better tolerated and adherence-friendly regimens. A new ARV regimen should be selected based on antiretroviral therapy (ART) history, current and previous drug-resistance test results, and whether a fully susceptible ARV drug with a high barrier to resistance and other fully active drugs are available. ARV drugs with a high barrier to resistance include boosted darunavir (DRV), dolutegravir (DTG), and bictegravir (BIC), and fully active drugs may include drugs in classes for which the person has not previously selected for drug-resistant virus.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

EVOTAZ is a two-drug combination of atazanavir, a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) protease inhibitor, and cobicistat, a CYP3A inhibitor indicated for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV‑1 infection in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg. (1)

Limitations of Use

Use of EVOTAZ in treatment-experienced patients should be guided by the number of baseline primary protease inhibitor resistance substitutions. (1)

1.1 Indications

EVOTAZ®is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in the following populations [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]:

Adult patients
Pediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg.

1.2 Limitations of Use

Use of EVOTAZ in treatment-experienced patients should be guided by the number of baseline primary protease inhibitor resistance substitutions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].

### Clinical implications of genotypic resistance to the newer antiretroviral drugs in HIV-1-infected patients with virological failure [^8a12b8f6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Virological suppression rates achieved with the new antiretroviral drugs in patients with virological failure and resistance to multiple drug classes are nearly matching the rates seen in treatment-naive patients. Knowledge of cross-resistance patterns to drugs of the same class is key for successful use of etravirine, tipranavir, and darunavir in treatment-experienced patients. Determination of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) tropism is cardinal for maraviroc. The impressive potency of raltegravir must not preclude its use with other active drugs because of its limited genetic barrier. These new agents have demonstrated superiority in virtually all efficacy parameters in their pivotal salvage trials, but comparative data between them are still very scarce. This review discusses the clinical implication of resistance to these new drugs. Specific genotypic resistance scores have been developed for tipranavir and etravirine, and mutations conferring resistance to darunavir are well understood. Determining the most active drugs and successfully combining them is the key challenge in salvage regimens.

14.2 Clinical Trial Results in Virologically-Suppressed Subjects with HIV-1 Infection Who Switched to SYMTUZA

Phase 3 trial TMC114IFD3013 [NCT02269917, (EMERALD)] evaluated the efficacy of SYMTUZA in virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL) subjects with HIV-1 infection. Subjects were virologically suppressed for at least 2 months and no more than once had a viral load elevation above 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL during the year prior to enrollment. Subjects were on a stable antiretroviral regimen (for at least 6 months), consisting of a bPI [either darunavir once daily or atazanavir (both boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat), or lopinavir with ritonavir] combined with emtricitabine and TDF. Subjects had no history of failure on darunavir treatment and no known or suspected darunavir resistance-associated substitutions. Emtricitabine or tenofovir resistance-associated substitutions were not specifically excluded by the protocol. They either switched to SYMTUZA (N = 763) or continued their treatment regimen (N = 378) (randomized 2:1). Subjects had a median age of 46 years (range 19–78), 82% were male, 75% White, 21% Black, and 2% Asian. The median baseline CD4+ cell count was 628 cells/mm3(range 111–1921 cells/mm3). Overall, 15% (N = 169) of subjects had prior virologic failure. Five subjects had archived tenofovir resistance-associated substitutions and 53 subjects had archived emtricitabine resistance-associated substitutions, mainly at RT position M184. All of these subjects with emtricitabine resistance-associated substitutions had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48 (N = 50) or at the last on-treatment viral load (N = 3). Virologic outcomes are presented in Table 12. Prior virologic failure did not impact treatment outcomes.

The mean increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Week 48 was 20 cells/mm3in subjects who switched to SYMTUZA and 8 cells/mm3in subjects who stayed on their baseline PI + FTC/TDF.

### Darunavir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (Symtuza) [^500893c4]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Trials

Darunavir resistance-associated substitutions (V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54L or M, T74P, L76V, I84V, and L89V) in HIV-1 protease were derived from clinical trial data of antiretroviral therapy experienced patients, which were all protease inhibitor-experienced patients. Baseline International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA)-defined PI resistance substitutions confer reduced virologic response to darunavir.

In the AMBER clinical trial of subjects with no prior antiretroviral treatment history, there were 7 subjects with protocol-defined virologic failure and with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL at failure or later timepoints who had post-baseline resistance data in the SYMTUZA arm. None of the subjects had detectable emergent darunavir resistance-associated substitutions or other primary protease inhibitor resistance-associated substitutions and only one subject had emergent M184M/I/V, which confers resistance to emtricitabine and lamivudine. In the comparative PREZCOBIX + emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate arm, there were 2 protocol-defined virologic failures with post-baseline resistance data and neither had detectable resistance emergence.

In the EMERALD clinical trial of virologically-suppressed subjects who switched to SYMTUZA, 1 subject who rebounded and 2 subjects who discontinued early from the study had post-baseline resistance genotypes. None of the subjects had darunavir, primary protease inhibitor, emtricitabine, or tenofovir resistance-associated substitutions. In the control arm, there were 3 subjects who rebounded with post-baseline genotypes and no resistance-associated substitutions were observed.
