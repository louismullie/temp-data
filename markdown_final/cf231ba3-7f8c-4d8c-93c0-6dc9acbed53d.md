## Question

What is the recommended timing for repeating troponin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to repeat troponin and how to apply the ESC 0h/1h and 0h/2h algorithms, including when to extend to 3 hours and how symptom onset timing or special scenarios modify this strategy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context, specifically whether this is suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) versus a chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) presentation. Then, I should verify the precise ESC-endorsed serial testing intervals and laboratory turnaround requirements. Next, I need to check what to do when initial results are inconclusive and how early versus late presenters influence repeat timing. After that, I will consider the added value of serial testing for risk stratification, biological variability implications, and special populations like CKD or very high initial troponin. Finally, I will summarize the practical timing recommendations and caveats to ensure safe application at the bedside.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because this drives the algorithm choice: if the presentation suggests ACS (e.g., ischemic symptoms, dynamic ECG changes), we move promptly into an accelerated hs-cTn pathway, whereas CCS patients without ACS features do not need emergent serial troponin testing; however, if CCS patients exhibit concerning features suggestive of ACS, they should be referred urgently to emergency care and undergo repeated hs-cTn testing as part of an ACS pathway, integrated with ECG and clinical assessment to avoid misclassification of STEMI or very high-risk NSTE-ACS where management should not wait on biomarker serials [^111MoUaa] [^113fb6dS].

> I will now examine the core ESC algorithms for suspected NSTE-ACS: draw hs-cTn at presentation (0 hour) and repeat at 1 hour as the preferred approach, or at 2 hours as an alternative when the 1-hour pathway is not feasible; critically, I need to ensure that results are available within about 60 minutes of sampling so that clinical decisions can be made in real time, and I should verify the assay-specific cutoffs and delta criteria used locally because thresholds are platform dependent [^111QnpBh] [^11231327] [^115wc2F7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions if the first two measurements neither clearly rule in nor rule out NSTEMI; in that case, I should obtain an additional hs-cTn measurement at 3 hours from presentation if no alternative explanation has emerged, and wait, let me verify the timing nuance here — it's 3 hours from initial presentation, not 3 hours after the second draw, which I almost misstated earlier, so I should correct that to align with the ESC guidance [^114DjxHW] [^1125VYuT].

> Next, I should review symptom-onset timing because early presenters often need more caution: in those presenting within 3 hours of symptom onset, single-sample rule-out strategies are less reliable due to rising kinetics not yet captured, so serial testing at 1–2 hours is essential and clinicians should be cautious with limit-of-detection thresholds, particularly noting assay-specific performance differences between hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT in very early presenters [^115M3h69] [^111en2fF].

> But wait, what if the patient is a late presenter beyond 3 hours from symptom onset; in that scenario, a single very low hs-cTn at presentation coupled with an unremarkable ECG and consistent clinical assessment can safely exclude MI in many patients, although I should confirm that the local rule-out threshold and assay performance support this approach and be prepared to perform serial testing if clinical suspicion remains or values are not very low [^113Dfs9P] [^115M3h69] [^1137jsXo].

> I need to ensure I appreciate the broader value of serial testing beyond a binary diagnosis: dynamic rise and/or fall patterns increase specificity for type 1 MI compared with isolated elevations, while recognizing that large rule-in thresholds alone have limited positive predictive value at presentation and that serial change helps distinguish infarction from nonischemic myocardial injury; moreover, two elevated hs-cTn concentrations with a substantive rise identify patients at highest short-term mortality risk, informing triage and treatment intensity [^115RRzAg] [^112hUUQh].

> Let me consider biological variability because it influences how much time and delta I need to see a meaningful change: short-interval samples can show small fluctuations within biological noise, so I should interpret deltas against reference change values, with data suggesting that substantial short-term percentage changes are often required to exceed variability, reinforcing why properly spaced serials and assay-validated delta criteria matter for decision-making [^112ZyEw4].

> I should confirm special situations and caveats: if the initial hs-cTn is markedly elevated, for example more than 20 times the sex-specific 99th percentile with compatible symptoms, the PPV for NSTEMI exceeds 90% and repeating troponin may not be necessary to make the diagnosis; conversely, in CKD or ESRD, elevations may be chronic and interpretation is challenging, so while timing of repeats remains the same, I must rely more heavily on dynamic change, clinical context, and ECG rather than absolute values; finally, I need to double-check assay-specific recommendations because hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT platforms differ in analytical characteristics and recommended thresholds, which can subtly affect timing and delta interpretation though not the overall 0h/1h or 0h/2h framework [^1115aVg1] [^115DMcyC] [^111en2fF].

> Wait, let me verify operational constraints because they can derail a good algorithm: the ESC pathway assumes rapid analytical turnaround with results available within 60 minutes to support 1-hour retesting, and while emerging point-of-care high-sensitivity platforms may help meet these timelines, I need to check local validation and quality controls before substituting them, keeping the same serial timing principles for early presenters and for borderline results [^115wc2F7] [^1161jJyc] [^116Yfvff].

> Hmm, wait a minute, to synthesize this into practical timing: for suspected NSTE-ACS, obtain hs-cTn at 0 hour and repeat at 1 hour when possible or 2 hours as an alternative, and if those two samples are inconclusive, extend testing to 3 hours from presentation; ensure especially in early presenters that serial sampling is performed because single-sample strategies can miss evolving injury, whereas in late presenters with very low initial hs-cTn and low clinical suspicion, a single measurement may suffice, all while integrating ECG and clinical risk to avoid delaying urgent reperfusion in STEMI or very-high-risk NSTE-ACS [^111QnpBh] [^114DjxHW] [^113fb6dS].

Recheck troponin at **0/1-hour or 0/2-hour intervals** for suspected NSTEMI using high-sensitivity assays, as per ESC 2023 guidelines [^111QnpBh] [^11231327]. If initial results are inconclusive [^114DjxHW], **repeat at 3 hours**. For **early presenters (< 3 hours)** from symptom onset, **always perform serial testing** due to possible delayed troponin rise [^115M3h69]. In STEMI, **do not delay reperfusion** [^113fb6dS] for troponin testing; in non-ACS myocardial injury, use serial testing to assess rise/fall and guide management [^112sZCCV]. For chronic coronary syndromes, repeat troponin **only if clinical or ECG features** suggest ACS [^111MoUaa].

## Recommended timing for troponin rechecking

### Initial measurement

Obtain the initial measurement **immediately at presentation**, with results available **within 60 minutes** [^115wc2F7].

---

### Serial measurements for suspected NSTEMI

Use serial hs-cTn [^111QnpBh] at **0 and 1 hour or 0 and 2 hours** [^11231327] to rule in or rule out NSTEMI. If results from the 0/1-hour or 0/2-hour algorithms are inconclusive, **repeat at 3 hours** [^1125VYuT].

---

### Early presenters (< 3 hours from symptom onset)

For patients presenting within 3 hours of symptom onset, **always perform serial testing** because troponin rise may be delayed [^115M3h69]. This serial sampling accounts for delayed biomarker release in early presenters [^111en2fF].

---

### STEMI

Do not delay **reperfusion** for troponin testing [^113fb6dS]. Obtain a baseline troponin before PCI if feasible; do not delay treatment [^111Bz72S].

---

### Non-ACS myocardial injury

Use **serial testing to assess rise and fall** [^112sZCCV], with results guiding management.

---

### Chronic coronary syndromes

Repeat troponin **only when clinical or ECG features** suggest ACS [^111MoUaa]. Routine repeat testing is otherwise not indicated.

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring troponin rechecking

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended timing for rechecking** |
|-|-|
| Suspected NSTEMI | - 0/1-hour or 0/2-hour algorithms <br/> - 3-hour if inconclusive |
| Early presenters (< 3 hours) | Serial testing at 0, 1, and 3 hours |
| STEMI | - Baseline before PCI if feasible <br/> - Do not delay reperfusion |
| Non-ACS myocardial injury | Serial testing to assess rise/fall |
| Chronic coronary syndromes | Repeat only if clinical/ECG features suggest ACS |

---

## Factors influencing timing of troponin rechecking

- **Assay sensitivity**: High-sensitivity assays enable earlier detection and shorter intervals [^111QnpBh] [^113Dfs9P].

- **Clinical presentation**: Symptom onset timing and severity guide interval selection [^111en2fF].

- **Patient risk factors**: Higher risk may warrant shorter intervals and closer monitoring [^1117aNRB].

- **Institutional protocols**: Local policies and resources influence timing [^111K71Cn].

---

## Clinical implications of delayed or inappropriate troponin rechecking

- **Delayed diagnosis**: Late rechecking can delay MI diagnosis and treatment, increasing adverse events [^1124MvLb].

- **Unnecessary testing**: Inappropriate testing can cause false positives, unnecessary workups, and longer stays [^113jzvz6].

- **Increased costs**: Unnecessary testing and prolonged stays raise healthcare costs [^113HH49v].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial measurement**: Immediately at presentation; results within 60 minutes [^115wc2F7].

- **Serial measurements**: 0/1-hour or 0/2-hour algorithms for suspected NSTEMI [^111QnpBh] [^114DjxHW].

- **Early presenters**: Serial testing at 0, 1, and 3 hours [^115M3h69].

- **STEMI**: Do not delay reperfusion for troponin testing [^113fb6dS].

- **Non-ACS myocardial injury**: Serial testing to assess rise/fall [^112sZCCV].

- **Chronic coronary syndromes**: Repeat only if clinical or ECG features suggest ACS [^111MoUaa].

---

Rechecking troponin should follow **ESC 2023 algorithms** and be tailored to clinical context, assay sensitivity, and patient risk to ensure accurate diagnosis and timely management.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for coronary artery disease, specifically concerning cardiac troponin, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend that patients be referred to the emergency department immediately, and/or there should be repeated measurement of blood troponin. Preferably, high-sensitivity or ultrasensitive assays should be used to rule out acute myocardial injury if clinical or ECG assessment suggests acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rather than chronic coronary syndrome.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^112sZCCV]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

To promote the adoption of common standards, the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction recommends cardiac troponin testing and the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) as the diagnostic threshold for myocardial infarction. In practice, there are many causes of troponin elevation, with about half of all increases attributable to conditions other than type 1 myocardial infarction. Nonetheless, the early differentiation between types of myocardial infarction and acute or chronic nonischemic myocardial injury is important because the immediate management of these conditions differs. Prompt treatment with antiplatelet agents, anticoagulation, and coronary revascularization is recommended in type 1 myocardial infarction, whereas these may not be indicated in type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury and may be contraindicated.

- **Alternative thresholds**: Above the 99th percentile have been proposed to improve the positive predictive value (PPV) and specificity of troponin for type 1 myocardial infarction. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines propose the use of rule-in thresholds above the 99th percentile to guide admission to cardiology and coronary angiography. These rule-in thresholds and those 5 times the URL are purported to give a PPV of at least 70% and 90%, respectively. They were derived in selected patients with chest pain. However, in practice, troponin testing is applied more widely to evaluate patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome presenting with a broader range of symptoms. Guidelines also recommend serial testing.

### Troponin in early presenters to rule out myocardial infarction [^115M3h69]. European Heart Journal (2023). Low credibility.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays are able to quantify low levels of cardiac troponin in the majority of presumably healthy individuals. This has led to accelerated diagnostic pathways that use a single measurement of cardiac troponin at presentation to rule out myocardial infarction. Such approaches are safe and effective in patients presenting more than 2 or 3 hours after symptom onset. However, concerns remain about the use of a single test strategy in early presenters, and it is unclear how the performance of cardiac troponin changes with time following symptom onset.

Early rule-out thresholds use low levels of cardiac troponin to identify patients at presentation who are low risk and may not require serial testing. Studies have used either the limit of detection of a high-sensitivity assay or have defined the optimal rule-out threshold as the highest cardiac troponin concentration measurable that enables the greatest proportion of patients to be ruled out with a negative predictive value of ≥ 99.5% for myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days. However, concerns remain that cardiac troponin elevations may not be recognized if testing is performed within a few hours of symptom onset. Indeed, an increase in the proportion of false negatives has been observed in patients presenting within 2 or 3 hours.

As such, international guidelines recommend serial sampling in early presenters, which adds complexity to patient assessment and reduces the proportion of patients eligible for a single test rule-out, and therefore the effectiveness of these strategies.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, specifically with respect to cardiac troponin, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining additional testing after 3 hours if the first two high-sensitivity cardiac troponin measurements of the 0 hour/1 hour algorithm are inconclusive and no alternative diagnoses explaining the condition have been made.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, specifically concerning cardiac troponin, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend using an ESC algorithmic approach. This approach involves serial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin measurements at 0 hour/1 hour or 0 hour/2 hours to rule in and rule out NSTEMI.

### High-sensitivity point-of-care measurement of cardiac troponin [^116Yfvff]. European Heart Journal (2025). Low credibility.

New technologies enabling access to high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays at the point of care (POC) are available for routine use. POC technology can accelerate cardiac troponin testing within the hospital setting and support testing in other healthcare environments. Pre-analytical and analytical issues unique to POC testing are discussed. The opportunities and the evidence needed to support the routine use of hs-cTn POC assays in clinical care are outlined. Based on recent developments, the potential impact of hs-cTn at the POC in multiple clinical settings is described, and a roadmap of the steps required for successful implementation is provided.

### Serial high-sensitivity troponin measurements for the rapid exclusion of acute myocardial infarction in low-risk patients [^1137jsXo]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

High-sensitivity troponin assays facilitate the rapid exclusion of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, elevated results are also seen in other conditions causing myocardial injury. Serial measurements increase the specificity for AMI, helping to rapidly identify patients for whom revascularization may be appropriate. In this study, we explore a strategy for rapidly excluding AMI in symptomatic patients using serial high-sensitivity troponin measurements.

- **Main findings**:
	1. All patients presenting more than 3 hours after symptom onset with a negative result had a second negative result.
	2. AMI was excluded in all patients with two results falling below the lower limit of detection of a standard troponin assay by 8 hours post-symptom onset.

### The clinical need for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays for acute coronary syndromes and the role for serial testing [^114mAfpD]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponin is the biomarker of choice for the serologic diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes. International cardiology and laboratory medicine guidelines have suggested that the cutoff concentration be set at the 99th percentile of a healthy population, with an assay imprecision of 10% or less. Unfortunately, most commercial troponin assays do not have the sensitivity and precision to reliably detect troponin in the sera of healthy subjects. Therefore, there is a need to develop troponin assays with higher sensitivity, which cannot be achieved while also improving the assay's precision.

- **Methods and results**: Novel prototype analytical testing devices have been developed that are 5- to 10-fold more sensitive than existing commercial troponin assays. These tests should enable an earlier detection of myocardial infarction relative to the time of presentation and detect a higher percentage of emergency department chest pain patients who are at risk for short-term major adverse cardiac events. However, the use of a high-sensitivity troponin assay will also result in the detection of more patients who have cardiac necrosis due to a nonischemic etiology.

- **Conclusions**: Serial troponin testing will be necessary to determine the clinical significance of low levels of troponin release with the use of high-sensitivity assays. Guidelines will need to be established to determine a change in troponin results that is statistically and clinically significant, and new considerations for the time interval needed between blood collections. This will enable the use of future high-sensitivity assays effectively.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin on presentation to rule out myocardial infarction: A stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial [^116NCm5T]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays enable myocardial infarction to be ruled out earlier, but the safety and efficacy of this approach is uncertain. We investigated whether an early rule-out pathway is safe and effective for patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome.

- **Methods**: We performed a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial in the emergency departments of seven acute care hospitals in Scotland. Consecutive patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome between December 2014 and December 2016 were included. Sites were randomized to implement an early rule-out pathway where myocardial infarction was excluded if high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations were < 5 ng/L at presentation. During a previous validation phase, myocardial infarction was ruled out when troponin concentrations were < 99th percentile at 6 to 12 hours after symptom onset. The coprimary outcome was length of stay (efficacy) and myocardial infarction or cardiac death after discharge at 30 days (safety). Patients were followed for one year to evaluate safety and other secondary outcomes.

- **Results**: We enrolled 31,492 patients (59 ± 17 years of age [mean ± SD]; 45% women) with troponin concentrations < 99th percentile at presentation. Length of stay was reduced from 10.1 ± 4.1 to 6.8 ± 3.9 hours (adjusted geometric mean ratio, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.73–0.83]; P < 0.001) after implementation, and the proportion of patients discharged increased from 50% to 71% (adjusted odds ratio, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.45–1.75]). Noninferiority was not demonstrated for the 30-day safety outcome.

### Value of troponin testing for detection of heart disease in previously healthy children [^111WxavP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Serial troponin levels were not obtained systematically; however, among 404 patients with initially non-elevated levels who had serial measurements, subsequent elevation was found in 80 (20%). Of these, 15 (19%) had a cardiac diagnosis at discharge, including cardiomyopathy in 4, probable myocarditis in 4, arrhythmia in 3, coronary anomaly in 2, other congenital heart disease in 1, and Kawasaki disease without coronary aneurysm in 1. For the entire cohort, the predictive value of elevated troponin level at any time during hospital stay (PPV, 56%; negative predictive value, 89%) was not superior to that of the level at initial presentation (PPV, 60%; negative predictive value, 89%).

Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified an optimal cutoff of 0.005 ng/mL with an area under the curve of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.67–0.75) to differentiate cardiac from non-cardiac disease in this pediatric cohort. With subgroup analysis by age, the optimal troponin cutoff value to differentiate cardiac from non-cardiac diagnosis was higher in children aged less than 3 months (0.045 ng/mL) compared with children aged 3 months or older (0.005 ng/mL). Using this new age-based cutoff value for troponin level, the C statistic of the model to differentiate cardiac from non-cardiac diagnosis was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84–0.90).

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: Evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^113GPby9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

While the new assays can provide more accurate and rapid detection of myocardial necrosis, they do not indicate the cause of cell death. Improved assay performance must be accompanied by enhanced clinical evaluation of patients to effectively interpret results and apply them in clinical practice. The universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI) was a broad consensus developed by representatives from the American College of Cardiology Foundation, European Society of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and World Heart Federation. This definition provided increased structure and clarity around diagnosing MI in the era of a troponin gold standard. Importantly, it firmly established the importance of clinical symptoms in conjunction with elevated troponin levels occurring with a characteristic rise and/or fall to establish type 1 MI. It also allowed for diagnosis in the setting of sudden cardiac death and enhanced categorization for periprocedural MIs.

As sensitivity and precision of troponin assays have improved, false-positive results due to assay imprecision are becoming less of a problem. However, the pressure on clinical perspective in interpreting positive troponin results has increased, given that there is a large differential diagnosis generated by a positive troponin assay.

### Understanding cardiac troponin part 2: Early rule out of acute coronary syndrome [^111BXisW]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Chest pain of suspected cardiac origin is a very common presentation in the emergency department. Over the past decade, there has been an exponential growth in strategies that promote blood sampling at increasingly earlier time points after presentation to facilitate the rule-out of acute coronary syndrome. In part 2 of this series, we examine key concepts from the recent literature with the aim of improving clinicians' understanding of the rule-out strategies available to them. We provide a structured overview of strategies that facilitate discharge with blood testing in under three hours.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: Evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^113ugqw9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Based on their analytic capabilities, high-sensitivity assays offer several advantages over their conventional assay counterparts. They are extremely sensitive, perhaps allowing for earlier and faster recognition of myocardial infarction (MI) patients and giving clinicians an avenue to more quickly diagnose and treat patients appropriately. The new assays are also precise, having small coefficient of variation (CV) levels even at the 99th percentile in reference populations.

- **Specificity for myocardial necrosis**: This topic is controversial. There are conflicting opinions on the specificity of troponin for myocyte infarction versus ischemia. Briefly, limited data demonstrate that during stress tests, standard-sensitivity troponin assays are static, while high-sensitivity assays detect a small rise in troponin. Experimental models of ischemia, achieved by pacing patients from the coronary sinus, show a low-level elevation in troponin appreciated only with high-sensitivity troponin assays.

Some authors interpret similar findings as consistent with ischemia; however, it has also been argued that high-sensitivity assays detect minute levels of myocyte necrosis, indicating miniscule MIs. Additionally, several proposed mechanisms of troponin release are not related to necrosis. These include apoptosis, cellular release of proteolytic products, increased cell wall permeability with stress or stretch, and the production of membranous blebs that contain troponin. Despite the controversy, the potential for early and accurate diagnosis offered by high-sensitivity troponin assays represents a significant advancement.

### Acute coronary syndromes. The diagnostic role of troponins [^113MMiGF]. Thrombosis Research (2001). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) represent the acute, life-threatening phases of coronary heart disease. Clinical symptoms, EKG, and CK-MB measurements are frequently insufficient to evaluate patients without persisting ST elevations. Serial determinations of troponin T or troponin I after arrival in a hospital disclose minor myocardial injury in patients presenting as unstable angina. This finding allows for the currently best risk stratification and may contribute to cost-effectiveness. Without elevated troponins, the risk for death or myocardial infarction during a 30-day follow-up is not more than 1%. The lack of elevated troponins does not imply that these patients do not have coronary artery disease. Patients with positive evidence of troponins represent a high-risk group who should be hospitalized and further evaluated, as the risk for myocardial infarction and death in 30 days is approximately 20%. Studies indicate that early revascularization under glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists represents the optimal treatment.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^112Sh4jv]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

We recognize some strengths and limitations of this study. First, we enrolled consecutive patients in whom the attending clinician suspected acute coronary syndrome by embedding our screening tool into the electronic health care system. This approach avoided selection bias and ensured that our study population was representative. Second, all diagnoses were adjudicated according to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction, ensuring that our findings are relevant to contemporary practice.

Although few patients had missing troponin values for the evaluation of rule-in thresholds (0.1%), serial testing was performed at the discretion of the attending clinician and was conducted in only 53% of patients with myocardial injury or infarction. It is likely that those patients undergoing serial testing differed from those who had a single test performed. However, our comparison between patients with type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction and those with myocardial injury was limited to the subgroup of patients with two or more tests performed within 12 hours of presentation.

Cardiac troponin was measured with a single high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay, and we recognize that the performance of rule-in thresholds for myocardial infarction is likely to differ for other assays. Lastly, the approach to patient selection for cardiac troponin testing will vary across health care systems. We recommend some caution in extrapolating the performance of rule-in thresholds to sites where testing is performed more widely.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^111FgAcf]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

Although we observed important differences in the kinetics, cardiac troponin concentrations at presentation are insufficient to distinguish type 1 myocardial infarction from other causes of myocardial injury or infarction in practice. Clinical context may be more helpful than any rule-in threshold for guiding initial triage and management decisions.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: Evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^112ZyEw4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

With the increased sensitivity of these new assays and the evaluation of their precision and sensitivity in healthy populations (although not completely agreed on), investigators have discovered biological variability in the low detectable levels of healthy individuals. Biological variability is a type of preanalytic variation due to changes over time in normal individuals. These changes may be secondary to circadian rhythm, monthly changes, or seasonal changes inherent to a species. In addition, there is random biological fluctuation around an inherent set point that may be specific to an individual. This certainly affects the utility of these new assays and should inform the use of threshold values and change values that might be used for diagnostic and prognostic clinical evaluation.

Wu et al. demonstrated a mean biological variability in healthy individuals using the Singulex cTnI assay in the range of approximately 10% over 4 hours and approximately 15% over 8 weeks. With this level of variability, the authors calculated a reference change value of 81% for increasing serial assays and −45% for decreasing serial assays to define abnormality. Vasile et al, using the Roche hs‐Troponin T assay, showed that mean delta values within 24-hour studies were ± 58%, while values over multiple days could vary by ± 90%. Given this biological variability, the authors determined that a short‐term (e.g. 4 hours) change of 85% or long‐term (e.g. 8 weeks) change of 315% would be necessary to be reasonably certain that abnormality was present.

### Present and future of cardiac troponin in clinical practice: A paradigm shift to high-sensitivity assays [^116UaJ9t]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite its wide utilization and central role in the evaluation of patients with potential ischemic symptoms, misconceptions and confusion about cardiac troponin (cTn) prevail. The implementation of high-sensitivity (hs) cTn assays in clinical practice offers multiple potential advantages, provided there is an education process tied to their introduction that emphasizes appropriate utilization. Several diagnostic strategies with hs-cTn assays have been explored, including the use of undetectable values, accelerated serial hs-cTn sampling, hs-cTn measurements in combination with a clinical-risk score, and a single hs-cTn measurement with a concentration threshold tailored to meet a clinical need.

In this document, we discuss basic concepts that should facilitate the integration of hs-cTn assays into clinical care in the years to come.

### Outcomes associated with small changes in normal-range cardiac markers [^111qwEux]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Troponin concentrations rising above an institutional cut point are used to define acute myocardial necrosis, yet it is uncertain what outcomes are associated with fluctuations in troponin that do not exceed this level. We evaluate the association between troponin fluctuations below an institutional upper limit of normal and acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

- **Materials and methods**: This was a post hoc analysis of the Internet tracking registry of ACS (i*trACS), which describes patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with suspected ACS across the spectrum of risk. Patients were included in this registry if they were at least 18 years old and had suspected ACS at the time of their ED visit. Inclusion in this analysis required that patients had at least one cardiac marker (creatine kinase-MB [CK-MB], troponin T, or troponin I) drawn twice within six hours of presentation, with both measures being below the institution's upper limit of normal. A marker change was defined as either an increase or decrease that exceeded 15% of the institutional upper limit of normal. Acute coronary syndrome was defined as a positive stress test, documented myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or death within 30 days of their ED admission.

- **Results**: Of 17,713 patient visits, 2162 met inclusion and exclusion criteria. There were 1872 patient visits with two troponin results and 1312 with two CK-MB results. Patient visits with increasing troponin levels had increased odds of ACS compared with those with stable troponin levels (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.4–9.2).

### Convalescent troponin and cardiovascular death following acute coronary syndrome [^115XsBQ2]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing is used in the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes, but its role during convalescence is unknown. This study investigated the long-term prognostic significance of serial convalescent high-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentrations following acute coronary syndrome.

In a prospective multicenter observational cohort study of 2140 patients with acute coronary syndrome, cardiac troponin I concentrations were measured in 1776 patients at 4 and 12 months following the index event. Patients were stratified into three groups according to the troponin concentration at 4 months using the 99th percentile (women > 16 ng/L, men > 34 ng/L) and median concentration of those within the reference range. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death.

Troponin concentrations at 4 months were measurable in 99.0% (1759/1776) of patients (67 ± 12 years, 72% male) and were ≤ 5 ng/L (median) and > 99th percentile in 44.8% (795) and 9.3% (166), respectively. There were 202 (11.4%) cardiovascular deaths following a median of 4.8 years. After adjusting for the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events score, troponin remained an independent predictor of cardiovascular death (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.5 per doubling), with the highest risk observed in those with increasing concentrations at 12 months. Patients with 4-month troponin concentrations > 99th percentile were at increased risk of cardiovascular death compared with those ≤ 5 ng/L (29.5% [49/166] vs 4.3% [34/795]; adjusted HR 4.9, 95% CI 3.8 to 23.7).

### Temporal evolution of serum concentrations of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin during 1 year after acute coronary syndrome admission [^116U5eAw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponins (hs-cTns) are now widely used in clinical practice and are key elements of the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients presenting with ischemic chest pain. In the setting of suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS), high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) have a comparable good performance and are practically interchangeable. However, hs-cTns are also measured for purposes other than diagnosing ACS, such as part of perioperative care, though studies comparing hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT concentrations outside the setting of ACS are scarce and mostly performed in the general population.

In this study, we used the BIOMArCS (Biomarker Study to Identify the Acute Risk of a Coronary Syndrome) with high-frequency blood sampling to investigate in detail the evolution of hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT concentrations until 1 year after ACS admission. We aimed to describe differences in the post-ACS kinetics and differences in the hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT concentrations after the biomarker reached stable levels. In addition, we explored the biological variation of cardiac troponins, measured with contemporary high-sensitivity assays.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^112ghpcL]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

In recent years, a number of approaches have been proposed that could enable clinicians to use cardiac troponin more flexibly. These approaches recognize the limitations of applying fixed thresholds to triage a heterogeneous population of patients and the challenge of performing serial testing at precise intervals in clinical practice.

- **Troponin only–Manchester acute coronary syndrome rule**: This uses logistic regression to provide individual patient risk estimates for non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction by incorporating age, sex, clinical variables, and a measure of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T at presentation. This rule performs well but does not discriminate type 1 myocardial infarction from other causes of troponin elevation or take into account serial testing.

- **COMPASS-MI collaborative analysis**: In a collaborative analysis that pooled data from multiple cohorts, the COMPASS-MI (Calculation of Myocardial Infarction Risk Probabilities to Manage Patients With Suspicion of Myocardial Infarction) investigators highlight that a more flexible approach is required. They demonstrate proof of concept that the negative predictive value and PPV for type 1 myocardial infarction vary across a range of thresholds and delta change in troponin values.

- **Myocardial ischemic injury index**: Finally, the myocardial ischemic injury index uses a gradient-boosting machine learning algorithm to combine age, sex, and paired high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I values to compute a value (0–100) that reflects the likelihood of type 1 myocardial infarction for an individual patient. Serial testing can be performed at any time point, and the algorithm incorporates flexible timing, addressing previous limitations in clinical practice.

### Incremental value of objective cardiac testing in addition to physician impression and serial contemporary troponin measurements in women [^114iraxf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend that patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain who are at low risk for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) receive an objective cardiac evaluation with a stress test or coronary imaging. It is uncertain whether all women derive benefit from this process. The study aimed to determine the incremental value of objective cardiac testing after serial cardiac markers and physician risk assessment.

Women enrolled in the 18-site Myeloperoxidase in the Diagnosis of Acute Coronary Syndrome (MIDAS) study had serial troponin I measured at time 0 and 90 minutes, alongside a physician risk assessment for the presence of ACS. Risk estimates obtained at the time of ED evaluation were dichotomized as high or non-high risk. The primary outcome was the composite of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or revascularization at 30 days. Logistic regression with receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and net reclassification index were used to determine the diagnostic accuracy for the composite outcome of 30-day MI or revascularization for two models: 1) troponin I results and physician risk assessment alone and 2) troponin I results, physician risk assessment, and objective cardiac testing.

A total of 460 women with a median age of 58 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 48.5 to 68 years) were included, and 32 (6.9%) experienced AMI or revascularization by 30 days. Comparison of the area under the ROC curves (AUC) showed that the addition of objective cardiac testing to the combination of troponin I results and physician risk assessment increased the diagnostic accuracy for predicting the composite outcome.

### Troponin in early presenters to rule out myocardial infarction [^111en2fF]. European Heart Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Are we now able to rule out myocardial infarction at presentation in patients with very recent onset symptoms if cardiac troponin I levels are undetectable? There are several considerations. First, our findings are only applicable to the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assays tested here, and additional data are needed in similarly large cohorts to determine whether the same approach could be applied for other assays.

In contrast to cardiac troponin I, for cardiac troponin T, the guideline-recommended rule-out threshold of 5 ng/L is based on the limit of detection. On most platforms, the assay is not able to measure troponin below this threshold. Second, we demonstrate heterogeneity in the sensitivity and negative predictive value of a threshold of 2 ng/L in sub-groups of patients who presented within 3 hours of symptom onset. In particular, the negative predictive value was less than 99% in those with known ischaemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and renal impairment, although this may in part reflect the extremely small number of patients with these conditions who have undetectable values. This variation was not seen in patients presenting at later time points, suggesting that these factors influence the release kinetics of cardiac troponin or the perception of the onset of symptoms.

Further research on the kinetics of cardiac troponin in patients with these conditions is required, and clinicians should exercise caution and clinical judgement when applying the limit of detection to rule out those who present early.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: Evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^1131k1h6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

The primary role of the troponin assay since its inception has been to diagnose patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While the improved sensitivity and specificity of troponin, over creatine kinase–MB, may have enhanced diagnostic accuracy for AMI in the emergency department and hospital, its shortcoming is that, depending on the time between symptom onset and presentation, there is a delay of several hours in the elevation of the biomarker. This delay causes a delay in diagnosis and, consequently, longer emergency department and observation stays for patients with and without AMI.

New high-sensitivity assays have overcome this weakness with their improved sensitivity, making the first low-level elevations of troponin detectable within 90 to 180 minutes of the event. Two large prospective studies performed in the emergency department setting showed that the high-sensitivity troponin assays are more accurate than previous assays in the successful diagnosis of AMI within three hours of the onset of symptoms. The increase in accuracy and speed could be beneficial in multiple ways. Patients are diagnosed more quickly and, as a result, may be treated more rapidly, including the earlier invasive therapy.

For the majority of patients, the improved assays will lead to a quicker rule-out of myocardial infarction. This may allow for more prompt subsequent evaluation and perhaps earlier discharge of appropriate patients, decreasing further costs. However, there has not been adequate prospective evaluation of the use of these new assays in a diagnostic algorithm.

### Cardiac troponins [^115NvB8M]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponins I and T are proteins integral to the function of cardiac muscle. They are very sensitive markers for the detection of myocardial damage, and the ability to assay their serum levels accurately and quickly has revolutionized the concepts of minor myocardial injury and infarction. They are also powerful prognostic indicators of future adverse cardiac events.

Limitations, more of troponin T than I, include decreased specificity in renal failure and skeletal muscle disease. Rapid, whole blood assays are now available that can be performed at the patient's bedside. This review discusses the cardiac troponins, their biochemistry, the assays for them currently available, and their roles in the evaluation of cardiac disease in the Emergency Department (ED).

### Serial troponin-T and long-term outcomes in suspected acute coronary syndrome [^112hUUQh]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Long-term prognostic implications of serial high-sensitivity troponin concentrations in subjects with suspected acute coronary syndrome are unknown.

- **Methods and results**: Individuals with a first diagnosis of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, observation for suspected myocardial infarction, or chest pain from 2012 through 2019, who underwent two high-sensitivity troponin-T (hsTnT) measurements 1–7 hours apart, were identified through Danish national registries. Absolute and relative risks for death at days 0–30 and 31–365, stratified by whether subjects had normal or elevated hsTnT concentrations, and whether these concentrations changed by 20 to 50%, or > 50% in either direction from first to second measurement, were calculated through multivariable logistic regression with average treatment effect modeling. Of the 28,902 individuals included, 2.8% had died at 30 days, whereas 4.9% of those who had survived the first 30 days died between days 31–365. The standardized risk of death was highest among subjects with two elevated hsTnT concentrations (0–30 days: 4.3%, 31–365 days: 7.2%). In this group, mortality was significantly higher in those with a > 20 to 50% or > 50% rise from the first to second measurement, though only at 30 days. The risk of death was very low in subjects with two normal hsTnT concentrations (0–30 days: 0.1%, 31–365 days: 0.9%) and did not depend on relative or absolute changes between measurements.

- **Conclusions**: Individuals with suspected acute coronary syndrome and two consecutively elevated hsTnT concentrations consistently had the highest risk of mortality.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: Evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^116XXjNQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

While elevated troponin might signal worse prognosis among patients with known CAD or CHF or who are otherwise at significant risk, high-sensitivity assays may provide a means of screening a general population of patients for cardiac dysfunction. In a prospective observational cohort of general patients randomly enrolled from a large metropolitan area (Dallas Heart Study), elevated levels of high-sensitivity troponin were associated with greater rates of structural heart disease, including left ventricular hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction, as well as all-cause mortality within a median follow-up of 6.4 years. In a nationwide prospective cohort study of ambulatory older adults (≥ 65 years) without heart failure, high-sensitivity troponin values (both baseline and absolute change over 2 years) were associated with incident heart failure and cardiovascular death over a median follow-up of 11.8 years. Thus, in a general population, high-sensitivity troponin might play a role in screening for structural and coronary heart disease, potentially prompting further evaluation and more aggressive primary prevention measures. However, there are several obstacles to overcome before such a clinical strategy could be used. Biological variability will have to be further explored and quantified to establish reasonable threshold change values. Standardization of high-sensitivity troponin assays would be extremely important to allow for appropriate interpretation of troponin values with time and across different medical systems.

### Troponin testing for clinicians [^111K71Cn]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The analytical performance of troponin assays has improved markedly in the last two decades. The variety of assays, their evolution over time, and their critical importance in influencing care mandates the need for skills in their use. There are three critical elements necessary for optimal use of troponin testing in clinical care: 1) the analytical performance of the assay; 2) the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the test result; and 3) the clinical reasoning for ordering and the proper clinical context for interpreting the test result.

This paper provides further explanation that will assist clinicians in their clinical decision-making and interpretation of troponin test results. Schematic visual explanations are provided to help clinicians develop a more intuitive understanding of troponin testing.

### Implementation of a sensitive troponin I assay and risk of recurrent myocardial infarction and death in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^111cqPqe]. JAMA (2011). High credibility.

Although troponin assays have become increasingly sensitive, it remains unclear whether further reductions in the threshold of detection for plasma troponin concentrations will improve clinical outcomes in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

The objective of this study was to determine whether lowering the diagnostic threshold for myocardial infarction (MI) with a sensitive troponin assay could improve clinical outcomes.

The design included all consecutive patients admitted with suspected ACS to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, before (n = 1038; February 1-July 31, 2008, during the validation phase) and after (n = 1054; February 1-July 31, 2009, during the implementation phase) lowering the threshold of detection for myocardial necrosis from 0.20 to 0.05 ng/mL with a sensitive troponin I assay. Patients were stratified into three groups: < 0.05 ng/mL, 0.05–0.19 ng/mL, and ≥ 0.20 ng/mL. During the validation phase, only concentrations above the original diagnostic threshold of 0.20 ng/mL were reported to clinicians.

The main outcome measured was event-free survival (recurrent MI and death) at 1 year in patients grouped by plasma troponin concentrations. Results indicated that plasma troponin concentrations were less than 0.05 ng/mL in 1340 patients (64%), 0.05 to 0.19 ng/mL in 170 patients (8%), and 0.20 ng/mL or more in 582 patients (28%). During the validation phase, 39% of patients with plasma troponin concentrations of 0.05 to 0.19 ng/mL were dead or had recurrent MI at 1 year, compared with 7% and 24% of those patients with troponin concentrations of less than 0.05 ng/mL and 0.20 ng/mL or more, respectively.

### Troponin: Think before you request one [^113jzvz6]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (ACS) is one of the most common presentations in acute hospital settings. Troponin (cTn) has emerged as one of the most sensitive biochemical markers for the diagnosis of ACS. However, if used inappropriately and in the absence of true clinical context, it can be elevated in a number of non-cardiac conditions, leading to false clinical diagnoses, inappropriate workups, and increased patient hospital stays. The cost of unnecessary clinical testing is another aspect of the problem.

At Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport (one of the busiest district general hospitals in Wales), we retrospectively analyzed the nature of troponin requests over a random period of one week, specifically examining the indications and final diagnostic impact. In many cases, it was found that requests were made without any clinical justification. One of the main, and probably unavoidable, reasons for this was that requests were made from triage before the patient was assessed by a clinician. However, steps were taken to clarify common clinical indications for a suspected cardiac diagnosis in which troponin was useful. Additionally, the "tick box" practice for inappropriate laboratory investigations was discouraged. A repeat audit was conducted on similar basic principles, and a measurable improvement was identified, with the potential for significant impact in the future.

### A practical approach for the use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays in the evaluation of patients with chest pain [^1124MvLb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain is a common clinical presentation, especially in the emergency department. Rapid identification of patients with myocardial infarction, as well as those with noncardiac chest pain, is important to start therapy in the former and avoid unnecessary investigations and delays in discharge in the latter. Besides electrocardiograms, cardiac biomarkers are a key element in decision-making. Conventional creatinine kinase and troponin assays are not sensitive enough and have to be repeated at least 6 to 12 hours after initial evaluation.

New high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) tests are currently available and, if used appropriately, can substantially improve management. Due to their high sensitivity and accuracy, these tests allow measurement of very low serum troponin levels, such as those present in healthy individuals, and can detect small changes in troponin concentration within a short time frame. These tests are thus very useful for the early diagnosis of myocardial infarction but can also be elevated in several other conditions that result in myocardial injury. A good understanding of the analytical characteristics of these assays is of utmost importance for their appropriate use in clinical practice.

### What US cardiology can learn from the 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes [^113fb6dS]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The spectrum of clinical presentations, electrocardiographic findings, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin levels in patients with acute coronary syndrome highlights critical diagnostic elements. The initial ACS assessment should encompass the electrocardiogram, physical examination, clinical history, vital signs, and trends in high-sensitivity troponin levels.

An ST elevation MI becomes readily apparent from the electrocardiogram, while patients with NSTE-ACS should be classified into two categories: those with very high-risk features and those without. Very high-risk features include hemodynamic instability or cardiogenic shock, ongoing chest pain refractory to medical management, acute heart failure presumed secondary to ongoing myocardial ischemia, life-threatening arrhythmias or cardiac arrest post-presentation, mechanical complications, and dynamic electrocardiographic changes suggestive of ischemia.

Patients suffering from STEMI require immediate angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or thrombolysis if timely PCI is not feasible, mirroring the management approach for NSTE-ACS patients presenting very high-risk features. For NSTE-ACS without these high-risk features, it is recommended that angiography be considered within the initial 24 hours. The outcome of angiography will subsequently inform the necessity for PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Additionally, long-term medical therapy and lifestyle adjustments, particularly smoking cessation, should be methodically considered.

### Interpreting troponin in renal disease: A narrative review for emergency clinicians [^115DMcyC]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) can experience several severe complications, including acute coronary syndrome (ACS). While troponin is the biomarker of choice for evaluation of ACS, interpretation of troponin in CKD/ESRD can be challenging.

- **Objective**: This narrative review evaluates troponin elevation in patients with CKD/ESRD, pitfalls in the evaluation with troponin, and an approach to using troponin in these high-risk patients.

- **Discussion**: Patients with CKD/ESRD are at greater risk for ACS and possess higher levels of circulating troponin. Relatedly, these patients often present atypically for ACS. Several pitfalls must be considered in the use of troponin when evaluating for ACS. While troponin elevation in patients with CKD/ESRD is often considered to be due to underlying renal disease, this elevation has several etiologies, including uremic skeletal myopathy, microinfarctions, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), decreased clearance, and unrecognized congestive heart failure (CHF). Utilizing troponin assays in this patient population requires a nuanced approach, as the sensitivity and specificity for troponin testing in CKD varies. Concern for ACS with elevated troponin warrants treatment for ACS until proven otherwise, with consideration of atypical presentations along with other causes for patient symptoms that may result in troponin elevation.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with CKD/ESRD presenting with symptoms concerning for ACS are challenging. The utilization of troponin assays is important in this population, given their elevated risk and atypical presentation.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentrations at presentation in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^1169mUSK]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

The introduction of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing into clinical practice has transformed the assessment of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome in the emergency department. Most patients can be discharged using accelerated diagnostic pathways that do not require hospital admission for peak cardiac troponin testing. These pathways are not recommended for patients with ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram, but given that interpretation is dependent on experience, there is a risk patients could be inappropriately assessed.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^115RRzAg]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Although the 99th percentile is the recommended diagnostic threshold for myocardial infarction, some guidelines also advocate for the use of higher troponin thresholds to rule in myocardial infarction at presentation. It is unclear whether the magnitude or change in troponin concentration can differentiate causes of myocardial injury and infarction in practice.

- **Methods**: In a secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized controlled trial, we identified 46,092 consecutive patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations at presentation and on serial testing were compared between patients with myocardial injury and infarction. The positive predictive value and specificity were determined at the sex-specific 99th percentile upper reference limit and rule-in thresholds of 64 ng/L and 5-fold of the upper reference limit for a diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction.

- **Results**: Troponin was above the 99th percentile in 8,188 patients (18%). The diagnosis was type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction in 50% and 14%, and acute or chronic myocardial injury in 20% and 16%, respectively. Troponin concentrations were similar at presentation in type 1 (median [25th-75th percentile] 91 [30–493] ng/L) and type 2 (50 [22–147] ng/L) myocardial infarction and in acute (50 [26–134] ng/L) and chronic (51 [31–130] ng/L) myocardial injury. The 99th percentile and rule-in thresholds of 64 ng/L and 5-fold upper reference limit gave a positive predictive value of 57% (95% CI, 56%-58%).

### Cardiac troponin at the point of care in acute and chronic coronary syndromes [^111BR23x]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

The availability of hs-cTn assays at the point of care could allow the single-sample rule-out of myocardial infarction in primary care, without serial testing. However, it is important to highlight that some patients will require serial measurements if their symptoms occurred within 3 hours of sampling or the cardiac troponin concentration is above the rule-out threshold. In a single-centre observational cohort study, hs-cTn testing in primary care using a central laboratory assay identified 76.6% of patients as low risk, with a sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of 98.4% and 99.9%, respectively. The safety and efficacy of measuring cardiac troponin at the point of care with a high-sensitivity assay in primary care will be evaluated in the randomized controlled trial POB-HELP study (Ruling out acute coronary syndrome in primary care with a clinical decision rule and a capillary, high-sensitive troponin I point of care test; NCT05827237).

Availability of hs-cTn at the point of care in a primary care setting offers opportunities beyond the rule-in and rule-out of myocardial infarction. International guidelines for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease currently recommend the use of population-based cardiovascular risk scoring. These risk scores, however, have been shown to overpredict cardiovascular risk in older adults and underestimate risk in younger individuals. Large studies have demonstrated that incorporating cardiac troponin into risk prediction models improves the accuracy of risk scores. Higher concentrations are associated with more cardiovascular events.

### Pros and cons of high-sensitivity assays for cardiac troponin [^112GrQ3Z]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

A 3-hour algorithm using high-sensitivity assays for cardiac troponin to rule out myocardial infarction (MI) is recommended in ESC guidelines. However, whether faster rule-out algorithms can discriminate between MI and other conditions that elevate the troponin level, or can be safely implemented across the whole spectrum of patient risk, remains unclear.

### Cardiac troponin assays with improved analytical quality: A trade-off between enhanced diagnostic performance and reduced long-term prognostic value [^113L2924]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

According to recommendations, patients are eligible for early discharge or further investigations for ACS based on the troponin results. The algorithms encompass an initial review of the admission sample in patients who present more than 3 hours after symptom onset. If the concentration is below the LOD of the troponin assay, the patient is eligible for "rule-out" and may be discharged if the electrocardiogram and/or the clinical symptoms suggest a lower likelihood of ACS. The remaining patients undergo serial sampling at 1-hour intervals. Based on the baseline and delta values obtained, patient status is established as "rule-out", "observation", or "rule-in" for NSTEMI. Again, ruled-out patients may be discharged if the clinical suspicion of ACS is low, those who are ruled in may go directly to cardiac angiography and eventually invasive treatment, and those in the observation group undergo diagnostic follow-up. We compared the recommended ESC (cTnT and cTnI (Abbott)) algorithms and those suggested by Body et al. and Neumann et al. to the novel algorithms described.

- **Single sample rule-out of NSTEMI**: The novel cTnI (sgx) rule-out algorithms were defined based on the following hierarchy of criteria: diagnostic sensitivity for NSTEMI ≥ 99.0%, as previously described, and the maximum possible specificity. Sensitivity was preferred over negative predictive value as the criterion because sensitivity is independent of disease prevalence.

Tables illustrating the described algorithms have been omitted.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I at presentation in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome: a cohort study [^113Dfs9P]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

One of the main limitations was that we did not test the implementation of this threshold in routine clinical practice. Although we determined the number of patients who could be safely discharged, whether clinicians can effectively implement this threshold in practice and whether this will substantially improve rates of discharge is unknown. Conversely, this threshold should not be implemented in isolation and without regard to appropriate clinical assessment. One in 200 patients still had an index or 30-day event, and many had other evidence of myocardial ischaemia. Finally, we had no data about later investigations and treatments. Implementation of this threshold is expected to reduce health-care costs, but these benefits might be lost if re-presentations or additional outpatient consultations increase.

A troponin concentration of less than 5 ng/L met our prespecified criteria for a negative predictive value of at least 99.5%. At this threshold, almost two-thirds of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome could have been discharged with very few cardiac events. Indeed, implementation of this threshold could double the number of patients discharged directly from the emergency department. Lower thresholds did not improve the negative predictive value and would identify fewer patients suitable for discharge. Increasing the threshold to less than 6 ng/L would identify an additional 6% of patients suitable for discharge, but would double the number of adverse events. Moreover, we have internally and externally validated this threshold.

### Patient selection for high sensitivity cardiac troponin testing and diagnosis of myocardial infarction: Prospective cohort study [^1117aNRB]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

High sensitivity cardiac troponin assays are now being introduced worldwide, with the exception of the US where they have only recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Although cardiac troponin testing in undifferentiated patients may be justified when myocardial infarction is a possibility, it is important that clinicians are aware that elevated cardiac troponin concentrations are not exclusive to type 1 myocardial infarction. Implementation of high sensitivity cardiac troponin testing should be accompanied by education of clinicians to guide patient selection and the interpretation of elevated troponin concentrations. Testing should be incorporated into evidence-based pathways. If implemented without adoption of a considered approach, high sensitivity cardiac troponin assays may increase diagnostic uncertainty and increase the need for further invasive and non-invasive cardiac investigations, leading to cost implications for the healthcare system.

In the UK, where the approach to investigation is more conservative, we observed that troponin testing was performed in patients with a higher pre-test probability of myocardial infarction, and the positive predictive value of high sensitivity cardiac troponin was higher than in the US. Unsurprisingly, the positive predictive value across both populations was highest in patients with chest pain, myocardial ischaemia on the electrocardiogram, or known ischaemic heart disease, reflecting the higher prevalence of myocardial infarction in patients with these features.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^116PpnmW]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

In consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, we evaluated whether troponin concentrations at presentation or their kinetics differed sufficiently to discriminate between myocardial injury and infarction. We report a number of observations that are relevant to practice.

- **Findings**: First, troponin concentrations at presentation are similar in patients with myocardial injury and those with infarction regardless of the diagnostic classification. Second, the use of recommended rule-in thresholds above the 99th percentile provides only marginal improvements in the PPV and specificity for type 1 myocardial infarction. Troponin thresholds > 1000 ng/L would be required to achieve a PPV of ≥ 75%. Third, the magnitude and rate of change of troponin can help differentiate type 1 from type 2 myocardial infarction and acute or chronic myocardial injury.

Although we observed important differences in troponin kinetics, the troponin concentration at presentation provides only limited discrimination between type 1 myocardial infarction and other causes of myocardial injury or infarction. Clinical context may be more helpful than any given rule-in threshold to guide the triage and initial management of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome in practice.

### Temporal evolution of serum concentrations of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin during 1 year after acute coronary syndrome admission [^112U5N2x]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, studies on the biological variation of cardiac troponins, measured with contemporary high‐sensitivity assays, are scarce, and their sample sizes have usually been small. Particularly in patients with established CCS, such as patients following ACS, little to no information is available. The parameters of variation found in our study are comparable to earlier reports in subjects sampled from the general "healthy" population. For example, Wu et al. reported a long‐term individual variation of 14% for hs‐cTnI based on 17 healthy subjects. The coefficient of interindividual or between‐subject variation in their report was lower than in our study, which suggests that cardiac troponins show larger variations in patients with CCS than in healthy individuals. The larger between‐subject variation in a diseased population compared with a healthy one is also confirmed by a study of Meijers et al, comparing biological variation in 83 patients with heart failure to 28 healthy subjects. They reported a coefficient of interindividual or between‐subject variation for hs‐cTnT of 96.6% and 51.2%, respectively. The CVs, however, were similar in both populations and comparable to our cohort.

### Questions and answers on workup diagnosis and risk stratification: A companion document of the 2020 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation [^1115aVg1]. European Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

There is no need for a second troponin assessment. The diagnosis of NSTEMI is made and appropriate treatment should be initiated. The positive predictive value for NSTEMI in patients with typical symptoms and a substantial (> 20 times the 99th percentile) elevation in cTn is > 90%. If the institution uses the ESC hs-cTn T 0h/1 h-algorithm, an initial hs-cTn T concentration above 52 ng/L allows triage of patients towards rule-in.

- **Scenarios of hs-cTn usage**: The next four scenarios highlight how to use the available different types of hs-cTn.

Q8. A 60-year-old patient without prior history of coronary artery disease (CAD) presents to the emergency department with right-sided thoracic chest pain. The last chest pain episode started 5 hours prior to hospital admission and is still ongoing. He is hemodynamically stable and the physical examination is normal. The 12-lead ECG is also normal. The initial hs-cTn T level is normal at 4 ng/L (ULN < 14 ng/L). The intern in the emergency department asks you as a cardiology consultant if this single very low hs-cTn T concentration allows the rule-out of NSTEMI.

### Point-of-care testing with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays: The challenges and opportunities [^1161jJyc]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2022). High credibility.

To understand the significant changes in this practice area, it is important to be aware of two key events that occurred following the introduction and subsequent development of cTn assays. First, the change from diagnosis using creatine kinase MB to cTn increased the risk of a biochemical false-positive from 0.044% (classified as abnormal when more than twice the 97.5th reference limit) to 1% (abnormal when above the 99th percentile). The second is the improvement in troponin assays. Early assays had inadequate sensitivity for detection of troponin. Progressive improvements in assay sensitivity, combined with the use of the 99th percentile, resulted in previously undiagnosed myocardial injury being detectable in a range of clinical conditions.

Currently, hs-cTn assays are in routine clinical use in many laboratories and are defined by two criteria. First, the coefficient of variation (CV) at the 99th percentile upper reference limit should be ≤ 10%, and second, measurable concentrations should be attainable at a concentration at or above the assay's limit of detection (LoD) for > 50% of healthy individuals. Hence, hs-cTn assays represent the reference analytical standard against which diagnostic strategies must now be compared.

At the time of writing, in each clinical situation where troponin elevation has been detected and where myocardial infarction (MI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is not suspected, the troponin elevation has been shown to be prognostic. More troponin is worse than less troponin, and no troponin is better than any troponin.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^1126j4H8]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

- **Kinetics of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I from symptom onset**: A spaghetti plot illustrates the concentration of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I in patients with myocardial injury and infarction. Patients are stratified by the adjudicated diagnosis: type 1 myocardial infarction (red), type 2 myocardial infarction (yellow), acute myocardial injury (blue), and chronic myocardial injury (gray). The plot is restricted to those patients whose troponin concentration exceeded the sex-specific 99th percentile during serial testing within 12 hours of presentation and for whom the time of symptom onset was known (n = 3845). Linear mixed-effects modeling, with random intercepts and slopes including quadratic terms for time, was performed with cardiac troponin I as the outcome. The model output, incorporating time from symptom onset, troponin levels, and changes in troponin concentration, is overlaid for each condition. The final model to estimate the trajectory of cardiac troponin I for each condition was selected based on the Akaike information criteria.

- **Absolute and relative changes in troponin I concentrations**: Violin-density and box-and-whisker plots illustrate the absolute and relative changes in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentration on serial testing in patients stratified by diagnosed condition: type 1 myocardial infarction (red) and type 2 myocardia…

### An algorithm for rule-in and rule-out of acute myocardial infarction using a novel troponin I assay [^115nScBg]. Heart (2017). High credibility.

To derive and validate a hybrid algorithm for rule-out and rule-in of acute myocardial infarction, measurements were taken at presentation and after two hours using a novel cardiac troponin I (cTnI) assay. The algorithm was derived and validated in two cohorts (605 and 592 patients) from multicentre studies enrolling chest pain patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) within 12 hours of onset of the last episode. The index diagnosis and cardiovascular events up to 30 days were adjudicated by independent reviewers.

In the validation cohort, 32.6% of the patients were ruled out upon ED presentation, 6.1% were ruled in, and 61.3% remained undetermined. A further 22% could be ruled out and 9.8% ruled in after two hours. In total, 54.6% of the patients were ruled out with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.4% (95% CI 97.8% to 99.9%) and a sensitivity of 97.7% (95% CI 91.9% to 99.7%); 15.8% were ruled in with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 74.5% (95% CI 64.8% to 82.2%) and a specificity of 95.2% (95% CI 93.0% to 96.9%); and 29.6% remained undetermined after two hours. No patient in the rule-out group died during the 30-day follow-up in the two cohorts.

This novel two-step algorithm based on cTnI measurements enabled just over a third of the patients with acute chest pain to be ruled in or ruled out already at presentation and an additional third after two hours. This strategy maximizes the speed of rule-out and rule-in while maintaining high NPV and PPV, respectively.

### Timing of peak troponin T and creatine kinase-MB elevations after percutaneous coronary intervention [^1125B3sE]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

The prognostic significance of elevations in creatine kinase-MB and troponin T (cTnT), which have been conventionally measured 6 to 8 hours after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), has been established. However, the time to peak biomarker appearance in the circulation has not been defined and is the purpose of this pilot study.

- **Design**: Nonrandomized, nonconsecutive patient cohort.

- **Setting**: Clinical practice, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.

- **Patients**: Cohort (n = 57) undergoing elective PCI.

- **Interventions**: cTnT and creatine kinase (CK)-MB measured at baseline, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, and ≥ 12 hours (mean ± SEM, 18 ± 5 hours) after PCI.

- **Measurements and results**: Postprocedure cTnT elevations were detected in 30 of 57 patients (53%). Of these, 4 of 30 patients (13%) had peak cTnT at 4 hours (0.80 ± 0.40 ng/mL), 5 of 30 patients (17%) had peak cTnT at 8 hours (1.07 ± 0.48 ng/mL), and 21 of 30 patients (70%) had peak cTnT at ≥ 12 hours (0.21 ± 0.06 ng/mL); 22 of 30 patients received abciximab. Elevations in CK-MB occurred in 14 of 57 patients (25%). Of these, 3 of 14 patients (21%) demonstrated peak CK-MB at 2 hours (18.5 ± 7.9 ng/mL) and the remainder (11 of 14 patients, 79%) during the 12- to 20-hour interval (20.2 ± 4.4 ng/mL); 12 of 14 patients received abciximab.

- **Conclusion**: More cTnT than CK-MB elevations occur after PCI; however, both biomarkers demonstrate a longer time to peak value than anticipated in clinical practice. Early surveillance monitoring (< 12 hours) does not detect peak biomarker levels, especially in patients with normal baseline values.

### Temporal changes of stable high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels and prognosis [^11432CHz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Data access: The authors declare that all supporting data are available within the article and its online supplemental files.

- **Data sources**: The study was based on data from seven large emergency departments (EDs) in Stockholm and Göteborg, Sweden, between December 9, 2009, and December 31, 2016. Data from each hospital's administrative databases were used to collect information on all ED visits by adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) during the study period. Laboratory data were obtained from local clinical chemistry databases. The Elecsys 2010 system (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was used to analyze high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs‐cTnT) levels at all sites. This assay has a detection limit of 5 ng/L, a 99th-percentile cutoff point of 14 ng/L, and a coefficient of variation of < 10% at 13 ng/L.

- **Data linkage**: Data were thereafter sent to the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare for linking with a range of health data registers, providing data on comorbidities, use of medication, and mortality, including causes of death. Data were obtained from the National Patient Register (NPR), the Prescribed Drug Register, and the Causes of Death Register, respectively. Detailed data on myocardial infarction (MI) diagnoses were obtained from the SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web System for Enhancement and Development of Evidence‐Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) register, which is a nationwide registry that collects information on all patients admitted to a coronary care unit in Sweden. Both NPR and SWEDEHEART are national registries with excellent nationwide coverage and accuracy for MI diagnoses.

### Implications of lowering threshold of plasma troponin concentration in diagnosis of myocardial infarction: Cohort study [^116qRCaD]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between troponin concentration, assay precision, and clinical outcomes in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome. This research was conducted as a cohort study at a tertiary center in Scotland.

The study involved 2,092 consecutive patients admitted with suspected acute coronary syndrome. These patients were stratified into three groups based on their levels of troponin I, measured using a sensitive assay: < 0.012 µg/L, 0.012–0.049 µg/L, and ≥ 0.050 µg/L. These thresholds were defined by the 99th percentile for troponin concentration (0.012 µg/L) with a coefficient of variation of 20.8% and the diagnostic threshold (0.050 µg/L) with a coefficient of variation of 7.2%.

- **Main outcome measure**: One-year survival without events such as myocardial infarction or death in patients grouped by troponin concentration.

- **Results**: Troponin I concentrations were < 0.012 µg/L in 988 patients (47%), 0.012–0.049 µg/L in 352 patients (17%), and ≥ 0.050 µg/L in 752 patients (36%). Adopting the 99th percentile threshold would increase the number of people diagnosed with myocardial infarction from 752 to 1,104, a relative increase of 47%. At one year, patients with troponin concentrations of 0.012–0.049 µg/L were more likely to be dead or readmitted with myocardial infarction than those with troponin concentrations < 0.012 µg/L (13% vs. 3%, P < 0.001; odds ratio 4.7, 95% confidence interval 2.9 to 7.9). Compared with patients who had troponin levels ≥ 0.050 µg/L, those with troponin levels of 0.012–0.049 µg/L had a higher risk profile but were less likely to be diagnosed with, or investigated and treated for, acute coronary syndrome.

The study concluded that lowering the diagnostic threshold to the 99th percentile, accepting greater assay imprecision, would significantly alter the diagnosis landscape.

### Utility of serial conventional troponin testing for emergency department patients stratified by HEART score and symptom timing [^11554hVV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The HEART score for risk stratifying chest pain patients in the emergency department (ED) has been widely adopted in clinical practice but is often employed with nonconformant serial troponin measurements. The primary objective of this study was to examine the utility of obtaining a second conventional 3-hour troponin I (TnI) level in ED patients presenting with potential acute coronary syndrome (ACS), stratified by HEART score and duration of symptoms.

This was a retrospective cohort study of consecutive adult ED patients with a complete HEART score. We assessed the utility of repeat TnI measurement by examining the positivity rate of ΔTnI = [Second TnI] - [Initial TnI] stratified by HEART score and time elapsed since onset or resolution of symptoms. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) within 6 weeks of the index visit were assessed.

A total of 944 patients were included, with 433 (45.9%) assigned a low-risk HEART score of 0–3. Of the 268 (61.9%) low-risk HEART score patients receiving a second TnI, only 3 (1.1% [0.2–3.2%]) resulted in a positive ΔTnI, one of which occurred in the setting of an elevated initial TnI. Overall, patients presenting within 3 hours of symptoms were more likely to experience positive ΔTnI, index MACE, and MACE at 6 weeks compared to patients presenting ≥ 3 hours since symptom onset/resolution and patients with unknown timing of symptoms (15.9% vs. 11.0% vs. 10.3%, p < 0.001; 10.0% vs. 5.3% vs. 4.6%, p = 0.021; 12.7% vs. 6.6% vs. 6.4%, p = 0.047).

Our data suggest serial measurements of conventional troponin provide important clinical insights.

### Troponin: Think before you request one [^111GQEke]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Low credibility.

The measurement of cardiac troponin (cTn) has revolutionized the evaluation and management of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Recent consensus statements endorse the use of cTnI or cTnT as the biomarker of choice for such applications.

Elevated cTn values outside of ACS are not uncommon and reflect cardiomyocyte necrosis from a wide array of cardiac, pulmonary, and systemic diseases. A clinician must be familiar with the broad differential diagnosis of an elevated cTn to avoid the false attribution of "acute myocardial infarction" (MI) in a patient without ACS, thus reducing the burden of unnecessary work and admission rates for the hospital.

Another aspect of the problem is the financial impact of haphazard testing in hospitals that are part of an NHS already struggling to keep up with its demands and supplies. It was observed that, in most cases, a troponin request was just a routine "tick box" practice that led to a lot of unnecessary processing. This led to requests for these tests even before the patient was assessed by a clinician.

It was also identified that troponin was often being used as a differentiating tool to provide a conclusion in the absence of an appropriate clinical history or examination, which should be the mainstay in any clinical scenario. An improvement project focusing on such potentially avoidable and otherwise quite useful investigations can be of great value for the hospital trust, as well as allowing the NHS to keep up with its aim of better quality at low cost.

### Convalescent troponin and cardiovascular death following acute coronary syndrome [^111fHGff]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing is used in the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes; however, its role during convalescence is unknown. This study investigated the long-term prognostic significance of serial convalescent high-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentrations following acute coronary syndrome.

In a prospective multicentre observational cohort study of 2,140 patients with acute coronary syndrome, cardiac troponin I concentrations were measured in 1,776 patients at 4 and 12 months following the index event. Patients were stratified into three groups according to the troponin concentration at 4 months using the 99th centile (women > 16 ng/L, men > 34 ng/L) and median concentration of those within the reference range. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death.

Troponin concentrations at 4 months were measurable in 99.0% (1,759/1,776) of patients (67 ± 12 years, 72% male). Concentrations were ≤ 5 ng/L (median) and > 99th centile in 44.8% (795) and 9.3% (166) of patients, respectively. There were 202 (11.4%) cardiovascular deaths following a median of 4.8 years. After adjusting for the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events score, troponin remained an independent predictor of cardiovascular death (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.5 per doubling), with the highest risk observed in those with increasing concentrations at 12 months. Patients with 4-month troponin concentrations > 99th centile were at increased risk of cardiovascular death compared with those ≤ 5 ng/L (29.5% (49/166) vs 4.3% (34/795); adjusted HR 4.9, 95% CI 3.8 to 23.7).

### Serial changes in highly sensitive troponin I assay and early diagnosis of myocardial infarction [^116ahwDc]. JAMA (2011). Low credibility.

The introduction of highly sensitive troponin assays into clinical practice has substantially improved the evaluation of patients with chest pain.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a highly sensitive troponin I (hsTnI) assay compared with a contemporary troponin I (cTnI) assay and their serial changes in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

- **Design, setting, and patients**: A total of 1818 patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome were consecutively enrolled at the chest pain units of the University Heart Center Hamburg, the University Medical Center Mainz, and the Federal Armed Forces Hospital Koblenz, all in Germany, from 2007 to 2008. Twelve biomarkers, including hsTnI (level of detection, 3.4 pg/mL) and cTnI (level of detection, 10 pg/mL), were measured on admission and after 3 and 6 hours.

- **Main outcome measures**: Diagnostic performance for AMI of baseline and serial changes in hsTnI and cTnI results at 3 hours after admission to the emergency department.

- **Results**: Of the 1818 patients, 413 (22.7%) were diagnosed with AMI. For the discrimination of AMI, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95–0.97) for hsTnI on admission and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.90–0.94) for cTnI on admission, both of which were superior to the other evaluated diagnostic biomarkers. The use of hsTnI at admission (with the diagnostic cutoff value at the 99th percentile of 30 pg/mL) had a sensitivity of 82.3% and a negative predictive value (for ruling out AMI) of 94.7%. The use of cTnI (with the diagnostic cutoff value at the 99…

### Convalescent troponin and cardiovascular death following acute coronary syndrome [^115aGetH]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

Taken alongside these reports, our study has important clinical implications regarding the measurement of troponin following an acute coronary syndrome. The American Heart Association estimates that 720,000 individuals within the United States alone will experience a first fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction during 2018. A further 335,000 will have a recurrent event. This sizeable residual risk persists despite major therapeutic advances, including potent preventative therapies and early revascularization. Improving long-term outcomes in a cost-effective manner will require improved therapeutic targeting.

Within this context, troponin testing is inexpensive and already widely available in clinical practice. In the face of resource constraints, troponin concentrations could be used to guide the use of more costly investigations and in targeting treatments at the subgroup of patients identified to be at greatest risk of adverse events. We have shown that troponin concentrations increase as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) declines, and identifying this pattern could prompt clinicians to reassess cardiac function and encourage uptitration of risk-modifying drugs such as inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system.

- **Relationship between troponin and blood pressure**: The relationship between increasing blood pressure and troponin reinforces the importance of optimization of blood pressure-lowering therapies.

- **Troponin-guided care relevance**: Troponin-guided care may have particular relevance when considering the appropriate use of novel therapeutic agents such as inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin–kexin type 9 and the anti-inflammatory drug canakinumab.
