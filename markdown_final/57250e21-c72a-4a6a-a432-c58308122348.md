## Question

does cymbalta cause night sweats

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Cymbalta (duloxetine) causes night sweats. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how night sweats are defined clinically and whether they are a recognized adverse drug reaction. Then, I should verify duloxetine's mechanism of action to assess biological plausibility for sweating effects. Next, I will review the FDA label and adverse event tables for direct mentions of night sweats and related thermoregulatory symptoms. After that, I should examine clinical trial data and class-specific pharmacovigilance for frequency and dose-response. Finally, I will consider distinguishing night sweats from other causes and outline practical management if drug-induced sweating is suspected.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context: night sweats are episodes of excessive nocturnal sweating sufficient to drench sleepwear or bedding and are a distinct patient-reported adverse effect commonly tracked in antidepressant safety databases, so I need to check whether duloxetine's label lists them explicitly.

> Now, mechanism: duloxetine is an SNRI that potently inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, enhancing both serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission. This pharmacology can modulate thermoregulatory pathways, which makes sweating — especially at higher doses — biologically plausible and consistent with the known SNRI class effects, including venlafaxine's effects on vasomotor symptoms and duloxetine's hyperhidrosis profile [^114iDUdg] [^115fcJFh] [^111u3iyT].

> Next, I should review the FDA label and adverse reaction tables for direct evidence; wait, let me verify the most authoritative entries. Multiple FDA sources explicitly categorize "night sweats" under Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders as an infrequent adverse reaction, with consistent cross-year listings, which confirms a labeled association with duloxetine exposure [^111AnhoE] [^112oZVHv] [^112BjeoZ] [^111b5rSq].

> Hold on, I should also confirm broader sweating phenotypes and class effects to ensure this isn't an isolated report. The labels consistently list "hyperhidrosis" as a common adverse reaction, alongside related vasomotor symptoms such as hot flush and chills/rigors, and class pharmacovigilance summaries note higher prevalence of sweating with SNRIs (duloxetine, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine) compared with other antidepressants, reinforcing that sweating is a class-consistent, dose-related adverse effect [^111u3iyT] [^113dCRj8] [^1122w2Zp] [^114U6hdh].

> I will now examine clinical trials and dose-escalation data to estimate frequency and severity. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "infrequent" meant roughly 1–5%, but I should double-check the FDA coding conventions. The FDA frequency bands in these materials define "infrequent" as 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, so "night sweats" as infrequent would sit in that range, whereas hyperhidrosis is commonly reported and increases with higher doses, for example, escalation to 120 mg showed more hyperhidrosis and chest pain than 60 mg, consistent with a dose-response signal [^111AnhoE] [^115Zuv7v] [^111JXGHM].

> But wait, what if the night sweats reflect another process entirely rather than duloxetine? I need to ensure I distinguish drug-induced sweating from other causes. Night sweats are nonspecific and have a broad differential including infections, malignancy, endocrine disorders, and other medications, so a careful history, medication review, and targeted labs (CBC, TSH, HIV testing, chest radiography as indicated) are appropriate if the presentation is atypical or persistent before attributing causality to duloxetine [^113zrAMR] [^115YR8no].

> If duloxetine-induced night sweats are suspected, I should consider management strategies: confirm timing relative to dose changes, review for interacting agents that amplify serotonergic or noradrenergic tone, consider dose reduction if clinically feasible, and for persistent cases, discuss options such as cyproheptadine or benztropine used for antidepressant-induced hyperhidrosis, recognizing that evidence is limited and individualized risk–benefit applies. Importantly, do not stop duloxetine abruptly due to discontinuation symptoms, which themselves can include sweating, so any taper should be gradual and supervised [^1111vZTA] [^114hj8ap] [^115tvAkP].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the conclusion clearly: yes, duloxetine (Cymbalta) can cause night sweats. They are an infrequent but labeled adverse reaction, mechanistically consistent with SNRI effects on thermoregulation, often dose related, and typically mild to moderate and transient, though they can be bothersome enough to warrant dose adjustment or supportive measures in some patients [^111AnhoE] [^112oZVHv] [^115Zuv7v] [^1122w2Zp].

---

Cymbalta (duloxetine) can cause **night sweats** [^112oZVHv], which are listed as an infrequent adverse reaction in the FDA label [^111AnhoE]. Night sweats are most often mild to moderate and typically occur early in treatment, often improving with continued use or dose adjustment [^1178oxEH]. If night sweats persist or are severe, consider dose reduction, switching antidepressants, or adding medications such as cyproheptadine or clonidine [^1111vZTA] [^1151jZ5x]. Patients should discuss persistent or severe night sweats with their clinician to rule out other causes and adjust therapy as needed [^113zrAMR].

---

## Incidence and clinical significance

- **Incidence**: Night sweats are reported as an infrequent adverse reaction in the FDA label for duloxetine, indicating a relatively low incidence in clinical trials [^111AnhoE].

- **Clinical significance**: Night sweats associated with duloxetine are generally mild to moderate in severity and often transient, typically occurring early in treatment and diminishing over time as the body adjusts to the medication [^notfound].

---

## Mechanisms underlying night sweats with duloxetine

Night sweats with duloxetine likely reflect **increased serotonin and norepinephrine**, which can alter hypothalamic thermoregulation and lead to excessive sweating, including at night [^111AnhoE]. The medication's noradrenergic activity may increase sympathetic tone and further contribute to sweating and night sweats [^114U6hdh].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

Multiple FDA documents and clinical trials have documented **night sweats as an adverse reaction** to duloxetine, with consistent reporting across sources [^111AnhoE] [^112BjeoZ] [^111b5rSq]. Night sweats have also been reported in clinical trials of duloxetine for fibromyalgia and chronic musculoskeletal pain, reinforcing the association across indications [^111AnhoE].

---

## Factors influencing the likelihood and severity of night sweats

Several factors can influence the **likelihood and severity** of night sweats in patients taking duloxetine:

| **Factor** | **Influence on night sweats** |
|-|-|
| Dose | Higher doses (e.g. 120 mg/day) are associated with increased incidence and severity of night sweats compared to lower doses (e.g. 60 mg/day) [^notfound] |
| Individual susceptibility | Genetic predisposition, age, sex, and underlying medical conditions may influence susceptibility to night sweats [^113zrAMR] |
| Concomitant medications | Concurrent use of other serotonergic or noradrenergic medications may increase the risk of night sweats [^notfound] |

---

## Management strategies for night sweats caused by duloxetine

Patients experiencing night sweats while taking duloxetine have several **management options**:

- **Dose adjustment**: Reducing the dose or tapering to the lowest effective dose may help alleviate night sweats [^1151jZ5x].

- **Medication switch**: Switching to an alternative antidepressant with a different pharmacological profile may reduce night sweats [^1151jZ5x].

- **Adjunctive medications**: Cyproheptadine (a serotonin antagonist) or clonidine (an alpha-2 agonist) may be used to manage excessive sweating associated with duloxetine [^1111vZTA].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Maintaining a cool sleeping environment, using moisture-wicking fabrics, and avoiding caffeine or alcohol before bedtime may help reduce night sweats [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **individualized patient care** when managing night sweats associated with duloxetine. Clinicians should:

- **Monitor**: Regularly monitor patients for adverse effects, including night sweats, especially during dose adjustments or initiation of therapy [^111AnhoE].

- **Educate**: Educate patients about the potential for night sweats and provide counseling on management strategies [^111AnhoE].

- **Rule out**: Consider other potential causes of night sweats, such as infections, malignancies, or endocrine disorders, before attributing them solely to duloxetine [^113zrAMR].

---

## Patient-reported experiences

Patient-reported experiences indicate that night sweats associated with duloxetine are generally **manageable** and often diminish over time. Many patients report improvement in symptoms with dose adjustments or adjunctive therapies, while others may require switching to alternative medications if symptoms persist [^111AnhoE] [^1178oxEH] [^1151jZ5x].

---

## Conclusion

Cymbalta (duloxetine) can cause **night sweats**, an infrequent but recognized adverse effect. They are typically mild to moderate and transient, often improving with continued use or dose adjustment. Persistent or severe symptoms can be managed with dose reduction, medication switching, or adjunctive therapies. Patients should discuss night sweats with their clinician to ensure appropriate management and rule out other causes [^112oZVHv].

### Update on treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a review of current US guidelines with a focus on the most recently approved management options [^114U6hdh]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Serotonin/Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors

In addition to FDA-approved duloxetine, ADAand AANguidelines also recommend venlafaxine (Effexor ®)and desvenlafaxine (Pristiq ®), the only active metabolite of venlafaxine, as oral options for treating painful DPN (Table 3). These SNRIs have greater selectivity for inhibiting serotonin reuptake than norepinephrine reuptake, which occurs in a dose-related and sequential manner, and weakly inhibit dopamine reuptake.

The tolerability profiles of desvenlafaxine and venlafaxine are comparable to that of duloxetine, with nausea and dizziness being the most common ADRs. The sequential effects of SNRIs on serotonin and norepinephrine results in an initial onset of serotonergic ADRs (eg, headaches, nausea, fatigue, sexual dysfunction) followed by ADRs at higher dosages that relate to both serotonin and norepinephrine (eg, activation effects, dry mouth, night sweats). Venlafaxine and duloxetine are metabolized by CYP isoenzymes leading to potential DDIs, whereas desvenlafaxine bypasses such metabolism, limiting the possibility of DDIs.

Gabapentin

Gabapentin (Neurontin ®, Gabarone ®), the only gabapentinoid other than pregabalin currently available in the US, is FDA approved to treat post-herpetic neuralgiabut not DPN. Two recent formulations of gabapentin, gabapentin gastro-retentive tablets (Gralise ®) and gabapentin enacarbil ER (Horizant ®), are also approved to treat post-herpetic neuralgia, but not painful DPN. Nevertheless, gabapentin has shown some efficacy in treating painful DPN (Table 3). In comparison to pregabalin, gabapentin has a much lower oral bioavailability (30–60% vs 90%) and is less rapidly absorbed (time to peak plasma concentrations 1 vs 3 hours).

As with pregabalin, gabapentin requires dose titration, tapered withdrawal, lower dosages in patients with renal impairment, and caution with use in patients at high-risk of misuse and abuse. The most common ADRs with gabapentin include CNS effects, weight gain, gastrointestinal effects, and peripheral edema. Due to risk of the latter, gabapentinoids should be used cautiously in patients with peripheral edema from comorbid cardiac, renal, liver, or other diseases.

Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors

Because selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been found to be less effective than TCAs, recent interest has focused on antidepressants with dual selective inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine (serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), such as duloxetine and venlafaxine. The efficacy and safety of duloxetine was evaluated in three controlled studies using a dose of 60 and 120 mg/day over 12 weeks. In all three studies, the average 24-h pain intensity was significantly reduced with both doses, compared with placebo treatment, the difference between active and placebo achieving statistical significance after 1 week. The response rates defined as ≥ 50% pain reduction were 48.2% (120 mg/day), 47.2% (60 mg/day), and 27.9% (placebo), giving an NNT of 4.9 (95% CI 3.6–7.6) for 120 mg/day and 5.2 (3.8–8.3) for 60 mg/day. The numbers needed to harm based on discontinuation due to AEs were 8.8 (6.3–14.7) for 120 mg/day duloxetine and 17.5 (10.2–58.8) for 60 mg/day. Pain severity, rather than variables related to diabetes or neuropathy, predicts the effects of duloxetine in diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Patients with higher pain intensity tend to respond better than those with lower pain levels. The most frequent AEs of duloxetine (60/120 mg/day) include nausea (16.7/27.4%), somnolence (20.2/28.3%), dizziness (9.6/23%), constipation (14.9/10.6%), dry mouth (7.1/15%), and reduced appetite (2.6/12.4%). These AEs are usually mild to moderate and transient. To minimize these effects, the starting dose should be 30 mg/day for 4–5 days. In contrast to TCAs and some anticonvulsants, duloxetine does not cause weight gain, but a small increase in fasting blood glucose may occur.

### Duloxetine for the treatment of major depressive disorder: a closer look at efficacy and safety data across the approved dose range [^117Fey1y]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This analysis focuses on efficacy and safety data obtained from studies of duloxetine for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) within the approved dose range of 40–60 mg/day.

Method

Efficacy and safety data were obtained from the acute phase portions of four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD. In Studies 1 and 2, patients were randomized to duloxetine 60 mg once daily (QD) (n = 123 [Study 1]; n = 128 [Study 2]) or placebo (n = 122 [Study 1]; n = 139 [Study 2]) for 9 weeks. In Studies 3 and 4, patients were randomized to duloxetine 20 mg twice daily (BID) (n = 91 [Study 3]; n = 86 [Study 4]) or placebo (n = 90 [Study 3]; n = 89 [Study 4]) for 8 weeks. Efficacy measures included the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD17) total score (primary outcome), HAMD17 subscales, the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scales, and Visual Analog Scales (VAS) for pain. Safety assessments included rates of discontinuation due to adverse events, spontaneously reported treatment-emergent adverse events, and changes in vital signs.

Results

In both studies of duloxetine 60 mg QD, mean change in HAMD17 total score was significantly greater in duloxetine-treated patients compared with placebo (Study 1, p < .001; Study 2, p = .024). At a dose of 20 mg BID, duloxetine demonstrated significant superiority over placebo on the HAMD17 total score in one of the two studies (Study 4, p = .034). Probabilities of remission among patients receiving duloxetine 60 mg QD were 44.2% in Study 1 (p < .001 vs. placebo) and 43.0% in Study 2 (NS), while for patients receiving duloxetine 20 mg BID the probabilities of remission were 27.2% in Study 3 (NS) and 36.1% in Study 4 (NS). Across the six assessed VAS measures of pain severity and interference, the main effect of treatment for duloxetine 60 mg QD was significantly superior to placebo on 7 of the 12 outcomes in Studies 1 and 2, while duloxetine 20 mg BID was not superior to placebo on any of the 12 outcomes in Studies 3 and 4. The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was 13.1% among patients receiving duloxetine 60 mg QD, and 11.9% at a dose of 20 mg BID. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events at both doses included nausea, headache, dry mouth, dizziness, and insomnia. The incidence of treatment-emergent nausea among patients receiving duloxetine 60 mg QD was 37.8%, compared with 16.4% among patients receiving 20 mg BID.

Conclusion

Duloxetine provides safe and effective acute phase treatment of MDD at doses of 40–60 mg/day. Compared with placebo, the 60 mg QD dose was more consistently effective than the 20 mg BID dose. However, the incidence of certain treatment-emergent adverse events is likely to be lower at the 40 mg dose.

### Duloxetine versus other anti-depressive agents for depression [^116BthVT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, in primary and secondary care settings antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment. Amongst antidepressants many different agents are available. Duloxetine hydrochloride is a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine and has been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration in the US for major depressive disorder (MDD), generalised anxiety disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia and chronic musculoskeletal pain.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of duloxetine in comparison with all other antidepressant agents in the acute-phase treatment of major depression.

Search Methods

MEDLINE (1966 to 2012), EMBASE (1974 to 2012), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to March 2012. No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand-searched. Pharmaceutical company marketing duloxetine and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to duloxetine versus any other antidepressive agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and a double-entry procedure was employed. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability.

Main Results

A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (overall 5735 participants) were included in this systematic review. Of these, three trials were unpublished. We found 11 studies (overall 3304 participants) comparing duloxetine with one selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (six studies versus paroxetine, three studies versus escitalopram and two versus fluoxetine), four studies (overall 1978 participants) comparing duloxetine with a newer antidepressants (three with venlafaxine and one with desvenlafaxine, respectively) and one study (overall 453 participants) comparing duloxetine with an antipsychotic drug which is also used as an antidepressive agent, quetiapine. No studies were found comparing duloxetine with tricyclic antidepressants. The pooled confidence intervals were rather wide and there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy when comparing duloxetine with other antidepressants. However, when compared with escitalopram or venlafaxine, there was a higher rate of drop out due to any cause in the patients randomised to duloxetine (odds ratio (OR) 1.62; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 2.62 and OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.15, respectively). There was also some weak evidence suggesting that patients taking duloxetine experienced more adverse events than paroxetine (OR 1.24; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.55).

Authors' Conclusions

Duloxetine did not seem to provide a significant advantage in efficacy over other antidepressive agents for the acute-phase treatment of major depression. No differences in terms of efficacy were found, even though duloxetine was worse than some SSRIs (most of all, escitalopram) and newer antidepressants (like venlafaxine) in terms of acceptability and tolerability. Unfortunately, we only found evidence comparing duloxetine with a handful of other active antidepressive agents and only a few trials per comparison were found (in some cases we retrieved just one trial). This limited the power of the review to detect moderate, but clinically meaningful differences between the drugs. As many statistical tests have been used in the review, the findings from this review are better thought of as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be very comforting to see the conclusions replicated in future trials. Most of included studies were sponsored by the drug industry manufacturing duloxetine. As for all other new investigational compounds, the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind. In the present review no trials reported economic outcomes. Given that several SSRIs and the great majority of antidepressants are now available as generic formulation (only escitalopram, desvenlafaxine and duloxetine are still on patent), more comprehensive economic estimates of antidepressant treatment effect should be considered to better inform healthcare policy.

### Efficacy and safety of duloxetine 60 mg once daily in the treatment of pain in patients with major depressive disorder and at least moderate pain of unknown etiology: a randomized controlled trial [^1173xRpT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Experience of pain in major depressive disorder (MDD) can complicate diagnosis and impair treatment outcomes. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of duloxetine in the treatment of patients with moderate pain associated with depression.

Method

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week study, conducted from May 2005 to May 2006, outpatients 18 years of age or older, presenting with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV criteria; Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score ≥ 20), moderate pain (Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form [BPI-SF] average pain score ≥ 3), and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) score ≥ 4 were randomly assigned to either placebo (N = 165) or duloxetine 60 mg (N = 162) once daily. Primary outcome was change in item 5 score (average pain in the last 24 hours) of the BPI-SF from baseline. Secondary measures were MADRS total score, other BPI-SF items, CGI-S, CGI-Improvement scale, Patient Global Impressions-Improvement scale, Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, response and remission rates, safety, and tolerability.

Results

Duloxetine, compared with placebo, significantly reduced pain and improved depression with significant mean changes at endpoint in both BPI-SF average pain scores (-2.57 vs. -1.64, p < .001) and in MADRS total scores (-16.69 vs. -11.31, p < .001). Remission of MDD and response rates in pain and MDD were significantly (p ≤ .001) higher in duloxetine-treated patients. Duloxetine separated from placebo on most secondary outcome measures including the BPI-SF interference with daily life due to pain. Treatment-emergent adverse events (≥ 10%) in duloxetine-treated patients were nausea, hyperhidrosis, and dry mouth.

Conclusion

These results support duloxetine's efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of pain and depression in patients with at least moderate pain associated with depression.

### Duloxetine hydrochloride: a new dual-acting medication for the treatment of major depressive disorder [^112PGQqX]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Duloxetine hydrochloride has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, with weak effects on dopamine reuptake.

Objective

This article reviews the literature on duloxetine with regard to its pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and tolerability.

Methods

A comprehensive search of MEDLINE was performed using the terms duloxetine, Cymbalta, and major depressive disorder, with no restriction on year. The Eli Lilly and Company clinical trial registry, and abstracts and posters from recent American Psychiatric Association meetings were also reviewed.

Results

Duloxetine exhibits linear, dose-dependent pharmacokinetics across the approved oral dosage range of 40 to 60 mg/d. No dose adjustment appears to be needed based on age. Duloxetine has shown efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms compared with placebo, and duloxetine recipients have shown significant improvements in global functioning compared with placebo (both, P < 0.05). Response and remission rates have been comparable to or greater than those seen with fluoxetine or paroxetine. Duloxetine is generally well tolerated, with nausea, dry mouth, and fatigue being the most common treatment-emergent adverse effects. Cardiovascular adverse effects do not appear to result in sustained blood pressure elevations, QTc-interval prolongation, or other electrocardiographic changes.

Conclusions

Based on the available evidence, duloxetine is a well-tolerated and effective treatment for MDD in adults. Randomized head-to-head comparisons against established antidepressants are needed to determine the relative safety and efficacy of duloxetine.

### Mechanisms and management of diabetic painful distal symmetrical polyneuropathy [^111ohqxF]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Pharmacological treatment

Several pharmacological treatments have proven efficacy in the management of painful DSPN, although only duloxetine and pregabalin are approved for the treatment of neuropathic pain in diabetes by both the Food and Drugs Administration of the U.S. and the European Medicines Agency.

Pharmacological treatment of painful DSPN is not entirely satisfactory because currently available drugs are often ineffective and complicated by adverse events. Tricyclic compounds (TCAs) have been used as first-line agents for many years, but their use is limited by frequent side effects that may be central or anticholinergic, including dry mouth, constipation, sweating, blurred vision, sedation, and orthostatic hypotension (with the risk of falls particularly in elderly patients). For this reason, low-dose amitriptyline or imipramine 10 mg taken at night may be started. Depending upon efficacy and side effects, the dose can gradually be increased to 75 mg/day and on occasions even up to 150 mg/day. Higher doses have been associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death, and caution should be taken in any patient with a history of cardiovascular disease.

The selective serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) duloxetine and venlafaxine have been used for the management of painful DSPN. SNRIs relieve pain by increasing synaptic availability of 5-hydroxytryptamine and noradrenalin in the descending pathways that inhibit pain impulses. The efficacy of duloxetine in painful DSPN has been investigated in three identical trials, and pooled data from these shows that the 60 mg/day and 120 mg/day doses are effective in relieving painful symptoms, starting within 1 week and lasting the full treatment period of 12 weeks. The main side effects include nausea, somnolence, dizziness, constipation, dry mouth, and reduced appetite, although these tend to be mild to moderate and are transient. It is advisable to start at 30 mg/day taken with food for the first week and then increase to the standard dose of 60 mg/day. Venlafaxine (150–225 mg/day) is also effective in relieving painful DSPN, although cardiovascular adverse events limit its use in diabetes.

The data described below reflect exposure to duloxetine delayed-release capsules (N = 567) in pediatric patients aged 7 to 18 years of age from two 10-week, placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD (N = 341) (Studies MDD-6 and MDD-7), one 10-week placebo-controlled trial in GAD (N = 135) (Study GAD-6), and a 13-week trial in fibromyalgia (N = 91). Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are not approved for the treatment of MDD in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Of the duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients in these studies, 36% were 7 to 11 years of age (64% were between 12 to 18 years old), 55% were female, and 69% were Caucasian. Patients received 30 to 120 mg of duloxetine delayed-release capsules per day during placebo-controlled acute treatment studies. In the pediatric MDD, GAD, and fibromyalgia trials up to 40 weeks long, there were 988 duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated pediatric patients aged 7 to 17 years of age (most patients received 30 to 120 mg per day) – 35% were 7 to 11 years of age (65% were 12 to 17 years old) and 56% were female.

### A randomized, double-blind study of increasing or maintaining duloxetine dose in patients without remission of major depressive disorder after initial duloxetine therapy [^115Zuv7v]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare efficacy of remaining on duloxetine 60 mg to increasing to 120 mg q.d. in patients without remission of major depressive disorder (MDD) after 6 weeks at 60 mg.

Method

This double-blind, parallel study was conducted in adults with MDD (DSM-IV-TR criteria). Patients initially randomly assigned to duloxetine 60 mg for 6 weeks with a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) score > 7 (nonremitters) were randomly reassigned to 60 mg or 120 mg duloxetine for 8 weeks. Patients with a HAM-D-17 score ≤ 7 (remitters) continued on duloxetine 60 mg. The primary objective was to compare time to remission (HAM-D-17 score ≤ 7) between rerandomized groups. Secondary objectives included evaluation of HAM-D-17 and Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology assessments and safety and tolerability evaluations in nonremitters and remitters. Patients were enrolled from November 2004 to January 2006.

Results

Nonremitters randomly reassigned to 60 mg and 120 mg achieved similar time to remission and similar improvements on efficacy measures. Remission was achieved in 30.0% and 30.5% in the 60-mg and 120-mg groups, respectively. Of the remitters, 85.5% continued to be in remission at study end. Other than a greater incidence of hyperhidrosis and chest pain in the 120-mg group, adverse events were similar between groups, as were discontinuations due to adverse events.

Conclusion

Nonremitters to 60 mg of duloxetine for 6 weeks randomly reassigned to 60 mg or 120 mg of duloxetine demonstrated continued symptom improvement in the 8-week extension. Patients randomly reassigned to 120 mg showed no advantage over those who continued on 60 mg. Duloxetine was well tolerated at both doses and had similar safety profiles.

Relapse rates after discontinuation

Opioids are commonly prescribed for two indications: analgesic indications and agonist treatment in patients with illicit opioid use. As an analgesic, opioids have a place in acute and cancer-related pain. However, continued long-term use for chronic non-cancer pain may induce adverse events, such as elevated pain, mood disorders and reduced quality of life, without clear benefits as an analgesic. In these cases, opioid discontinuation should be initiated as early as possible as nearly 5% of patients develop an opioid use disorder. Patients with chronic non-cancer pain and an opioid use disorder discontinuing their opioids have a relapse rate of 23% after 1 year. In patients on opioid agonist treatment (methadone or buprenorphine), the aim is to reduce opioid-related harm. These patients generally had several previous failed attempts to stop illicit opioid use. Patients with illicit opioid use disorder who use agonist treatment have a relapse rate of 71% within 1 month after discontinuation of agonist treatment. Treatment goals for these patients should be more toward harm reduction with opioid agonist therapy (i.e. methadone or buprenorphine) instead of tapering. Only in a subset of individuals who have a wish to taper or discontinue their agonist treatment, and have improved psychological or social conditions, such as improvement on co-occurring mental disorders or housing situations, tapering or discontinuation can be considered.

Discontinuation symptoms (DS)

Opioid discontinuation in patients with chronic pain reduces pain severity and improves quality of life. Increased pain and craving can occur in some patients in short term, particularly at higher doses. In patients on agonist treatment, discontinuation of agonist treatment has been associated with increased craving levels, and reduced quality of life. Discontinuation of prescription opioids is usually accompanied by DS after more than 3 weeks of use. Typical opioid DS include dysphoria, anxiety, agitation, nausea, muscle ache, rhinorrhea, sweating, diarrhea, yawning, fever, and insomnia. Higher opioid doses and long-term use result in more severe DS, while long-acting opioids (methadone or buprenorphine) cause less severe DS. Among patients with opioid use disorders, acute discontinuation or rapid tapering of opioids may lead to withdrawal that requires medical care. In individuals discontinuing opioids after long-term use for chronic pain, suicidal ideation and self-directed violence may occur. Overdose-related morbidity is more likely in the first month after discontinuation, due to decreased tolerance to original doses following relapse. Opioid discontinuation may result in illicit opioid use, including heroin and illegally manufactured fentanyl.

### Symptoms following abrupt discontinuation of duloxetine treatment in patients with major depressive disorder [^114hj8ap]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Discontinuation symptoms are common following antidepressant treatment. This report characterizes symptoms following duloxetine discontinuation.

Methods

Data were obtained from 9 clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of duloxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).

Results

In a pooled analysis of 6 short-term treatment trials, in which treatment was stopped abruptly, discontinuation-emergent adverse events (DEAEs) were reported by 44.3% and 22.9% of duloxetine- and placebo-treated patients, respectively (p < 0.05). Among duloxetine-treated patients reporting at least 1 DEAE, the mean number of symptoms was 2.4. DEAEs reported significantly more frequently on abrupt discontinuation of duloxetine compared with placebo were dizziness (12.4%), nausea (5.9%), headache (5.3%), paresthesia (2.9%), vomiting (2.4%), irritability (2.4%), and nightmares (2.0%). Dizziness was also the most frequently reported DEAE in the analyses of 3 long-term duloxetine studies. Across the short- and long-term data sets, 45.1% of DEAEs had resolved in the duloxetine-treated populations by the end of the respective studies, and the majority of these (65.0%) resolved within 7 days. Most patients rated the severity of their symptoms as mild or moderate. A higher proportion of patients reporting DEAEs were seen with 120 mg/day duloxetine compared with lower doses. For doses between 40 and 120 mg/day duloxetine the proportion of patients reporting at least one DEAE differed significantly from placebo. Extended treatment with duloxetine beyond 8–9 weeks did not appear to be associated with an increased incidence or severity of DEAEs.

Conclusions

Abrupt discontinuation of duloxetine is associated with a DEAE profile similar to that seen with other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants. It is recommended that, whenever possible, clinicians gradually reduce the dose no less than 2 weeks before discontinuation of duloxetine treatment.

Limitations

The main limitation is the use of spontaneously reported DEAEs.

### Antidepressant-induced sweating [^1151jZ5x]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of excessive sweating probably caused by paroxetine, review the literature on antidepressant-induced sweating, and provide recommendations for the management of antidepressant-induced sweating.

Case Summary

A 59-year-old white female presented to a pharmacist-staffed pharmacotherapy clinic with episodes of excessive sweating. The episodes occurred primarily on her head and back of the neck. Other etiologies were ruled out and paroxetine was discontinued. Paroxetine had been initiated at least 7 months prior to the reporting of symptoms. Sweating symptoms gradually improved until resolution 5 weeks following discontinuation of paroxetine. The Naranjo probability scale indicated a causal relationship is probable.

Discussion

Excessive sweating has been associated with antidepressants including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, and venlafaxine. In some patients, these symptoms require therapeutic intervention such as dose reduction, antidepressant substitution, antidepressant discontinuation, or addition of an agent to control sweating. Agents that have been reported successful in controlling the sweating include benztropine and cyproheptadine.

Conclusions

We recommend a patient-specific approach for the management of antidepressant-induced sweating. First, consider dose reduction or a trial off antidepressant medication. In patients in whom this is inappropriate or ineffective, substitution of another antidepressant should be considered. If episodes of excessive sweating persist, consider treatment of sweating symptoms with benztropine or cyproheptadine in the absence of contraindications.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation

In the two placebo-controlled clinical trials (Studies EM-1 and EM-2), 5.5% of subjects treated with ORILISSA 150 mg once daily and 9.6% of subjects treated with ORILISSA 200 mg twice daily discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions compared to 6.0% of those given placebo. Discontinuations were most commonly due to hot flushes or night sweats (1.1% with 150 mg once daily and 2.5% with 200 mg twice daily) and nausea (0.8% with 150 mg once daily and 1.5% with 200 mg twice daily) and were dose-related. The majority of discontinuations due to hot flushes or night sweats (10 of 17, 59%) and nausea (7 of 11, 64%) occurred within the first 2 months of therapy.

In the two extension trials (Studies EM-3 and EM-4), discontinuations were most commonly due to decreased BMD and were dose-related. In these trials, 0.3% of subjects treated with ORILISSA 150 mg once daily and 3.6% of subjects treated with ORILISSA 200 mg twice daily discontinued therapy due to decreased BMD.

### Night sweats: a systematic review of the literature [^112u4P6C]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Much of primary care involves helping patients manage symptoms. Nighttime sweating is a symptom linked to menopause, malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and infections. However, in primary care settings, night sweats are commonly reported by persons without these conditions.

Methods

We conducted a literature review, focusing on questions about definition, mechanisms, incidence/prevalence, measurement, clinical causes, evaluation, treatment, and prognosis. We limited our search to English language studies of adult humans published since 1966. Because studies of estrogen and androgen deficiency states had been reviewed by others, we excluded them. Search criteria were developed for each question. Publications meeting criteria were reviewed by the first 2 authors and consensus was reached through discussion.

Results

Prevalence estimates ranged from 10% among older primary care patients to 60% among women on an obstetrics inpatient unit. Life expectancy of primary care patients reporting night sweats did not appear to be reduced. Although many clinical causes have been suggested, most are not well supported. Algorithmic approaches to evaluation are not evidence-based. Alpha adrenergic blockers may reduce night sweats in patients taking serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Thalidomide and thioridazine may benefit some terminal cancer patients with night sweats.

Conclusions

The symptom, night sweats, appears to be nonspecific. Many questions about causation, evaluation, and management remain unanswered.

Withdrawal

Withdrawal symptoms may occur when sleep medicines are stopped suddenly after
being used daily for a long time. In some cases, these symptoms can occur even
if the medicine has been used for only a week or two. In mild cases, withdrawal
symptoms may include unpleasant feelings. In more severe cases, abdominal and
muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, shakiness, and rarely, seizures may occur.
These more severe withdrawal symptoms are very uncommon. Although withdrawal
symptoms have not been observed in the relatively limited controlled trials
experience with Sonata, there is, nevertheless, the risk of such events in
association with the use of any sleep medicines.

Another problem that may occur when sleep medicines are stopped is known as
"rebound insomnia". This means that a person may have more trouble sleeping the
first few nights after the medicine is stopped than before starting the
medicine. If you should experience rebound insomnia, do not get discouraged.
This problem usually goes away on its own after 1 or 2 nights.

If you have been taking Sonata or any other sleep medicine for more than 1 or
2 weeks, do not stop taking it on your own. Always follow your doctor's
directions.

Changes In Behavior and Thinking

Some people using sleep medicines have experienced unusual changes in their
thinking and/or behavior. These effects are not common. However, they have

Overall, participants reporting specific side effects were younger than those not doing so. Conversely, two side effects, rashes and runny nose, were reported by older participants (Table 1). Some side effects such as dizziness, headaches and sweating showed a higher prevalence across SNRIs than SSRIs. These patterns were sometimes sex-specific (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1). We observed a higher prevalence of weight gain from mirtazapine, dry mouth from amitriptyline and drowsiness from both amitriptyline and mirtazapine than SNRIs and SSRIs. Conversely, reduced sexual desire or function was more commonly reported for SSRIs or SNRIs than amitriptyline and mirtazapine (Fig. 1).

### Duloxetine in the long-term treatment of major depressive disorder [^111JXGHM]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is a chronic recurring disorder and guidelines recommend long-term therapy. This clinical trial evaluated the long-term (1 year) safety and efficacy of duloxetine, a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, in patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder.

Method

This was an open-label, 52-week, multinational clinical trial in outpatients (age ≥ 18 years) who received duloxetine at 80 mg/day (administered 40 mg twice daily) to 120 mg/day (administered 60 mg twice daily) for up to 1 year.

Results

A total of 1279 patients had postbaseline data. Of these, 520 were exposed to duloxetine for at least 360 days, yielding approximately 808 patient-years of total exposure. Mean changes in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) score, 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression total score and subfactor scores, Beck Depression Inventory-II score, and Sheehan Disability Scale score and mean Patient Global Impression-Improvement scale (PGI-I) scores all showed highly significant (p < .001) improvements at all assessment times. The estimated probabilities of improvement in CGI-S and PGI-I scores at week 1 were 40.4% and 59.2%, respectively, and at week 2 were 70.0% and 78.3%. The estimated probabilities of remission at weeks 6, 28, and 52 were 50.8%, 75.6%, and 81.8%, respectively. Adverse events led to discontinuation in 218 patients (17.0%). The most frequent specific events leading to discontinuation were nausea (1.5%), somnolence (1.4%), vomiting (0.9%), hypomania (0.8%), pregnancy (0.8%), dizziness (0.6%), insomnia (0.6%), and hypertension (0.5%). Treatment-emergent adverse events that were reported by > 10% of patients included nausea, insomnia, headache, somnolence, dry mouth, dizziness, constipation, sweating increase, anxiety, diarrhea, and fatigue. Most events occurred early in the study. Of those events that first occurred or worsened after discontinuation, only dizziness (8.3%) occurred in more than 5% of patients. Mean changes from baseline to last observation for standing and supine pulse were less than 2 b.p.m. Mean changes in blood pressure (< 1.0 mm Hg), corrected QT interval (< 1 msec), and body weight (2.4 kg [5.3 lb]) were not clinically significant. Laboratory analyses varied across visits, and mean changes after 52 weeks were generally close to zero. The incidence of laboratory values above or below normal limits at any time during treatment was low.

Conclusion

Duloxetine was effective, safe, and well tolerated in the long-term treatment of major depression at a dose of 80 to 120 mg/day in this study.

VA/DoD chronic multisymptom illness (CMI) guideline — duloxetine for symptoms consistent with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS): There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against offering duloxetine for patients with CMI and symptoms consistent with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-replaced). Evidence includes a double-blind randomized controlled trial of 60 patients with ME/CFS in which duloxetine did not significantly improve fatigue-related symptoms or function, while it was slightly favored over placebo for mental fatigue and demonstrated improvements in the Clinical Global Impression – Severity scale (CGI-S), with Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scores and function inconclusive. Adverse events occurred in ≥ 5% of patients, most commonly somnolence, dizziness, headache, and dry mouth, and clinicians should continue to weigh individual benefits against the risks of treatment. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, and duloxetine is readily available in the VA/DoD with no prior authorization required.

### A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of duloxetine hydrochloride enteric-coated tablets in the treatment of refractory chronic cough [^113Yi88Q]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Refractory cough is a chronic cough with unclear diagnosis or with a definite diagnosis but poor curative effect. The diagnosis and treatment process recommended by the existing cough guidelines requires that on the basis of careful medical history inquiry and physical examination, necessary auxiliary examinations be selected to identify the cause of chronic cough, and the treatment response to the cause should be determined to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. Sometimes, even after a comprehensive auxiliary examination, the cause of cough cannot be identified, or although the cause can be identified, there is no effective treatment or no good treatment response, resulting in stubborn or persistent cough symptoms. All of the above are refractory coughs. The proportion of refractory cough among cases of chronic cough varies between regions, up to 42%, and our department has found rates of 5–12%. The symptoms of patients with refractory cough are often stubborn and persistent. Severe coughing not only causes headache, chest pain, vomiting, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, cough syncope, urinary incontinence, and other manifestations, as well as complications such as rib fractures, but also makes patients irritable, depressed, and anxious, which seriously lower their quality of life. These patients often seek medical treatment in multiple hospitals, spend huge amounts of money, undergo repeated auxiliary examinations, take various therapeutic drugs indiscriminately, and suffer the risks of drug side effects, causing serious social problems and economic burdens.

### A review of the adverse effects and safety of noradrenergic antidepressants [^115FvAhu]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

There are a variety of noradrenergic antidepressants available, most of which act by inhibiting neuronal noradrenaline re-uptake, although few drugs are specific for this action. Where drugs have numerous actions the adverse effects of noradrenaline reuptake may be difficult to isolate, although in this respect the adverse effects of reboxetine, a specific noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor, are illuminating. Noradrenergic antidepressants typically cause minor changes in blood and heart rate, sweating and insomnia. Other pharmacological actions shown by non-specific antidepressants may act to worsen or mitigate these adverse effects. Noradrenergic drugs are less likely than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to cause sexual dysfunction but more likely to cause urinary hesitancy. Doubts remain over the relative propensity for antidepressants with different modes of action to cause diabetes and hyponatraemia. Noradrenergic actions do not seem to confer a risk of death in overdose.

### Duloxetine, 60 mg once daily, for major depressive disorder: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^111UWVie]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Despite treatment advances, major depressive disorder (MDD) is still a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Current therapies frequently fall short of providing full remission. In addition, physical symptoms are commonly seen in MDD patients, increasing overall morbidity and health care utilization. Duloxetine hydrochloride, a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, was evaluated for efficacy and tolerability/safety in the treatment of MDD and associated physical symptoms.

Method

In this multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group study, adult patients with DSM-IV MDD were randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 122) or duloxetine (60 mg/day, N = 123) for 9 weeks. The primary efficacy measure was the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) total score. Painful physical symptoms were assessed using visual analog scales, and global illness and quality of life were evaluated using the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale, the Patient Global Impressions-Improvement scale, and the Quality of Life in Depression Scale. Safety and tolerability were determined by monitoring discontinuation rates, adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory results.

Results

Duloxetine was significantly superior to placebo (p < .001) in reducing HAM-D-17 total scores, starting at week 2. The estimated probability of remission for duloxetine-treated patients (44%) was almost 3 times that of placebo patients (16%). Duloxetine significantly reduced painful physical symptoms in comparison with placebo. Discontinuation due to adverse events for duloxetine-treated patients (13.8%) compared favorably with the rates reported for SSRIs in other studies. Nausea, dry mouth, and somnolence were the most common adverse events; no significant incidence of hypertension was seen.

Conclusion

Duloxetine, 60 mg/day, is a well-tolerated and effective treatment for MDD that reduces painful physical symptoms. These findings suggest that duloxetine may be a first-line treatment for patients with MDD and associated painful physical symptoms.

### Is duloxetine's effect on painful physical symptoms in depression an indirect result of improvement of depressive symptoms? Pooled analyses of three randomized controlled trials [^114F4wtL]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

1. Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD), primarily described in terms of emotional features such as depressed mood, also includes physical symptoms (eg, idiopathic pain, changes in weight, sleep, appetite), that are the major complaints driving patients seeking medical care. Painful physical symptoms (PPS), generally present as unexplained headache, pain in the joints or abdomen, or pains in the chest, neck, or shoulder areas, are frequently encountered physical symptoms. PPS is linked with poorer clinical outcomes and contribute to the overall burden of MDD.,

Some studies suggest that the depressive symptoms (DS) and PPS present different trajectories. For example, MDD patients with PPS receiving serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors for 9 months initially showed similar improvements in both DS and PPS. However, while DS continued to improve, PPS did not improve further after 1 month.

Duloxetine is balanced in its affinity of binding to serotonin and norepinephrine transporter sites and potently inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, thus enhancing monoaminergic tone. Randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials with MDD patients with PPS showed that duloxetine is effective in improving both DS and PPS. However, the extent of interactions between DS and PPS improvement in MDD is not well understood, and the reciprocal roles of pain relief and relief of DS on each other in MDD patients are currently under investigation.

For example, in a 9-week treatment of MDD patients with duloxetine, 51% of duloxetine's total effect on overall pain was due to a direct effect and 49% was the result of an indirect effect mediated through change in depression severity. However, because not all the patients necessarily had PPS associated with MDD, these results may not be applied to the specific population of patients with MDD and associated PPS.

### Night sweats and elevated follicle-stimulating hormone levels while taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [^1177Wwbt]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed to women with depression and anxiety disorders. Although night sweats are a reported adverse effect, some women have relief of vasomotor symptoms during perimenopausal period while taking them. The relationships between SSRIs, thermoregulation, gonadotropins, and estrogen and their connection to fertility remain unclear.

Case

A reproductive-aged woman, seeking treatment for infertility, experienced night sweats and elevated follicle-stimulating hormone levels while taking SSRIs for treatment of depression.

Conclusion

Many women of reproductive age are taking SSRIs, but the affect of SSRIs on normal reproductive function is unknown and further research in this area is needed.

### Understanding genetic risk factors for common side effects of antidepressant medications [^1172J6uY]. Communications Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we aimed at gaining insights into the genetic aetiology of self-reported antidepressant adverse side effects. Our study has several insights, including (1) providing prevalence estimates for side effects outside of a controlled clinical trial; (2) assessing drug-class specificity of antidepressant side effects; (3) testing and providing evidence for non-specific factors (i.e. not related to the type of medication), which is of particular interest for some side effects such as suicidality; and 4) testing for genetic factors underlying the aetiology of side effects using PRS. We identified the most common side effect to be reduced sexual drive or function, followed by weight gain. Reduced sexual function was most prevalent among males taking paroxetine, an SSRI, whereas weight gain was the most prevalent among females taking amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). These findings are consistent with research findings showing SSRIs exhibit the most adverse sexual effects, whereas TCAs have been established to cause weight increases.

Studies have suggested that SSRI-based sexual dysfunction may result in 40–65% of individuals ceasing treatment. It is hypothesised that testosterone and dopamine neurotransmitters are dysregulated by SSRIs, a plausible hypothesis considering the role that testosterone plays in sexual function and the high amounts circulating in males compared to females. Moreover, serotonin plays a crucial role in initiating smooth muscle contraction of the genito-urinary system and regulating the response of the sexual cycle; thus, exogenous substances such as SSRIs that alter these mechanisms may cause sexual dysfunction in both males and females. SNRIs have been reported to lead to more dizziness, trouble sleeping and dry mouth than SSRIs. We found a higher prevalence for dizziness and sweating from venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine and duloxetine (SNRIs) compared to other antidepressants.

### Do side effects of antidepressants impact efficacy estimates based on the hamilton depression rating scale? A pooled patient-level analysis [^116kRzL4]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

It is desirable that a rating scale accurately reflects the underlying severity of the condition it aims to depict, as well as how this severity is influenced by treatment. This has since long been suggested not to be the case for the effect parameter most widely used in trials of antidepressants, namely the sum of the 17 items of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17-sum) –. One potential drawback of the HDRS-17-sum as a measure of depression severity is that some of the items included with the intention to quantify depressive severity may also capture common antidepressant side effects (SEs).

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are the most commonly prescribed drugs for the treatment of major depression. Among the SEs frequently reported in relation to their use are insomnia, sweating, nausea, constipation, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, ejaculation difficulties, anorgasmia, loss of libido, and weight loss –. As the HDRS-17 includes three items pertaining to insomnia (items 4–6), one for gastrointestinal symptoms (item 12), one for genital symptoms (item 14), and one for weight loss (item 16), there is potential for the SEs of SSRIs and SNRIs to be erroneously accounted for as symptoms of depression. Similarly, the somatic anxiety item of the HDRS-17 (item 11), which includes complaints such as dry mouth, micturition difficulties, palpitations, etc. may also reflect common antidepressant SEs. If at hand, such a mechanism would lead to an underestimation of the antidepressant efficacy of these compounds. Conversely, it is possible that the antidepressant efficacy of compounds with sedative or appetite increasing effects may be erroneously overestimated due to reduced ratings of sleep disturbance or weight loss.

### Persistent night sweats: diagnostic evaluation [^113zrAMR]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Night sweats are a nonspecific symptom that patients commonly experience but rarely discuss with their physicians without prompting. Although many life-threatening causes such as malignancies or infections have been described, most patients who report persistent night sweats in the primary care setting do not have a serious underlying disorder. Conditions commonly associated with night sweats include menopause, mood disorders, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hyperthyroidism, and obesity. If a clinical diagnosis is apparent based on the initial history and physical examination, specific treatment for four to eight weeks may be offered. When the history and physical examination do not reveal a specific cause, physicians should proceed with a systematic and cost-conscious strategy that uses readily available laboratory and imaging studies, such as a complete blood count, tuberculosis testing, thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, HIV testing, C-reactive protein level, and chest radiography. Additional tests that could be considered selectively include computed tomography of the chest and/or abdomen, bone marrow biopsy, polysomnography, and/or additional laboratory studies if indicated. If these results are normal, and no additional disorders are suspected, reassurance and continued monitoring are recommended. The presence of night sweats alone does not indicate an increased risk of death.

### Efficacy and safety of ammoxetine in major depressive disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^1114jMbe]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most prevalent mental health disorders, causing substantial disability and economic burden. The World Health Organization reported that MDD will become the primary cause of disability worldwide by 2030. Various classes of antidepressant medications include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), mirtazapine, tricyclic antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, among others. Due to their relatively mild adverse effects, SSRIs and SNRIs are often recommended as first-line treatment for MDD. However, 50% to 60% of patients cannot tolerate or do not respond adequately to them. The STAR*D study indicated that only 30% to 40% of patients reached remission with first-line antidepressants. Additionally, these medications have a slow onset of action and a high incidence of adverse reactions. The SNRIs may outperform SSRIs in efficacy and speed of onset, with fewer cardiovascular complications compared with tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Furthermore, SNRIs effectively alleviate depressive symptoms associated with chronic pain, making them mainstream options in clinical practice. Compared with SSRIs, the variety of SNRIs is limited, with duloxetine dominating the market. While it blocks serotonin and norepinephrine transporters more potently than venlafaxine, many patients with MDD still experience common adverse effects, such as nausea, drowsiness, dry mouth, sweating, constipation, and decreased appetite. Moreover, duloxetine may have higher hepatotoxicity than other SNRIs, such as venlafaxine, because of its naphthyl ring, which induces oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in hepatic organoids. Therefore, considering the burden of MDD and the potential of SNRIs, there is a need for new compounds within this class.

### Duloxetine for the treatment of major depressive disorder: safety and tolerability associated with dose escalation [^1169Vdrm]. Depression and Anxiety (2007). Low credibility.

Duloxetine has demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) at a dose of 60 mg/day (given once daily). Whereas the target dose for the majority of patients is 60 mg/day, higher duloxetine doses (up to 120 mg/day) have been studied using a twice-daily dosing schedule. To further investigate the pharmacological profile of duloxetine within a once-daily dosing regimen at doses above 60 mg, we examined the safety and tolerability of duloxetine during a dose escalation from 60 mg/day to 120 mg/day. This single-arm, non-placebo-controlled study incorporated a 7-week dose escalation phase, in which patients and investigators were blinded as to timing of dose increases, followed by an open-label extension phase of up to 2 years duration. Patients (age ≥ 18 years) meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD (n = 128) received placebo for 1 week, followed by duloxetine (60 mg/day) titrated after 1 week to 90 mg/day, and after a further week to 120 mg/day. The dose of 120 mg/day was then maintained for 4 weeks. The extension phase comprised an initial 6-week dose stabilization period, during which duloxetine was tapered to the lowest effective dose, followed by continuation therapy at the stabilized dose. We assessed safety using spontaneously reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), laboratory analytes, and visual analogue scales (VAS) for gastrointestinal (GI) disturbance. Efficacy measures included the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) total score, the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scales, and VAS assessments of pain severity and interference. The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events during the acute phase of the study was 15.6%. The most frequently reported TEAEs were nausea, headache, dry mouth, dizziness, and decreased appetite. The majority of TEAEs were associated with initial duloxetine dosing; further escalations in dose produced few additional adverse events. VAS measures of GI disturbance worsened significantly compared with baseline values after 1 week of duloxetine treatment. Subsequent assessments of GI disturbance, following dose escalation to 90 mg/day and 120 mg/day, showed either no significant difference or a significant improvement from baseline. Significant improvements (P < .001) were observed in all assessed depression efficacy measures, and in five of six VAS pain outcomes, during acute phase treatment. During 2 years of extension phase therapy, the rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was 11.9%, and the only TEAEs reported by > 10% of patients were upper respiratory tract infection (13.1%), headache (10.7%), and insomnia (10.7%). Mean changes from baseline to the end of the extension phase in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 3.8 and 0.5 mm Hg, respectively, and there were no reports of sustained hypertension. Mean increase in heart rate was 5.9 bpm, while patients exhibited a mean weight increase of 3.1 kg over 2 years of treatment. Results from this study suggest that rapid dose escalation of duloxetine (60 mg/day → 90 mg/day → 120 mg/day) is safe and tolerable. Despite weekly escalation, the majority of adverse events were mild and transient and occurred in the first week of duloxetine dosing (at 60 mg once daily). Long-term treatment at a stabilized duloxetine dose was associated with a relatively low incidence of TEAEs and treatment discontinuation due to adverse events. Time course profiles of body weight and heart rate showed modest increases during 2 years of treatment [ClinicalTrials.gov number, NC T000 42575].

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of duloxetine hydrochloride DR PO (also known as Cymbalta):
- **1-naphthol toxicity**: use caution in patients with delayed gastric emptying, as extremely acidic conditions can facilitate the hydrolysis of duloxetine to form naphthol.
- **Acute angle-closure glaucoma**: use caution in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.
- **Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome**: do not discontinue abruptly in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.
- **Bleeding, hypertension**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as duloxetine has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events. Obtain BP monitoring. Recognize that the risk of bleeding is higher with concomitant use of aspirin, NSAIDs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants.
- **Decreased serum sodium**: use caution in all patients, especially in the elderly and in patients with volume depletion or taking diuretics. Discontinue duloxetine if symptomatic hyponatremia develops.
- **Exacerbation of increased blood glucose**: use caution in patients with diabetes.
- **Increased serum transaminases, jaundice, ALF**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as duloxetine has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events. Discontinue duloxetine if jaundice or other evidence of liver dysfunction occurs.
- **Manic or mixed episodes**: use caution in patients with major depressive disorder at risk for bipolar disorder. Screen patients for personal and family history of bipolar disorder before initiating duloxetine.

### Duloxetine for the long-term treatment of major depressive disorder in patients aged 65 and older: an open-label study [^1136jLKw]. BMC Geriatrics (2004). Low credibility.

The incidence and pattern of treatment-emergent adverse events during Weeks 1 to 8 of this study were generally similar to those observed in acute-phase, placebo-controlled trials in older patients. The most frequently reported adverse events were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, constipation, and dry mouth. Most of the events were either mild or moderate in severity and transient in nature. During the last 44 weeks of the study, no adverse event occurred in more than 8% of the patient population and the incidence of each specific event was generally lower in the entire period from Weeks 9–52 than in the initial 8 weeks of the study. Thus, patients who tolerated duloxetine during the early period of the trial were likely to tolerate long-term dosing.

Administration of medication to elderly patients necessitates consideration of the physiological changes which accompany aging. Such changes can result in substantial differences in adverse event profiles between older and younger patient populations. In this study, comparisons between age groups (18–64 years vs. ≥ 65 years) of the most commonly reported treatment emergent adverse events revealed significant differences only in the rates of insomnia and headache. Furthermore, in each of these cases the higher rates were observed in the younger age group. In the absence of a placebo control arm these results must be viewed with an appropriate degree of caution, but they provide an indication that the adverse event profile for duloxetine in the elderly may be similar to that observed in younger patients.

### Low-dose paroxetine (7.5 mg) improves sleep in women with vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^113eCY68]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Disturbances in sleep (eg, sleep induction, sleep maintenance, nighttime awakenings, and early morning wakefulness) are common among women during midlife. The prevalence of sleep disturbances increases with age and menopause status, with up to half of women aged 40 to 59 years reporting poor sleep quality. Targeting the specific causal factors/conditions of sleep disturbances, rather than treating the sleep problem nonspecifically with sedative or hypnotic medications, is important given that these medications are recommended for short-term situational sleep problems rather than for long-term disorders because of their addictive potential.

Hot flashes and night sweats, collectively termed vasomotor symptoms (VMS), occur in up to 80% of perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.VMS can be bothersome and may negatively impact functioningand activities of daily living, including work, social, and leisure activities. Furthermore, VMS have been linked to increased prevalence of sleep disturbances and nighttime awakenings during menopause.-Because sleep disturbance is a risk factor for impaired daytime functioning, development of medical and affective disorders, and increased health care costs, sleep disturbances associated with menopause may negatively affect the health and safety of postmenopausal women and persons with whom they interact.

### Duloxetine 60 mg once daily dosing versus placebo in the acute treatment of major depression [^112KCzL3]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2002). Low credibility.

Existing therapies for major depressive disorder (MDD) have either limited efficacy and/or poor tolerability. The present study examined the effects of duloxetine, a potent and balanced dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE), in patients with MDD. Adult patients (N = 267) with MDD were randomly assigned to receive duloxetine (60 mg/day) or placebo in this 9-week, multi-center, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial. Efficacy was evaluated using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD(17)), Visual Analog Scales (VAS) for pain, Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S), Patient's Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I), and Quality of Life in Depression Scale (QLDS). Safety was evaluated by assessing discontinuation rates, adverse event rates, vital signs, and laboratory tests. Duloxetine (60 mg QD) significantly reduced the HAMD(17) total score compared with placebo at the end of 9-week therapy. Estimated probabilities of response and remission were 65 and 43%, respectively, for duloxetine compared with 42 and 28% for placebo. Duloxetine also reduced overall pain, back pain, shoulder pain and time in pain while awake significantly more than placebo. Global measures of improvement, including PGI-I and QLDS, were significantly improved by duloxetine compared with placebo. Discontinuations due to adverse events were more frequent for duloxetine-treated patients (12.5%) than for placebo-treated patients (4.3%). Nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, and constipation were more frequent for duloxetine than placebo. There was no significant incidence of hypertension, nor any other safety issues. Duloxetine 60 mg administered once daily appears to be a safe and effective treatment for MDD.

### Severe night sweating treated by oxybutynin [^115gfRGN]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Sleep hyperhidrosis is defined as profuse nocturnal sweating that disrupts sleep. Although the mechanism is unknown, some cases are secondary to hot flushes during the menopausal period, medical, mental and sleep disorders, and medication, while dysregulation of thermoregulation during sleep is suspected in primary cases. We present the case of a woman with severe primary sleep hyperhidrosis, occurring nightly for 23 years, which definitively resolved after brief treatment with oxybutynin (a muscarinic receptor-blocking anticholinergic). An ammoniacal odor in the sweat and a sensation of coldness on awakening during sweating episodes suggest that the mechanism of her night sweating was not an exacerbation of thermoregulation during the night but shares the mechanical properties of emotional/psychological sweating. This extreme case of sleep hyperhidrosis was treated with excellent efficacy and minimal side effects using oxybutynin, which could benefit other patients with nighttime discomfort.

### Prevalence and impact of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause among women in Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and nordic Europe: a cross-sectional survey [^114pde8s]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Worldwide, on average, about 57% of women aged 40 to 64 years experience vasomotor symptoms (VMS) due to menopause.VMS are characterized by hot flashes (also called hot flushes) and/or night sweats. Reported VMS prevalence rates vary between regions in Asia, North and South America, Africa, and Australia, with estimates of 37% to 58% in Asia (16% in Japan), 18% to 70% in South America, 39% to 77% in Africa, 41% to 77% in North America (34% in the United States), 33% to 83% in Australia, and 40% to 97% in Europe. VMS often negatively affect quality of life (QoL) and interfere with daily activities and productivity at home and work. - They can also cause sleep disturbances (eg, nocturnal awakenings), which could further affect daily activities.,

VMS are the primary menopausal symptoms for which women seek treatment, and women with greater VMS severity have been shown to have an increased number of menopause-related physician visits. However, a recent electronic chart review showed that up to 40% of women did not receive a prescription treatment for their VMS after discussions with their healthcare practitioners (HCP). The proportion of women who use any treatment for their VMS is low, despite the data showing that HT is effective for VMS due to menopause. Nonhormone (non-HT) prescription therapies available at the time of the survey reported herein included selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), gabapentin/pregabalin, clonidine, and oxybutynin. - Many of these options do not have regulatory approval for VMS, which varies between countries. For example, paroxetine is approved for VMS in the United States, but it is not approved for VMS in Canada or Sweden, which are countries included in the current study. Modest efficacy of non-HT compared with HT, as well as concerns about safety and tolerability, may limit use of these agents. Thus, many women seek nonprescription herbal treatments and dietary supplements, despite a lack of evidence of their efficacy and safety.- In 2023, fezolinetant, a first-in-class neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause.

### Low-dose estradiol and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine for vasomotor symptoms: a randomized clinical trial [^115fcJFh]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Estrogen therapy is the gold standard treatment for hot flashes and night sweats, but some women are unable or unwilling to use it because of associated risks. The serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine hydrochloride is used widely as a nonhormonal treatment. While the clinical impression is that serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are less effective than estrogen, these medications have not been simultaneously evaluated in one clinical trial to date.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of low-dose oral 17β-estradiol and low-dose venlafaxine extended release in alleviating vasomotor symptoms (VMS).

Design, Setting, and Participants

In total, 339 perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with at least 2 bothersome VMS per day (mean, 8.1 per day) were recruited from the community to MsFLASH (Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health) clinical network sites between December 5, 2011, and October 15, 2012.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to double-blind treatment with low-dose oral 17β-estradiol (0.5 mg/d) (n = 97), low-dose venlafaxine hydrochloride extended release (75 mg/d) (n = 96), or placebo (n = 146) for 8 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the mean daily frequency of VMS after 8 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes were VMS severity, bother, and interference with daily life. Intent-to-treat analyses compared the change in VMS frequency between each active intervention and placebo and between the 2 active treatments.

Results

Compared with baseline, the mean VMS frequency at week 8 decreased to 3.9 (95% CI, 2.9–4.9) VMS per day (52.9% reduction) in the estradiol group, to 4.4 (95% CI, 3.5–5.3) VMS per day (47.6% reduction) in the venlafaxine group, and to 5.5 (95% CI, 4.7–6.3) VMS per day (28.6% reduction) in the placebo group. Estradiol reduced the frequency of symptoms by 2.3 more per day than placebo (P < .001), and venlafaxine reduced the frequency of symptoms by 1.8 more per day than placebo (P = 0.005). The results were consistent for VMS severity, bother, and interference. Low-dose estradiol reduced the frequency of symptoms by 0.6 more per day than venlafaxine (P = 0.09). Treatment satisfaction was highest (70.3%) for estradiol (P < .001 vs placebo), lowest (38.4%) for placebo, and intermediate (51.1%) for venlafaxine (P = 0.06 vs placebo). Both interventions were well tolerated.

Conclusions and Relevance

Low-dose oral estradiol and venlafaxine are effective treatments for VMS in women during midlife. While the efficacy of low-dose estradiol may be slightly superior to that of venlafaxine, the difference is small and of uncertain clinical relevance.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) medication side effects — common SSRI effects and management: The most common SSRI side effects include gastrointestinal distress, agitation, insomnia or somnolence, increased tendency to sweat, and sexual side effects (diminished libido and difficulty with erection and orgasm). A first step is to consider dose reduction to alleviate side effects without loss of therapeutic effect; when this is not possible, specific interventions may be considered. Gastrointestinal distress will usually disappear within 1–2 weeks at a constant dose; insomnia may respond to morning dosing, standard sleep hygiene measures, or a sleep-promoting agent; fatigue or sleepiness may respond to modest doses of modafinil; and sweating has been treated with low-dose anticholinergics such as benztropine, or with clonidine, cyproheptadine, or mirtazapine.

### Effects of low-dose paroxetine 7.5 mg on weight and sexual function during treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^111Sz7au]. Menopause (2014). Low credibility.

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) associated with menopause, such as hot flashes and night sweats, affect up to 80% of menopausal women, negatively impact quality of life and daily functioning, and cause many women to seek treatment. Although hormone therapy is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS associated with menopause, safe and effective nonhormonal alternatives to hormone therapy are needed.

Since the 1990s, multiple clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of antidepressants and anticonvulsants in treating VMS associated with menopause; yet, until recently, only a few — including some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) — had suggested efficacy. Neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and serotonin are hypothesized to influence temperature homeostasis, and agents such as SSRIs/SNRIs, which increase serotonin and norepinephrine transmission, may thereby be able to modulate thermoregulation, although the precise mechanisms remain unclear.

The use of SSRIs and SNRIs at therapeutic doses prescribed for psychiatric disorders is associated with several unwanted adverse effects, including weight gain and sexual dysfunction. Because both weight and libido may already be negatively impacted by menopause, any treatment that exacerbates these effects is unlikely to be viewed favorably by women and may result in drug discontinuation, noncompliance, or inappropriate self-management. Despite these tolerability issues, some physicians prescribe antidepressants off-label for the management of menopausal VMS. According to IMS Health estimates, more than 2.4 million SSRI prescriptions were filled in 2012 for the treatment of VMS. For paroxetine prescriptions, 20 and 40 mg were the most commonly prescribed doses.

Findings from previously published clinical studies of paroxetine-and results of a phase 2 studyindicated that doses lower than those prescribed for psychiatric disorders may be efficacious in treating moderate to severe VMS associated with menopause while demonstrating favorable tolerability. Brisdelle (paroxetine 7.5 mg; previously called low-dose mesylate salt of paroxetine) is the first and only US Food and Drug Administration–approved nonhormonal option for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS associated with menopause. Two phase 3 studies (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT01361308 and NCT01101841) demonstrated that paroxetine 7.5 mg reduced moderate to severe VMS in postmenopausal women and was well tolerated. Using pooled data from the two phase 3 studies, we examined whether treatment with paroxetine 7.5 mg affected weight, sexual function, or both.

### Diagnosing night sweats [^115YR8no]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Night sweats are a common outpatient complaint, yet literature on the subject is scarce. Tuberculosis and lymphoma are diseases in which night sweats are a dominant symptom, but these are infrequently found to be the cause of night sweats in modern practice. While these diseases remain important diagnostic considerations in patients with night sweats, other diagnoses to consider include human immunodeficiency virus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia, and several less common diseases. Antihypertensives, antipyretics, other medications, and drugs of abuse such as alcohol and heroin may cause night sweats. Serious causes of night sweats can be excluded with a thorough history, physical examination, and directed laboratory and radiographic studies. If a history and physical do not reveal a possible diagnosis, physicians should consider a purified protein derivative, complete blood count, human immunodeficiency virus test, thyroid-stimulating hormone test, erythrocyte sedimentation rate evaluation, chest radiograph, and possibly chest and abdominal computed tomographic scans and bone marrow biopsy.

### Acupuncture in the real world: evaluating a 15-year NADA auricular acupuncture service for breast cancer survivors experiencing hot flushes and night sweats as a consequence of adjuvant hormonal therapies [^113EQXvo]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hot flushes and night sweats (HFNS) are a consequence of adjuvant hormonal treatments (tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors) for breast cancer, of which there were 55,000 new cases annually in the UK from 2015–2017. They have been reported by up to 84% of women taking tamoxifen, with 60% reporting symptoms as severe. Previous opinion held that these symptoms alleviate with time; however, recent research reports that prevalence may remain static for the duration of adjuvant hormonal treatment and continue for 5 years after treatment ends.

A common symptom of natural menopause, hot flushes are described as sudden sensations of heat, often accompanied by sweating, reddening of the skin, and sometimes by palpitations. They are associated with impaired quality of life, poor sleep, and negative mood, with night sweats associated with a greater risk of minor depression, fatigue and mood changes.

Cancer treatment induced HFNS are reported as more severe, frequent, and longer-lasting than those of natural menopause. HFNS have a wider implication for cancer survival, as treatment side effects are cited as a key reason for low adherence to endocrine therapy, with consequent impact on survival.

The main treatment for menopausal symptoms, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), is contraindicated for use with women with breast cancer, as are progestogens. Non-hormonal pharmacological treatments most likely to be offered for HFNS management include selective serotonin (and norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs), especially venlafaxine, as well as gabapentin and clonidine. Due to concerns about the inhibitory effects of SSRIs and SRNIs on tamoxifen, paroxetine and fluoxetine are not recommended for women taking tamoxifen. However, some women who are prescribed these medications do not find them helpful, whilst others find the mild to moderate beneficial effects are outweighed by their adverse effects. Furthermore, many women do not want to take medications in addition to their adjuvant hormonal therapy and seek non-pharmacological options.

### Understanding genetic risk factors for common side effects of antidepressant medications [^1122w2Zp]. Communications Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

SSRIs are generally prescribed as first-line agents due to their safety profile, evident since clinical studies from the 1980s onwards, for individuals with multiple comorbidities –. Moreover, as they are better tolerated than older agents, this results in more effective long-term management. While we observed specific instances where side effects were more prevalent across other antidepressant types, we did not find a lower prevalence for any side effect nor a higher prevalence of no side effects for SSRIs. This might be explained by the fact that non-specific factors (i.e. regardless of medication class) seemed to underlie the self-reporting of side effects.

Side effects co-occurred across all antidepressants assessed despite their variable modes of action and metabolism. Participants who reported a side effect for one medication were more likely to report that same side effect for other medications. This strongly suggests the existence of common non-specific factors, which are potentially a mixture of shared pharmacological and genetic factors underlying their aetiology. Our structural equation modelling analyses suggested that for some side effects, a common factor model would be preferred over models considering the drug classes.

The evidence for lack of drug-class factors was not equally strong for all side effects. For example, sweating showed the best fit to a model containing an SNRI factor along with the common factor. This is consistent with the higher prevalence of sweating reported for SNRIs compared to other drugs, which would already imply an SNRI-specific factor increasing its prevalence. For some side effects, common factors are further supported by the fact that they are widely reported from other types of medications; for example, weight gain is a common side effect not only for antidepressants but also for antipsychotics, antihyperglycemics, antihypertensives and corticosteroids. The nature of these common factors is complex and might include a mixture of a nocebo effect, shared metabolism, common environmental and genetic factors.

Withdrawals and adverse events

Table 2 shows withdrawals and adverse events in the five reviews with largest amounts of data. Average adverse event withdrawals were between 6% and 9% for duloxetine, milnacipran and pregabalin. Serious adverse events were both rare and on no occasion were they statistically different between the active drug and placebo. Somnolence, dizziness and weight gain seemed common with pregabalin, and nausea with SNRIs.

Efficacy outcomes other than pain

Four reviews reported outcomes other than pain. None of the medications had a substantial effect size (SMD > 0.2) except for SSRIs for depression and mirtazapine for sleep problems (Table 3).

Table 3.
Sleep problems, fatigue, depressed mood and health-related quality of life for Groups 4 and 5

There was a small improvement for participants receiving mirtazapine 15 mg to 45 mg a day in participant-reported sleep problems, but not in fatigue, negative mood, nor in health-related quality of life.

For duloxetine 60 mg and 120 mg daily, a significant benefit was reported at 12 weeks or less for the mean improvement in SF-36 physical subscore, bodily pain subscore, the Patient Reported Global Impression of Improvement, the British Pain Inventory severity of average pain, and pain at rest (night pain). Significant benefit for the mean improvement in SF-36 mental subscore was found only for the 120 mg dose.

For SNRIs (duloxetine and milnacipran) there were improvements overall and with each drug separately, for fatigue, depression, anxiety and HRQoL. There was an overall improvement in the tender point threshold with duloxetine but not milnacipran. There was no overall improvement in patient-reported sleep problems, although there was an improvement with duloxetine when analysed independently.

"While there were no serious AEs found in the evidence review", duloxetine had "more adverse effects" than placebo, including "nausea, insomnia, dry mouth, constipation, somnolence, fatigue, and hyperhidrosis", and "sexual side effects that may diminish treatment acceptability and adherence". Duloxetine "has a risk of hepatotoxicity and should not be used in patients with substantial alcohol use or evidence of chronic liver disease". Combining duloxetine with serotonergic medications "increases the risk of serotonin syndrome and should be used with caution". Antidepressants, including duloxetine, carry "a black box warning… for increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults". Duloxetine "may be preferred in patients with depression or anxiety" because it is "U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for these conditions, in addition to fibromyalgia".

### Hyponatremia associated with the use of common antidepressants in the all of Us research program [^1111PjRN]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

Common antidepressants can cause hyponatremia. However, the relative risks among different drugs over long‐term follow‐up are unknown.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

Are there differential risks of hyponatremia when prescribed one of eight common antidepressants?
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

With this large national cohort, this study demonstrated differential short‐ and long‐term risks among common antidepressants. Duloxetine was associated with hyponatremia at a greater rate than the other studied antidepressants. Bupropion and paroxetine were associated with the lowest risks of hyponatremia.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

Our study suggests that patients on duloxetine and other antidepressants with higher risks of hyponatremia might benefit from more rigorous monitoring for hyponatremia.

Several classes of commonly used antidepressants can cause hyponatremia via the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) through mechanisms involving the central nervous system. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) can lead to increased release of ADH from the posterior pituitary by potentiating the activation of adrenergic receptors within the hypothalamus. With SSRIs, the incidence of drug‐induced SIADH has been reported in 0.5 to 32% of patients using these drugs.

SSRIs, SNRIs, and norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) are widely used for the treatment of mood disorders (such as major depressive disorder), anxiety disorders, post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and chronic pain. In clinical practice, the selection of antidepressants is based on optimizing efficacy and minimizing toxicity. Other common side effects of these medications can include changes in eating habits, changes in sleep patterns, and changes in sexual function.

### Effects of adjunctive reboxetine in patients with duloxetine-resistant depression: a 12-week prospective study [^112EY9nz]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

The efficacy of the combination therapy with two antidepressants from different pharmacological families in patients with treatment-resistant depression has been reported in multiple studies. In this prospective 12-weeks open-label study, we assessed the effectiveness of the addition of reboxetine to 79 depressive outpatients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) according to the DSM-IV criteria who had previously not responded, or had done so only in a partial way, over 8 weeks of conventional treatment, in monotherapy, with duloxetine. Efficacy was assessed using the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I). Safety was evaluated by recording spontaneously reported adverse events. Data were analysed on an intent-to-treat basis, using the last-observation-carried-forward method. Mean HDRS reduction was 65.5% (P < 0.0001). The percentages of responders (≥ 50% reduction in HDRS) and patients considered benefiting from complete remission (HDRS ≤ 10 points) at week 12 were 76% and 69.3%, respectively. By the end of the treatment, the score of CGI-I decreased 68.5% (P < 0.0001). Percentage of patient improving (CGI < 4 points) was 95.8%. The most common non-serious adverse events were dry mouth, increased sweating, constipation and difficulty passing urine. The results of this study suggest that the combination strategy with reboxetine may be an effective and well-tolerated tool in duloxetine-resistant patients.

### Is duloxetine's effect on painful physical symptoms in depression an indirect result of improvement of depressive symptoms? Pooled analyses of three randomized controlled trials [^113k86GG]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

3. Results

3.1. Patient baseline characteristics

A total of 1320 patients were randomly assigned to the treatment groups, resulting in 641 receiving treatment with duloxetine and 679 receiving placebo (Table 2). Most of the patients were female (69.7%) and Caucasian (81.8%). The mean age (SD) of the patients was 46.5 (12.99) years. The mean baseline MADRS total score (SD) and BPI-SF average pain score (SD) were 29.9 (2.83) and 5.7 (1.63), respectively. Within this population, 25.5% were undergoing their first MDD episode. Gender and ethnicity distributions, age, and baseline illness characteristics were similar between duloxetine and placebo groups (Table 2).

Table 2
Baseline characteristics (all randomized patients).

3.1.1. Patient disposition

At the end of the 8-week treatment, there was no significant difference in the numbers of patients discontinued early between duloxetine and placebo groups (duloxetine: 15.9% vs placebo: 16.2%). A significantly (P = 0.0033) greater number of patients discontinued treatment for lack of efficacy in the placebo group (4.4%) compared with that in the duloxetine group (1.6%). There was no significant difference (P = 0.2261) between the duloxetine (5.3%) and placebo (3.8%) groups in discontinuation due to adverse events (Table 3).

### Switching to duloxetine from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants: a multicenter trial comparing 2 switching techniques [^113v3zhS]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare 2 methods of switching selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) non-responders or partial responders to duloxetine.

Method

Adult outpatients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder, a Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D(17)) total score of ≥ 15, and a Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness score of ≥ 3 despite at least 6 weeks of SSRI treatment were randomly assigned to either abrupt discontinuation of SSRI immediately followed by initiation of duloxetine (direct switch [DS]; N = 183) or tapered discontinuation of SSRI over 2 weeks and simultaneous administration of duloxetine (start-taper switch [STS]; N = 185). Efficacy, safety, and tolerability outcomes associated with these 2 switch methods were compared following switch and after 10 weeks of duloxetine treatment. The study was conducted from August 2004 to March 2006.

Results

There was a significant improvement in depressive symptom severity in both switch groups as measured by mean change in HAM-D(17) total score (p ≤ .001), but no difference between the switch groups (-10.23 DS vs. -10.49 STS). Criteria for noninferiority of the DS group to the STS group, which was the primary objective of the study, were met. Response rates (54.4% DS vs. 59.6% STS), remission rates (35.7% DS vs. 37.2% STS), and other secondary outcome measures were similar for both switch groups. Few patients discontinued the study due to adverse events (6.6% DS vs. 3.8% STS). Headache, dry mouth, and nausea were the most frequently reported adverse events in both switch groups.

Conclusions

Switch to duloxetine was associated with significant improvements in both emotional and painful physical symptoms of depression and was well tolerated and safe, regardless of which of the switch methods was used.

### Duloxetine for the long-term treatment of major depressive disorder in patients aged 65 and older: an open-label study [^1178oxEH]. BMC Geriatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment-emergent adverse events

Treatment-emergent adverse events occurring in > 5% of patients during the open-label therapy phase (Weeks 1 through 52) are summarized in Table 3. The incidence for these events during Weeks 1 to 8 and Weeks 9 to 52 are also listed in Table 3. During Weeks 1 through 52, adverse events reported by more than 10% of patients were dizziness, nausea, constipation, somnolence, insomnia, dry mouth, diarrhea, headache, and increased sweating. Over 75% of occurrences of these events were rated as mild or moderate in severity. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was lower during the latter 44 weeks of the study (Weeks 9 to 52) than during the first 8 weeks. Each event with an incidence of at least 5% during Weeks 9 to 52 was also present at the same or higher rate during the first 8 weeks.

Table 3
Treatment-emergent adverse events †

† Events with an occurrence > 5% in Weeks 1–52.

Rates of occurrence of other adverse events of importance in an elderly population were low: 2 patients experienced a fall, while there were single reports of syncope and postural hypotension. When analyzed by age group, patients aged 65 and older were found to report a significantly lower incidence of insomnia and headache than those patients aged < 65 (Table 4). No other significant differences were observed between age groups.

### Night sweats, sleep disturbance, and depression associated with diminished libido in late menopausal transition and early postmenopause: baseline data from the herbal alternatives for menopause trial (HALT) [^111wZNnR]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to evaluate the association of depression, sleep disturbance, and menopausal symptoms with diminished libido.

Study Design

Data from a 2001–2002 baseline survey of 341 peri- and postmenopausal women, aged 45–55 years, participating in a randomized trial, was analyzed. Eligibility included at least 2 hot flashes and/or night sweats per day and no hormone therapy for at least the prior 3 months. The survey evaluated sexual function, depression, sleep, and vasomotor symptoms. We examined the association between these factors, using multivariate regression models.

Results

Of 341 women, 64% had diminished libido, 18% had moderate to severe depression, and 43% had poor sleep quality. Women averaged 4.6 hot flashes and 1.9 night sweats per day. Depressive symptoms (P = 0.003), poor sleep (P = 0.02), and night sweats (P = 0.04) were significantly associated with diminished libido.

Conclusion

Factors associated with diminished libido in midlife are complex but include depression, disturbed sleep, and night sweats, all common symptoms of the menopausal transition and early menopause.

### Familial secondary hyperhidrosis associated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor treatment [^112qNAZn]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this report, we describe a case of secondary hyperhidrosis associated with tumor necrosis factor–alpha (TNF-α) inhibitor treatment. Given the timing of the onset of symptoms and initiation of treatment, TNF-α blockade is most likely the cause of hyperhidrosis in both the patient and his sibling. Moreover, the persistence of hyperhidrosis during both types of TNF-α inhibitor treatment, and the severity of hyperhidrosis tightly correlated to the frequency of anti–TNF-α treatment supports the hypothesis of medication-induced hyperhidrosis. It is important to consider whether other medications may have contributed to hyperhidrosis in this case. The patient's medical history was notable for depression for which he was being treated with duloxetine. Duloxetine is known to cause hyperhidrosis via perturbation of serotonin and norepinephrine in the central nervous system and periphery. Because the sweating occurred only after initiation of therapy for uveitis and colitis, duloxetine is unlikely the causative trigger of his hyperhidrosis. Prednisolone, a metabolite of prednisone, is also associated with hyperhidrosis but presumably because of its action on the glucocorticoid receptor and downstream effects of increased sympathetic activity. Of note, prednisolone therapy has been used successfully to treat acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis. Prednisone was initiated with adalimumab and could have contributed to the hyperhidrosis. However, the patient reports that the symptoms of hyperhidrosis remained the same even after tapering of the prednisone dose and initiated therapy on infliximab. Azathioprine is not associated with hyperhidrosis.

### Duloxetine hydrochloride (Cymbalta) [^114iDUdg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Although the exact mechanisms of the antidepressant, central pain inhibitory and anxiolytic actions of duloxetine in humans are unknown, these actions are believed to be related to its potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in the CNS.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Preclinical studies have shown that duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and a less potent inhibitor of dopamine reuptake. Duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA receptors in vitro. Duloxetine does not inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO).

CYMBALTA is in a class of drugs known to affect urethral resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of CYMBALTA 160 mg and 200 mg administered twice daily (2.7 and 3.3 times the maximum recommended dosage, respectively) to steady state was evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded, two-way crossover study in 117 healthy female adult subjects. No QT interval prolongation was detected. CYMBALTA appears to be associated with concentration-dependent but not clinically meaningful QT shortening.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Duloxetine has an elimination half-life of about 12 hours (range 8 to 17 hours) and its pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the therapeutic range. Steady-state plasma concentrations are typically achieved after 3 days of dosing. Elimination of duloxetine is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozymes, CYP1A2 and CYP2D6.

Absorption

After oral CYMBALTA administration, duloxetine hydrochloride is well absorbed. There is a median 2 hour lag until absorption begins (Tlag), with maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) of duloxetine occurring 6 hours post dose. There is a 3 hour delay in absorption and a one-third increase in apparent clearance of duloxetine after an evening dose as compared to a morning dose.

Effect of Food: Food does not affect the Cmaxof duloxetine, but delays the time to reach peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of absorption (AUC) by about 10%.

Distribution

The apparent volume of distribution averages about 1640 L. Duloxetine is highly bound (> 90%) to proteins in human plasma, binding primarily to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. The interaction between duloxetine and other highly protein bound drugs has not been fully evaluated. Plasma protein binding of duloxetine is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment.

### Duloxetine (Drizalma sprinkle) [^114uqCxY]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.7	Discontinuation Syndrome

Discontinuation symptoms have been systematically evaluated in patients taking duloxetine. Following abrupt or tapered discontinuation in adult placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following symptoms occurred at 1% or greater and at a significantly higher rate in duloxetine-treated patients compared to those discontinuing from placebo: dizziness, headache, nausea, diarrhea, paresthesia, irritability, vomiting, insomnia, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, and fatigue.

Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures.

Monitor patients for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with DRIZALMA SPRINKLE [see Dosage and Administration (2.10)]. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the healthcare provider may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.9)].

5.8	Activation of Mania/Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with DRIZALMA SPRINKLE or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In controlled clinical trials in adult patients with major depressive disorder, patients with bipolar disorder were generally excluded; however, symptoms of mania or hypomania were reported in 0.1% of patients treated with duloxetine delayed-release capsules. No activation of mania or hypomania was reported in DPNP, GAD, fibromyalgia, or chronic musculoskeletal pain placebo-controlled trials.

Prior to initiating treatment with DRIZALMA SPRINKLE, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.

5.9	Angle-Closure Glaucoma

The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs, including DRIZALMA SPRINKLE, may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Avoid use of antidepressants, including DRIZALMA SPRINKLE, in patients with anatomically narrow angles.

### Duloxetine versus placebo for the treatment of women with stress predominant urinary incontinence in Taiwan: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^112e6Djb]. BMC Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Significantly more duloxetine-treated women than placebo-treated women experienced TEAEs with 26.7% of duloxetine-treated women discontinuing therapy due to adverse events. Unlike the core registration studies, this study did not have a 2-week placebo lead-in phase which may have increased the number of TEAEs reported relative to those studies in which the discontinuation rate due to adverse events was 20.5% for duloxetine-treated subjects. Mean BMI in the Taiwanese women was lower than the mean BMI in women included in the core studies which could contribute to the increased number of women reporting TEAEs and discontinuing.

Nausea was a frequent adverse event associated with duloxetine treatment; 3.3% of all duloxetine patients discontinued due to nausea, although the majority of women who experienced duloxetine-related nausea completed the study. Nausea tended to start soon after the initiation of duloxetine treatment. In most cases, nausea was mild to moderate, did not worsen after its onset, and resolved within 1 week to 1 month of therapy.

Overall, the majority of TEAEs reported by > 5% of duloxetine-treated subjects and significantly more often than in placebo-treated subjects, tended to be mild in severity. One subject reported severe nausea. In no instance did any of these TEAEs increase in severity. The majority of women that experienced fatigue, nausea, and somnolence but remained in the study had resolution of the events within 30 days.

Constipation, dry mouth, and hyperhidrosis tended to persist longer than 30 days. This TEAE profile is largely consistent with published data from Africa, Australia, Europe, and North and South America. The improvement associated with duloxetine treatment should be weighed against a considerable discontinuation rate due to early adverse events.

### Treatment satisfaction, unmet needs, and new treatment expectations for vasomotor symptoms due to menopause: women's and physicians' opinions [^115wKAXM]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes collected for participants were unmet needs with current available VMS treatments, willingness to use new VMS treatments, and expectations for new VMS treatments.

Unmet needs with available VMS treatments

Unmet needs with current available VMS treatments were assessed to elucidate the perceived impact of current treatments on symptom improvement, benefits of current treatments, risks of current treatments, and women's and physicians' involvement in treatment decision-making.

Survey participants rated symptom improvement based on the extent to which current VMS treatments improved hot flashes, night sweats, sleep, mood, sexual desire, work, concentration, disruption in daily activities, and quality of life on a 5-point Likert scale (not at all, a little, somewhat, quite a bit, very much).

Perceived benefits of current treatments were rated based on treatment features that met women's and physicians' expectations based on their self-report, including improvement of hot flashes and night sweats, improvement in quality of life, no short-term side effects, minor side effects that required minimal treatment, limited or no long-term safety concerns, convenience of mode of administration, treatment frequency, insurance coverage, low out-of-pocket costs, and an "other" category.

Expectations of new treatments

Expectations of new VMS treatments were assessed based on "women's and physicians" expectations for whether a new treatment was better at reducing frequency of hot flashes and night sweats, was better at reducing severity of hot flashes and night sweats, would improve sleep quality, would reduce the impact of hot flashes and night sweats on work, would improve mood disruptions, would improve sex drive, and would improve general quality of life. Expectations also included how the treatment would be delivered (ie, pill, patch, ring, or topical formulation), how often it would be administered (ie, once daily or less than once daily), if it would have no/fewer interactions with other drugs, if it would lower risk of short-term side effects, if it would have limited/no long-term safety concerns, if it would be covered by insurance/lower cost, and an "other" category.

### The combination of duloxetine and bupropion for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder [^1139hmy2]. Depression and Anxiety (2006). Low credibility.

Our objective was to assess the effectiveness and safety of the combination of duloxetine and bupropion for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TRD). A retrospective chart review was conducted to identify patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who had not experienced full remission of symptoms following an adequate trial of either duloxetine (n = 3) or bupropion (n = 7), and who then received the combination of these two antidepressants for TRD. Ten patients [37.2 ± 11.3 years of age, five women, baseline Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale score 4.4 ± 1.1], seven of whom had not remitted following treatment with bupropion (330 ± 67 mg, 20.5 ± 12.2 weeks), and three of whom had not remitted following treatment with duloxetine (90 ± 30 mg, 18 ± 2 weeks) received at least 4 weeks of combination treatment. The CGI was administered when the combination was first prescribed, and following 8.8 ± 4.0 (range, 4–16) weeks of treatment. There was a significant decrease in CGI-S (Severity) scores (4.4 ± 1.1 to 2.1 ± 0.9, P < .0001) following combination treatment. Three (30%) patients were remitters at follow-up, and six (60%) were responders who did not achieve full symptom remission. The mean maximum adjunctive duloxetine and bupropion doses were 60.0 ± 17.3 mg and 175.0 ± 114.5 mg, respectively. Side effects reported during combination treatment were nausea (n = 2), dry mouth (n = 2), jitteriness/agitation (n = 2), fatigue/drowsiness (n = 2), increased blood pressure (n = 1), increased sweating (n = 1), insomnia (n = 1), pruritus (n = 1), headache (n = 1), sexual dysfunction (n = 1), and weight gain (n = 1). Although preliminary, these results suggest a possible role for the combination of duloxetine and bupropion for TRD.
