## Question

can you give sprintec with history of von willebrand disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Sprintec (norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol), a combined oral contraceptive, can be used in a patient with a history of von Willebrand disease, and under what conditions it would be safe and appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the product labeling and whether vWD is a contraindication. Then, I should verify the thrombotic risk profile of combined hormonal contraceptives and how that interfaces with a bleeding disorder like vWD. Next, I will review disease-specific guidelines for managing heavy menstrual bleeding in vWD and whether they endorse combined hormonal contraception. After that, I need to weigh benefits versus risks in vWD, construct an individualized risk assessment, and consider alternatives like levonorgestrel IUS or tranexamic acid. Finally, I will outline practical prescribing, monitoring, and multidisciplinary coordination so that the recommendation is clinically actionable.

> Let me first confirm the FDA labeling and contraindications for Sprintec; wait, let me verify that vWD is not listed as a contraindication and check for any disease-specific warnings. The structured product labeling for norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol highlights absolute contraindications such as acute or decompensated liver disease and thrombotic disorders, but it does not list von Willebrand disease anywhere as a contraindication or special warning, which means vWD per se is not a labeled reason to avoid Sprintec [^1145zW8v] [^116SFnrd].

> Next, I should review the venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk attributable to combined hormonal contraceptives; hold on, I need to be precise about the absolute risk and time course. Combined hormonal contraceptives increase VTE risk to roughly 3–12 per 10,000 woman‑years, with the highest risk during the first year of use and when restarting after a break of four weeks or more, and risk factors that amplify this include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, while pregnancy and the postpartum period carry even higher VTE risk than CHCs, which is relevant when counseling on contraception options and baseline risk framing [^112bQdBz] [^115vdsco].

> Now, let me think about vWD pathophysiology and baseline thrombotic risk; hmm, wait a minute, I almost conflated vWD with thrombophilia — no, vWD is a primary hemostatic bleeding disorder due to quantitative or qualitative defects in VWF, leading to mucocutaneous bleeding, not a prothrombotic state, so vWD itself does not inherently elevate baseline VTE risk, though the individual may still have independent VTE risk factors that matter when using estrogen-containing contraceptives [^11798kDm].

> I should confirm what disease-specific guidelines say about hormonal management of heavy menstrual bleeding in vWD; hold on, I should verify whether combined oral contraceptives are actually recommended. The 2021 ASH/ISTH/NHF/WFH guidelines explicitly suggest considering hormonal therapy — either combined hormonal contraception or a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system — or tranexamic acid for patients with vWD who have heavy menstrual bleeding and do not desire pregnancy, as part of shared decision-making that weighs bleeding control and risks, which directly supports the appropriateness of CHCs in this population when clinically indicated [^111YKKUM] [^114msFSa]. Moreover, these guidelines also highlight hormonal therapy's benefits beyond bleeding control, including relief of dysmenorrhea and management of endometriosis or PCOS symptoms, which can further tip the balance toward CHCs for some patients [^116Au3wA].

> Let me weigh the benefit–risk ratio more explicitly; I need to ensure I am not over- or under-stating either side. Benefits include effective control of heavy menstrual bleeding with improved quality of life and iron status, and provision of reliable contraception in someone who may be particularly harmed by anemia from ongoing bleeding, while the absolute VTE risk with CHCs remains low and is still lower than the thrombotic risk of pregnancy, especially postpartum, which is a key comparative anchor during counseling; ACOG has historically recognized combined hormonal contraception as a first-line medical option for menorrhagia in women with vWD, though higher-quality comparative data remain limited and decisions should be individualized [^112bQdBz] [^111jiNpw].

> Before prescribing, I should construct an individualized risk assessment; hold on, I should verify which elements are essential. I will assess vWD type and bleeding phenotype, quantify heavy menstrual bleeding and treat iron deficiency or anemia, screen for VTE risk factors such as age over 35 years, smoking, obesity, major immobility, or a family history of VTE, and complete a standard gynecologic evaluation to exclude structural causes of bleeding if not already done, because these steps directly influence both safety and expected efficacy of CHCs and alternatives in vWD [^111B2mQS] [^112bQdBz] [^114PungM] [^114ZUoQL].

> But wait, what if VTE risk factors are present or the patient is averse to estrogen? In those circumstances, I should reconsider estrogen exposure and preferentially discuss alternatives such as the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, progestin-only methods, or tranexamic acid for cycle days with heavy flow, because these strategies avoid systemic estrogen and are guideline‑supported options for vWD with heavy menstrual bleeding, with progestin‑only methods generally carrying minimal or no additional thrombotic risk compared with combined methods, although patient-specific factors and preferences still guide the final choice [^114msFSa] [^116CHH2S] [^116UCo8n].

> I need to check for special scenarios that could change the plan; for example, if the patient is anticoagulated or comes from a thrombophilia family. In women on anticoagulation, LNG‑IUS and some progestin‑only options have supportive evidence for improving bleeding while maintaining contraceptive efficacy, and for women with a family history of high‑risk thrombophilia such as antithrombin, protein C, or protein S deficiency, ASH suggests considering targeted thrombophilia testing to inform avoidance of CHCs if high‑risk thrombophilia is present, which can materially alter the risk–benefit calculus for Sprintec [^114w8Er3] [^112XNT1y].

> Hold on, I should verify practical prescribing and monitoring details if we proceed with Sprintec. I would counsel on VTE symptom vigilance, avoid use in the presence of absolute contraindications such as acute or decompensated liver disease, reassess bleeding control, side effects, and adherence at about three months, and check hemoglobin and ferritin to ensure heavy menstrual bleeding is adequately controlled and iron stores are recovering, adjusting the plan based on response and tolerance in an iterative shared decision‑making process [^1145zW8v] [^112bQdBz] [^111B2mQS].

> Let me double-check a common logistical question: do CHCs preclude diagnostic testing for vWD if the diagnosis is still in question? Reassuringly, adolescents and young women who are already on CHCs for menorrhagia can generally undergo VWF antigen, VWF activity, and FVIII testing without stopping hormones, minimizing the risk of rebound heavy bleeding from discontinuation while proceeding with evaluation if needed, which is a practical point for ongoing diagnostic workups [^113KUiZr].

> I should confirm the need for multidisciplinary input; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without emphasizing coordination. For vWD patients choosing among hormonal and nonhormonal options, external guidance underscores shared decision‑making with hematology and gynecology to balance bleeding control, contraceptive goals, and thrombotic risk, which is particularly important when comorbidities or competing risks complicate the choice of therapy [^1163JB5u] [^114msFSa].

> Putting it all together, Sprintec can be used in patients with a history of vWD when there are no absolute contraindications and when an individualized assessment shows low overall VTE risk, especially when contraception and heavy menstrual bleeding control are both desired, with counseling that frames the small absolute VTE risk against the benefits and against the higher thrombotic risk of pregnancy; if meaningful VTE risk factors or high‑risk thrombophilia are present, estrogen‑free alternatives such as LNG‑IUS, progestin‑only methods, or tranexamic acid should be prioritized, and all decisions should be made through shared decision‑making with appropriate monitoring and follow‑up for efficacy and safety [^1145zW8v] [^112bQdBz] [^111YKKUM] [^114msFSa] [^112XNT1y].

Sprintec (norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol) **can be used** in women with von Willebrand disease (VWD) to manage heavy menstrual bleeding [^111YKKUM], as combined hormonal contraception is recommended for this purpose. However, **individualized risk assessment** is essential because CHCs increase venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk [^115vdsco], especially in women with additional risk factors (e.g. obesity, smoking, thrombophilia) [^112bQdBz]. For women with high VTE risk or contraindications to estrogen, consider progestin-only methods [^116CHH2S] or the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) [^114msFSa] [^111htNGZ]. Shared decision-making and close monitoring for bleeding or thrombotic events are recommended [^111jiNpw].

---

## Clinical considerations for sprintec use in vwd

### Benefits

Key benefits include **menstrual control** [^111jiNpw] — CHCs (including Sprintec) are effective for heavy menstrual bleeding in VWD [^111YKKUM] — and **ovarian suppression**, as CHCs reduce hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, which are common in VWD [^113vZUEb].

---

### Risks

Key risks include **thrombotic risk** — CHCs increase VTE risk [^112bQdBz], particularly with additional factors such as obesity, smoking, or thrombophilia [^115vdsco] — and **bleeding risk**, as CHCs may cause breakthrough bleeding, which can be problematic in VWD [^112DJoyB].

---

## Guidelines and recommendations

The ASH/ISTH/NHF/WFH 2021 guidelines **recommend CHCs or the LNG-IUS** for heavy menstrual bleeding in VWD [^111YKKUM], with individualized risk–benefit assessment and shared decision-making [^114msFSa]. The **LNG-IUS is particularly effective** and may be preferred for some patients [^114msFSa] [^111htNGZ].

---

## Alternative contraceptive options

For women with VWD who have contraindications to estrogen or elevated thrombotic risk, **consider** the following:

- **Progestin-only methods**: Pills, injectables, or implants [^116CHH2S].
- **LNG-IUS**: Highly effective for bleeding control and contraception [^114msFSa] [^114w8Er3].
- **Non-hormonal methods**: Copper IUD or barrier methods.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is **essential** [^111B2mQS] for women with VWD using Sprintec and should include:

- **Bleeding assessment**: Track menstrual bleeding and breakthrough bleeding [^114PungM].
- **Thrombotic surveillance**: Monitor for VTE symptoms (leg swelling, pain, shortness of breath) [^112XNT1y].
- **Laboratory monitoring**: Periodic VWF and factor VIII levels as indicated [^114HPqqN].

---

## Patient counseling

Counsel patients on the following:

- **Risks and benefits**: Discuss bleeding control and thrombotic risks [^111YKKUM].
- **Adherence**: Emphasize consistent use to minimize breakthrough bleeding [^112DJoyB].
- **Warning signs**: Educate on symptoms of bleeding and thrombosis [^116SFnrd].

---

Sprintec can be used in women with VWD for menstrual bleeding control [^111YKKUM], but **requires individualized risk assessment**, shared decision-making, and close monitoring. Alternative options should be considered for those with higher thrombotic risk or estrogen contraindications [^115vdsco].

Regarding specific circumstances for von Willebrand disease, more specifically with respect to patients with heavy menstrual bleeding, ASH/ISTH/NHF/WFH 2021 guidelines recommend considering initiating either hormonal therapy (combined hormonal contraception or levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) or tranexamic acid instead of desmopressin for the treatment of patients with vWD with heavy menstrual bleeding who do not wish to conceive.

### Norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol [^112bQdBz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Use of combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) increases the risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Risk factors for VTEs include smoking, obesity, and a family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate the use of CHCs. The risk of VTE may be greater with the norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system in women with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² compared to women with a lower BMI [see Contraindications (4)].

While the risk of VTE associated with the use of CHCs is well-established, the rates of VTE are even greater during pregnancy, especially during the post-partum period [see Figure 1]. The frequency of VTE in women using CHCs has been estimated to be 3 to 12 cases per 10,000 woman-years.

The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of CHC use and when restarting hormonal contraception following a break of 4 weeks or longer. This initial higher risk declines during the first year, but users of CHCs remain at an increased risk of VTE compared to non-users of CHCs. Based on results from a few studies, there is some evidence that this increased risk applies to non-oral products as well. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to CHCs gradually disappears after CHC use is discontinued.

- **Figure 1**: Shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs, for women who use CHCs with a range of doses and routes of administration, for pregnant women, and for women in the post-partum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective, if 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs are followed for one year.

### Recombinant von Willebrand factor prophylaxis in patients with severe von Willebrand disease: Phase 3 study results [^114TYwcr]. Blood (2022). Low credibility.

Because no formal statistical tests were planned for this study, the sample size was not based on a power calculation for a significance test but was driven mainly by the European Medicines Agency Guideline on the Clinical Investigation of Human pdVWF Products. Approximately 22 adults were to be included in the study, with ≥ 8 patients in each cohort and a total of ≥ 5 patients with type 3 VWD.

The safety analysis set comprised all patients who signed informed consent and received any amount of rVWF. The full analysis set, the primary analysis population for the efficacy outcome measures, comprised all patients who received rVWF prophylaxis. The pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) full analysis set comprised all patients who received ≥ 1 rVWF infusion and provided ≥ 1 quantifiable PK or PD measurement after administration for the PK or PD analysis.

The primary endpoint analysis provided an estimation of sABR through month 12. The mean and 95% Wald confidence interval (CI) for the historical and on-study sABRs and the ratio of the two sABRs (on-study/historical) were estimated within each group using a generalized linear mixed-effects model fitting a negative binomial distribution and a logarithmic link function. The number of unique bleeding events (BEs) for each patient by observation period (historical or on-study) was a dependent variable, and the observation period (historical or on-study) was an independent term. The model options included the logarithm of the observation period duration (in years) as an offset. Historical sABR was based on reliable medical records for BEs occurring within 12 months.

### How I manage severe von Willebrand disease [^112NwtbW]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

This guideline is intended for a broad range of severe VWD patients, including those with type 1 Vicenza, type 1 with VWF levels below 10 IU/dL, type 2A, type 2B, and type 3 disease. It also caters to individual VWD patients with a severe bleeding phenotype, irrespective of their disease type. Additionally, recommendations are included for patients at high risk for bleeding in specific situations. These include pregnant women with VWD whose VWF levels do not increase above 50 IU/dL during the third trimester and patients experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Von Willebrand factor levels in the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11798kDm]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

The reported prevalence of VWD is up to 1% in the general population based on epidemiologic studies, with a symptomatic prevalence of approximately 0.1% at the primary care level. The prevalence of VWD is about 15% in women with heavy menstrual bleeding, making it the most common inherited bleeding disorder known in humans. VWD is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of VWF, a multimeric glycoprotein that binds platelets at sites of vascular injury and stabilizes circulating coagulation factor VIII (FVIII).

Patients with VWD can experience easy bruising, bleeding from the oral cavity, heavy menstrual bleeding, as well as bleeding after dental work, surgical procedures, and childbirth. Joint bleeding may also occur in more severe deficiency. These symptoms vary among patients with VWD, and the bleeding phenotype can fluctuate throughout the life of a patient with VWD, leading to the need for accurate diagnosis of VWD types and subtypes and individualized management plans. Different types and subtypes of VWD have been defined depending on the type of abnormality in VWF. A patient with partial quantitative deficiency in VWF would have type 1 VWD, whereas a patient with a virtual absence of VWF would have type 3 VWD. Patients with type 2 VWD have qualitative abnormalities of VWF: type 2A is characterized by reduced or absent high molecular weight VWF, type 2B results from a gain of function in VWF that increases its affinity for platelets, type 2M is caused by reduced VWF interactions with platelets or collagen, and type 2N results from reduced binding of VWF to FVIII.

### Cablivi [^112JCmrB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In cases of overdose, due to the pharmacological action of Cablivi, there is a potential for an increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Close monitoring for signs and symptoms of bleeding is recommended. If necessary, the use of von Willebrand factor concentrate could be considered to correct hemostasis.

### How I treat von Willebrand disease [^114b8sh1]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Recent multicenter studies have clarified the molecular basis underlying the different von Willebrand disease (VWD) types, all of which are caused by the deficiency and/or abnormality of von Willebrand factor (VWF). These studies have suggested a unifying pathophysiologic concept. The diagnosis of VWD remains difficult because its clinical and laboratory phenotype is very heterogeneous and may overlap with normal subjects. Stringent criteria are therefore required for a clinically useful diagnosis. In this paper, we delineate a practical approach to the diagnosis and treatment of VWD. Our approach is based on the critical importance of a standardized bleeding history that has been condensed into a final bleeding score and a few widely available laboratory tests, such as VWF ristocetin cofactor activity, VWF antigen, and factor VIII. This approach would help identify those subjects who will probably benefit from a diagnosis of VWD.

The next step involves performing a trial infusion with desmopressin in all patients who fail to exhibit an enhanced responsiveness to ristocetin. On the basis of these results, and through a series of illustrative examples, the clinician will be able to select the best approach for the optimal management of VWD according to the patient's characteristics and clinical circumstances.

### Acog committee opinion no. 451: Von Willebrand disease in women [^111jiNpw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Approximately 3 million women in the United States have inherited bleeding disorders. The prevalence of bleeding disorders is particularly high among women with menorrhagia. Von Willebrand disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. Once a diagnosis is made, collaboration with a hematologist is helpful for long-term management. Women with Von Willebrand disease may be at increased risk for gynecologic and obstetric complications. Many treatments are available for the control of menorrhagia in women with Von Willebrand disease, but the first-line therapy remains combined hormonal contraception.

### Oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy: How strong a risk factor for venous thromboembolism [^113N3ryE]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Low credibility.

Exogenous hormone therapies, such as combined oral contraceptives (COC) and hormone replacement therapy (HRT), cause blood hypercoagulability and are a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). There is controversy regarding how strong this "provoking" risk factor is and how other risk factors may synergize to increase VTE risk. We aim to review the latest literature on the risk of initial and recurrent VTE with COC and HRT use to provide guidance for decision-making about the duration of anticoagulation and to guide future research efforts.

### Gynecologic and obstetric management of women with von Willebrand disease: summary of 3 systematic reviews of the literature [^111htNGZ]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

We conducted three systematic reviews (SRs) to inform the recommendations on the obstetric and gynecologic management of women with von Willebrand Disease (VWD) for the American Society of Hematology (ASH), the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF), and the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH). The questions were prioritized by the guideline panel based on areas of significant need in the field of VWD, along with input from an international survey of clinicians, patients, and caregivers. As part of this project, other SRs were developed to cover the perioperative management and von Willebrand factor (VWF) prophylaxis in patients with VWD (manuscript submitted).

In this SR, we found mostly very low-certainty evidence from comparative observational studies and case series. Further data are needed to determine the optimal hierarchy of treatment of women with VWD and heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). The evidence suggests that:

1. There is very low certainty about the efficacy of different treatment options in women with VWD. Because hormonal therapy is effective in controlling HMB based on data from women without bleeding disorders, we believe the most effective strategy to be hormonal therapy with a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) or combined oral contraceptives, followed by tranexamic acid (TxA), and desmopressin.

2. There is high uncertainty about how VWF levels of 0.50 to 1.50 IU/mL compare with VWF levels greater than 1.50 IU/mL in women with VWD who receive epidural anesthesia during labor.

3. TxA may have benefits in women with VWD in the postpartum period, but there is much uncertainty in this evidence.

Overall, the certainty of the evidence for all the SRs was very low. There was a single randomized clinical trial that enrolled 116 participants addressing one of the comparisons of interest in SR1.

### Case-based discussion on the implications of exogenous estrogens in hemostasis and thrombosis: The obstetrician's view [^113vZUEb]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

This paper presents an obstetrician's perspective on three clinical scenarios involving bleeding and thrombotic disorders.

- **First scenario**: An 18-year-old with a history of heavy menstrual bleeding since menarche experiences abdominal pain. An ultrasound suggests a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, indicating an underlying bleeding disorder. Management goals include controlling hemorrhage and preserving fertility. Ovarian suppression is outlined as the most effective method to prevent recurring hemorrhagic ovarian cysts. Long-term management of heavy menstrual bleeding with hormonal contraception is also described.

- **Second scenario**: The same patient returns five years later for a preconception visit. The potential risks to an unborn baby with von Willebrand disease (VWD) are addressed. Although there is a natural rise in von Willebrand factor (VWF) during pregnancy, women with VWD do not achieve the same VWF levels as those without VWD, which is emphasized. The implications are presented in anticipation of pregnancy, alongside the need for nonhormonal management of heavy menstrual bleeding and hemorrhagic ovarian cysts.

- **Third scenario**: The patient's cousin, who has factor V Leiden, seeks consultation regarding thrombosis risks with in vitro fertilization. The process of assisted reproductive technology is described, with details on preventing venous thromboembolism by avoiding ovarian hyperstimulation and reducing the likelihood of multiple gestations.

### Recombinant von Willebrand factor prophylaxis in patients with severe von Willebrand disease: Phase 3 study results [^116VMiKp]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

Treated spontaneous ABRs were assessed in different groups: (A) the prior on-demand group and (B) the switch group (FAS). The figures illustrate the proportion of patients in each bleeding category, historically and during the study, as well as the mean (SD) and median (range) changes from historical to on-study spontaneous annual bleeding rate (sABR) through month 12. Historically, within the past 12 months, none of the patients in the prior on-demand group had a 0 or > 0 to 2 sABR.

Most patients (18 out of 23) had 0 treated spontaneous bleeding events (BEs) while receiving recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF) prophylaxis through month 12. Of the 5 patients who experienced treated spontaneous BEs, 3 showed reductions in their historical sABR, whereas 2 exhibited an increase. Historical and on-study spontaneous BEs are displayed by patient in supplemental Figure 1. Most of the on-study treated spontaneous BEs in these 5 patients were mucosal bleeds and/or cases of menorrhagia. Specifically, in the prior on-demand group, there were 5 oral/other mucosal bleeds, 3 instances of menorrhagia, and 1 bleed at another location. In the switch group, there were 14 oral/other mucosal bleeds, 1 hemarthrosis, and 3 bleeds at an unknown location. There were no occurrences of muscle/soft tissue, skin, gastrointestinal, central nervous system, or body cavity bleeds, and no hematuria was reported.

- **rVWF prophylactic consumption**: Most patients (prior on-demand: 100%; switch: 80%) initiated a twice-weekly rVWF prophylaxis regimen. Three patients experienced at least one increase in their dosing regimen: 1 patient in the prior on-demand group shifted from twice weekly to three times weekly, and 2 patients in the switch group changed from twice weekly to three times weekly or every 3 days. The mean (SD) weight-adjusted weekly rVWF dose per patient was 98.6.

### The diagnosis and management of von Willebrand disease: a United Kingdom Haemophilia Centre Doctors Organization guideline approved by the British Committee for Standards in Haematology [^115WeHtV]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for von Willebrand disease" serves as a crucial tool for identifying patients with this common inherited bleeding disorder. The primary purpose of these criteria is to facilitate accurate diagnosis, enabling appropriate management and treatment strategies for affected individuals.

The diagnostic process involves two key components. The first is a history of significant mucocutaneous bleeding, which is a common symptom in patients with von Willebrand disease. This may include easy bruising, frequent nosebleeds, prolonged bleeding from minor wounds, or heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding in women.

The second component is a laboratory finding of von Willebrand factor activity less than 0.3 units/mL. von Willebrand factor is a protein that aids in blood clotting, and its activity can be measured through a laboratory test. A low level of von Willebrand factor activity indicates von Willebrand disease.

The diagnosis is confirmed if both these criteria are met; if either is not met, the diagnosis is not confirmed. This binary approach ensures a high degree of specificity in the diagnostic process, reducing the likelihood of false-positive results.

This tool is designed to determine whether an individual meets the diagnostic criteria for von Willebrand disease based on two key clinical inputs.

### How we make an accurate diagnosis of von Willebrand disease [^112VZFAi]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a common autosomally inherited hemorrhagic disorder mainly associated with mucocutaneous bleeding. VWD results from quantitative (type 1 and 3) or qualitative (type 2) defects of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a large multimeric plasma glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in hemostasis. VWF is essential for mediating platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of vascular injury under high shear stress conditions. Additionally, VWF carries coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), prolonging its half-life and concentrating it at the damaged endothelium.

According to guidelines from the International Society for Thrombosis and Hemostasis, diagnosing VWD requires several assays to evaluate VWF's capacity to interact with various ligands, such as platelet glycoprotein Ibα, collagen, and FVIII. Hence, the differential diagnosis of VWD into types 1, 2A, 2B, 2M, 2N, or 3 requires specialized laboratories. These laboratories routinely perform specific tests, like multimer analysis or ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination.

However, the basic identification of VWD patients is possible in many hemostasis laboratories due to automated tests. These tests measure VWF antigen levels and its platelet-dependent activity in patient plasma. Despite this, laboratory investigations for VWD in individuals with a suspected hemorrhagic tendency should commence only after the attending physician, upon evaluating personal and family bleeding history, confirms the suspicion of VWD.

### Von Willebrand's disease in the year 2003: Towards the complete identification of gene defects for correct diagnosis and treatment [^1152tSAd]. Haematologica (2003). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand's disease (VWD) is an autosomally inherited bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or abnormality of von Willebrand factor (VWF). VWF is a multimeric adhesive protein which plays an important role in primary hemostasis by promoting platelet adhesion to the subendothelium at sites of vascular injury and platelet-platelet interactions in high shear-rate conditions. It is also the carrier of factor VIII (FVIII), thus indirectly contributing to the coagulation process. VWD has a prevalence of about 1% in the general population, but the figure for clinically relevant cases is lower (about 100/million inhabitants). Bleeding manifestations are heterogeneous; mucosal bleeding is typical of all VWD cases but hemarthrosis and hematomas may also be present when FVIII levels are low.

- **Information sources**: Most cases appear to have a partial quantitative deficiency of VWF (type 1 VWD) with variable bleeding tendency, whereas qualitative variants (type 2 VWD), due to a dysfunctional VWF, are clinically more homogeneous. Type 3 VWD is rare, and the patients have a moderate to severe bleeding diathesis because of the virtual absence of VWF, and a recessive pattern of inheritance. The diagnosis of VWD, especially type I, may be difficult because the laboratory phenotype is highly heterogeneous and is confounded by the fact that factors outside the VWF gene (e.g. blood group) influence VWF levels. An array of tests is usually required to characterize the VWD types of the disorder and establish the best treatment modality.

- **Conclusions**: The aim of treatment is to

### Diagnosis of von Willebrand disease [^1134Y5dm]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder, resulting from a deficiency and/or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (VWF). Since its first description 100 years ago, the diagnosis of VWD has evolved due to advancements in laboratory diagnostic tests and clinical guidelines and recommendations.

There are three established diagnostic criteria for VWD: a personal history of excessive mucocutaneous bleeding, a family history of bleeding, and reduced VWF levels. Over the years, the diagnosis of VWD has been challenging due to a lack of consensus and barriers to achieving an accurate and timely diagnosis. In 2021, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines were developed. These guidelines have provided clarity and consensus, but there continue to be opposing views and challenges. Additionally, there remain barriers to achieving a diagnosis of VWD that need to be addressed.

### Management of von Willebrand disease with a factor VIII-poor von Willebrand factor concentrate: Results from a prospective observational post-marketing study [^115BG9bs]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is caused by a deficiency or abnormality of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a multimeric glycoprotein with a high molecular weight. VWF plays a crucial role in primary hemostasis, promoting the adhesion of platelets to subendothelium after vascular injury and in blood coagulation as it carries and protects factor VIII (FVIII) from inactivation and rapid catabolism. VWD is a heterogeneous disease ranging from moderate to very severe deficiency in VWF and is classified into three different types: type 1 and type 3 are characterized by a partial or (virtually) complete quantitative deficiency of VWF, while type 2 results from qualitative defects. The prevalence of VWD in patients referred for clinically relevant bleeding symptoms is about 0.01%, although the most severe form, type 3 VWD, is very rare (0.5‐5 cases/million).

The goal of VWD therapy is the correction of the VWF defect and, consequently, the correction of abnormal platelet adhesion and the abnormal intrinsic coagulation pathway. Several plasma‐derived VWF/FVIII factor concentrates, initially developed for the treatment of hemophilia A and containing large amounts of VWF, can be used to treat desmopressin‐unresponsive or intolerant patients with VWD. These VWF/FVIII products vary in VWF/FVIII ratio, depending upon the manufacturing process. As the FVIII defect in VWD is secondary to that of VWF, the endogenous synthesis of FVIII is normal, contrary to hemophilia A. Thus, correction of the VWF defect results also in the correction of FVIII.

### New advances in the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease [^1161t2Jc]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common autosomal inherited bleeding disorder, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 1000 individuals. VWD is classified into quantitative and qualitative forms. Diagnosis of VWD is complex and requires:

- **Personal and family history**: A personal history of bleeding symptoms and a family history of bleeding or VWD.
- **Laboratory testing**: Confirmatory laboratory testing, which includes measurement of von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen levels, VWF platelet binding activity (VWF:RCo, VWF:GPIbM, and VWF:GPIbR), and factor VIII (FVIII) activity.

There are bleeding assessment tools to objectively measure bleeding symptoms in patients. These tools have been shown to correlate with both the diagnosis and the severity of VWD. Additional testing to confirm the specific subtype may include VWF collagen binding activity, low-dose ristocetin VWF-platelet binding, FVIII-VWF binding, VWF multimer analysis, and VWF propeptide antigen. Recent advances have been made regarding some of these assays. Molecular testing in VWD is not found to be useful in "low VWF" or most type 1 VWD cases. However, it may be informative in patients with severe type 1 VWD, type 1C VWD, type 2 VWD, or type 3 VWD for accurate diagnosis, genetic counseling, and appropriate treatment. The diagnostic algorithm for VWD is complex, but advances continue to be made in improving VWF functional assays and diagnostic pathways.

### The von Willebrand disease prophylaxis network (vWD PN): exploring a treatment concept [^117R8xF1]. Thrombosis Research (2006). Low credibility.

The von Willebrand Disease Prophylaxis Network (vWD PN) has been initiated to study the natural history of von Willebrand Disease (vWD) bleeding and to prospectively assess the role of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) concentrate prophylaxis in vWD. Patients with all types of vWD who require treatment with vWF concentrate will be enrolled in the study. Quality of life will be assessed, and safety and efficacy will be monitored at predetermined intervals.

Between February 2005 and July 18, 2005, 62 investigators from Europe and North America participated in the vWD PN, with 61 submitting census data. A total of 5,343 patients have been identified for enrollment; of these, 991 patients were treated with plasma-derived products in the preceding 12 months, and 99 patients received prophylaxis, primarily for joint-related bleeds. The vWD PN aims to further elucidate the role of vWF concentrate prophylaxis in vWD and to identify patients most likely to benefit from prophylaxis.

### How I manage severe von Willebrand disease [^111Pvx1t]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

Although several studies have been performed on postpartum haemorrhage in VWD patients, the quality of those observational studies is low. It is generally accepted that no treatment is necessary if the levels of VWF and FVIII are > 50 iu/dl during the third trimester. Desmopressin can be administered in women with type 1 VWD who are known to have a good desmopressin response. We only administer desmopressin after clamping the umbilical cord in order to prevent severe hypotension in the mother, which can harm the unborn child.

There is still limited evidence for treatment recommendations using FVIII/VWF concentrates in pregnant VWD patients. In an observational study, James et al. (2015) found no incidence of PPH in 17 type 1 VWD patients with VWF and FVIII levels > 50 iu/dl during the third trimester who did not receive prophylactic treatment. In 15 women (7 with type 1 and 8 with type 2) with a mean VWF:RCo of 34 (0–75) iu/dl during the third trimester that were prophylactically treated with factor concentrate during labor, only one patient with type 2B VWD had excessive bleeding.

VWD women who were prophylactically treated with factor concentrates had, despite treatment, more blood loss compared to women without VWD and untreated type 1 VWD women. Stoof et al. (2015) observed PPH in over 50% of type 1 and type 2 VWD patients with VWF levels < 50 iu/dl in the third trimester, despite VWF concentrate treatment aiming for target levels of 100 iu/dl at labor.

### Interaction between oral contraceptive use and coagulation factor levels in deep venous thrombosis [^116Ch45h]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2003). Low credibility.

Deep venous thrombosis is a multicausal disease, which means more than one risk factor typically needs to be present to cause the disease. Oral contraceptive use increases the risk of venous thrombosis. However, since not all women using oral contraceptives develop thrombosis, the presence of additional risk factors is likely in affected individuals. The aim of this study was to assess the joint effect of oral contraceptive use and the levels of procoagulant factors FII, FV, FVII, FVIII, FIX, FX, FXI, FXII, FXIII, and fibrinogen. Data from premenopausal women were re-analyzed as part of the Leiden Thrombophilia Study.

- **Highest relative risks observed**: The combinations of oral contraceptive use and high levels (greater than the 90th percentile) of certain coagulation factors exhibited the highest relative risks. Specifically:
	- FII: Odds Ratio (OR) OC+FII 10.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.5–29.0.
	- FV: OROC+FV 12.6; 95% CI 3.8–41.5.
	- FXI: OROC+FXI 11.9; 95% CI 3.6–39.2.

Additionally, certain combinations correlated with low levels of other factors, such as FXIII.

### Efficacy of the 1-year (13-cycle) segesterone acetate and ethinylestradiol contraceptive vaginal system: Results of two multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase 3 trials [^112zqvhm]. The Lancet Global Health (2019). Low credibility.

Six months after the trial commenced, the DSMB recommended the exclusion of women with a BMI greater than 29.0 kg/m² rather than exclusion based on weight. This decision was due to the well-characterized risk of venous thromboembolism in obese women and the occurrence of non-fatal venous thromboembolisms in two participants with a BMI greater than 29.0 kg/m² reported early in the study.

Participants were recruited to the trial through IRB-approved local advertising.

- **Procedures**: Participants were screened after expressing interest and consenting to trial involvement. Screening involved clinical tests, physical examination, including a gynecological examination, and obtaining a medical history, including a history of pregnancy. After screening, all eligible participants began the study identically, regardless of their previous contraceptive method use. Contraceptive vaginal system use was initiated at the baseline visit, which occurred between menstrual days 2 and 5, and following a negative urine pregnancy test. Urine pregnancy tests were repeated at all subsequent visits (cycles 3, 6, 9, and 13), and at the final study termination visit (1–2 weeks after cycle 13). Women who discontinued the study early had pregnancy tests at their last study visit.

The day of contraceptive vaginal system insertion became day 1 of the first treatment cycle. Site staff counseled participants on the proper use of the contraceptive vaginal system, provided written instructions that outlined the 21-days-in and 7-days-out regimen, and reinforced directions about keeping the contraceptive vaginal system in place continuously.

### Recombinant von Willebrand factor prophylaxis in patients with severe von Willebrand disease: Phase 3 study results [^111DX5hz]. Blood (2022). Low credibility.

This study had several limitations. It was a nonrandomized, noncomparative trial involving a limited number of patients, although a justified and acceptable number by regulatory guidelines for this rare disease. Furthermore, differences between the data collection methods for historical BEs (i.e. retrospective extraction from medical records) and on-study BEs (i.e. prospective monitoring with an electronic patient diary) may have introduced bias and resulted in some data gaps. Historical BEs were included in the primary and secondary efficacy analyses if there was adequate evidence of a BE occurring and being treated with VWF infusions. However, the investigator assessment of hemostatic efficacy was not available for all historical BEs.

In summary, this prospective, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of rVWF prophylaxis in patients with severe VWD. In patients previously treated on-demand with VWF products, rVWF prophylaxis reduced the frequency of spontaneous BEs requiring VWF treatment. Furthermore, patients switching from prophylaxis with pdVWF to rVWF prophylaxis experienced a similar level of hemostatic control over spontaneous BEs, and a high proportion of patients in both groups had no treated spontaneous BEs during rVWF prophylaxis. The safety profile of rVWF observed in this study was consistent with the previously established safety profile, and no new adverse drug reactions were identified.

### Mili [^112DJoyB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Mili (norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP 0.250 mg/0.035 mg) are oral contraceptive pills.

- **Instructions for use**: Take 1 pill every day at the same time, following the order directed on your blister pack. Do not skip your pills, even if you do not have sex often. Missing pills, including starting the pack late, increases the risk of pregnancy. The more pills you miss, the higher the likelihood of becoming pregnant. If you have trouble remembering to take Mili, consult your healthcare provider.

- **Side effects and considerations**: When you first start taking Mili, spotting or light bleeding between periods may occur. If this persists beyond a few months, contact your healthcare provider. Nausea is also common during the first few months. Do not stop taking the pill if you feel sick; this symptom usually resolves itself. Should nausea persist, call your healthcare provider. Missing pills may cause additional spotting or light bleeding, even if you take the missed pills later. On days you take 2 pills to catch up, mild nausea may occur.

- **Period irregularities and other precautions**: Missing a period is not uncommon. However, if you miss a period and have not followed the instructions, or if you miss two periods consecutively, or suspect you may be pregnant, contact your healthcare provider. A positive pregnancy test indicates you should stop taking Mili. If you experience vomiting or diarrhea within 3 to 4 hours of taking your pill, take another pill of the same composition.

### Can von Willebrand disease be investigated on combined hormonal contraceptives [^113KUiZr]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

This study aims to review the medical literature and determine whether testing for von Willebrand disease can be performed in adolescents using combined hormonal contraceptives (CHC).

- **Design**: The study involved a literature review using databases such as Embase and Medline. Searches were conducted with keywords such as "von Willebrand factor", "von Willebrand disease", "contraceptive agents", and "menorrhagia". Articles were selected if they were controlled trials comparing a form of CHC versus a control group, with testing for von Willebrand factor performed and reported.

- **Main outcome measures**: The principal measure was the impact of combined hormonal contraceptives on von Willebrand factor antigen. Secondary outcomes included effects on Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor activity, known as the Ristocetin cofactor.

- **Results**: Seven articles met the inclusion criteria. All seven assessed VWF Ag with CHC use; six of the seven demonstrated no change, while one study, Gevers Leuven, showed a significant decrease after CHC use. Three studies measured Factor VIII and showed no significant change with CHC use. Additionally, a study by Kadir assessed the Ristocetin cofactor and also failed to demonstrate any change with CHC.

- **Conclusion**: The literature suggests that adolescents assessed for menorrhagia and already on combined hormonal contraceptives can be tested for von Willebrand disease if the diagnosis is suspected by the physician. By allowing adolescents to remain on combined hormonal contraceptives during testing, one avoids the risk of severe menorrhagia, which could result in hospital admission and transfusion.

### Von Willebrand's disease diagnosed after menorrhagia worsened from levonorgestrel intrauterine system [^112XGGbj]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Adult females with menorrhagia may have unrecognized mild von Willebrand's disease. Most females with known von Willebrand's disease report menorrhagia.

- **Case**: A 38-year-old healthy female desired contraception. She described heavy menses lasting 8 days since menarche. Her history included uncomplicated vaginal deliveries, and her physical examination was normal. After the levonorgestrel intrauterine system was placed, her menorrhagia worsened to 14 successive days each month. Evaluation revealed mild von Willebrand's disease. At 19 months of follow-up, she retained her levonorgestrel intrauterine system and avoided pregnancy. Her menses slowly improved to spotting for 8 days each month.

- **Conclusion**: Von Willebrand's disease is a likely cause of menorrhagia that goes unrecognized, as well as a potential cause for "failed" conservative treatment for menorrhagia. Understanding the cause of menorrhagia is an important aspect of evaluating this common symptom.

### Topics of interest in women with myeloproliferative neoplasms [^112U5mC5]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Issues in adolescent women with menstrual disorders and contraception**: Heavy menstrual bleeding may be the presenting sign of MPN, particularly ET, especially when accompanied by acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS). While it is recommended to obtain a formal assessment by a gynecologist, from a hematological standpoint, the management approach may include reducing the aspirin dose, administering low doses of clot-stabilizing drugs (e.g. tranexamic acid), or using a hormone-coated intrauterine device (IUD) such as Mirena. Consultations with female MPN patients of childbearing age should integrate discussions regarding forms of contraception and preconception planning.

	- Of paramount and recurring concern is the potential thrombotic risk associated with contraceptive use. There is currently insufficient evidence to support a clear association between estrogen-based contraception and thrombosis in MPN, with a retrospective review disclosing that estrogen-based therapy appeared safe in ET outside the setting of the combined OC pill — the latter's use may be associated with an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis. It may therefore be reasonable to recommend avoidance of estrogen-based contraception in favor of alternatives — progesterone-only pill, implant, depot, IUD (e.g. Mirena), or barrier methods. Moreover, it is vital to discuss the potential teratogenic effect of cytoreductive therapy as well as requisite contraceptive measures as needed.

### Gynecologic and obstetric management of women with von Willebrand disease: Summary of 3 systematic reviews of the literature [^111yYYHe]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

These systematic reviews have several strengths. First, we conducted them according to rigorous methodological standards. Second, we used broad eligibility criteria to include any type of evidence that could be informative. For example, we included evidence from women with bleeding disorders other than von Willebrand Disease (VWD), as well as study designs that are not considered optimal for making inferences about treatment effects, such as case series, when these were the only evidence available. Third, we conducted an explicit and transparent assessment of the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach and used this assessment to draw conclusions that considered not only the effect estimates but also the certainty of the evidence.

Our systematic reviews have limitations common to all systematic reviews. Finding the relevant studies depends on the quality of the indexing process of the searched databases. Some of the studies included in the systematic reviews were not indexed under the terms describing women with bleeding disorders used in our initial search strategy. Similarly, including studies depends on clear reporting in titles and abstracts, which was not the case for many of these studies. We overcame these limitations by maintaining close collaboration with the guideline panel members who were familiar with the literature and could point out studies that may be relevant but had not been originally found due to the limitations described herein. This way, we were certain to include all relevant evidence.

### Selection of contraceptive therapy for patients with thrombophilia: A review of the evidence [^116UCo8n]. Journal of Women's Health (2014). Low credibility.

Awareness of the contributions of thrombophilia to thrombosis-related morbidity and mortality has been growing in the last few decades. Thrombophilia is especially concerning in females seeking contraception because some types of hormonal contraception have been associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE). Clinicians face a growing need for awareness of evidence-based contraception selection for this population.

- **Methods**: PubMed literature searches were conducted to provide a review of the literature describing contraceptive use in patients with thrombophilia. This review also describes contraceptive selection and counseling for this population.

- **Results**: Studies of combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) use demonstrate a 2- to 50-fold increase in VTE in individuals with thrombophilia, depending on the type of thrombophilia and the reference group identified. Two small studies describing VTE incidence in progesterone-only contraceptive (POC) users with thrombophilia were identified, but they did not provide conclusive information regarding VTE risk in this population.

- **Conclusions**: POC may be recommended for contraception in patients with most thrombophilias, but studies should be undertaken to further define the safety of POC use in this population.

### Prophylaxis escalation in severe von Willebrand disease: a prospective study from the von Willebrand disease prophylaxis network [^116pLYCT]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). High credibility.

The treatment of mucosal bleeding (epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and menorrhagia) and joint bleeding remains problematic in clinically severe von Willebrand disease (VWD). Patients are often unresponsive to treatment, such as desmopressin or antifibrinolytic therapy, and may require von Willebrand factor (VWF) replacement therapy. There are limited data on the use of prophylaxis in VWD, and none have been applied in a prospective, treatment escalation design.

- **Objective**: Evaluate the effect of escalating dose prophylaxis in severe VWD.

- **Methods**: Patients eligible for enrollment in this prospective study included those with type 1 VWD with VWF activity-ristocetin cofactor ratio ≤ 20% and unresponsive to desmopressin, patients with type 2 VWD not responsive to desmopressin, and all subjects with type 2B and type 3 VWD. Entry criteria were strictly defined, as were therapy escalation parameters and clinical data collection.

- **Results**: Eleven subjects completed the study. Six had type 2A, and five had type 3 VWD. Six patients presented with epistaxis, three with gastrointestinal bleeding, and two with joint bleeding. Seven had dose escalation above the first level. Among the 10 subjects with evaluable bleeding log data, the use of prophylaxis decreased the median annualized bleeding rate from 25 to 6.1 (95% confidence interval of the rate difference: -51.6 to -1.7). The median annualized bleeding rate was even lower (4.0; 95% confidence interval: -57.5 to -5.3) when the subjects reached their final dosing level.

### Efficacy of the 1-year (13-cycle) segesterone acetate and ethinylestradiol contraceptive vaginal system: results of two multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase 3 trials [^115hfzHb]. The Lancet Global Health (2019). Low credibility.

An open-label, pharmacokinetic study of the segesterone acetate and ethinylestradiol contraceptive vaginal system in 39 women verified rapid absorption of both steroids through the vaginal mucosa after insertion, with steady-state systemic levels of segesterone acetate and ethinylestradiol achieved by day 4 of use. Mean serum segesterone acetate and ethinylestradiol concentrations peak immediately after the first contraceptive vaginal system insertion in cycle 1 and decline rapidly to a steady state by 96 hours. Peak and steady-state levels fall modestly in subsequent cycles.

The segesterone acetate and ethinylestradiol contraceptive vaginal system has several potential advantages for women across diverse settings. The cyclic regimen of 21 days in and 7 days out provides regular withdrawal bleeds, a pattern familiar to and desirable for many women. Using the same contraceptive vaginal system for thirteen 28-day cycles (1 year) enhances convenience and addresses a common access issue that can be a factor in unintended pregnancies (difficulties returning to healthcare facilities or pharmacies for refills or new prescriptions for hormonal contraceptives requiring timely use). Additionally, the segesterone acetate and ethinylestradiol contraceptive vaginal system does not require refrigeration before dispensing or during non-use, facilitating storage and distribution, an access element affecting providers and women across many regions.

Here, we present data from two 13-cycle, open-label trials designed to assess the contraceptive efficacy of the segesterone acetate and ethinylest.

Regarding specific circumstances for von Willebrand disease, particularly in patients with heavy menstrual bleeding, the ASH/ISTH/NHF/WFH 2021 guidelines recommend regular assessment of these patients. It is advised to treat iron deficiency and/or anemia, as both conditions, resulting from iron deficiency, are associated with adverse outcomes, including diminished health-related quality of life (QoL).

### Gynecologic and obstetric management of women with von Willebrand disease: Summary of 3 systematic reviews of the literature [^117J6hvW]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

We assessed the quality of the evidence for each of the outcomes using the Grading of Recommendations Assessments, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The quality assessment considered study design, risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias, presence of large effects, dose-response gradient, and residual confounding.

- **Risk of bias**: We assessed this using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized clinical trials and the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool for comparative observational studies. Because of the lack of a comparison group in the single-arm studies that we used to make inferences about how treatments compare, their risk of bias was judged as high by default.

- **Inconsistency**: We assessed this by comparing the point estimates and CIs across studies, as well as by using statistical measures (χ² and I²).

- **Indirectness**: We focused on characteristics of the population, particularly the proportion of participants who had VWD instead of other bleeding disorders.

- **Imprecision**: This was assessed using a noncontextualized approach and the null effect as the threshold of interest, as well as the optimal information size.

- **Publication bias**: We planned to assess this by using funnel plots if a meta-analysis included 10 studies or more.

We constructed summary-of-findings tables using GRADEpro. Whenever possible, we present absolute and relative estimates of effects. We calculated absolute estimates using the results from the included studies to obtain a baseline risk.

### The impact of a male or female thrombotic family history on contraceptive counseling: A cohort study [^114G8qnW]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Essentials: It is unknown if a male or female thrombotic family history influences risk in female relatives. We assessed thrombotic risk in female relatives of male and female patients with thrombosis. A hormonally related female thrombotic family history further increases risk in female relatives. This information could be important in counseling women on contraceptive options.

- **Background**: Women from thrombophilic families have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which increases further during oral contraceptive (COC) use and during pregnancy-postpartum. Whether this additional risk differs between relatives of male and female patients or is different when the female patient had a hormonally related VTE (during COC use/pregnancy) is unknown.

- **Methods**: One thousand five female relatives of consecutive patients with VTE from a family-based cohort were retrospectively followed for incident VTE from ages 15 to 50, first VTE, or study inclusion. Absolute and relative VTE risks adjusted for factors of patients (sex, age) and relatives (thrombophilia, COC use, pregnancy) were estimated in relatives of female and male patients and in relatives of female patients with and without hormonally related VTE.

- **Results**: Absolute risk in relatives of female (0.32 [95% confidence interval 0.23–0.43]) vs. male patients (0.39 [95% CI 0.28–0.53]) was comparable. However, the heterogeneity analysis of risk estimates suggested that in relatives of female vs. male patients, a hormonally related thrombotic family history might influence risk differently.

### How I manage severe von Willebrand disease [^116LJHnq]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. The estimated prevalence of VWD patients with clinically relevant bleeding is 1:10,000. VWD is characterized by mucocutaneous bleeding, such as menorrhagia, epistaxis, and gum bleeds. However, other bleeds, such as joint bleeds and gastrointestinal bleeds, also occur, especially in more severely affected patients. VWD diagnosis is based on personal bleeding history, family history of VWD, and a detailed laboratory evaluation.

- **Classification of VWD**: Von Willebrand disease is classified into three subtypes based on a quantitative reduction or a qualitative defect of von Willebrand factor (VWF).
	- *Type 1 VWD* is characterized by a quantitative reduction of VWF and is the most common (70–80%) form of VWD. The bleeding phenotype of type 1 VWD patients is generally milder than in type 2 and type 3 VWD.
	- *Type 2 VWD* is diagnosed in 20% of VWD patients and is characterized by a qualitative defect of VWF. The bleeding phenotype is generally more severe than in type 1 VWD patients.
	- *Type 3 VWD* is the rarest (prevalence < 5%) and most severe form of VWD; it is characterized by a complete absence of VWF.

### Management of von Willebrand disease with a factor VIII-poor von Willebrand factor concentrate: Results from a prospective observational post-marketing study [^111AmuuT]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

Seventy patients were treated for 676 minor bleeding episodes, of which 138 occurred in 17 children under 12 years. Most of these bleeding episodes were treated on an ambulatory basis. The median number of EDs by episode for a given patient was 2.0, ranging from 1.0 to 12.4 in a patient with severe type 1 repeatedly treated for re-hemarthrosis. The median daily dose administered was 49.8 VWF:RCo IU/kg (range 24‐177 IU/kg). Factor VIII was co-administered at the first VWF injection in 55.9% of events and 56.9% of those occurring in patients with basal FVIII:C under 20 IU/dL.

- **Long-term prophylaxis**: Long-term prophylaxis was initiated to prevent re-bleeding episodes in 32 VWD patients, including five patients below 12 years of age. The most frequent reasons for LTP were the prevention of joint bleeding (43.8%) and GI bleeding (40.6%) and mainly concerned type 3 and type 2 VWD patients, respectively. Patients under LTP received 43.5 VWF:RCo IU/kg (median) per infusion administered approximately twice a week. This was more frequent in patients with a history of GI bleeding compared with those with a history of joint bleeds (median 2.5 versus 1.9 infusions per week). Breakthrough bleeding occurred following 1.5% of prophylactic infusions and required additional treatment with Wilfactin. In the subgroup of patients with available data and treated for at least 12 months (n = 20), the median annualized bleeding rate (ABR) was 1.0 (range 0.0 to 11.0). The highest ABR was due to the recurrence of GI bleeding in one patient with type 2A.

### Efficacy of the 1-year (13-cycle) segesterone acetate and ethinylestradiol contraceptive vaginal system: Results of two multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase 3 trials [^1137ahnY]. The Lancet Global Health (2019). Low credibility.

Our results also raise the methodological issue of obtaining accurate reports about contraceptive use during clinical trials and in real-life settings. Women in these trials used paper diaries to record the information required for calculating pregnancy rates, which did not reveal between-group differences in adherence and highlight the challenges that investigators must confront when trying to show product efficacy in clinical trials. Investigators need more innovative technologies and strategies for obtaining accurate information about participant motivation and behaviors in contraceptive trials, especially for user-controlled methods.

The strengths of this efficacy analysis are its large sample size, the two-study, multicentre, multicountry participant population, the frequency of pregnancy testing, and the ongoing follow-up and surveillance. Although 962 (42%) patients discontinued the study, this was expected, was taken into account when determining the sample size, and was similar to reports from other contraceptive clinical trials and real-world settings. A limitation of the study is possible under-reporting or inaccuracies in the participant-completed paper diaries for the use of the contraceptive vaginal system and back-up contraception. Another important limitation relates to the DSMB decision to limit enrolment of and discontinue from the study women with a BMI greater than 29.0 kg/m², which might influence the generalisability of the data such that additional research is warranted. Similarly, studies with women from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia might be warranted.

### A 12-month clinical investigation with a 24-day regimen containing 15 microg ethinylestradiol plus 60 microg gestodene with respect to hemostasis and cycle control [^115KzFLW]. Contraception (2001). Low credibility.

The effects of a 24-day regimen containing 15 microg ethinyl estradiol (EE) plus 60 microg gestodene on cycle control and hemostasis were evaluated in 58 healthy women (ages 19–47 years). All the women received the pill for 12 months. Withdrawal bleeding during every cycle in the tablet-free interval was experienced by 84.5% of the women. The overall incidence of irregular bleeding was 19.3%.

Hemostasis was evaluated in 20 women. No changes were observed in plasma fibrinogen concentrations, nor in prothrombin fragment F1+2. There was a slight increase in thrombin-antithrombin III complexes after 6 and 12 months of oral contraceptive use. Antithrombin III activity significantly increased after one year of pill intake. The concentrations of tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor, both antigen and activity, did not change.

These results show that very low doses of EE, such as 15 microg, do not impair hemostasis in healthy females. However, the reduction in the EE dose is responsible for some of the effects on cycle control.

### How I manage severe von Willebrand disease [^111haTLj]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

The most used treatment option to increase von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor VIII (FVIII) levels in patients with mild or moderate von Willebrand disease (VWD) is to administer desmopressin (1-deamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin, DDAVP). Desmopressin stimulates the endogenous VWF release from the endothelium into the circulation. Unfortunately, type 3 patients are unresponsive due to the lack of endogenous VWF, and only a limited number of severe type 1 and type 2 VWD patients can be treated with desmopressin.

In a large study on severe VWD patients with VWF levels below 10 IU/dl at the time of desmopressin administration — where the response was defined as an increase of plasma FVIII:C and VWF:RCo of at least 3-fold over baseline, levels of at least 30 IU/dl, and a bleeding time of 12 minutes or less 2 hours after the end of desmopressin infusion — most type 1 patients did not respond. Moreover, other factors, such as the type, pathophysiology, and genotype of VWD, determine the response to desmopressin.

Therefore, severe VWD type 1 and 2 patients without contraindications for desmopressin should receive a test dose of desmopressin (0.3 μg/kg intravenously) to evaluate whether they respond sufficiently. In severe VWD patients who respond well, treatment with desmopressin is often sufficient to treat minor bleeding and to prevent bleeding during minor surgery or interventions. In the case of life-threatening bleeding or major surgery, VWF/FVIII concentrates are needed.

### Use of contraceptive methods by women with current venous thrombosis on anticoagulant therapy: A systematic review [^114w8Er3]. Contraception (2009). Low credibility.

As nearly all women with venous thromboembolism (VTE) will be treated with anticoagulant therapy, it is important to consider how anticoagulation affects the safety of contraceptive use.

- **Study design**: We conducted a systematic review of the literature regarding the use of contraceptive methods in women with VTE on anticoagulant therapy. Due to the limited direct evidence identified, we expanded our search to include women on anticoagulant therapy for indications other than VTE and women with bleeding disorders.

- **Results**: Six articles met our inclusion criteria. Three observational studies found the levonorgestrel-releasing IUD (LNG-IUD) was an effective treatment for menorrhagia in women on anticoagulation therapy or with bleeding disorders. Prevention of hemorrhagic ovarian cysts was observed in women on chronic anticoagulation treated with depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) in one small observational study. Among women with bleeding disorders, no complications were reported in 16 women with placement of the LNG-IUD. One pharmacokinetic study found no statistically significant interaction between combined oral contraceptives and warfarin. Other than one case report, no evidence was found regarding the risk of re-thrombosis in women on anticoagulation therapy using a contraceptive method.

- **Conclusion**: The majority of studies in this review examined the treatment effects of the LNG-IUD or DMPA on complications of anticoagulation and found overall beneficial effects of their use in these circumstances. Minimal evidence in women with inher…

### Global estimation of the bleeding episodes treatable with desmopressin in von Willebrand disease and hemophilia A [^111BWkhm]. Haematologica (2025). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) and hemophilia A (Hem A) are the most common inherited bleeding disorders. Non-severe phenotypes (type 1) account for 70–80% of all VWD cases, while non-severe Hem A accounts for 40–50% of all Hem A cases. The administration of 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin, also known as desmopressin or DDAVP, increases plasma factor VIII in most patients with mild and in some with moderate Hem A, and also corrects von Willebrand factor (VWF) deficiency in patients with type 1 VWD. Therefore, bleeding can be treated successfully, safely, and inexpensively in a large proportion of these patients.

While desmopressin is administered intravenously, it can also be administered subcutaneously or intranasally. The latter formulations are particularly convenient for home treatment, and thus reduce in-hospital admissions and the inherent costs, and promote patient adherence and the prompt control of bleeding. Nevertheless, this medication, with almost 50 years of clinical experience and proven safety and efficacy, is often neglected, underused or unavailable. With this background, there is a need to estimate how many patients could globally benefit from this treatment and how many bleeding events could be treated. Therefore, we carried out the present narrative review with the aim of filling these knowledge gaps.

### Desmopressin acetate [^113xTLwi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Increased risk of thrombosis in patients with von Willebrand's disease Type IIB**:
	- The use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand's disease may result in platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia, and possibly thrombosis.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**:
	- Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with intravenous and intranasal desmopressin acetate, including cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of desmopressin acetate injection [see Contraindications (4)]. It is not known whether antibodies to desmopressin acetate injection are produced after repeated injections. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during administration, interrupt treatment should a reaction occur, and manage medically. Permanently discontinue for serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

- **Fluid retention**:
	- Desmopressin acetate injection can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Patients with heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk. Desmopressin acetate injection is not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or those with a history of urinary retention. Advise patients to limit fluid intake [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### Hormonal contraception and thrombotic risk: A multidisciplinary approach [^116CHH2S]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Heightened publicity about hormonal contraception and thrombosis risk, alongside the publication of new guidelines by the World Health Organization in 2009 and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2010 addressing this complex issue, have led to multidisciplinary discussions on the special issues of adolescents cared for at our pediatric hospital. In this review of the literature and new guidelines, we have outlined our approach to the complex patients referred to our center. The relative risk of thrombosis on combined oral contraception is three- to fivefold, whereas the absolute risk for a healthy adolescent on this therapy is only 0.05% per year. This thrombotic risk is affected by estrogen dose, type of progestin, mechanism of delivery, and length of therapy. Oral progestin-only contraceptives and transdermal estradiol used for hormone replacement carry minimal or no thrombotic risk. Transdermal, vaginal, or intrauterine contraceptives and injectable progestins need further study. A personal history of thrombosis, persistent or inherited thrombophilia, and numerous lifestyle choices also influence thrombotic risk.

In this summary of one hospital's approach to hormone therapies and thrombosis risk, we review relative-risk data and discuss the application of absolute risk to individual patient counseling. We outline our approach to challenging patients with a history of thrombosis, known thrombophilia, anticoagulation, or family history of thrombosis or thrombophilia. Our multidisciplinary group has found that knowledge of the guidelines and individualized management…

### Case-based discussion on the implications of exogenous estrogens in hemostasis and thrombosis: The hematologist's view [^112jCrDD]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

In the childbearing years, hormonal therapy or hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle or the puerperium may be complicated by bleeding or thrombosis. However, among women with congenital disorders of hemostasis and thrombosis, the risk of bleeding or thrombosis may be further increased. In women with congenital bleeding disorders, heavy menstrual bleeding is the most common bleeding symptom, and postpartum hemorrhage can occur despite treatment. Given the limitations of therapy and the associated medical and psychological burden in women with bleeding disorders, better treatment approaches are needed to improve health outcomes and quality of life.

For women with congenital thrombotic disorders, thromboembolism may complicate exogenous hormonal therapy and endogenous hormonal changes during pregnancy and procedures, though the risk differs by type of thrombophilia, procedure, time at risk, and thrombosis risk factors, all of which affect management. This article explores a case-based discussion of issues in women with congenital bleeding and clotting disorders. It includes heavy menstrual bleeding in a woman with VWD, postpartum hemorrhage risk in VWD, and thrombosis risk with oocyte retrieval in a woman with factor V Leiden and past thromboembolism. The goals are to review bleeding or thrombosis risk in these cases, examine data, consider limitations of treatment guidelines, and identify areas for future study.
