## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the ankle-brachial index (ABI) range, including how to interpret normal, borderline, abnormal, and noncompressible values, and what to do when results are discordant or in special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative, current guideline sources. Then, I should verify the diagnostic thresholds and how they differ from older or lower-credibility sources. Next, I will consider special situations like diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and suspected critical limb-threatening ischemia where ABI can be misleading. After that, I should review prognostic implications of borderline and low-normal ABI. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach to measurement, interpretation, and follow-up testing, making sure I reconcile any conflicting statements from the literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the highest-credibility sources so I don't anchor on outdated or inconsistent ranges. The 2024 ACC/AHA/AACVPR guideline and the 2024 ESC guideline both provide standardized ABI categories and are the most current, while the 2019 Global Vascular Guidelines inform management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia and noncompressible arteries; I should also keep in mind the 2018 USPSTF evidence review for screening context, even though it does not make a screening recommendation in asymptomatic adults [^1e9755ca] [^fea07846] [^7392a822] [^0930720a].

> Now, I should verify the diagnostic thresholds. The 2024 ACC/AHA/AACVPR guideline defines normal ABI as 1.00–1.40, borderline as 0.91–0.99, abnormal as ≤ 0.90, and noncompressible as > 1.40; the 2024 ESC guideline aligns with ≤ 0.90 for PAD diagnosis and treats ≥ 1.40 as inconclusive due to noncompressibility, which matches the ACC/AHA framing; wait, let me double-check that I'm not mixing up the borderline band — yes, both contemporary guidelines converge on 0.91–0.99 as borderline and ≤ 0.90 as abnormal, replacing older ranges that sometimes used 0.90–1.29 as "normal" and 1.3–1.4 as "borderline high", which I should explicitly correct here [^1e9755ca] [^fea07846] [^d9e0468a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about what a "normal" ABI truly means. I initially thought 1.00–1.40 implies no PAD, but I need to ensure I qualify that: values above 1.40 suggest noncompressible arteries and can mask disease, whereas values in the 1.00–1.40 range are generally considered normal for diagnostic purposes, yet even borderline and low-normal ABI carry elevated cardiovascular and limb risk, so "normal" does not equal "risk-free" in prognostic terms [^1e9755ca] [^d8a66bd7] [^a41cd1b6].

> Next, I should review special populations where ABI can be misleading. In diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and older adults with medial arterial calcification, ABI may be falsely elevated or noncompressible, so a normal or high ABI does not exclude PAD; in these cases, I need to check the toe-brachial index (TBI), where ≤ 0.70 is abnormal and less affected by calcification, and consider absolute toe pressure or other hemodynamic tests if tissue loss is present; let me verify that both the Global Vascular Guidelines and contemporary reviews support TBI as the alternative first-line test in suspected CLTI or when ABI is > 1.40 or discordant — yes, they do [^7392a822] [^e4d0137f] [^b501fe7f].

> I will now examine the prognostic meaning of borderline and low-normal ABI, because this often changes management even when symptoms are absent. Multiple cohorts show that ABI 0.91–0.99 and even 1.00–1.09 associate with higher risks of mobility loss, functional decline, and severe leg outcomes including CLI and amputation, independent of traditional risk factors; wait, I should confirm that these associations persist after adjustment — yes, the WALCS and ARIC analyses demonstrate graded risk across the ABI spectrum, including below 1.10, reinforcing that borderline and low-normal values are not benign [^a41cd1b6] [^d8a66bd7] [^cfb37c95].

> Let me consider what to do when ABI is borderline or normal but suspicion remains high. Exercise ABI increases diagnostic yield: a drop to ≤ 0.90 after exercise, a ≥ 20% fall from baseline, or a delayed recovery (> 3 minutes) supports hemodynamically significant PAD; I should confirm that guidelines endorse exercise ABI when resting ABI is 0.91–0.99 and symptoms are suggestive — yes, ACC/AHA and SVS recommend exercise ABI in that scenario, and some data suggest exercise ABI adds prognostic information even when resting ABI is normal, though I need to be cautious not to overgeneralize beyond symptomatic populations [^7d1177fa] [^ca8b9bb4] [^990fa508].

> But wait, what if the ABI is > 1.40 and I suspect disease anyway? I should double-check the next step. Noncompressible arteries invalidate standard ABI interpretation; in this case, I should obtain TBI and, if needed, segmental pressures, pulse volume recordings, or anatomic imaging to localize disease and guide therapy; the Global Vascular Guidelines and contemporary reviews emphasize TBI and alternative hemodynamics in this setting, and I should not falsely reassure based on a high ABI alone [^7392a822] [^e4d0137f] [^b501fe7f].

> I need to ensure the measurement technique is correct because interpretation hinges on it. ABI should be calculated using the higher of the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial systolic pressures at the ankle divided by the higher of the two brachial systolic pressures, with the patient supine after a short rest; cuffs should be appropriately sized, and if there is a > 15–20 mm Hg inter-arm difference, I should use the higher arm pressure; hold on, I should verify whether some guidelines prefer the lowest ankle pressure for risk stratification — yes, when ABI is used as a cardiovascular risk marker, some recommend using the lower ankle pressure divided by the higher arm pressure, so I should document both conventions and state the purpose of the ABI measurement clearly [^7d415829] [^9d347f15] [^31aa3d1e].

> Let me reconsider the screening question, since clinicians often ask whether to screen asymptomatic patients. The USPSTF concludes evidence is insufficient for routine ABI screening in asymptomatic adults without known CVD or severe CKD, so screening is not recommended broadly; however, targeted screening is reasonable in higher-risk groups such as adults ≥ 65, or ≥ 50 with diabetes or smoking, and many vascular societies support selective screening to improve risk stratification and medical management; I should confirm that ACC/AHA 2024 supports screening in increased-risk patients — yes, it does [^0930720a] [^e8858ecf] [^27e974ad].

> Next, I should review how to integrate ABI into overall care. An abnormal ABI (≤ 0.90) confirms PAD and should trigger guideline-directed medical therapy for atherosclerotic risk reduction, including high-intensity statin, antiplatelet therapy unless contraindicated, blood pressure control, diabetes optimization, smoking cessation, and structured exercise; borderline and low-normal ABI should prompt aggressive risk factor modification even if symptoms are absent, given the elevated cardiovascular and limb risks demonstrated in observational cohorts; I should double-check that this aligns with ACC/AHA guidance — it does [^1e9755ca] [^d8a66bd7] [^a41cd1b6].

> In summary, I should confirm the final ranges and actions clearly. Normal ABI is 1.00–1.40, borderline is 0.91–0.99, abnormal is ≤ 0.90, and noncompressible is > 1.40; when ABI is > 1.40 or discordant with clinical suspicion, use TBI and alternative hemodynamics; when ABI is 0.91–0.99 with suggestive symptoms, obtain exercise ABI; and remember that even values of 1.00–1.09 carry increased risk and warrant vigilant risk factor management, especially in older adults or those with diabetes or CKD [^1e9755ca] [^fea07846] [^7392a822] [^d8a66bd7].

---

The ABI range is **0.90–1.40**, with **≤ 0.90 indicating PAD** [^1e9755ca] and **> 1.40 suggesting noncompressible arteries** [^7392a822]. Values of 0.91–0.99 are borderline and warrant further evaluation, especially if symptoms are present [^7d415829]. ABI is a simple, noninvasive test that helps diagnose PAD, assess cardiovascular risk [^ab27acf1], and guide management; however, results must be interpreted in clinical context, and alternative tests (e.g. toe-brachial index) are needed when arteries are noncompressible [^7392a822].

---

## Normal ABI range

- **Normal ABI**: 1.00–1.40 [^1e9755ca] [^fea07846].
- **Physiological basis**: Higher ankle pressures reflect wave reflection and impedance changes with distance from the heart [^1211f9df].
- **Clinical implication**: Values in this range generally exclude significant PAD, though very high values (> 1.40) may indicate noncompressible arteries [^7392a822].

---

## Abnormal ABI values

### ABI ≤ 0.90

- **Definition**: Abnormal; diagnostic of PAD [^1e9755ca] [^fea07846].
- **Severity correlation**: Lower ABI reflects more severe ischemia and higher cardiovascular risk [^fe2055e7] [^ab27acf1].
- **Clinical implications**: Increased risk of claudication, functional decline, and adverse cardiovascular events [^a41cd1b6] [^d8a66bd7].

---

### ABI 0.91–0.99

- **Definition**: Borderline; possible early PAD [^7d415829].
- **Clinical implications**: Associated with increased cardiovascular risk and functional decline; consider exercise ABI or further testing if symptomatic [^a41cd1b6] [^ca8b9bb4].

---

### ABI > 1.40

- **Definition**: Noncompressible arteries; falsely elevated [^7392a822].
- **Clinical implications**: Common in diabetes, CKD, or elderly; use toe-brachial index or other tests to assess perfusion [^7392a822] [^b501fe7f].

---

## Clinical significance of ABI ranges

| **ABI range** | **Clinical interpretation** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|-|
| ≤ 0.90 | Abnormal (PAD) | - Increased cardiovascular risk <br/> - Claudication <br/> - Functional impairment [^ab27acf1] [^a41cd1b6] |
| 0.91–0.99 | Borderline | - Possible early PAD <br/> - Increased cardiovascular risk [^7d415829] [^73d48e40] |
| 1.00–1.40 | Normal | - No significant PAD <br/> - Lower cardiovascular risk [^1e9755ca] [^fea07846] |
| > 1.40 | Noncompressible | - Falsely elevated <br/> - Use alternative tests [^7392a822] [^b501fe7f] |

---

## Factors influencing ABI accuracy

- **Arterial calcification**: Elevates ABI, causing false negatives [^7392a822].
- **Obesity**: May impair cuff placement and accuracy [^notfound].
- **Operator technique**: Doppler use and cuff selection affect reliability [^1211f9df].

---

## Clinical applications of ABI

- **Diagnosis**: First-line test for suspected PAD [^1e9755ca] [^fea07846].
- **Risk stratification**: Predicts cardiovascular events and mortality [^ab27acf1] [^75d021f2].
- **Follow-up**: Monitors disease progression or response to therapy [^3d970362].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Noncompressible arteries**: ABI > 1.40 is unreliable; use TBI or other tests [^7392a822] [^b501fe7f].
- **Borderline values**: May require exercise ABI or repeat testing [^7d415829] [^ca8b9bb4].
- **Clinical context**: Always interpret results with symptoms and risk factors [^27e974ad].

---

The ABI range is **0.90–1.40**, with ≤ 0.90 indicating PAD and > 1.40 suggesting noncompressible arteries. Borderline values (0.91–0.99) carry increased risk and may need further evaluation. ABI is a useful, noninvasive tool for PAD diagnosis and risk assessment, but results must be interpreted in clinical context, with alternative tests when arteries are noncompressible [^1e9755ca] [^7392a822].

### Interpretation and significance of ankle-brachial systolic pressure index [^fe2055e7]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The ankle-brachial systolic pressure index (ABI) is an underutilized, easy-to-perform, physiologic test to diagnosis atherosclerotic lower-limb arterial occlusive disease. Testing requires a sphygmomanometer and continuous-wave Doppler probe to measure the ratio of ankle and brachial systolic blood pressures. The ABI measurement has been standardized by use of the highest ankle and brachial systolic pressure for the calculation; abnormal threshold value is ≤ 0.9. The ABI is used to diagnosis and screen for peripheral arterial disease, which is a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis and a predictor of cardiovascular events. A lower ABI value correlates with severity of limb ischemia and decreased survival. Measurement of ABI is recommended as the initial diagnostic test for patients with exertional leg pain (claudication), to assess the healing potential of foot lesions, after blunt extremity trauma to detect occult arterial injury, and as part of the routine health assessment of patients with diabetes and peripheral arterial disease.

### Screening for peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular disease risk assessment with the ankle-brachial index in adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^e5874741]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2005 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for peripheral artery disease (PAD).

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the use of resting ankle-brachial index (ABI) as a screening test for PAD or as a risk predictor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The review focused on resting ABI as the sole screening method; the diagnostic performance of ABI testing in primary care populations, unselected populations, and asymptomatic populations; the predictive value of ABI testing for major CVD outcomes in primary care or unselected populations; and the effect of treatment on general CVD and PAD-specific morbidity in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic PAD.

Population

This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults who do not have a known diagnosis of PAD, CVD, severe chronic kidney disease, or diabetes.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for PAD and CVD risk assessment with the ABI in adults. (I statement).

### Screening for peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular disease risk assessment with the ankle-brachial index: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^fbddd741]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) risk assessment and ABI test details — adults: Major risk factors for PAD include older age, diabetes, current smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol level, obesity, and physical inactivity. Resting ABI is most commonly used to detect PAD in clinical settings, and ABI is calculated as the systolic blood pressure obtained at the ankle divided by the systolic blood pressure obtained at the brachial artery while the patient is lying down. A ratio of less than 1 (typically defined as < 0.9) is considered abnormal and is commonly used to define PAD. PAD treatment focuses on improving outcomes in symptomatic patients; interventions to prevent CVD events include smoking cessation, lowering cholesterol levels, managing high blood pressure, and antiplatelet therapy.

Burden of disease — prevalence of low ABI and PAD in the United States is summarized as follows: 5.9% of US adults 40 years or older have a low ABI, and when persons with known coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease are excluded, the reported prevalence of PAD in studies is 4.7%. In the United States, a low ABI (typically < 0.9) is considered diagnostic for PAD in clinical practice. Age-stratified low ABI prevalence is 1.9% in adults aged 40 to 59 years, 8.1% in those aged 60 to 74 years, and 17.5% in those 75 years or older.

### Screening for peripheral artery disease using the ankle-brachial index: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^16790af3]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with a high risk for cardiovascular events and poor ambulatory function, even in the absence of symptoms. Screening for PAD with the ankle-brachial index (ABI) may identify patients in need of treatment to improve health outcomes.

Objective

To systematically review evidence for the US Preventive Services Task Force on PAD screening with the ABI, the diagnostic accuracy of the test, and the benefits and harms of treatment of screen-detected PAD.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant English-language studies published between January 2012 and May 2, 2017. Surveillance continued through February 7, 2018.

Study Selection

Studies of unselected or generally asymptomatic adults with no known cardiovascular disease.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Independent critical appraisal and data abstraction by 2 reviewers.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Cardiovascular morbidity; PAD morbidity; mortality; health-related quality of life; diagnostic accuracy; and serious adverse events.

Results

Five studies (N = 5864 participants) were included that examined the indirect evidence for the benefits and harms of screening and treatment of screen-detected PAD. No population-based screening trials evaluated the direct benefits or harms of PAD screening with the ABI alone. A single diagnostic accuracy study of the ABI compared with magnetic resonance angiography gold-standard imaging (n = 306) found low sensitivity (7%-34%) and high specificity (96%-100%) in a screening population. Two adequately powered trials (n = 4626) in asymptomatic populations with and without diabetes with a variably defined low ABI (≤ 0.95 or ≤ 0.99) showed no statistically significant effect of aspirin (100 mg daily) for composite CVD outcomes (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.00 [95% CI, 0.81–1.23] and HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.76–1.26]). One trial (n = 3350) demonstrated no statistically significant increase in major bleeding events with the use of aspirin (adjusted HR, 1.71 [95% CI, 0.99–2.97]) and no statistically significant increase in major gastrointestinal bleeding (relative risk, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.44–2.91]). Two exercise trials (n = 932) in screen-relevant populations reported no differences in quality of life, Walking Impairment Questionnaire walking distance, or symptoms at 12 and 52 weeks; no harms were reported.

Conclusions and Relevance

There was no direct evidence and limited indirect evidence on the benefits of PAD screening with the ABI in unselected or asymptomatic populations. Available studies suggest low sensitivity and lack of beneficial effect on health outcomes, but these studies have important limitations.

### Screening for peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular disease risk assessment with the ankle-brachial index: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^d415e712]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Assessment of risk for peripheral artery disease (PAD) — major risk factors include diabetes, current smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, obesity, and physical inactivity, with current smoking and diabetes showing the strongest association. Among healthy US men aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD, the 25-year risk for PAD in the absence of 4 conventional risk factors is rare at 9 cases per 100 000 men per year; these 4 factors account for 75% of all PAD cases, and at least 1 is present at diagnosis in 96% of men. Although women have a slightly lower ABI than men, low ABI prevalence does not appear to vary significantly by sex after age adjustment.

### Screening for peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular disease risk assessment with the ankle-brachial index: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^d64439e3]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Treatment and interventions — because PAD manifests systemic atherosclerosis in the lower limbs, treatment targets both lower limb ischemia and prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Interventions to prevent CVD events include smoking cessation, lowering cholesterol levels, managing high blood pressure, and antiplatelet therapy, and patients with a low ABI may already be recommended for these treatments because the major PAD risk factors are used to calculate CVD risk.

---

### Screening for peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular disease risk assessment with the ankle-brachial index: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^ab27acf1]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) rationale and detection — Peripheral artery disease is a manifestation of atherosclerosis in the lower limbs, and it can impair walking and, in severe cases, can lead to tissue loss, infection, and amputation. Patients with PAD are at increased risk for CVD events, because atherosclerosis is a systemic disease that also causes coronary and cerebrovascular events. In national survey data, 5.9% of the US population 40 years or older has a low ABI (≤ 0.9), which indicates the presence of PAD, yet the true prevalence is difficult to establish because more than half of persons with a low ABI are asymptomatic or have atypical symptoms and population screening studies using a gold standard diagnostic test are lacking. For screening accuracy, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the accuracy of the ABI for identifying asymptomatic persons with PAD who can benefit from treatment.

### Screening for peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular disease risk assessment with the ankle-brachial index: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^21951c74]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Screening tests — ankle-brachial index (ABI) calculation, threshold, and performance in asymptomatic persons: ABI is calculated as the ankle systolic blood pressure divided by the brachial systolic pressure with the patient lying down, and a ratio of less than 1.0 is considered abnormal. In one study of adults older than 70 years, an ABI of less than 0.9 had a sensitivity of 15% to 20% and a specificity of 99% compared with whole-body magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Physical examination has low sensitivity for detecting mild PAD in asymptomatic persons, and the clinical benefits and harms of screening with a physical examination have not been evaluated.

ANKLE-BRACHIAL INDEX

Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is the ratio between the SBP measured at the ankle and the SBP measured at the brachial level. Measurement of ABI is simple, noninvasive, minimally time-consuming, and inexpensive; it is used for both the diagnosis and surveillance of lower extremity artery disease (LEAD), and the assessment of general atherosclerosis advancement and CV risk.

ABI measurement involves comparing SBP in the upper and lower limbs, considering the physiological increase in these values as the pulse wave travels through the arterial vessels, resulting from combined effect of pulse wave reflections and amplification, as well as changes in vessel wall thickness and properties. The presence of stenosis in the arteries of the aorta and /or lower limbs results in a decrease in the value of SBP measured in their distal section (and therefore also in a decrease in ABI), while pathological stiffening of the vessels results in an increase in this pressure (and an abnormal increase in ABI).

Indications

ABI should be measured for the clinical purposes in patients with clinical suspicion of LEAD and in patients without clinical suspicion but at risk of LEAD. Table 6 is summarizing the major indications of ABI:

TABLE 6
Indications of ankle/brachial index (ABI)

How to measure ankle brachial index

Despite the relative simplicity of the method, the data indicate significant heterogeneity in the protocols used, which makes interpretation difficult, especially in the case of serial studies in each patient. Therefore, we suggest the following principles:

Material

1 The examination should be performed using a Doppler method. The use of other methods (oscillometric, palpation, etc.) does not ensure sufficient accuracy and repeatability.
2 Assessment of SBP should be performed consistently on the upper and lower limbs using the same method − using a manually inflated cuff and a Doppler probe. The use of automatic oscillometric assessment on arm to simplify the protocol leads to an overestimation of the ABI.
3 It is recommended to use a 5–10 MHz Doppler probe and a cuff adjusted to the limb circumference (width of at least 40% of the limb circumference at the measurement site).
4 Automatic ABI assessment methods may be a promising time-saving alternative, especially in screening. Automated oscillometric and probably photoplethysmography methods seem to be more reliable than automated volume (dual-chamber) plethysmographic methods. Further evaluation studies are necessary.

### The toe-brachial index in the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease [^23f01867]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) can be diagnosed noninvasively by segmental blood pressure measurement and calculating an ankle-brachial index (ABI) or toe-brachial index (TBI). The ABI is known to be unreliable in patients with vascular stiffness and fails to detect the early phase of arteriosclerotic development. The toe vessels are less susceptible to vessel stiffness, which makes the TBI useful. However, the diagnostic limits used in guidelines, clinical settings, and experimental studies vary substantially. This review provides an overview of the evidence supporting the clinical use of the TBI.

Methods

A review of the literature identified studies reporting the use of the TBI regarding guideline recommendations, normal populations, correlations to angiographic findings, and prognostic implications.

Results

Eight studies conducted in a normal population were identified, of which only one study used imaging techniques to rule out arterial stenosis. A reference value of 0.71 was estimated as the lowest limit of normal based on the weighted average in studies with preheating of the limbs. A further seven studies showed correlations of the TBI with angiographic findings. The TBI had a sensitivity of 90% to 100% and a specificity of 65% to 100% for the detection of vessel stenosis. Few studies investigated the value of the TBI as a prognostic marker for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, and no firm conclusions could be made. Studies have, however, shown correlation between the TBI and comorbidities such as kidney disease, diabetes, and microvasculature disease.

Conclusions

In contrast to the well-defined and evidence-based limits of the ABI, the diagnostic criteria for a pathologic TBI remain ambiguous. Although several guidelines and reviews of PAD diagnostics recommend a TBI < 0.70 as cutoff, it is not strictly evidence-based. The current literature is not sufficient to conclude a specific cutoff as diagnostic for PAD. The current studies in normal populations and the correlation with angiography are sparse, and additional trials are needed to further validate the limits. Large-scale trials are needed to establish the risk of morbidity and mortality for the various diagnostic limits of the TBI.

### Screening for peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular disease risk assessment with the ankle-brachial index: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^0930720a]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a manifestation of atherosclerosis in the lower limbs. It can impair walking and, in severe cases, can lead to tissue loss, infection, and amputation. In addition to morbidity directly caused by PAD, patients with PAD are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, because atherosclerosis is a systemic disease that also causes coronary and cerebrovascular events.

Objective

To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for PAD and CVD risk with the ankle-brachial index (ABI).

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on whether screening for PAD with the ABI in generally asymptomatic adults reduces morbidity or mortality from PAD or CVD. The current review expanded on the previous review to include individuals with diabetes and interventions that include supervised exercise and physical therapy intended to improve outcomes in the lower limbs.

Findings

The USPSTF found few data on the accuracy of the ABI for identifying asymptomatic persons who can benefit from treatment of PAD or CVD. There are few studies addressing the benefits of treating screen-detected patients with PAD; 2 good-quality studies showed no benefit of using the ABI to manage daily aspirin therapy in unselected populations, and 2 studies showed no benefit from exercise therapy. No studies addressed the harms of screening, although the potential exists for overdiagnosis, labeling, and opportunity costs. Studies that addressed the harms of treatment showed nonsignificant results. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for PAD with the ABI in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for PAD and CVD risk with the ABI in asymptomatic adults. (I statement).

### Lower extremity arterial disease in patients with diabetes: a contemporary narrative review [^b52d310b]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

Ankle–brachial index testing

Ankle–brachial index has emerged as the relatively simple, non-invasive, and inexpensive tool for LEAD diagnosis. The ADA recommends the assessment of ABI as a first line non-invasive test in patients with symptoms or signs of LEAD. It is computed as a ratio of systolic blood pressure at the ankle to the systolic blood pressure in the upper arm. ABI is normal in 1.0–1.4 range, suspicious in 0.9–1 range, and obviously pathologic under 0.9. An ABI over than 1.4 is also considered as abnormal, reflecting calcified and stiffed arteries. ABI was also reported as a marker of CVD and death, but the latest US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation (Table 1) has underlined the lack of evidence supporting the ABI use to screen for LEAD and cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic adult people. The performance of ABI for LEAD screening is particularly inconsistent in people with diabetes. A comprehensive systematic review showed a variable performance: the sensitivity of ABI < 0.9 ranged from 29 to 95% (median at 63%), and its specificity varied between 58 and 97% (median 93%). The addition of ABI > 1.3 did not improve the discrimination. The measurement of ABI is also dependent on operator skills. The performance is particularly affected by the presence of peripheral diabetic neuropathy, medial arterial calcification, and incompressible arteries. In these situations, the toe brachial index may be more effective (pathological if < 0.70). The quality of studies evaluating alternative diagnostic techniques for the screening of LEAD in individuals with diabetes is poor. Otherwise, the toe pressure and the transcutaneous pressure of oxygen (TcPO2) are recommended for the diagnosis of lower limb critical ischemia (see below), and the estimation of the likelihood of wound healing or a requirement of amputation.

### Associations between the ankle-brachial index and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality are similar in individuals without and with type 2 diabetes: nineteen-year follow-up of a population-based cohort study [^8698ed4f]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Identifying individuals with a high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remains challenging, as many high-risk individuals are asymptomatic. The ankle-brachial blood pressure index (ABI) is a marker for systemic atherosclerosis, is strongly associated with mortality, and may thus improve identification of high-risk individuals. However, the validity of the ABI may be decreased in diabetes, as ankle pressures may be elevated by medial arterial calcification and arterial stiffening, which occur more frequently in diabetes. In diabetes, the ABI may thus fall within the normal range (≥ 0.9 to ≤ 1.4) when both atherosclerosis and arterial stiffening and calcifications of the lower limbs occur within the same individual. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether the associations between the ABI and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality are similar or, in fact, weaker in individuals with diabetes than in individuals without diabetes. We investigated the ABI at several cutoff points (ABI < 0.9, < 1.0, and < 1.1) and as a continuous variable because development of atherosclerosis in the lower limbs is a continuous process. In addition, we investigated whether alternatives for the ABI, such as the toe-brachial index (TBI) and Doppler flow curves of the lower extremities, were more strongly associated with mortality than the ABI in individuals with diabetes, as these techniques may be less affected by arterial calcifications and stiffening than the ABI.

### Assessment and management of peripheral arterial disease: what every cardiologist should know [^707a3a7f]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Ankle brachial index

The ankle brachial index (ABI) is a simple bedside tool to diagnose lower extremity PAD. The ABI of each leg is the highest ankle systolic blood pressure (SBP) (obtained by blood pressure cuff above the ankle and Doppler of both the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries) divided by the highest arm SBP. A low ABI (< 0.9) is indicative of obstructive disease, and a very elevated ABI (> 1.4) represents arterial stiffening from calcification. In patients with claudication symptoms, exercise treadmill ABI or pedal plantarflexion (toe raises) ABI increase the sensitivity of the test.

In patients who are elderly or with diabetes or chronic kidney disease (CKD), ABI is often elevated due to medial calcification. If there is suspicion that ABI is artificially elevated, toe brachial index (TBI) should be measured because the digital arteries are rarely non-compressible. A TBI of < 0.7 is generally considered to be abnormal. Due to high likelihood of falsely elevated ABI in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI), TBI should always be obtained in patients with lower extremity wounds. Other measurements of perfusion, such as transcutaneous oxygen pressure and skin perfusion pressure, can help guide revascularisation in patients with CLTI.

### Ankle to brachial systolic pressure index at rest increases with age in asymptomatic physically active participants [^280c2dac]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Key messages

This is the first study to report that resting ankle–brachial index (ABI) increases with age in asymptomatic and physically active participants without risk factors.
The decrease of ABI value with age could be due to the increase in the prevalence of asymptomatic peripheral artery disease in older participants.
This study suggests that the so-called borderline or low normal ABI (in the range 0.90–0.99) remains to be studied by considering the age of the participant.

### Ankle to brachial systolic pressure index at rest increases with age in asymptomatic physically active participants [^f1521224]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the present study provides, for the first time, objective evidence that the 'physiological' change in ABI increases with age. This reinforces the belief that the decrease in ABI at rest with age observed in general population studies likely results from the increased prevalence of participants with subclinical PAD. This may also question whether the same resting ABI value should be used as a cut-off point in the youngest and oldest participants. Specifically, the present study suggests that the so-called borderline or low normal ABI (in the range of 0.90–0.99) is more likely to predict the presence of PAD in older than in younger patients.

### Discordant values in lower extremity physiologic studies predict increased cardiovascular risk [^fa5bb988]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The ankle‐brachial index (ABI) is a simple, noninvasive study to assess for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The index is calculated by dividing the highest systolic blood pressure from the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery by that of the brachial artery. ABIs define PAD with reasonable accuracy and have been shown to predict cardiovascular events and mortality. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Abnormal ABIs in asymptomatic patients have been associated with a higher incidence of death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. 6 Patients may be classified as having a normal ABI when 1 ankle artery systolic blood pressure is normal while the other ipsilateral ankle artery pressure is reduced or abnormal — a condition hereafter referred to as discordant ABI. Little attention is given to discordant ABI calculations, again referring to those patients who had a normal ABI reported, but also had an abnormal ABI calculated using the lower of the 2 systolic blood pressures from the ankle arteries for that extremity. We question whether discordant ABIs are a marker of increased cardiovascular and mortality risks and as such should be given consideration when making clinical decisions.

### Low ankle-brachial index is a predictive factor for initial severity of acute ischaemic stroke [^3107a1a3]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

A low ankle-brachial index (ABI) is predictive of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). For unknown reasons, patients with PAD demonstrate higher vascular mortality during follow-up than do those without. Initial stroke severity is a strong predictor of long-term outcome and may be different between patients with and without PAD. Thus, we investigated whether a low ABI was associated with severe stroke presentation.

Methods

We enrolled 1147 first-ever ischaemic stroke patients who underwent ABI measurements during hospitalization. Patients were categorized into the normal (≥ 0.90) or the abnormal (< 0.90) ABI group. Baseline characteristics and initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores were compared between the groups. We further analysed components of the NIHSS subscales in these groups.

Results

Ankle-brachial index was abnormal in 85 (7.4%) patients. Mean initial NIHSS score was higher in the abnormal ABI group (6.61 ± 6.56) than in the normal ABI group (4.36 ± 4.90) (P = 0.003). A low ABI was independently associated with higher NIHSS score in a multivariate analysis. In the abnormal ABI group, leg weakness was more severe than it was in the normal ABI group, and the contribution of leg weakness to the initial NIHSS score was higher.

Conclusions

Patients with low ABI values presented with more severe ischaemic stroke. Contribution of pre-existing PAD to leg weakness may play a role in the initial severity of stroke in patients with PAD. Our findings suggest that poor clinical outcomes in patients with PAD may be partially explained by their increased likelihood for severe stroke.

### Ankle brachial index values, leg symptoms, and functional performance among community-dwelling older men and women in the lifestyle interventions and independence for elders study [^4612a3d8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects 8 million men and women in the United States (US) and will become more common as the US population survives longer with chronic disease.PAD can be detected noninvasively with the ankle brachial index (ABI), a ratio of Doppler‐recorded systolic blood pressures in the lower and upper extremities. – Although intermittent claudication is the classic symptom, PAD is often asymptomatic or can present with atypical leg symptoms. –

A normal ABI value is 1.10 to 1.40. –, This is because among individuals without PAD, lower extremity arterial pressures increase with greater distance from the heart, due to increasing impedance with increasing arterial taper, resulting in higher systolic pressures at the ankle compared with the brachial arteries. Thus, an ABI < 0.90 is highly sensitive and specific for PAD, an ABI of 1.10 to 1.40 indicates absence of PAD, and ABI values between 0.90 and 1.09 represent borderline PAD or low normal ABI values.

Ankle pressure (AP) and ankle-brachial index (ABI) — for suspected chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI), measurement of AP and calculation of ABI are recommended as the first-line noninvasive hemodynamic test. Many patients with CLTI will have an AP < 50 mm Hg or an ABI typically < 0.4, but ABI should be reported as noncompressible if > 1.4, since incompressibility can artifactually elevate readings between 0.4 and 1.4.

### Associations of borderline and low normal ankle-brachial index values with functional decline at 5-year follow-up: the WALCS (walking and leg circulation study) [^a41cd1b6]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

We studied associations of borderline and low normal ankle-brachial index (ABI) values with functional decline over a 5-year follow-up.

Background

The associations of borderline and low normal ABI with functional decline are unknown.

Methods

The 666 participants included 412 with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Participants were categorized as follows: severe PAD (ABI < 0.50), moderate PAD (ABI 0.50 to 0.69), mild PAD (ABI 0.70 to 0.89), borderline ABI (0.90 to 0.99), low normal ABI (1.00 to 1.09), and normal ABI (ABI 1.10 to 1.30). Outcomes were assessed annually for 5 years. Mobility loss was defined as loss of the ability to walk one-quarter mile or walk up and down 1 flight of stairs without assistance among participants without baseline mobility impairment. Becoming unable to walk for 6 min continuously was defined as stopping during the 6-min walk at follow-up among those who walked for 6 min continuously at baseline. Results were adjusted for age, sex, race, comorbidities, and other confounders.

Results

Hazard ratios (HRs) for mobility loss according to ABI category were as follows: severe PAD, HR: 4.16 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.58 to 10.92); moderate PAD, HR: 3.82 (95% CI: 1.66 to 8.81); mild PAD, HR: 3.22 (95% CI: 1.43 to 7.21); borderline ABI, HR: 3.07 (95% CI: 1.21 to 7.84); and low normal ABI, HR: 2.61 (95% CI: 1.08 to 6.32; p trend = 0.0018). Similar associations were observed for becoming unable to walk for 6 min continuously (p trend < 0.0001).

Conclusions

At 5-year follow-up, persons with borderline ABI values have a higher incidence of mobility loss and becoming unable to walk for 6 min continuously compared with persons who have a normal baseline ABI. A low normal ABI is associated with an increased incidence of mobility loss compared with persons who have a normal ABI.

### Ankle-brachial index, toe-brachial index, and cardiovascular mortality in persons with and without diabetes mellitus [^137b83cf]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The prognostic utility of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) may be hampered in persons with diabetes due to peripheral arterial stiffening in the ankles. Stiffening of toe arteries occurs infrequently in diabetes. We aimed to determine the nature of the relationship of the toe-brachial index (TBI) and ABI with cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and to determine whether the associations are modified in individuals with diabetes.

Methods

Individuals with clinically suspected atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease who underwent ABI and TBI measurements in a vascular laboratory were monitored longitudinally for CVD mortality.

Results

Among 469 participants (89% men), the mean age was 68 ± 9 years, and 36% had diabetes. The mean ABI was 0.83 ± 0.28 and the mean TBI was 0.60 ± 0.24. During median 7.0 years of follow-up, there were 158 CVD deaths. The association of the ABI categories with CVD deaths differed in diabetic vs nondiabetic participants (P = 0.002 for interaction). In contrast, the association of the TBI categories with CVD deaths was similar, irrespective of diabetes status (P = 0.17 for interaction). Among diabetic patients, a U-shaped relationship was observed between ABI categories and CVD death: those with low (< 0.90) and high (> 1.30) ABIs were both at higher risk than those with normal ABIs (range, 0.90–1.30). In nondiabetic patients, association of ABI categories with CVD death was linear, such that those with an ABI > 1.30 were at the lowest risk, whereas those with an ABI < 0.90 were at higher risk. In contrast, the association of TBI categories with CVD death was linear irrespective of diabetes status. High TBI categories consistently predicted low risk, whereas risk was higher with progressively lower TBI categories.

Conclusions

Among diabetic individuals with clinically suspected peripheral arterial disease, those with low and high ABIs are both at higher risk of CVD death. In contrast, a linear relationship was observed between TBI categories and CVD death irrespective of diabetes status. These findings suggest that stiffened ankle arteries may limit the predictive value of the ABI in individuals with diabetes, a limitation that may be overcome by measurement of the TBI.

### Use and utility of ankle brachial index in patients with diabetes [^824c2ef7]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Ankle brachial index (ABI) is a simple method to screen peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and to evaluate cardiovascular (CV) prognosis in the general population. Measuring it requires a hand-held Doppler probe but it can be done also with an automatic device. ABI is an effective tool for clinical practice or clinical studies. However, in diabetic patients, it has some specific caveats. Sensitivity of the standard threshold of 0.9 appears to be lower in diabetic patients with complications. Moreover, highly frequent arterial medial calcifications in diabetes increase ABI. It has been demonstrated that measurements > 1.3 are well correlated with both an increased prevalence of PAD and CV risk. Therefore, ABI thresholds of less than 0.9 and more than 1.3 are highly suspicious for PAD and high CV risk in diabetic patients. However, when there is concomitant clinical peripheral neuropathy or high risk of arterial calcification, the efficiency of ABI seems to be limited. In this case, other methods should be applied, toe pressure, in particular. Thus, the ABI could be used in patients with diabetes, but values should be interpreted with precision, according to the clinical situation.

### Position statement on noninvasive imaging of peripheral arterial disease by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Canadian Interventional Radiology Association [^ec793ade]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Peripheral arterial disease — ankle brachial index (ABI) thresholds and performance are outlined: the range for a normal ABI is between 1.0 and 1.1; clinical severity by ABI includes no symptoms when ABI is more than 1.0, claudication when ABI is between 0.5 and 1.0, rest pain when ABI is between 0.25 and 0.50, and impending tissue loss when ABI is less than 0.25; the sensitivity and specificity for PAD diagnosis are 72% and 96%, respectively. In heavily calcified vessels, a toe brachial index (TBI) can be used, with index > 0.65 considered normal and severe PAD present with a TBI of less than 0.40, and ABI does not localize disease within the lower extremities.

Society for Vascular Surgery — noninvasive testing for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) specifies ankle-brachial index (ABI)–based thresholds and exercise criteria. Quantitative assessment includes noninvasive vascular testing, of which the cornerstone is the measurement of the ABI. If the ABI is ≥ 1.4 from noncompressibility, a toe-brachial index is a useful alternative and a toe-brachial index value of ≤ 0.7 is indicative of hemodynamically significant arterial insufficiency. In patients with compelling symptoms and normal resting tests, obtaining an ABI with exercise can be helpful; the standardized treadmill protocol asks patients to walk at a predetermined speed for a maximum of 5 minutes. Diagnostic exercise thresholds include a drop in ABI to ≤ 0.9, more specific criteria of a drop of 30 mm Hg or 20% of the baseline ABI with exercise, and a delayed (> 3 minutes) recovery.

### Impact of low ankle-brachial index on the risk of recurrent vascular events [^649e8b54]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- Low ankle-brachial index (ABI) identifies a stroke subgroup with high risk of recurrent stroke, cardiovascular events, and death. However, limited data exist on the relationship between low ABI and stroke in low and middle-income countries. Therefore, we evaluated the prevalence of ABI ≤ 0.90 (which is diagnostic of peripheral artery disease) in nonembolic stroke patients or transient ischemic attack and assessed the correlation of low ABI with stroke risk, factors, and recurrent vascular events and death. Methods- Patients ≥ 45 years with acute transient ischemic attack or minor ischemic strokes were recruited consecutively from over 17 low-income and middle-income countries (Latin America [1543 patients], Middle East [1041 patients], North Africa [834 patients], and South Africa [217 patients]). The ABI measurement was performed at a single visit. Stroke recurrence and risk of new vascular events were assessed after 24 months of follow-up. Results- Among 3487 enrolled patients, abnormal ABI (< 0.9) was present in 22.3%. Patients with an ABI of ≤ 0.9 were more likely (P < 0.05) to be male, older, and have a history of peripheral artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. During 2-year follow-up, the rate of major cardiovascular event was higher in patients with ABI < 0.9 than those with ABI ≥ 0.9 (Kaplan-Meier estimates, 22.5%; 95% CI, 19.6–25.8 versus 13.7%; 21.4–15.1; P < 0.001), and when ABI was categorized into 4 groups (≤ 0.6; 95% CI, 0.6–0.9; 0.9–1; 1–1.4), the rate of major cardiovascular event was higher in those with ABI ≤ 0.6 than the other groups (Kaplan-Meier estimates, 32.6%; 95% CI, 21.0–48.3 for ABI ≤ 0.6 versus 21.7%; 95% CI, 18.8–25.0 for ABI 0.6–0.9 versus 14.3%; 95% CI, 12.4–16.6 for ABI 0.9–1 versus 13.3%; 95% CI, 11.6–15.2 for ABI 1–1.4; P < 0.001). Conclusions- Among patients with nonembolic ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, those with low ABI had a higher rate of vascular events and death in this population. Screening for ABI in stroke patients may help identify patients at high risk of future events.

### Femoral artery atherosclerosis is associated with physical function across the spectrum of the ankle-brachial index: the San Diego population study [^a13c5347]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is inadequate to detect early-stage atherosclerotic disease, when interventions to prevent functional decline may be the most effective. We determined associations of femoral artery atherosclerosis with physical functioning, across the spectrum of the ABI, and within the normal ABI range.

Methods and Results

In 2007–2011, 1103 multiethnic men and women participated in the San Diego Population Study, and completed all components of the summary performance score. Using Doppler ultrasound, superficial and common femoral intima media thickness and plaques were ascertained. Logistic regression was used to assess associations of femoral atherosclerosis with the summary performance score and its individual components. Models were adjusted for demographics, lifestyle factors, comorbidities, lipids, and kidney function. In adjusted models, among participants with a normal-range ABI (1.00–1.30), the highest tertile of superficial intima media thickness was associated with lower odds of a perfect summary performance score of 12 (odds ratio = 0.56 [0.36, 0.87], P = 0.009), and lower odds of a 4-m walk score of 4 (0.34 [0.16, 0.73], P = 0.006) and chair rise score of 4 (0.56 [0.34, 0.94], P = 0.03). Plaque presence (0.53 [0.29, 0.99], P = 0.04) and greater total plaque burden (0.61 [0.43, 0.87], P = 0.006) were associated with worse 4-m walk performance in the normal-range ABI group. Higher superficial intima media thickness was associated with lower summary performance score in all individuals (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Findings suggest that use of femoral artery atherosclerosis measures may be effective in individuals with a normal-range ABI, especially, for example, those with diabetes mellitus or a family history of peripheral artery disease, when detection can lead to earlier intervention to prevent functional declines and improve quality of life.

### Ankle blood pressure corresponding to brachial blood pressure: age-and sex-specific reference values [^34d3dc34]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Brachial blood pressure (BP) measurement is the standard method for diagnosing hypertension, but alternative measurement sites, like the ankle, may be needed in certain clinical cases. Current guidelines lack age- and sex-specific reference values for these measurements, which may lead to misdiagnosis. This study investigates variations in supine ankle BP across different ages and sexes at equivalent seated brachial BP levels.

Methods

This study utilized health examination data from 102,956 adults aged 20–79 years between 2010 and 2019. Participants with ankle-brachial index (ABI) outside the normal range of 0.91–1.4 or histories of cardiovascular disease, stroke, or malignancy were excluded. BP measurements followed a standardized protocol with validated devices. Supine ankle BP was compared with seated brachial BP across age and sex groups.

Results

Of the 102,956 participants, 32,416 were women (mean age 41.5 years) and 70,540 were men (mean age 43.5 years). Supine ankle BP readings consistently increased with age and were higher in men than women at equivalent seated brachial BP levels. At a seated brachial BP of 130/80 mm Hg, supine ankle BP increased from 142/75 mm Hg in women in their 20s to 162/82 mm Hg in their 70s, and from 146/79 mm Hg to 164/83 mm Hg in men over the same age range.

Conclusions

Supine ankle BP increases with age and is higher in men than women at equivalent seated brachial BP levels. These age- and sex-specific reference values enhance the accuracy of hypertension diagnosis when brachial BP measurement is impractical.

### Ankle-brachial index measured by palpation for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease [^13be7695]. Family Practice (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The ankle-brachial index (ABI), i.e. the ratio of the ankle to brachial systolic blood pressure, is the golden standard for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and is a highly specific method for the assessment of vascular risk in otherwise asymptomatic patients.

Objective

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of the ABI measured by palpation in patients at increased cardiovascular risk in a primary care setting.

Methods

Twenty-four GPs enrolled 10 consecutive patients each, at intermediate cardiovascular risk, based on age > 55 and < 65 years and one or two associated major cardiovascular risk factors or age > 65 and < 80 years without associated cardiovascular risk factor. Clinical data recording and measurements of the ABI were performed. The design of the study was a prospective, blind comparison between the ABI measured by palpation by the GP and simultaneously by Doppler ultrasound by an angiologist (reference test).

Results

Out of 240 enrolled patients, 205 completed the study (35 lost to follow-up); in 9, ABI by palpation was not measurable. Out of the remaining 196 assessable patients, 8 (4.08%) had PAD. Sensitivity of the palpation method was 88% (95% confidence intervals: 65–100), specificity 82% (77–88), positive predictive value 18% (6–29), negative predictive value 99% (98–100), positive likelihood ratio = 4.98 (3.32–7.48) and negative likelihood ratio = 0.15 (0.02–0.95).

Conclusions

The measurement of ABI by palpation in the setting of primary care, in patients at intermediate cardiovascular risk, is a sufficiently sensitive method to consider its use as a screening test for the exclusion of PAD.

### Risk factors and haemodynamic variables in patients with low toe-brachial index but normal ankle-brachial index [^145a457a]. Atherosclerosis (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Classically, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is diagnosed by a low ankle-brachial index (ABI), but the diagnosis can also be made based on toe-brachial index (TBI) measurements. The objective of this study was to characterize patients with low TBI but normal ABI, and chart potential underestimation of PAD prevalence by solitary use of ABI.

Methods

A total of 3739 consecutive patients with known or suspected PAD referred for ABI and TBI measurements in a four-year period were compared to an age- and gender matched control group (n = 17,340).

Results

In the patient cohort, 65.0% had low ABI, 20.5% had low TBI but normal ABI, and 14.5% had normal indices. When comparing the frequencies of comorbidities related to atherosclerotic disease (myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney failure), there were no significant differences among patients with low ABI or low TBI with normal ABI in any of the variables (all p > 0.06). Of the patients with low TBI and normal ABI, 18.7% were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type I or II, and 8.2% with chronic kidney disease.

Conclusions

Patients with low TBI but normal ABI represented 20.5% of patients referred with the suspicion of PAD. Furthermore, patients with low TBI but normal ABI presented similar comorbid characteristics to patients with low ABI, who have a well-described increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The solitary use of ABI underestimated the prevalence of PAD in the population, and PAD screening could potentially be improved by routine application of TBI.

### Exercise ankle brachial index adds important prognostic information on long-term out-come only in patients with a normal resting ankle brachial index [^990fa508]. Atherosclerosis (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical value of exercise ankle brachial index (ABI) is still unclear, especially in patients with normal resting ABI.

Method

2164 patients performed a single-stage treadmill exercise test to diagnose or evaluate PAD. The population was divided into two groups: a normal resting ABI (resting ABI ≥ 0.90) and PAD (resting ABI < 0.90). Patients with a normal resting ABI were divided into 4 exercise ABI groups: exercise ABI < 0.90, 0.90–0.99, 1.00–1.09 and 1.10–1.29 (reference).

Results

Mean follow-up was 5 years. Exercise ABI added significant prognostic information on all cause long-term mortality only in patients with normal resting ABI (p-value 0.014, HR 0.99 95% CI (0.98–0.99)), not in patients with PAD. Fifty years or older (OR 2.93 95% CI (1.65–5.20)) and resting systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg (OR 2.18 95% CI (1.35–3.55)) were associated with an abnormal exercise ABI in patients with a normal resting ABI. Mortality rate increased when the exercise ABI became worse (p trend 0.0001) with a 2.5-fold increase mortality risk in patients with a normal resting ABI but exercise ABI < 0.90 (HR 2.56, 95% CI (1.11–5.91)).

Conclusion

In patients with a normal resting ABI, treadmill exercise ABI added important prognostic information on long-term mortality. Based on our results we recommend that at least all patients suspected for PAD, with a resting ABI ≥ 0.90, who are 50 years or older and having hypertension should undergo treadmill exercise testing.

### Combination of low ankle-brachial index and high ankle-brachial index difference for mortality prediction [^2c9dad3c]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Low ankle-brachial index (ABI) and high ABI difference (ABID) are each associated with poor prognosis. No study has assessed the ability of the combination of low ABI and high ABID to predict survival. We created an ABI score by assigning 1 point for ABI < 0.9 and 1 point for ABID ≥ 0.17 and examine the ability of this ABI score to predict mortality. We included 941 patients scheduled for echocardiographic examination. The ABI was measured using an ABI-form device. ABID was calculated as |right ABI-left ABI|. Among the 941 subjects, the prevalence of ABI < 0.9 and ABID ≥ 0.17 was 6.1% and 6.8%, respectively. Median follow-up to mortality was 93 months. There were 87 cardiovascular and 228 overall deaths. All ABI-related parameters, including ABI, ABID, ABI < 0.9, ABID ≥ 0.17, and ABI score, were significantly associated with overall and cardiovascular mortality in the multivariable analysis (P ≤ 0.009). Further, in the direct comparison of multivariable models, the basic model+ABI score was the best at predicting overall and cardiovascular mortality among the five ABI-related multivariable models (P ≤ 0.049). Hence, the ABI score, a combination of ABI < 0.9 and ABID ≥ 0.17, should be calculated for better mortality prediction.

### 2016 AHA / ACC guideline on the management of patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease: executive summary [^3b40af2b]. Vascular Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) clinical evaluation — vascular examination includes palpation of lower extremity pulses, auscultation for femoral bruits, and inspection of the legs and feet; pulses are rated 0, absent; 1, diminished; 2, normal; or 3, bounding. Patients with confirmed PAD are at increased risk for subclavian artery stenosis, and an inter-arm blood pressure difference of > 15 to 20 mm Hg is abnormal; measuring blood pressure in both arms identifies the arm with the highest systolic pressure, a requirement for accurate measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI). To confirm the diagnosis of PAD, abnormal physical examination findings must be confirmed with diagnostic testing, generally with the ABI as the initial test.

### Use of the ankle-brachial index combined with the percentage of mean arterial pressure at the ankle to improve prediction of all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus: an observational study [^0d683908]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus (DM) has become a heavy health burden because of its high global prevalence. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) of the lower extremities is a common complication of type 2 DM. The mortality risk of PAD was reported to be between those of myocardial infarction and stroke in a cohort study with a mean follow-up of 5.9 years, and DM increased the risk of mortality by 1.4 times in patients with PAD. Although PAD is clinically confirmed using noninvasive angiography (i.e. computed tomography angiography and magnetic resonance angiography) or invasive angiography for anatomical assessments, the use of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) as a simple screen for PAD in patients with DM and cardiovascular risk is recommended by the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guidelines on the management of patients with lower extremity PAD.

However, the commonly used ABI value of < 0.90 has been reported to have only 75% sensitivity for PAD diagnosis, and the sensitivity is even lower in patients with DM than in those without DM. Since borderline low ABI values between 0.91 and 0.99 are associated with a higher risk of PAD and mortality than ABI ≥ 1.00, it has been suggested that sensitivity could be increased by raising the cutoff value for normal ABI to 1.00. However, the specificity is markedly decreased when the cutoff value for normal ABI is raised. Instead, an increase in diagnostic accuracy could be achieved by using other parameters in combination with ABI.

The combination of ABI and percentage of mean arterial pressure (%MAP) at the ankle has been reported to show better diagnostic accuracy than ABI alone. The %MAP can be calculated from a pulse volume recording at the ankle and automatically reported by the ABI-measuring machine, and so it is a convenient index to use along with the ABI in screening for PAD. A previous study has shown that %MAP > 45% predicts a high mortality risk in patients with normal ABI.

In summary, %MAP is a useful biomarker and can be conveniently measured to detect PAD in patients with normal ABI, especially in patients with DM, for whom the sensitivity of ABI for PAD diagnosis is relatively low. However, the utility of %MAP in combination with ABI in predicting long-term mortality is still not clear in patients with type 2 DM. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine whether the combination of low ABI and high %MAP would be a better predictor of all-cause mortality than low ABI alone in patients with type 2 DM.

### Low and borderline ankle-brachial index is associated with intracranial aneurysms: a retrospective cohort study [^6cf3ba64]. Neurosurgery (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The prevalence of unruptured IAs was nearly 9-fold higher in the low ABI group and nearly 7-fold higher in the borderline ABI group compared with the normal ABI group. Notably, the prevalence of unruptured IAs in the normal ABI group was similar to that reported in the general population. ABI measurements could be clinically relevant for identifying individuals at higher risk of IAs and may help guide screening and preventive strategies in addition to established criteria for IA screening.

### Low and borderline ankle-brachial index is associated with intracranial aneurysms: a retrospective cohort study [^c08b50ca]. Neurosurgery (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We found that both low ABI (≤ 0.9) and borderline ABI (0.91–0.99) were significantly associated with an increased risk of IAs when compared with patients with a normal ABI (1.0–1.4). The prevalence of unruptured IAs in the low ABI group (≤ 0.9) was 18.1%, whereas the prevalence of ruptured IAs was 2.2%. Similarly, in the borderline ABI group, the prevalence of unruptured IAs was 12.8%, and ruptured IAs were found in 2.1% of the cases. By contrast, individuals with a normal ABI had a much lower prevalence of unruptured IAs (1.9%) and ruptured IAs (0.5%). This pattern of findings suggests a vastly increased risk of IAs in patients with reduced ABI.

Our findings demonstrate a 9-fold higher prevalence of unruptured IAs in the low ABI group and approximately 7-fold higher prevalence in the borderline ABI group compared with those with a normal ABI range of 1.0–1.4. Notably, the prevalence of unruptured IAs in the normal ABI group was similar to that reported in the general population.

The prevalence of unruptured IAs in the low ABI group and borderline ABI group was similar to that observed in specific populations known to have a high risk of IAs, such as patients with polycystic kidney disease or those who have at least 2 first-degree relatives with IAs. Consequently, screening for IAs is recommended in these high-risk populations. In addition, female smokers have been reported to exhibit a prevalence of IAs ranging from 12%to 19%.

### Heterogeneity of ankle-brachial indices in Patients undergoing revascularization for Critical Limb ischemia [^00097f7a]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to describe the distribution of pre-intervention treated-limb ankle-brachial indices (ABIs) among patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) undergoing percutaneous vascular intervention (PVI) or surgical revascularization (SR).

Background

CLI is diagnosed by the presence of rest pain, tissue ulceration, or gangrene due to chronic arterial insufficiency. It is unclear what fraction of patients with suspected CLI have severe peripheral artery disease (PAD) on noninvasive functional testing.

Methods

The study included patients who underwent lower extremity revascularization for CLI in a multicenter registry in Michigan from January 2012 through June 2015. ABIs were classified as normal (ABI: 0.91 to 1.40), mild-moderate (ABI: 0.41 to 0.90), and severe (ABI: ≤ 0.40). Pre- and post-intervention Peripheral Artery Questionnaire summary scores were assessed in a subset of patients.

Results

Among 10,756 patients with signs or symptoms of CLI, 9,113 (84.7%) underwent PVI and 1,643 (15.3%) underwent SR. ABIs were recorded in 4,972 (54.6%) PVI and 1,012 (61.6%) SR patients. Patients undergoing PVI had higher ABIs than those undergoing SR, with substantial variation in both groups (PVI: 0.72 ± 0.29 vs. SR: 0.61 ± 0.29; p < 0.001). Nearly a quarter of patients with compressible arteries had normal ABIs (24.0%), whereas severe PAD was uncommon (16.5%). A significant improvement in Peripheral Artery Questionnaire scores was noted after intervention across all ABI categories.

Conclusions

Among patients undergoing revascularization for CLI in contemporary practice, the authors found substantial heterogeneity in pre-intervention ABIs. The disconnect between ABI results and clinical diagnosis calls into question the utility of ABIs in this population and suggests the need for standardization of functional PAD testing.

### Blood pressure measurement and assessment of arterial structure and function: an expert group position paper [^a9ec2437]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Procedure

1 The measurement should be performed on each arm (with the cuff placed in the typical place and the Doppler probe on the brachial artery) and each ankle (with the cuff placed just above the malleoli and the Doppler probe on both the posterior tibial artery and the anterior tibial/dorsal pedis artery; in the absence of a signal of the above arteries, it is recommended to try the measurement on the peroneal artery).
2 All measurements should be performed in a lying position, in a situation that ensures the patient's comfort, considering the rest period to achieve stable BP values.
3 When using the cuff on lower limbs, it is recommended to avoid areas of ulceration. The cuff should not be applied over distal bypass.
4 It is recommended to use the routine order of measurements: clockwise or counterclockwise, starting from one of the upper limbs and repeated for that limb at the end if the difference in upper limb measurements suggests a white coat reaction.
5 For diagnosing/monitoring LEAD, it is recommended to estimate the ABI for each lower limb separately (by dividing higher of systolic BP measured on the given ankle by higher of the BP measured on both arms).
6 For CV risk assessment, lower of two measured ABIs should be used.

Interpretation

1 An ABI ≤ 0.90 should be considered the threshold for confirming the diagnosis of LEAD.
2 An ABI > 1.40 suggests increased arterial stiffness. In the case of clinical suspicion of LEAD in such patients, toe-brachial index should be measured.
3 Both (≤ 0.90 and > 1.40) values of ABI should be considered as independent of others CV and mortality risk factors.

Measurement of ABI is relatively easy and requires only short training. It should be performed in all patients with symptoms or signs of LEAD as well as when arterial evaluation is needed such as in patients > 65 years or at high CV risk (Table 7).

### Position statement on noninvasive imaging of peripheral arterial disease by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Canadian Interventional Radiology Association [^9d347f15]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Ankle-brachial index measurement — standard testing modality — defines that the ABI is the ankle systolic blood pressure divided by the brachial artery systolic blood pressure and directs that both upper-extremity brachial pressures should be taken. If there is more than a 15-mm Hg difference between the two sides, hemodynamically significant disease should be considered to be present proximal to the brachial artery with the lower pressure; if there is a brachial pressure discrepancy, the higher pressure should be used. The greater of the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery blood pressure from each side is used to determine the ankle reading.

### Association of ankle-brachial index level with stroke [^ca402aa0]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

Background

There are conflicting data on the relationship between peripheral arterial disease (PAD) as defined by an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of < 0.9 and stroke risk, and these prior data have largely focused on a single race or gender. Furthermore, the association between subsequent ABIs above the established 0.9 threshold for PAD vs. stroke has not been studied. This study assessed stroke occurrence across the full spectrum of ABI values among a broad cohort of stroke survivors.

Methods

Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999–2004, a nationally representative sample of United States adults, were used to assess prevalence of PAD as evidenced by ABI of < 0.9, and to simultaneously identify the independent associations of ABI levels (< 0.90, 0.90–0.99, 1.00–1.09, > 1.3) with stroke prevalence.

Results

Among 6382 adults, 4602 (72%) had full and complete data of which 277 (6%) reported stroke occurrence. Stroke survivors were older and more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, elevated blood pressure and glycohemoglobin, than non-stroke respondents. More subjects with ABI < 0.9 vs. ≥ 0.9 had experienced a stroke (12.7% vs. 5.4%, p < 0.001). Within the full ABI range, stroke presence rose with decreasing ABI (p = 0.0013). After adjustment for potential confounders, only ABI < 0.9 (OR 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2–3.1) and 0.9–0.99 (OR 2.3, 95% CI = 1.4–3.6) compared with the referent group (1.10–1.29) were significantly associated with presence of stroke.

Conclusions

Data from this nationally representative cohort support an independent relationship between established PAD and stroke occurrence, but also indicate that even borderline PAD is strongly linked to stroke.

### Femoral artery atherosclerosis is associated with physical function across the spectrum of the ankle-brachial index: the San Diego population study [^67e495b4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The ankle‐brachial index (ABI) is inadequate to detect early‐stage atherosclerotic disease, when interventions to prevent functional decline may be the most effective. We determined associations of femoral artery atherosclerosis with physical functioning, across the spectrum of the ABI, and within the normal ABI range.

Methods and Results

In 2007–2011, 1103 multiethnic men and women participated in the San Diego Population Study, and completed all components of the summary performance score. Using Doppler ultrasound, superficial and common femoral intima media thickness and plaques were ascertained. Logistic regression was used to assess associations of femoral atherosclerosis with the summary performance score and its individual components. Models were adjusted for demographics, lifestyle factors, comorbidities, lipids, and kidney function. In adjusted models, among participants with a normal‐range ABI (1.00–1.30), the highest tertile of superficial intima media thickness was associated with lower odds of a perfect summary performance score of 12 (odds ratio = 0.56 [0.36, 0.87], P = 0.009), and lower odds of a 4‐m walk score of 4 (0.34 [0.16, 0.73], P = 0.006) and chair rise score of 4 (0.56 [0.34, 0.94], P = 0.03). Plaque presence (0.53 [0.29, 0.99], P = 0.04) and greater total plaque burden (0.61 [0.43, 0.87], P = 0.006) were associated with worse 4‐m walk performance in the normal‐range ABI group. Higher superficial intima media thickness was associated with lower summary performance score in all individuals (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Findings suggest that use of femoral artery atherosclerosis measures may be effective in individuals with a normal‐range ABI, especially, for example, those with diabetes mellitus or a family history of peripheral artery disease, when detection can lead to earlier intervention to prevent functional declines and improve quality of life.

### Ankle brachial index values, leg symptoms, and functional performance among community-dwelling older men and women in the lifestyle interventions and independence for elders study [^86b0908c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence and significance of low normal and abnormal ankle brachial index (ABI) values in a community-dwelling population of sedentary, older individuals is unknown. We describe the prevalence of categories of definite peripheral artery disease (PAD), borderline ABI, low normal ABI, and no PAD and their association with lower-extremity functional performance in the LIFE Study population.

Methods and Results

Participants age 70 to 89 in the LIFE Study underwent baseline measurement of the ABI, 400-m walk, and 4-m walking velocity. Participants were classified as follows: definite PAD (ABI < 0.90), borderline PAD (ABI 0.90 to 0.99), low normal ABI (ABI 1.00 to 1.09), and no PAD (ABI 1.10 to 1.40). Of 1566 participants, 220 (14%) had definite PAD, 250 (16%) had borderline PAD, 509 (33%) had low normal ABI, and 587 (37%) had no PAD. Among those with definite PAD, 65% were asymptomatic. Adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, smoking, and comorbidities, lower ABI was associated with longer mean 400-m walk time: (definite PAD = 533 seconds; borderline PAD = 514 seconds; low normal ABI = 503 seconds; and no PAD = 498 seconds [P < 0.001]). Among asymptomatic participants with and without PAD, lower ABI values were also associated with longer 400-m walk time (P < 0.001) and slower walking velocity (P = 0.042).

Conclusion

Among older community-dwelling men and women, 14% had PAD and 49% had borderline or low normal ABI values. Lower ABI values were associated with greater functional impairment, suggesting that lower extremity atherosclerosis may be a common preventable cause of functional limitations in older people.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Resting ankle–brachial index (ABI) for diagnosing PAD — In patients with history or physical examination findings suggestive of PAD, the resting ABI, with or without segmental pressures and waveforms, is recommended to establish the diagnosis. Resting ABI results should be reported as abnormal (ABI ≤ 0.90), borderline (ABI 0.91–0.99), normal (1.00–1.40), or noncompressible (ABI > 1.40). The ABI has sensitivities ranging from 68% to 84% and specificities from 84% to 99%. Calculated ABI values should be recorded to 2 decimal places. Patients with ABI ≤ 0.90 are diagnosed with PAD, those with ABI 0.91 to 0.99 may possibly have PAD and should undergo exercise ABI, if the clinical suspicion of PAD is significant, and values > 1.40 indicate that the arteries were not able to be compressed; in the setting of noncompressible ABI values, additional imaging can be used to diagnose PAD if the clinical suspicion is significant. Segmental lower extremity blood pressures and Doppler or plethysmographic waveforms (pulse volume recordings) can be used to localize anatomic segments of disease (e.g., aortoiliac, femoropopliteal, infrapopliteal).

### Predictors of an abnormal postexercise ankle brachial index: importance of the lowest ankle pressure in calculating the resting ankle brachial index [^2d468835]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The postexercise ankle-brachial index (ABI) is useful in patients with suspected peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and a normal resting ABI. Our objective was to determine the independent predictors of an abnormal postexercise ABI.

Hypothesis

We hypothesized that the lowest ankle systolic pressure to calculate the resting ABI would be associated with an abnormal post-exercise ABI.

Methods

Among 619 consecutive patients referred for suspected PAD, we calculated the postexercise ABI in patients with a normal resting ABI. An ABI < 0.90 at rest was considered abnormal. We investigated 3 definitions of an abnormal postexercise ABI, defined as either < 0.90, or > 5% or > 20% reduction compared with rest.

Results

Using multivariate analysis, the lowest ABI (calculated using the lowest and not the highest ankle systolic pressure) was consistently the most powerful independent predictor of an abnormal postexercise ABI. Patients with an abnormal lowest resting ABI were significantly more likely to have an abnormal postexercise ABI, as well as a significantly greater reduction in the ABI compared with rest. The lowest ABI had a high specificity (95%) but low sensitivity (82%) for a postexercise ABI < 0.90.

Conclusions

An abnormal lowest ABI (calculated with the lowest ankle systolic pressure) is the most important independent predictor of an abnormal ABI response to exercise in patients with a conventionally normal ABI. All such patients should be exercised and their ABI measured postexercise.

### A modified calculation of ankle-brachial pressure index is far more sensitive in the detection of peripheral arterial disease [^8e9e8968]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) is a simple, inexpensive, and useful tool in the detection of peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD). The current guidelines published by the American Heart Association define ABI as the quotient of the higher of the systolic blood pressures (SBPs) of the two ankle arteries of that limb (either the anterior tibial artery or the posterior tibial artery) and the higher of the two brachial SBPs of the upper limbs. We hypothesized that considering the lower of the two ankle arterial SBPs of a side as the numerator and the higher of the brachial SBPs as the denominator would increase its diagnostic yield.

Methods

The former method of eliciting ABI was termed as high ankle pressure (HAP) and the latter low ankle pressure (LAP). ABI was assessed in 216 subjects and calculated according to the HAP and the LAP method. ABI findings were confirmed by arterial duplex ultrasonography. A significant arterial stenosis was assumed if ABI was < 0.9.

Results

LAP had a sensitivity of 0.89 and a specificity of 0.93. The HAP method had a sensitivity of 0.68 and a specificity of 0.99. McNemar's test to compare the results of both methods demonstrated a two-tailed P < .0001, indicating a highly significant difference between both measurement methods.

Conclusions

LAP is the superior method of calculating ABI to identify PAD. This result is of great interest for epidemiologic studies applying ABI measurements to detect PAD and assessing patients' cardiovascular risk.

### Ankle brachial index for the diagnosis of lower limb peripheral arterial disease [^747e4583]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower limb is common, with prevalence of both symptomatic and asymptomatic disease estimated at 13% in the over 50 age group. Symptomatic PAD affects about 5% of individuals in Western populations between the ages of 55 and 74 years. The most common initial symptom of PAD is muscle pain on exercise that is relieved by rest and is attributed to reduced lower limb blood flow due to atherosclerotic disease (intermittent claudication). The ankle brachial index (ABI) is widely used by a variety of healthcare professionals, including specialist nurses, physicians, surgeons and podiatrists working in primary and secondary care settings, to assess signs and symptoms of PAD. As the ABI test is non-invasive and inexpensive and is in widespread clinical use, a systematic review of its diagnostic accuracy in people presenting with leg pain suggestive of PAD is highly relevant to routine clinical practice.

Objectives

To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of the ankle brachial index (ABI) - also known as the ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) - for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease in people who experience leg pain on walking that is alleviated by rest.

Search Methods

We carried out searches of the following databases in August 2013: MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (EBSCO), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences (LILACS) (Bireme), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and the Health Technology Assessment Database in The Cochrane Library, the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science, the British Library Zetoc Conference search and Medion.

Selection Criteria

We included cross-sectional studies of ABI in which duplex ultrasonography or angiography was used as the reference standard. We also included cross-sectional or diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) cohort studies consisting of both prospective and retrospective studies. Participants were adults presenting with leg pain on walking that was relieved by rest, who were tested in primary care settings or secondary care settings (hospital outpatients only) and who did not have signs or symptoms of critical limb ischaemia (rest pain, ischaemic ulcers or gangrene). The index test was ABI, also called the ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) or the Ankle Arm Index (AAI), which was performed with a hand-held doppler or oscillometry device to detect ankle vessels. We included data collected via sphygmomanometers (both manual and aneroid) and digital equipment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently replicated data extraction by using a standard form, which included an assessment of study quality, and resolved disagreements by discussion. Two review authors extracted participant-level data when available to populate 2×2 contingency tables (true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives). After a pilot phase involving two review authors working independently, we used the methodological quality assessment tool the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2), which incorporated our review question - along with a flow diagram to aid reviewers' understanding of the conduct of the study when necessary and an assessment of risk of bias and applicability judgements.

Main Results

We screened 17,055 records identified through searches of databases. We obtained 746 full-text articles and assessed them for relevance. We scrutinised 49 studies to establish their eligibility for inclusion in the review and excluded 48, primarily because participants were not patients presenting solely with exertional leg pain, investigators used no reference standard or investigators used neither angiography nor duplex ultrasonography as the reference standard. We excluded most studies for more than one reason. Only one study met the eligibility criteria and provided limb-level accuracy data from just 85 participants (158 legs). This prospective study compared the manual doppler method of obtaining an ABI (performed by untrained personnel) with the automated oscillometric method. Limb-level data, as reported by the study, indicated that the accuracy of the ABI in detecting significant arterial disease on angiography is superior when stenosis is present in the femoropopliteal vessels, with sensitivity of 97% (95% confidence interval (CI) 93% to 99%) and specificity of 89% (95% CI 67% to 95%) for oscillometric ABI, and sensitivity of 95% (95% CI 89% to 97%) and specificity of 56% (95% CI 33% to 70%) for doppler ABI. The ABI threshold was not reported. Investigators attributed the lower specificity for doppler to the fact that a tibial or dorsalis pedis pulse could not be detected by doppler in 12 of 27 legs with normal vessels or non-significant lesions. The superiority of the oscillometric (automated) method for obtaining an ABI reading over the manual method with a doppler probe used by inexperienced operators may be a clinically important finding.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence about the accuracy of the ankle brachial index for the diagnosis of PAD in people with leg pain on exercise that is alleviated by rest is sparse. The single study included in our review provided only limb-level data from a few participants. Well-designed cross-sectional studies are required to evaluate the accuracy of ABI in patients presenting with early symptoms of peripheral arterial disease in all healthcare settings. Another systematic review of existing studies assessing the use of ABI in alternative patient groups, including asymptomatic, high-risk patients, is required.

### A systematic review for the screening for peripheral arterial disease in asymptomatic patients [^c062acec]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is common and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. PAD can be detected through a noninvasive measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI).

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of several electronic bibliographic databases for studies that evaluated ABI as a screening test for PAD in asymptomatic individuals. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis, reporting pooled hazard ratios (HRs) when appropriate.

Results

We included 40 individual studies, 2 systematic reviews, and 1 individual-patient data meta-analysis. We found no studies comparing ABI screening with no screening in terms of patient-important outcomes (mortality, amputations). The yield of PAD screening averaged 17% (range, 1%-42%) and was 1% to 4% in lower risk populations. Patients with PAD had higher adjusted risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 2.99; 95% confidence interval, 2.16–4.12) and of cardiovascular mortality (HR, 2.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.91–2.89). Data on benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening were limited; however, ABI screening was associated with additional prognostic information and risk stratification for heart disease. The overall quality of evidence supporting screening was low.

Conclusions

The current available evidence demonstrates that PAD is common in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, but it does not support the benefit of routine ABI screening.

### Ankle-brachial index and subsequent risk of severe ischemic leg outcomes: the ARIC study [^d8a66bd7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Our results have several clinical implications. These findings address a critical knowledge gap between ABI and leg outcomes since for various clinical diagnostic tests, their associations with their most relevant outcome(s) have guided how to interpret those tests (eg, glomerular filtration rate and its association with end‐stage renal disease and glycated hemoglobin and its relation to diabetic complications). Our results support ABI ≤ 0.90 as a threshold for diagnosing PAD. The robust association of ABI 0.91 to 1.00 with severe leg outcomes in our study is in line with a recent recognition of this range as borderline low ABI. It is notable that even ABI 1.00 to 1.10 conferred ≈80% elevated risk of CLI and ischemic amputation after adjusting for potential confounders. Thus, it would be suboptimal if clinicians interpret this ABI range simply as normal. As of 2018, the US Preventive Services Task Force stated that there was insufficient information to determine the effectiveness of using ABI to screen for PAD in asymptomatic adults, mainly on the basis of the improvement of cardiovascular risk prediction by adding ABI to traditional predictors. Given the purpose of ABI (ie, detecting leg atherosclerotic disease, PAD), it seems reasonable for future iterations of US Preventive Services Task Force to discuss any implications of ABI on leg outcomes. To enrich that discussion, further studies are needed to evaluate whether any interventions can reduce the risk of major ischemic leg outcomes in people with low ABI. In this regard, a few studies have shown that statins, already recommended in people with PAD regardless of leg symptoms, may reduce the risk of major adverse limb events.

There are several limitations of this study that should be considered. The ABI measurement was based on an oscillometer device. Additionally, the ABI measurements were obtained on a single, randomly selected leg. Nonetheless, any nondifferential misclassification of ABI should bias the results toward null. Finally, ARIC participants were mainly composed of middle‐aged White and Black individuals; thus, the generalizability of these findings may be limited in other race or age groups.

In conclusion, lower ABI was independently and robustly associated with increased risk of CLI and ischemic leg amputation among this community‐based cohort of middle‐aged participants. Our results further support ABI ≤ 0.90 as a threshold for the diagnosis of PAD and also suggest the importance of recognizing the prognostic value of ABI 0.91 to 1.10 for limb prognosis.

Peripheral arterial disease diagnosis — measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) is identified as the primary method for establishing the diagnosis of PAD, and an ABI of ≤ 0.90 has been demonstrated to have high sensitivity and specificity for the identification of PAD compared with invasive arteriography; additional tests such as carotid intima-media thickness and brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation have shown promise but have not been broadly applied because they require more specialized equipment and technical expertise.

### Lifetime risk of lower-extremity peripheral artery disease defined by ankle-brachial index in the United States [^53b0b82f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

There seem to be a few ways to use the risk calculators from this study. For example, our lifetime risk calculator can be complementary to the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology lifetime risk calculator for coronary disease and stroke 7 and may contribute to comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment. Importantly, the awareness of PAD is low, and most PAD patients do not have typical leg symptoms of intermittent claudication. 17 Also, diagnostic processes and signs/symptoms are unique for PAD (eg, leg examination, ABI measurement, and reduced leg pulse). Thus, identifying people at high lifetime risk of PAD may have implications on targeted patients' education about manifestation and complications of PAD. The risk calculator for prevalent PAD may have implications for screening PAD. Although it is still under debate, 19, 36 some guidelines recommend screening PAD using ABI among high‐risk individuals. 19 Although those clinical guidelines empirically rely on age and the presence of a few key risk factors to identify "high‐risk" populations for PAD (eg, all adults aged ≥ 65 years or people aged 50 to 64 years with any atherosclerotic risk factors 19), our risk calculator for prevalent PAD will allow healthcare providers and patients to quantify the risk objectively on the basis of a combination of risk factors.

### Ankle brachial index values, leg symptoms, and functional performance among community-dwelling older men and women in the lifestyle interventions and independence for elders study [^6a627408]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence and significance of low normal and abnormal ankle brachial index (ABI) values in a community‐dwelling population of sedentary, older individuals is unknown. We describe the prevalence of categories of definite peripheral artery disease (PAD), borderline ABI, low normal ABI, and no PAD and their association with lower‐extremity functional performance in the LIFE Study population.

Methods and Results

Participants age 70 to 89 in the LIFE Study underwent baseline measurement of the ABI, 400‐m walk, and 4‐m walking velocity. Participants were classified as follows: definite PAD (ABI < 0.90), borderline PAD (ABI 0.90 to 0.99), low normal ABI (ABI 1.00 to 1.09), and no PAD (ABI 1.10 to 1.40). Of 1566 participants, 220 (14%) had definite PAD, 250 (16%) had borderline PAD, 509 (33%) had low normal ABI, and 587 (37%) had no PAD. Among those with definite PAD, 65% were asymptomatic. Adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, smoking, and comorbidities, lower ABI was associated with longer mean 400‐m walk time: (definite PAD = 533 seconds; borderline PAD = 514 seconds; low normal ABI = 503 seconds; and no PAD = 498 seconds [P < 0.001]). Among asymptomatic participants with and without PAD, lower ABI values were also associated with longer 400‐m walk time (P < 0.001) and slower walking velocity (P = 0.042).

Conclusion

Among older community‐dwelling men and women, 14% had PAD and 49% had borderline or low normal ABI values. Lower ABI values were associated with greater functional impairment, suggesting that lower extremity atherosclerosis may be a common preventable cause of functional limitations in older people.

### Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities: management of asymptomatic disease and claudication [^75d021f2]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) screening and prognosis using ankle-brachial index (ABI) — Epidemiologic studies have established the incremental value of ABI beyond standard risk scores in predicting future death and cardiovascular events, and an ABI < 0.9 or > 1.4 portends an increased risk of major cardiovascular events. A review by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gave ABI screening an indeterminate rating, stating insufficient evidence to assess benefits and harms. The SVS-commissioned meta-analysis states that ABI testing may incrementally improve cardiovascular risk prediction, but existing evidence does not support broad population screening of asymptomatic patients for PAD; although future studies may identify targeted subgroups, to date inadequate data exist and broad population screening appears unwarranted. After identifying symptoms consistent with intermittent claudication (IC) and an abnormal ABI, it is important to rule out other potential etiologies that can mimic PAD symptoms.

### PAD as a risk factor for mortality among patients with elevated ABI – a clinical study [^76e209a5]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aims to evaluate mortality across ankle-brachial index (ABI) values and to assess the association between elevated ABI, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and mortality.

Design

This is a retrospective clinical study.

Material and Methods

A total of 2159 patients referred with a suspicion of PAD had their ABI and toe brachial index (TBI) measured by photoplethysmography. ABI ≥ 1.3 was considered falsely elevated while TBI < 0.60 was the diagnostic criterion for PAD among the subjects. The cohort was followed up for total and cardiovascular mortality until 30 June 2008, by record linkage with the National Causes-of-Death Register.

Results

The average follow-up time was 39 months. A total of 576 (26.7%) patients died during the follow-up. Mortality was highest in the elevated ABI group (35.7% for elevated ABI; 30.1% for low ABI and 16.0% for normal ABI, p < 0.001). There was a greater than twofold risk of total, and an increased but statistically non-significant risk of, cardiovascular mortality among patients with elevated ABI. Similar risk ratios were noted for the low ABI (≤ 0.9) group. More pronounced associations were observed at both ends of the scale when ABI was divided into sub-categories. The overall survival was significantly worse for the elevated ABI group than for both the normal and the low-ABI group (p < 0.01 and p = 0.013, respectively). PAD was found to be independently associated with both total and cardiovascular mortality among those with elevated ABI (odds ratio (OR): 2.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01–4.85 and OR: 4.90; 95% CI: 1.50–16.04, respectively).

Conclusions

The association between elevated ABI and poor survival is similar to that of low ABI. PAD appears to be an independent risk factor for mortality among patients with elevated ABI.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) exercise treadmill ankle-brachial index (ABI) testing — in patients with PAD and an abnormal resting ABI ≤ 0.90, exercise treadmill ABI testing can be useful to objectively assess functional status; it can be useful to correlate exertional lower extremity symptoms to a decline in ABI after treadmill exercise, and administration of a 6-minute walk test in a corridor is a reasonable alternative for assessment of functional status.

### Ankle brachial index is equally predictive of exercise-induced limb ischemia in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with walking limitation [^a328235c]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In diabetic patients, arterial stiffness may impair compressibility of vessels and result in higher ankle to brachial index (ABI) than in non-diabetic subjects.

Methods

We studied 1972 non-diabetic and 601 diabetic patients, with suspected peripheral artery disease, Exercise transcutaneous oxygen pressure (Ex-tcpO2), expressed in DROP index (limb tcpO2 change minus chest tcpO2 change), is insensitive to arterial stiffness and can estimate exercise-induced regional blood flow impairment (RBFI). A minimal DROP < -15 mm Hg indicates the presence of RBFI (positive test). ABI was simplified to a category variable (ABIc) by rounding ABI to the closest first decimal.

Results

In the ABIc range 0.4 to 1.1 linear regression for mean DROP values were: y = 34 x - 53; (R² = 0.211) and y = 33 x - 52; (R² = 0.186) in diabetic and Non-diabetic patients, respectively. Both Db and non-D patients showed a high proportion of positive Ex-tcpO2 tests for ABIc in the normal range (ABIc: 1.0 and over) from 27.1 to up to 58%. More than half of patients with borderline ABI (ABIc = 0.9) had RBFI during exercise. it was 65.6% in diabetic and 58.5% non-diabetic patients.

Conclusions

Resting ABI was not a better predictor of exercise-induced RBFI in non-Db than in Diabetic patients. Our results highlights the interest of still measuring resting-ABI in diabetic patients to argue for the vascular origin of exertional limb pain, but also of performing exercise tests in patients with walking impairment.

### Ankle brachial index values, leg symptoms, and functional performance among community-dwelling older men and women in the lifestyle interventions and independence for elders study [^2ea5b230]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Results reported here document that among sedentary, community dwelling men and women age 70 to 89 with SPPB scores < 10, most participants had ABI values below a normal ABI range of 1.10 to 1.40. Fourteen percent had definite PAD (ABI < 0.90), 16% had a borderline ABI value of 0.90 to 0.99, and 33% had a low normal ABI value of 1.00 to 1.09. Most participants with definite or borderline PAD were asymptomatic. Among all asymptomatic participants, lower ABI values were associated with slower 400‐m walk time and slower 4‐m walking velocity, even after adjusting for age, sex, race, comorbidities, smoking, BMI, and physical activity. Among asymptomatic participants, those with borderline ABI values had slower 400‐m walk time and those with low normal ABI values had slower 4‐m walking velocity, compared with participants without PAD, adjusting for age and sex. Within the entire cohort, participants with low normal ABI values (ABI 1.00 to 1.09) had slower 4‐m walking velocity, compared with participants without PAD, adjusting for age and sex. However, associations of borderline (ABI 0.90 to 0.99) and low normal (ABI 1.00 to 1.09) ABI values with poorer 400‐m walk time and slower 4‐m walking velocity were not statistically significant after additional adjustment for race, comorbidities, smoking, BMI, and physical activity.

### Relation of borderline peripheral arterial disease to cardiovascular disease risk [^73d48e40]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a well-established risk factor for clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). The impact of a low ankle-brachial index (ABI), higher than the generally recognized 0.9 cutpoint for PAD, on CVD risk is not well characterized. We analyzed data from the 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n = 4,895), a nationally representative sample of United States adults, to determine the prevalence of PAD (ABI < 0.90), borderline PAD (ABI 0.90 to 0.99), a low-normal ABI (1.00 to 1.09), and a normal ABI (1.10 to 1.29), and the association of these ABI levels with CVD. The prevalence of PAD, borderline PAD, a low-normal ABI, and a normal ABI was 5.0%, 8.7%, 27.8%, and 54.8%, respectively. After age, race/ethnicity, and gender adjustment, the odds ratios of a 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk of ≥ 20%, CHD, stroke, and CVD were higher at lower ABI levels (each p trend < 0.01). After additional adjustment for potential confounders, the odds ratios associated with a low-normal ABI, borderline PAD, and PAD, compared with those with a normal ABI, were 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91 to 1.70), 1.34 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.83), and 1.87 (95% CI 1.29 to 2.73), respectively (p trend < 0.001) for CVD and 1.20 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.77), 1.45 (95% CI 0.80 to 2.63), and 2.02 (95% CI 1.20 to 3.39), respectively (p trend = 0.015) for a 10-year risk of CHD of ≥ 20%. In contrast, a trend was not present for CHD and stroke after multivariate adjustment. In conclusion, subjects with a low-normal ABI or with borderline PAD need screening for CVD risk factors, and interventions may be appropriate to prevent cardiovascular events.

### Ankle-brachial index and energy production in people without peripheral artery disease: the BLSA [^781f5425]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Impaired walking endurance associated with peripheral artery disease (PAD), defined as an ankle‐brachial index (ABI) of < 0.90, has been linked to lower mitochondrial oxidative capacity in the muscles of the lower extremities. This association may be attributable in part to the discrepancy between oxygen delivery and demand, as well as oxidative damage to myocytes from repeated episodes of ischemia‐reperfusion. Even a mildly lower ABI within the range of 0.9 to 1.4 is associated with lower performance in mobility tasks, and with lower mitochondrial oxidative capacity, assessed by phosphorous‐31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Longitudinal studies have found a decline in ABI with aging in the presence, and absence of PAD. Whether this age‐associated longitudinal decline in ABI is also associated with longitudinal reduction in muscle oxidative capacity is unknown. Hence, we hypothesized that, in participants who are free of PAD, lower ABI at baseline and greater decline in ABI with aging are associated with greater declines in mitochondrial oxidative capacity. If even subclinical decline of ABI is associated with reduced skeletal muscle oxidative capacity, interventions that ameliorate blood flow and muscle perfusion may prevent the decline of mitochondrial function with aging and its consequences.

### Upstroke time is a useful vascular marker for detecting patients with coronary artery disease among subjects with normal ankle-brachial index [^8934d5a5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Cutoff Values of ABI and Upstroke Time

The 2016 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines on the management of PAD recommend that ABI in the range of 1.00 to 1.40 should be classified as normal for the diagnosis of PAD. 1 In addition, a previous study has shown that low ABI (< 1.00) and high ABI (≥ 1.40) were associated with higher incidence of cardiovascular events than was normal ABI (1.00–1.40). 4 Therefore, participants were divided into 3 groups based on those cutoff values of ABI: patients with low ABI when either side of ABI was < 1.00, subjects with normal ABI when ABIs on both the left and right sides were within the range of 1.00 to 1.40, and patients with high ABI when either side of ABI was > 1.40.

To our knowledge, there has been no report in which a cutoff value of upstroke time for cardiovascular disease was proposed. Therefore, in accordance with the recommended cutoff value of upstroke time for diagnosis of PAD in the 2013 Japanese Circulation Society guidelines for a noninvasive vascular function test and cutoff values proposed in recent studies in which the optimal cutoff value of upstroke time for diagnosis of PAD was investigated, 9, 12, 13 participants were divided into 2 groups: subjects with normal upstroke time when the upstroke times on both the left and right sides were < 180 ms and patients with prolonged upstroke time when upstroke time on either side or upstroke times on both sides were ≥ 180 ms. In the present study, these cutoff values of ABI and upstroke time were used for severity assessment of atherosclerosis but not for diagnosis of PAD.

Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) — resting ankle-brachial index (ABI) testing — In patients with history or physical examination findings suggestive of PAD, the resting ABI, with or without ankle pulse volume recordings (PVR) and/or Doppler waveforms, is recommended to establish the diagnosis. The resting ABI should be reported as abnormal (ABI ≤ 0.90), borderline (ABI 0.91–0.99), normal (ABI 1.00–1.40), or noncompressible (ABI > 1.40). For screening, in patients at increased risk of PAD, screening for PAD with the resting ABI, with or without ankle PVR and/or Doppler waveforms, is reasonable, whereas in patients not at increased risk of PAD and without history or physical examination findings suggestive of PAD, screening for PAD with the ABI is not recommended.

### The ability of the toe-brachial index to predict the outcome of treadmill exercise testing in patients with a normal resting ankle-brachial index [^c88db4b1]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in the presence of a normal ankle-brachial index (ABI) can be diagnosed noninvasively by measuring a postexercise ABI or by measuring the toe-brachial index (TBI).

Methods

This was a prospective comparative study. Over a period of 30 months, a total of 415 patients who were referred with the suspicion of vascular claudication and resting values of 0.91 ≤ ABI < 1.40 were further evaluated for the resting TBI and postexercise ABI by treadmill testing.

Results

A total of 325 (39%) of the 830 investigated limbs had a low TBI (≤ 0.70), and 505 (61%) had a normal TBI. Of the limbs with a low TBI, 160 (49%) had PAD according to a postexercise ABI versus 165 (33%) of the limbs with normal TBI. The overall agreement in PAD classification between the two methods was 500/830 (60%) with a Cohen's kappa = 0.166 (95% CI: 0.096–0.232). The data showed an inverse correlation between the magnitude of the TBI decrease, as well as the resting ABI, and the probability of an abnormal postexercise ABI. On average, limbs with a low TBI had a lower resting ABI than patients with a normal TBI (1.07 ± 0.09 vs. 1.13 ± 0.10, P < 0.001). The groups with a low TBI had a significantly higher ratio of abnormal test results than patients with a normal TBI, in limbs with ABI (0.96–1.00) and ABI > 1.10 (P ≤ 0.022 for both), but there were no statistically significant differences found in other ABI intervals (P > 0.200 for all).

Conclusions

The magnitude of the TBI reduction correlates with an increased probability of an abnormal postexercise ABI. However, this is due in part to limbs with a low TBI having a lower resting ABI on average than limbs with a normal TBI, which also correlates with the probability of an abnormal exercise test result. This study shows that the TBI and the postexercise ABI are not interchangeable for establishing a PAD diagnosis.

### Ankle brachial index values, leg symptoms, and functional performance among community-dwelling older men and women in the lifestyle interventions and independence for elders study [^1d6f308a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Of 1635 LIFE participants, 1566 had a valid ABI measurement < 1.40 and are included in the primary analyses. An additional 36 LIFE participants had an ABI value > 1.40 and were included in separate exploratory analyses. Thirty‐three LIFE participants (2%) had missing ABI data. Fourteen participants had an ABI < 0.50 and 5 had an ABI < 0.40, consistent with severe PAD.

A total of 587 participants (37%) had a normal ABI value, defined as ABI 1.10 to 1.40. The remainder had ABI values < 1.10 or > 1.40. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of participants, according to ABI value. Lower ABI values were associated with older age, lower BMI values, and a higher prevalence of African American race, current smoking, and ever smoking. Participants in the ABI category of 0.90 to 0.99 included the highest proportion of women. Participants with an ABI > 1.40 had the highest proportion of men and the lowest proportion of African Americans.

Table 1.
Baseline Characteristics of the Study Population According to Baseline ABI Values

Only 12 (5.5%) of the 220 participants with PAD (ABI < 0.90) had classic symptoms of intermittent claudication, compared with 1.6%, 1.4%, and 0.85% of participants with borderline PAD (ABI 0.90 to 0.99), low normal ABI (ABI 1.00 to 1.09), and normal ABI (1.10 to 1.40), respectively (P < 0.001). Sixty‐five percent of participants with PAD were asymptomatic (ie, had no exertional leg symptoms), compared with 76.4%, 76.5%, and 74.6% of participants with borderline PAD, low normal ABI, and normal ABI, respectively (P = 0.012).

### A high normal ankle-brachial index is associated with proteinuria in a screened cohort of Japanese: the okinawa peripheral arterial disease study [^43203417]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

We hypothesized that ankle-brachial index (ABI) increased with age as a result of arterial stiffness, and decreased when flow-limiting atherosclerotic stenosis occurred in the lower limbs. As arterial stiffness is associated with proteinuria, we investigated the relationship between ABI and prevalence of proteinuria.

Methods

A cross-sectional study of ABI and proteinuria with 13,193 participants aged 21–89 years (53% women) from health checkups between July 2003 and March 2010 was conducted. ABI was measured using the automatic oscillometric method, and stratified into four groups: ABI ≤ 0.9 (low); 0.9 < ABI < 1.0 (borderline low); 1.0 ≤ ABI < 1.2 (normal); and 1.2 ≤ ABI < 1.4 (high normal).

Results

In participants with ABI at least 1.0, ABI was positively correlated with SBP, pulse pressure, and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity. In participants with ABI less than 1.0, all indices were negatively correlated with ABI. The prevalence of proteinuria, defined as ≥ 1+ by dipstick, was significantly higher in low (23%) and high normal ABI (10%) compared with borderline low (6%) and normal ABI (7%). In participants at least 60 years, proteinuria was significantly associated with only low ABI [odds ratio (OR) 3.22, 95% confidence interval 1.34–7.41] compared with normal ABI before and after multivariable adjustment. In participants less than 60 years, adjusted OR for proteinuria was only significantly associated with high normal ABI (OR 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.01–1.74).

Conclusion

High normal ABI in younger participants may be a result of arterial stiffness and associated with proteinuria.

### Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities: management of asymptomatic disease and claudication [^63ca23be]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery — recommendations for diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) state the following. We recommend using the ankle-brachial index (ABI) as the first-line noninvasive test to establish a diagnosis of PAD in individuals with symptoms or signs suggestive of disease. When the ABI is borderline or normal (> 0.9) and symptoms of claudication are suggestive, we recommend an exercise ABI. We suggest against routine screening for lower extremity PAD in the absence of risk factors, history, signs, or symptoms of PAD. For asymptomatic individuals who are at elevated risk, such as those aged > 70, smokers, diabetic patients, those with an abnormal pulse examination, or other established cardiovascular disease, screening for lower extremity PAD is reasonable if used to improve risk stratification, preventive care, and medical management. In symptomatic patients who are being considered for revascularization, we suggest using physiologic noninvasive studies, such as segmental pressures and pulse volume recordings, to aid in the quantification of arterial insufficiency and help localize the level of obstruction. In symptomatic patients in whom revascularization treatment is being considered, we recommend anatomic imaging studies, such as arterial duplex ultrasound, computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and contrast arteriography.

### Borderline ankle-brachial index is associated with poor short-term clinical outcome after coronary artery intervention [^237f620e]. Atherosclerosis (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the association between borderline ankle-brachial index (ABI) and clinical outcome in patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Methods

From August 2009 to August 2012, ABI was measured in 1291 patients who underwent PCI. Patients with borderline ABI were compared with those who had normal ABI. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE), defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and repeat revascularization.

Results

Of the 1291 patients, 1154 (82%) had normal ABI and 89 (7%) had borderline ABI. The median overall follow-up duration was 19 (interquartile range 13–26) months. After adjustment with IPTW, the incidence of stroke (HR, 6.28; CI 95%, 1.95–20.19; P < 0.01) and MACCE (HR, 2.54; CI 95%, 1.40–4.62; P < 0.01) were higher in the borderline ABI group. In a propensity score-matched population, the incidence of stroke (HR, 4.68; CI 95%, 1.18–18.52; p = 0.03) and MACCE (HR, 2.12; CI 95%, 1.09–4.11; P = 0.03) were still significantly higher.

Conclusion

The presence of borderline ABI was associated with worse clinical outcome and increased stroke rate compared with normal ABI during the short-term follow-up period in patients who underwent coronary intervention.

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) evaluation algorithm — patients with clinical suspicion (Rest pain – Tissue loss) proceed to a complete physical exam suggestive of peripheral artery disease (PAD); if suggestive, measure ankle pressure, ankle-brachial index (ABI), and Doppler waveforms, classifying ABI as normal (0.90–1.40) or abnormal (ABI < 0.90). If ABI > 1.40 or discordant ankle pressure, ABI, and/or Doppler waveforms, or if a normal ABI coexists with tissue loss or gangrene, measure toe pressure, toe-brachial index (TBI), and Doppler waveforms, then stage limb severity (WIfI) and obtain vascular imaging if the patient is a candidate for revascularization; if normal ABI without tissue loss, search for alternate cause of rest pain; if the physical exam is not suggestive, search for alternative diagnosis.

ASCO (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods: Pts who received at least 4 wk of abi or enza in the prechemotherapy mCRPC setting and whose disease progressed within 6 mo of screening were eligible. Pts received pembro 200 mg IV + docetaxel 75 mg/m. 2IV Q3W and prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily. Primary end points were PSA response rate, ORR per RECIST v1. 1 by blinded independent central review, and safety. Key secondary end points were DCR per RECIST v1. 1, DOR per RECIST v1. 1, radiographic PFS per PCWG-modified RECIST, and OS. Results: Of 105 enrolled pts, 104 were treated, and 50% had measurable disease. Median time from enrollment to data cutoff was 19. 9 mo for all pts and
21. 8 mo for pts with ≥ 27 wks follow-up. Confirmed PSA response rate was 28% in 103 pts with a baseline PSA assessment. Median time to PSA progression was 6. 2 mo.

In pts with measurable disease and ≥ 27 wks follow-up, ORR was 18% and DCR was 51%. Median DOR was 6. 7 mo; 5 pts had a response for ≥ 6 mo. In all pts, median rPFS was 8. 3 mo and OS was
20. 4 mo. +. Of 57 pts with AR-v7 data, 17. 5% were AR-v7 +, 77% were AR-v7 −, and 5% were undetermined. GEP was not significantly associated with ORR or PSA response.

### Toe brachial index and not ankle brachial index is appropriate in initial evaluation of peripheral arterial disease in type 2 diabetes [^0a39afe1]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Ankle brachial index commonly used to screen for PAD fails to detect all cases particularly in presence of arterial wall calcification. Both a raised ABI (> 1.3) and a so-called normal ABI (0.9–1.3) may miss confirmed PAD cases. Toe brachial index or TBI can be a useful alternative in such circumstances because toe arteries are too small caliber to be affected by wall calcification. TBI has good sensitivity as a screening tool for PAD in T2D. ABI and TBI also have good correlation for a low ABI, but this correlation is low or absent for raised or so-called normal ABI. Our study is the first to compare ABI and TBI with CT angiography and prove TBI scores way ahead of ABI. The currently used cut-off of TBI (0.6) provides the best sensitivity and specificity for PAD detection but we propose 1.0 as the upper limit cut-off of ABI for best sensitivity and specificity as derived from ROC. We therefore recommend that TBI may replace ABI, however due to logistic reasons, ABI may continue to be used as an initial screening tool given its widespread availability and low cost. However, TBI should be the bedside tool of choice in detecting PAD in T2D with ABI > 0.9

Ankle-brachial index

Eighteen studies evaluated the ABI to diagnose PAD in patients prone to MAC. In these studies, 10 different variables were investigated (Table 4 shows an overview). In studies including patients with an ABI > 1·3, the PLR ranged between 1·22 and 17, and the NLR ranged between 0 and 0·69 for an ABI with a threshold of < 0·90. When an ABI of < 0·9 or > 1·3 to 1·4 was defined as abnormal, the PLR and NLR ranges changed to 1·69–6·17 and 0·44–0·72, respectively.

Table 4
An overview of the different ABI variables to diagnose PAD.

Ankle pressure

Three studies mentioned an absolute ankle pressure of < 70mmHg as the threshold for diagnosing PAD. In two of these studies, a PLR of 2·25–2·73 and an NLR of 0·67–0·79 were found to detect PAD. It was not possible to calculate the PLR/NLR as a result of the selection of patients in one study. All included patients had > 50% stenosis on DSA, so only the sensitivity of 33% could be given in this study. A post-exercise reduction of > 30mmHg in systolic ankle pressure showed a lower PLR of 0·68 to detect PAD.

Toe-brachial index; toe pressure

Six studies investigated the TBI as an index test for PAD (with cut-off values of below 0·70 and 0·75). In these studies, PLRs ranged from 1·62 to 4·26. NLRs fluctuated between 0 and 0·47. In the three studies that evaluated toe pressure, different cut-off values were used. Vriens et al. used a pressure below 50 mmHg as indicator for PAD, leading to a PLR of 17·55 and an NLR of 0·56. Sonter et al. studied a pressure below 70 mmHg, with an infinite PLR and an NLR of 0·54. Tehan et al. used a pressure below 97 mmHg, resulting in a PLR of 2·67 and an NLR of 0·36.

Conclusions

Abnormal ABI in patients with significant CAD was associated with an increased incidence of major cardiovascular events, including the composite of all‐cause death/MI/stroke, all‐cause death, MI, and stroke, for long‐term follow‐up. Abnormal ABI could be a valuable tool for evaluating the prognosis of patients with significant CAD.

### Ankle-brachial index and cardiovascular outcomes in the bypass angioplasty revascularization investigation 2 diabetes trial [^14f49468]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Peripheral arterial disease increases cardiovascular risk in many patient populations. The risks associated with an abnormal ankle-brachial index (ABI) in patients with type 2 diabetes and stable coronary artery disease have not been well described with respect to thresholds and types of cardiovascular events.

Methods

We examined 2,368 patients in the BARI 2D trial who underwent ABI assessment at baseline. Death and major cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction and stroke) during follow-up (average 4.3 years) were assessed across the ABI spectrum and by categorized ABI: low (≤ 0.90), normal (0.91–1.3), high (> 1.3), or noncompressible.

Results

A total of 12,568 person-years were available for mortality analysis. During follow-up, 316 patients died, and 549 had major cardiovascular events. After adjustment for potential confounders, with normal ABI as the referent group, a low ABI conferred an increased risk of death (relative risk [RR] 1.6, CI 1.2–2.2, P = 0.0005) and major cardiovascular events (RR 1.4, CI 1.1–1.7, P = 0.004). Patients with a high ABI had similar outcomes as patients with a normal ABI, but risk again increased in patients with a noncompressible ABI with a risk of death (RR 1.9, CI 1.3–2.8, P = 0.001) and major cardiovascular event (RR 1.5, CI 1.1–2.1, P = 0.01).

Conclusions

In patients with coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes, ABI screening and identification of ABI abnormalities including a low ABI (< 1.0) or noncompressible artery provide incremental prognostic information.

### Noncompressible arteries correlate with increased cardiovascular mortality at 2 years [^e5d7099b]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a useful screening tool for the detection of peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Using ABI measurements, patients can be stratified into different severities of arterial occlusive disease.

Methods

Four hundred forty-four Veterans Health Administration Medical Center patients were referred for PVD between 2004 and 2005. Of those, 231 patients had an ABI ≤ 0.90 or > 1.2 with known treatment and follow-up obtained from electronic medical records. These individuals had bilateral ABI measurements and were observed for a median of 23 months (range, 4.0–60.0 months). Patients were divided into 4 ABI categories: severe (ABI ≤ 0.30; n = 62), moderate (ABI 0.30- ≤ 0.60; n = 138), mild (ABI 0.60- ≤ 0.90; n = 89), normal (ABI 0.90- ≤ 1.2; n = 86), and noncompressible (ABI > 1.2; n = 69).

Results

Mortality from cardiovascular disease in the severe, moderate, mild, normal, and noncompressible groups was 4.8%, 8.0%, 10.1%, 0%, and 21.7%, respectively, at the mean follow-up of 2 years. For all-cause mortality, the overall percent for each group respectively was 32.3%, 31.9%, 31.5%, 14%, and 42% (P = 0.003). To our surprise, ABIs < 0.9 did not show a linear correlation with 2-year survival. However, an ABI > 1.2, indicating noncompressible arteries, correlated significantly with higher rates of mortality at a mean follow-up of 2 years (33.3%). Cardiovascular disease and amputation were also significantly higher in those with noncompressible arteries than in the other groups.

Conclusions

ABI is a noninvasive, inexpensive test that provides valuable information on a patient's risk of death. We recommend that patients with noncompressible vessels undergo systemic cardiovascular work-up, including coronary and carotid artery evaluation.

### Upstroke time is a useful vascular marker for detecting patients with coronary artery disease among subjects with normal ankle-brachial index [^b30b813d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Ankle‐brachial index (ABI) measurement is a useful screening method for detecting peripheral artery disease (PAD). In the current major guidelines for diagnosis and management of PAD, the normal range of ABI has been defined as 1.00 to 1.40. 1, 2 In addition to PAD detection, ABI can be used as a cardiovascular risk marker because ABI is also an indicator of systemic atherosclerosis. 3, 4 Therefore, subjects with normal ABI are usually considered to be at lower cardiovascular risk than subjects with abnormal ABI (< 1.00 or > 1.40). 3, 4 However, the ABI method does not always provide reliable data for cardiovascular risk assessment because the ABI value is falsely elevated despite the presence of occlusive arterial lesions in the lower extremities in patients with noncompressible lower limb arteries, 5 potentially leading to incorrect cardiovascular risk assessment.

Waveforms of pulse volume recording obtained by using a plethysmography technique have been used as a noninvasive method for PAD detection. 6, 7, 8 Recent advancement of oscillometric cuff technology has enabled easy and accurate pulse volume recordings in a short time, resulting in clinical application of vascular parameters calculated from high‐quality waveforms of pulse volume recordings. Upstroke time, one of the vascular parameters calculated from the waveform of pulse volume recording, is transit time from the nadir to peak of the waveform. Because there is little information on the usefulness of upstroke time alone or in combination with ABI for detecting patients with advanced atherosclerosis as a vascular marker, we investigated the association between upstroke time and coronary artery disease (CAD) to determine whether upstroke time alone or in combination with ABI is useful for detecting patients with advanced atherosclerosis in a large number of well‐characterized subjects.

### Ankle-brachial index testing at the time of stress testing in patients without known atherosclerosis [^de405c83]. Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Individuals referred for stress testing to identify coronary artery disease may have nonobstructive atherosclerosis, which is not detected by stress tests. Identification of increased risk despite a negative stress test could inform prevention efforts. Abnormal ankle-brachial index (ABI) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.

Hypothesis

Routine ABI testing in the stress laboratory will identify unrecognized peripheral arterial disease in some patients.

Methods

Participants referred for stress testing without known history of atherosclerotic disease underwent ABI testing (n = 451). Ankle-brachial index was assessed via simultaneous arm and leg pressure using standard measurement, automated blood-pressure cuffs at rest. Ankle-brachial index was measured after exercise in 296 patients and 30 healthy controls. Abnormal postexercise ABI was defined as a > 20% drop in ABI or fall in ankle pressure by > 30 mm Hg.

Results

Overall, 2.0% of participants had resting ABI ≤ 0.90, 3.1% had ABI ≥ 1.40, and 5.5% had borderline ABI. No patient with abnormal or borderline ABI had an abnormal stress test. Participants who met peripheral arterial disease screening criteria (age ≥ 65 or 50–64 with diabetes or smoking) tended toward greater frequency of low ABI (2.9% vs 1.0%; P = 0.06) and were more likely to have borderline ABI (0.91 to 0.99; 7.8% vs 2.9%; P = 0.006). Postexercise ABI was abnormal in 29.4% of patients and 30.0% of controls (P not significant).

Conclusions

Ankle-brachial index screening at rest just before stress testing detected low ABI in 2.0% of participants, all of whom had negative stress tests.

### USPSTF evidence report: screening for peripheral artery disease using the ankle-brachial index… [^4803ce85]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

The most commonly used screening test for PAD is the ankle-brachial index, which is the ratio of the ankle and brachial systolic blood pressures. While the ABI is recommended in patients with symptoms, 5 less is known about the benefits and harms of its use for early detection and treatment in asymptomatic patients. In 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of using the ABI to screen for PAD and assess CVD risk in asymptomatic adults.
6. Key Question
2. What is the diagnostic accuracy of the ABI as a screening test for PAD in generally asymptomatic adults. Evidence for the diagnostic accuracy of the ABI as a screening test for PAD in asymptomatic adults is limited to 1 older fair-quality study published in 2008 that showed low sensitivity and high specificity.

The ABI was calculated for each leg by dividing the manual sphygmomanometer readings of posterior tibial artery systolic pressure by the mean of 3 brachial artery systolic pressures. A low ABI was defined as less than 0. 9, and accuracy was calculated based on the whole-body MRA gold standard, with PAD diagnosis defined as 50% or greater stenosis. The prevalence of an ABI less than 0. 9 was
4. 5% in the right leg and 4. 2% in the left leg. The prevalence of MRA-confirmed PAD defined as 50% or greater stenosis was 19. 0% in the right leg and
23. 0% in the left leg. Nonetheless, ABI values were similar in both trials, with a mean of 0. 86 in the AAA trial and a median of
0. 90 in the POPADAD trial. In AAA and POPADAD, 33% and 31% of participants, respectively, were current smokers. Key Question 5. What are the harms of treatment of screen-detected or generally asymptomatic adults with PAD or an abnormal ABI.

The poor sensitivity of the ABI identified in the 1 included diagnostic accuracy study contrasts with evidence in symptomatic populations. Other systematic reviews of largely symptomatic populations have reported much higher diagnostic accuracy. 9–11, 17 For example, pooled sensitivities and specificities for ABI 0. 9 or less compared with an angiographic reference standard have been reported at 75% and 86%.

### Ankle-brachial index and subsequent risk of severe ischemic leg outcomes: the ARIC study [^cfb37c95]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this large community‐based study of middle‐aged adults at baseline, we found that individuals with low ABI (≤ 0.90), borderline low ABI (0.91–1.00), and ABI 1.01 to 1.10 had elevated risks of severe leg outcomes of CLI and ischemic leg amputation relative to people with normal ABI (1.11–1.20). The association was largely consistent across demographic and clinical subgroups, although the association with both outcomes was weaker in women and participants with diabetes compared with their counterparts. High ABI > 1.30 was not associated with elevated risk of these adverse leg outcomes. We confirmed graded associations between lower ABI and the 2 leg outcomes when ABI was modeled continuously with cubic spline terms.

Although the association of lower ABI with severe leg outcomes (eg, amputation) has been shown in selected clinical populations (ie, patients with PAD, or people with diabetes), there are several unique aspects of our study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating this association in the general population (Table S3). Thus, our findings are likely to be more generalizable than previous studies. Also, reflecting the distribution of ABI in the general population, we uniquely observed elevated risk of severe leg outcomes for borderline low ABI (0.91–1.00) and even for ABI 1.01 to 1.10. Moreover, leveraging large sample size and long follow‐up of ≈28 years, we confirmed overall consistent results across major demographic and clinical subgroups.
