## Question

What are the key elements of a rehabilitation program after a stroke?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the key elements of a stroke rehabilitation program. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principles that underpin effective stroke rehabilitation. Then, I should verify the core components of the interdisciplinary team and their roles. Next, I will examine intensity, dose, and timing of therapy. After that, I need to check person-centered care and goal setting. I will then review assessment, monitoring, and outcome measurement. I should also consider transitions of care, equity and access, and finally synthesize a concise, clinically actionable summary with supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principles that consistently emerge across guidelines and exemplary programs. Organized, coordinated, interprofessional care is repeatedly emphasized as essential to maximize recovery and prevent complications, and this must be embedded from acute care through post-acute and community settings to sustain continuity and quality across the continuum [^111C33Kw] [^114PdqcN] [^113bQFx6]. I should also confirm that stroke rehabilitation is framed within the ICF model, targeting body functions, activities, and participation to optimize function, independence, and community reintegration, which aligns with contemporary policy statements and guideline frameworks [^114E2TyE] [^1156RjuZ]. Hold on, I should verify the role of administration and system support; exemplary programs consistently show that administrative leadership, resources, and quality infrastructure are necessary to sustain high-quality, person-centered rehabilitation delivery [^113GAUK7] [^114XYR3A].

> Next, I should review the core components of the interdisciplinary team and their responsibilities. The team typically includes physiatry or rehabilitation medicine physicians, rehabilitation nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, psychology or neuropsychology, social work, nutrition, and recreation therapy, with the patient and family as central team members; this composition is consistently recommended across AHA/ASA guidance and is reflected in exemplary program staffing models [^111C33Kw] [^116bQ8gf]. Wait, let me verify the role of navigation and care coordination; in resource-variable settings, dedicated navigators or embedded coordination roles can be critical to connect services and sustain longitudinal follow-up, a feature highlighted in both policy statements and pragmatic trials of transitional care [^114E2TyE] [^114miWfx].

> I will now examine intensity, dose, and timing, since these are pivotal levers of outcome. Early initiation of rehabilitation is recommended once medically stable, but very early mobilization within 24 hours may worsen outcomes and should be avoided; instead, structured rehabilitation beginning after 24 hours and intensified in the subacute window is supported by guidelines and trials [^117UBg2k] [^114gqTiq]. Let me double-check dose targets: for inpatient rehabilitation facilities, at least 3 hours per day, 5 days per week of multidisciplinary therapy is standard, while post-discharge programs commonly deliver 2–3 visits per week for 8–12 weeks, with flexibility to extend based on goals and tolerance; higher-intensity, task-specific training shows larger gains, and vigorous walking training outperforms moderate intensity for walking capacity over 12 weeks in chronic stroke [^114VfmoQ] [^114zyaFZ] [^111DUBtZ] [^115L15aF]. Hold on, I should verify the principle of task specificity; structured, task-oriented practice with high repetitions is consistently associated with better motor outcomes than non-task-focused approaches, reinforcing the need to prioritize functional, goal-directed training [^114i5Aum].

> Let me consider person-centered care and individualized goal setting, because adherence and meaningful gains hinge on alignment with patient values. Exemplary programs emphasize learning about the person's life circumstances, relationships, and valued activities, and they build therapeutic alliances characterized by trust and respect; this relational dimension is repeatedly cited by patients and caregivers as essential to engagement and recovery [^113GAUK7] [^1165hTtM]. I should confirm that goal setting is iterative and co-created, with explicit links to self-management and education that incorporate health literacy and adult learning principles to sustain practice beyond supervised sessions [^1133i8Fw] [^116nNVam].

> Next, I should review assessment, monitoring, and outcome measurement to ensure quality and track progress. Comprehensive functional assessments of ADLs, IADLs, communication, mobility, cognition, mood, and swallowing should occur before discharge and be repeated longitudinally, with standardized tools to quantify severity and guide care transitions; balance and gait speed are particularly useful for safety counseling and planning [^113dFEuc]. Wait, I need to check performance measures; the AHA/ASA-endorsed 13 performance measures operationalize guideline processes across settings, and routine outcome measurement at 90 days is a reasonable standard for tracking functional recovery and quality indicators [^111UUatq] [^1112NVDZ]. I should also confirm that outcome selection spans impairment, activity, and participation domains to reflect what matters to patients and clinicians, aligning with COMET and SRRR recommendations [^115VUmB9].

> I will now examine transitions of care and community integration, where many patients lose momentum. Early supported discharge and structured transitional care models can reduce length of stay and improve functional outcomes when delivered by specialized teams with home-based components; however, evidence quality varies and recent pragmatic work emphasizes the value of navigation, home environment modification, and extended follow-up to address barriers and sustain participation [^113bQFx6] [^114tT9Es] [^112YTYmk]. Hold on, I should verify the role of tele-rehabilitation; umbrella reviews suggest tele-rehabilitation can improve balance and ADLs, offering a viable strategy to extend access, particularly in rural or constrained settings, though implementation must address workflow and technology barriers [^1166B6Rh] [^113tYPae].

> But wait, what about equity, access, and system-level barriers that shape who gets rehabilitation and how much they receive. Policy statements consistently highlight disparities by race and ethnicity, geography, insurance status, and socioeconomic position, and they call for evidence-based policies, standardized performance measures, and surveillance to close gaps and ensure that access is driven by need rather than payer constraints [^112wfVBR] [^117D2end]. I should double-check utilization data; outpatient rehabilitation remains underused, with only about one-third of eligible survivors participating, underscoring the need for system-level interventions to improve referral, authorization, and retention [^113xrX3c].

> Let me synthesize the key elements succinctly while preserving the evidentiary anchors. Effective stroke rehabilitation is organized, coordinated, and interprofessional across the continuum; it delivers task-specific, adequately dosed therapy initiated early but not too early, with intensity matched to tolerance and goals; it is person-centered and relationship-based, with iterative goal setting and self-management support; it uses standardized assessments and outcomes to guide care and quality improvement; it prioritizes safe transitions with navigation and home integration; and it is sustained by administrative support, equitable access policies, and continuous quality improvement aligned with guideline-based performance measures [^111C33Kw] [^113bQFx6] [^113GAUK7] [^111UUatq] [^114E2TyE].

> Finally, I should confirm practical takeaways that clinicians can implement now. Ensure multidisciplinary team involvement early, target at least 3 hours per day in IRF settings and 2–3 visits per week for 8–12 weeks post-discharge when feasible, escalate to higher-intensity task-specific training when safe, embed patient and caregiver education with explicit home programs, screen and treat mood and cognitive barriers proactively, and track functional outcomes at 90 days using standardized measures; where access is limited, leverage tele-rehabilitation and navigator models to maintain continuity and dose [^114VfmoQ] [^114zyaFZ] [^114i5Aum] [^1166B6Rh] [^1112NVDZ].

A stroke rehabilitation program should be **multidisciplinary and coordinated** [^111C33Kw], with early initiation [^114gqTiq] and sufficient intensity [^115L15aF] to maximize recovery. It must be **individualized to patient goals** [^114i5Aum] and include assessment across motor, cognitive, communication, and psychological domains [^113dFEuc], with ongoing monitoring and adjustment [^115tbr1E]. Key elements include physical and occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, psychological support, and caregiver training [^111C33Kw], with seamless transitions and access to community resources to support long-term independence and quality of life [^114E2TyE].

---

## Multidisciplinary team and coordination

- **Interdisciplinary team**: Stroke rehabilitation requires a coordinated team including physiatrists, physical and occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, nurses, social workers, and caregivers [^111C33Kw].

- **Team coordination**: Regular team meetings and shared care plans ensure consistent, patient-centered care and prevent fragmented services [^111C33Kw] [^114VfmoQ].

- **Caregiver involvement**: Caregivers are integral to the team, providing support and participating in training and decision-making [^114rAbjN] [^113cf9b4].

---

## Early initiation and intensity of rehabilitation

- **Early initiation**: Rehabilitation should begin as soon as the patient is medically stable, ideally within 24–48 hours [^114Tm58B] [^111V2DKy].

- **Intensity and duration**: High-intensity, task-specific therapy (e.g. 2–3 hours/day, 5–7 days/week) [^114VfmoQ] for at least 4–12 weeks is recommended to optimize outcomes [^115L15aF].

- **Task-specific training**: Emphasis on functional, task-oriented practice to promote neuroplasticity and real-world recovery [^114i5Aum] [^113uiVVJ].

---

## Individualized patient-centered care

- **Personalized goals**: Care plans are tailored to patient preferences, functional status, and social context [^113dFEuc] [^1165hTtM].

- **Patient engagement**: Active participation and self-management are encouraged to enhance adherence and outcomes [^116nNVam] [^115GHz2z].

- **Flexibility**: Programs adapt to patient needs, progress, and changing circumstances [^1165hTtM].

---

## Comprehensive assessment and outcome measurement

- **Initial assessment**: Structured evaluation of motor, cognitive, communication, psychological, and social domains [^113dFEuc].

- **Standardized tools**: Use of validated measures (e.g. FIM, Barthel Index, MoCA, PHQ-9) to track progress and guide care [^113dFEuc] [^1159BUtD].

- **Regular reassessment**: Ongoing monitoring to adjust goals and interventions [^115tbr1E].

Objective

The objective of this study was to identify essential aspects of exemplary post-discharge stroke rehabilitation as perceived by patients, care partners, rehabilitation providers, and administrators.

Design

We carried out an exploratory qualitative, multiple case study. Stroke network representatives from four regions of the province of Ontario, Canada each nominated one post-discharge rehabilitation program they felt was exemplary.

Setting

The programs included: a mixed home- and clinic-based service; a home-based service; a clinic-based service with a stroke community navigator and; an out-patient clinic-based service.

Participants

Participants included 32 patients, 16 of their care partners, 23 providers, and 5 administrators.

Methods

We carried out semi-structured qualitative interviews with patients and care partners, focus groups with providers, and semi-structured interviews with administrators. Health records of patient participants were reviewed. Using an interpretivist-informed inductive content analysis, we developed overarching categories and subcategories first for each program and then across programs.

Results

Across four regions with differing types of programs, exemplary care was characterized by three essential components: stroke and stroke rehabilitation knowledge, relationship built through personalized respectful care, and a commitment to high quality, person-centered care.

Conclusion

Exemplary post-discharge care included knowledge regarding identification and treatment of stroke-related impairment, that is, information found in best practice guidelines. However, expertise related to building relationship through providing personalized respectful care, within a mutually supportive, improvement-oriented team was also essential. Additionally, administrators played a crucial role in ensuring continued ability to deliver exemplary care.

### Exemplary post-discharge stroke rehabilitation programs: a multiple case study [^114XYR3A]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Our case study of four exemplary post-discharge stroke rehabilitation programs identified essential aspects of such care. Each program took provincial guidelines as a starting point and applied these to provide services relevant to regional resources and needs. While team members used knowledge related to assessment and treatment of stroke impairment, they also demonstrated expertise in relational care. Importantly, their work as a committed, connected team was supported by administration. These three aspects, stroke knowledge, relationship built through respectful personalized care, and commitment to high quality person-centered care, appear essential to exemplary post-discharge stroke rehabilitation.

Clinical messages

Exemplary post-discharge stroke rehabilitation can be characterized by stroke and stroke rehabilitation knowledge, relationship built through personalized respectful care, and a commitment to high-quality, person-centered care.
The knowledge and skills required to provide exemplary post-discharge stroke rehabilitation go beyond an understanding of evaluation and intervention considerations in current best practice guidelines.
Administrative support is essential to the development and maintenance of exemplary post-discharge rehabilitation programs.

Introduction

Approximately half of people hospitalized due to stroke could benefit from rehabilitation following discharge to address continuing issues with daily life and social roles. While the processes of in-patient stroke rehabilitation have been well documented, post-discharge or community-based stroke rehabilitation has been the subject of less study. Post-discharge stroke rehabilitation differs from in-patient care in that it occurs in a variety of settings, including outpatient clinics and patient homes. As well, when funding limits are not an issue, there is often no clear marker for when service should end. Given that both features raise additional possibilities and considerations for care, greater understanding of post-discharge stroke rehabilitation is warranted.

The Canadian best practice guidelines state that post-discharge stroke rehabilitation should be as similar as possible to in-patient rehabilitation. However, for several reasons, it may not be feasible for post-discharge stroke rehabilitation to mirror in-patient care, particularly in terms of intensity. First, patient factors may limit such application. For example, a patient may be too fatigued to manage intensive programming. Second, modifications may be required for demographic reasons. For example, a region may not have adequate numbers of therapists to deliver intensive therapy. Third, when the focus is on intensity, therapy resources may be exhausted before meaningful, sustainable participation outcomes are attained. Patients may feel abandoned when care ceases before they are able to re-engage in valued activities and social roles. Examination of a variety of post-discharge stroke rehabilitation programs perceived as exemplary could help identify features essential to such care that cut across patients and settings, while clarifying features that may differ from in-patient rehabilitation.

In Canada, stroke care is part of the publicly funded healthcare system that ensures access to physician services and in-patient hospital care. Provision of healthcare is a provincial responsibility, and public access to post-discharge rehabilitation varies from province to province. In the province of Ontario, process and funding directives framed as Quality Based Procedures guide stroke care. These recommendations represent the provincial interpretation of stroke best practice guidelines and other evidence, with directives outlining the amount of therapy to be provided. This helps ensure that, in the face of funding constraints, most patients receive a reasonable amount of service.

Within the Quality Based Procedures, standards for post-discharge rehabilitation are described under sections entitled General Rehabilitation and Core Team Recommended Practices. These sections characterize ideal post-discharge rehabilitation as services that remediate deficits, begin as soon as possible after hospital discharge, and are provided by a specialized team, ideally in a centralized location. Regardless of location, providers are directed to offer, on average, 2–3 visits per week over 8–12 weeks.

Recommendations for local application of Quality Based Procedures are made by 11 regional stroke networks, who take into consideration unique regional needs. Post-discharge rehabilitation services are designed and provided through regional home care programs and hospitals. This results in varied programs that aim to deliver best practice within local contexts. The objective of this study was to identify essential aspects of exemplary post-discharge stroke rehabilitation as perceived by patients, care partners, rehabilitation providers, and administrators through a close examination of exemplary post-discharge rehabilitation programs across four distinct regions of Ontario, Canada.

Discussion

Across four geographically distinct regions, each with different resources, three categories of common core features of exemplary post-discharge rehabilitation were apparent: stroke and stroke rehabilitation knowledge, relationship built through respectful personalized care, and commitment to high-quality person-centered care. The first category, stroke and stroke rehabilitation knowledge, encompassed information regarding assessments, information considered within stroke rehabilitation guidelines. However, this feature also included knowledge and skill related to how specific impairments affected daily function and what patients could do to improve daily function given these issues. As well, it encompassed skill regarding how this information could be best shared with patients. In this way, principles of adult learningand health literacywere incorporated.

Also essential to stroke and stroke rehabilitation knowledge was understanding of navigation. This included objective knowledge, such as details regarding the local community, and interpersonal and organizational skills required to obtain and coordinate these services. There have been calls to add stroke community navigators to services for patients following hospital discharge. Our results indicate that navigation can be done effectively by all team members provided that they have the requisite knowledge, skills, and support. However, in areas where low therapist concentration precludes inclusion of navigation in therapists' roles, a dedicated stroke community navigator may be essential.

Results

Programs and Contexts

Characteristics of the regions from which programs were selected are outlined in Table 1. The regions demonstrated variability in urban/rural mix, age distribution, and proportion of rehabilitation providers by population. The programs included a clinic-based program (Program D), a home-based program (Program A), and two programs with a mix of both clinic and home visits (Programs B and C). Service provision varied, but typically included occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, social work, and rehabilitation assistance. Program C had a unique provider model that included a Stroke Community Navigator. In this program, an occupational therapist and a physiotherapist were contracted part-time; they assessed patients and provided advice regarding individual programming that was carried out by rehabilitation assistants.

Exemplary Care

Exemplary care was characterized by three essential components. These were: stroke and stroke rehabilitation knowledge, relationship built through respectful personalized care, and commitment to high quality person-centered care (Figure 1). These components are described below with illustrating quotes from patient, care partners, provider, and administrator participants. Patients and care partners are identified by pseudonyms.

### Exemplary post-discharge stroke rehabilitation programs: a multiple case study [^1165hTtM]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Application of an ethics of carelens allowed us to uncover essential features of exemplary post-discharge stroke rehabilitation that went beyond biomedical considerations. Such features related to personalized care and included flexibility regarding the timing of intervention, learning about the person, their life circumstances, relationships, and the activities they hoped to return to. Provision of personalized care required timing and intensity that differed from in-patient care, particularly so that care could be stretched out to allow important goals to be addressed.

In addition, personalized care was characterized by friendliness. Friendliness may seem an inappropriate term to describe a patient-provider relationship. However, patients saw providers as similar to good friends; they seemed to like and be interested in each patient, could be trusted by them, and were a source of valued support. Increasingly, the ability to provide respectful personalized care, and to build and maintain a therapeutic alliance, is recognized as essential to effective rehabilitation. Our study added support to emerging findings regarding the importance of person-centered care in neurorehabilitation. There have been increasing calls to better characterize what such care looks like in practice. Terry and Kayes, looking across patient and provider qualitative data from three studies, identified four essential features: focusing on patients' experience and needs given the difficult new reality of living with the effects of stroke; relational care as the basis of therapy and; supportive promotion of autonomy. Terry and Kayes noted that these features were put into practice despite restrictions within the systems practitioners were working. While it may be possible to introduce such care without administrative support, sustainability may be difficult. Through the inclusion of administrators among our participants, our study adds to existing knowledge by identifying their essential role in the provision of exemplary post-discharge rehabilitation. As well as championing and supporting personalized care, administrators provided real or virtual space for meeting and tools and processes to maintain communication between team members. They were open to team concerns and expected that team members would build and improve the service. Their expectations and support reinforced the teams' identities as skilled professionals committed to their patients and dedicated to continuous refinement of the program.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^111C33Kw]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this guideline is to provide a synopsis of best clinical practices in the rehabilitative care of adults recovering from stroke.

Methods

Writing group members were nominated by the committee chair on the basis of their previous work in relevant topic areas and were approved by the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke Council's Scientific Statement Oversight Committee and the AHA's Manuscript Oversight Committee. The panel reviewed relevant articles on adults using computerized searches of the medical literature through 2014. The evidence is organized within the context of the AHA framework and is classified according to the joint AHA/American College of Cardiology and supplementary AHA methods of classifying the level of certainty and the class and level of evidence. The document underwent extensive AHA internal and external peer review, Stroke Council Leadership review, and Scientific Statements Oversight Committee review before consideration and approval by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee.

Results

Stroke rehabilitation requires a sustained and coordinated effort from a large team, including the patient and his or her goals, family and friends, other caregivers (eg, personal care attendants), physicians, nurses, physical and occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, recreation therapists, psychologists, nutritionists, social workers, and others. Communication and coordination among these team members are paramount in maximizing the effectiveness and efficiency of rehabilitation and underlie this entire guideline. Without communication and coordination, isolated efforts to rehabilitate the stroke survivor are unlikely to achieve their full potential.

Conclusions

As systems of care evolve in response to healthcare reform efforts, postacute care and rehabilitation are often considered a costly area of care to be trimmed but without recognition of their clinical impact and ability to reduce the risk of downstream medical morbidity resulting from immobility, depression, loss of autonomy, and reduced functional independence. The provision of comprehensive rehabilitation programs with adequate resources, dose, and duration is an essential aspect of stroke care and should be a priority in these redesign efforts.

### Improving access to stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a policy statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^114E2TyE]. Stroke (2025). High credibility.

Creation of evidence-based policies to improve access, equity, effectiveness, and efficiency of postacute care (PAC) — policy and program focus: "Access to effective PAC as a means of stroke recovery is under threat", and prior to this statement "the AHA/ASA has not taken an advocacy approach to address these issues". Programmatically, "rehabilitation program goals should remain focused on all domains of the ICF framework, entailing the optimization of function and independence, facilitation of recovery, return to community living, prevention of secondary complications, and reduction in health and financial caregiver burden". To meet these aims, "health systems and policymakers must work collaboratively to enhance the quality, delivery, and effectiveness of PAC in the United States". The document notes that "Table 1 summarizes the relevant major recommendations of the 2016 AHA/ASA Guidelines for Adult Stroke Rehabilitation and Recovery", and that evidence since then has "supported early screening and comprehensive treatment of stroke-related mental health disorders, the need for early initiation of vocational rehabilitation (to promote early return to work), and greater emphasis of postacute care navigators and coordinators to facilitate safe and efficient transitions".

### Primary care of adult patients after stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^115tbr1E]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Poststroke physical rehabilitation in primary care — algorithm for screening and management specifies foundational steps and branching actions: Education about stroke (Class 1 recommendation), Advice and support for individually tailored recreational exercise program (Class 1 recommendation), and Advice to participate in balance training to reduce falls (Class 1 recommendation), followed by ASSESSMENT OF FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENTS (Class I or IIa Recommendations). If Rehabilitation potential has been achieved, proceed to Periodic reassessment; if not, Refer for therapy to address specific needs. This assessment determines the need for rehabilitation services, is initiated during admission and repeated in the office setting, and capabilities and needs for rehabilitation can change over time and across the continuum of stroke recovery. Three questions can be helpful in this assessment: (1) What could the patient do before the stroke that they cannot do now? (2) What does the patient want to be able to do? (3) Has the patient reached full potential?

### Comprehensive stroke care and outcomes: time for a paradigm shift [^111CfrDc]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Worldwide, stroke is prevalent, costly, and disabling in > 80 million survivors. The burden of stroke is increasing despite incredible progress and advancements in evidence-based acute care therapies and despite the substantial changes being made in acute care stroke systems, processes, and quality metrics. Although there has been increased global emphasis on the importance of postacute stroke care, stroke system changes have not expanded to include postacute care and outcome follow-up. Our objectives are to describe the gaps and challenges in postacute stroke care and suboptimal stroke outcomes; to report on stroke survivors' and caregivers' perceptions of current postacute stroke care and their call for improvements in follow-up services for recovery and secondary prevention; and, ultimately, to make the case that a paradigm shift is needed in the definition of comprehensive stroke care and the designation of Comprehensive Stroke Center. Three recommendations are made for a paradigm shift in comprehensive stroke care: (1) criteria should be established for designation of rehabilitation readiness for Comprehensive Stroke Centers, (2) The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association implement an expanded Get With The Guidelines-Stroke program and criteria for comprehensive stroke centers to be inclusive of rehabilitation readiness and measure outcomes at 90 days, and (3) a public health campaign should be launched to offer hopeful and actionable messaging for secondary prevention and recovery of function and health. Now is the time to honor the patients' and caregivers' strongest ask: better access and improved secondary prevention, stroke rehabilitation, and personalized care.

### Post stroke exercise training: intensity, dosage, and timing of therapy [^114gqTiq]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

More intense, earlier exercise in rehabilitation results in improved motor outcomes following stroke. Timing and intensity of therapy delivery vary from study to study. For more intensive therapies, there are practical challenges in implementation. However, there are also opportunities for high intensity treatment through innovative approaches and new technologies. Timing of rehabilitation is important. As time post stroke increases, the dosage of therapy required to improve motor recovery outcomes increases. Very early rehabilitation may improve motor outcomes but should be delayed for at least 24 hours post stroke.

### American Heart Association standards for postacute stroke rehabilitation care [^1117x56M]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based rehabilitation and secondary prevention interventions improve poststroke functional recovery and reduce secondary complications. However, stroke rehabilitation expertise, processes of care, and educational resources vary among sites where postacute care (PAC) is delivered. The American Heart Association developed quality standards based on the American Heart Association 2016 Guidelines for Adult Stroke Rehabilitation and Recovery to address these gaps. An interdisciplinary PAC standards writing committee identified key areas for PAC: quality improvement, medical management, care coordination, patient/caregiver and personnel education, and program management. Subgroups developed draft standards, combining results from a national landscape survey of PAC sites with clinical practice guidelines. The committee then refined the draft standards using a consensus-based process. American Heart Association staff and PAC sites in Montana convened a learning collaborative to gather feedback and provide gap analyses of the standards relative to current practices. Qualitative input from beta testing in Montana and quantitative results from the nationwide survey and Montana sites were analyzed and used to refine the standards further. The national landscape survey demonstrated that most sites do not meet the proposed standards: stroke program oversight structure (78% fall short), stroke rehabilitation leadership (70%), stroke-specific order sets/protocols (61%), and policies requiring staff stroke education (66%). Regarding Montana findings, 41% of the PAC sites have no mechanisms to identify areas of quality improvement specific to their stroke rehabilitation programs, and 59% do not use standardized tools to ensure that performance improvement initiatives are followed. However, with adequate support and resources, most Montana sites stated that they would be able to meet the proposed standards. We conclude that the Stroke PAC Quality Standards are applicable in PAC settings and provide a pathway to improving access to high-quality care for stroke survivors. Outcome studies are needed to confirm anticipated improvements in medical and functional outcomes.

### Improving access to stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a policy statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^1169Jfef]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Stroke rehabilitation is an integral component of comprehensive stroke care. Inequities in access to stroke rehabilitation can further widen the disability gap and disproportionately affect underinsured patients, patients living in rural areas, and patients from underrepresented races and ethnicities. However, even insured patients face obstacles to receiving stroke rehabilitation. The prior authorization process, peer-to-peer reviews, and subsequent appeals to health care insurers for the provision of postacute rehabilitation increase length of the acute care stay, placing pressure on health systems to expedite the transition of care, to the detriment of appropriate postacute rehabilitation placement. This policy statement focuses on (1) the provision of quality stroke rehabilitation to prevent complications, facilitate recovery, and limit disability, (2) the creation of evidence-based policies to improve equitable access, effectiveness, and efficiency of postacute care, (3) the development and use of performance measures that are aligned with the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Guidelines for Adult Stroke Rehabilitation and Recovery to incentivize optimal patient care, and (4) identification of research priorities targeted to improve stroke rehabilitation access. This policy statement is a call for positive and sustained action. Stroke rehabilitation is the lifeline of hope for survivors, their caregivers, and their communities in the days, months, and years after stroke. It is imperative that governments and other funding agencies balance the support needed for acute stroke and stroke rehabilitation treatment, and that organizations, including the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association-an unrelenting advocate for improved brain health-advance the importance of stroke rehabilitation throughout the continuum of care.

### Movement matters, and so does context: lessons learned from multisite implementation of the movement matters activity program for stroke in the comprehensive postacute stroke services study [^116tZ3Ta]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this Special Communication is to discuss the rationale and design of the Movement Matters Activity Program for Stroke (MMAP) and explore implementation successes and challenges in home health and outpatient therapy practices across the stroke belt state of North Carolina. MMAP is an interventional component of the Comprehensive Postacute Stroke Services Study, a randomized multicenter pragmatic trial of stroke transitional care. MMAP was designed to maximize survivor health, recovery, and functional independence in the community and to promote evidence-based rehabilitative care. MMAP provided training, tools, and resources to enable rehabilitation providers to (1) prescribe physical activity and exercise according to evidence-based guidelines and programs, (2) match service setting and parameters with survivor function and benefit coverage, and (3) align treatment with quality metric reporting to demonstrate value-based care. MMAP implementation strategies were aligned with the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change project, and MMAP site champion and facilitator survey feedback were thematically organized into the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research domains. MMAP implementation was challenging, required modification and was affected by provider- and system-level factors. Program and study participation were limited and affected by practice priorities, productivity standards, and stroke patient volume. Sites with successful implementation appeared to have empowered MMAP champions in vertically integrated systems that embraced innovation. Findings from this broad evaluation can serve as a road map for the design and implementation of other comprehensive, complex interventions that aim to bridge the currently disconnected realms of acute care, postacute care, and community resources.

### Gaps in guidelines on long-term management strategies for post-stroke dysphagia [^114aUyuN]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Research Priorities and Future Directions

To bridge these gaps, future research must prioritize structured long‐term follow‐up protocols, focusing on key unanswered questions: What is the optimal frequency and modality of dysphagia reassessment? Which rehabilitation approaches are most effective for sustained recovery, and how do their effects and potential side effects vary between acute and post‐acute settings? Which patient subgroups derive the greatest benefit from extended rehabilitation? How do emerging interventions — such as neurostimulation or pharmacological therapies — translate into meaningful, long‐term clinical improvements? The lack of large‐scale, prospective trials in these areas limits the ability to formulate standardized recommendations.

A structured, multidisciplinary approach — integrating stroke physicians, nurses, speech‐language pathologists, nutrition, and rehabilitation specialists — could enhance long‐term outcomes by ensuring ongoing reassessment and individualized rehabilitation. Future clinical trials should explore the comparative effectiveness of different rehabilitation strategies and validate structured follow‐up protocols. By addressing these research priorities, the field can move toward a more comprehensive and standardized approach to PSD management beyond the acute phase.

### Improving access to stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a policy statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^112wfVBR]. Stroke (2025). High credibility.

American Heart Association/American Stroke Association policy on stroke rehabilitation access emphasizes that access to postacute rehabilitation is often discordant with clinical standards and patient and family/caregiver needs, and that geographic, racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities contribute to poor outcomes. Policy development is hampered by the lack of high-quality comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness studies, with an urgent need for contemporary population-based studies. Thirteen performance measures have been developed for the AHA/ASA Guidelines for Adult Stroke Rehabilitation and Recovery to assess implementation and quality improvement; these measures should lead to benchmarks and recovery targets and could be used as a basis for implementing value-based health care as applied to other cardiovascular conditions, though concerns remain about risk adjustment using administrative data sources. The statement underscores that the emotional and mental health of patients and caregivers is an essential component of recovery, noting that depression, anxiety, pain, and loneliness impede participation in rehabilitation and compliance with secondary stroke prevention, and that clinician networks and insurance coverage are often limited and need to be addressed. It states that patients with stroke must receive appropriate care and intensity of rehabilitation by an interdisciplinary team in the right setting based on individual patient needs and not driven by health insurance limitations, managed care organization coverage policy, or financial incentives that benefit health systems.

### Outcome measures in post-stroke arm rehabilitation trials: do existing measures capture outcomes that are important to stroke survivors, carers, and clinicians? [^115VUmB9]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

There is a need for consensus on measure use in post-stroke arm rehabilitation trials. The Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) initiative, provides guidance on development of consensus recommendations, highlighting the importance of targeting outcomes that are important and relevant to patients and clinicians.

Considering the views of stroke survivors, clinicians and researchers, the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Common Data Elementrecommends items for inclusion as part of standardized data collection across all stroke trials, and the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement recommends measures for standardized data collection in stroke clinical practice. Other recommendations exist for general stroke outcomes and reflect physicians' opinions on important outcomes according to the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health framework.

The Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Round Table, consisting of researchers and clinicians, has generated consensus recommendations for core data collection across sensorimotor stroke rehabilitation trials, including a recommendation to use the Action Research Arm Test for measurement of arm activity limitation across trials. In addition, work has been completed to describe the psychometric properties of 53 available arm measuresin order to inform selection. However, due to the wide-ranging impact of stroke on people's lives, arm-specific measures are unlikely to capture all important outcomes.

To date, there is no clear consensus recommendation for the selection of measures in post-stroke arm rehabilitation randomized trials. Furthermore, there is a lack of information about which outcomes are most meaningful to stroke survivors, carers and clinicians. With a view to inform recommendations for selecting measures in future trials, we sought to investigate (1) existing measures used in post-stroke arm rehabilitation research studies, (2) outcomes important to stroke survivors, their carers and practising clinicians and (3) where important outcomes are captured by existing measures.

### A systematic review of the effectiveness of stroke self-management programs for improving function and participation outcomes: self-management programs for stroke survivors [^116nNVam]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

A systematic review of stroke self-management programs was conducted to: (i) identify how many and what self-management support strategies were included in stroke self-management interventions and (ii) describe whether self-management programs effectively improved outcomes, focusing specifically on function and participation outcomes.

Methods

Twelve databases were searched for the years 1986–2012 to identify self-management programs for stroke survivors. Pre-post, quasi-experimental and randomized controlled trial study designs were included. Descriptive information about the intervention was scrutinized to identify what self-management support strategies were present in the intervention and comparisons were made between programs using a group versus a one-to-one format. All outcomes were included and categorized.

Results

The most prominent strategies identified in our review were goal setting and follow-up, and an individualized approach using structured information and professional support. There are indications that self-management programs can significantly increase participation and functional ability. However, the high level of clinical heterogeneity in program delivery, outcomes and level of stroke severity made it impossible to conduct a meta-analysis. Further examination of individual self-management support strategies, such as linking rehabilitation goal setting to post-acute self-management programs, the inclusion of family members and the contribution of peer-support is warranted.

Implications For Rehabilitation

Self-management programs for stroke survivors. Linking post-acute self-management programs to rehabilitation goal setting could improve outcomes. Involving family members in self-management programs may benefit stroke survivors.

Organization of poststroke rehabilitation care — It is recommended that stroke patients who are candidates for postacute rehabilitation receive organized, coordinated, interprofessional care. It is recommended that stroke survivors who qualify for and have access to IRF care receive treatment in an IRF in preference to a SNF. Organized community-based and coordinated interprofessional rehabilitation care is recommended in the outpatient or home-based settings. ESD services may be reasonable for people with mild to moderate disability.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^112qjXrK]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

Organization of poststroke rehabilitation care (levels of care) emphasizes the role and heterogeneity of services: Rehabilitation services are the primary mechanism by which functional recovery and the achievement of independence are promoted in patients with acute stroke. The array of rehabilitation services delivered to stroke patients in the United States is broad and highly heterogeneous, varying in the type of care settings used; in the duration, intensity, and type of interventions delivered; and in the degree of involvement of specific medical, nursing, and other rehabilitation specialists. The nature and organization of rehabilitation stroke services in the United States have changed considerably over time in response to various forces, including the increasing integration of hospital and outpatient care delivery systems (at both local and regional levels), the organization of medical and other specialty rehabilitation groups, and repeated changes to the federal reimbursement fee structure (specifically, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services).

### Clinical practice recommendations for management of lateropulsion after stroke determined by a Delphi expert panel [^115jSDjn]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Procedures

The Delphi Process consisted of four online survey rounds conducted in English via the Qualtrics XM programme. Participants were advised upon recruitment that the process would be ceased after a maximum of four rounds. During an optional introductory video conference meeting (via Zoom) prior to Round One, panellists discussed the potential need for future meetings between rounds. A second meeting was held between the second and third rounds, during which definitions of consensus and management of recommendations relevant to all people after stroke, as opposed to those of particular importance to those with lateropulsion, were discussed and agreed upon.

The Round One survey consisted of 13 open questions designed to establish themes and opinions of panel members regarding elements of rehabilitation of lateropulsion and priorities for discussion:
What term(s) should be used to describe the phenomenon of active pushing of the body across the midline toward the more affected side, or actively resisting weight shift toward the less affected side? (Results of this component of the study are published elsewhere.)
Please outline the most important components of the education about lateropulsion, which should be provided to affected people after stroke and their families/carers.
Does the management of people with post-stroke lateropulsion vary according to assessment findings and/or presence of additional effects of stroke? Yes/No Please outline the factors that determine management strategies, and the ways in which these factors relate to management of the affected person.
Please list the most important elements of rehabilitation for a person with post-stroke lateropulsion.
Is the fear of falling an issue in people with post-stroke lateropulsion? Yes/No If it is an issue, how should this fear be addressed?
Please outline the role of positioning (in bed and in sitting) in the management of lateropulsion.
Which disciplines are essential in an ideal multidisciplinary team managing people with post-stroke lateropulsion, and what are their roles?
What is the optimal 'dose' of therapy for a person with post-stroke lateropulsion? (Please refer to attached – Hayward, Churilov) Please describe strategies that should be used to achieve this dose of therapy.
Does fatigue usually affect performance of people with post-stroke lateropulsion? Yes/No If you believe that fatigue is often a problem, what strategies should be employed to manage fatigue, in rehabilitation of a person with post-stroke lateropulsion?
How long should rehabilitation (inpatient, community and/or outpatient rehabilitation) for a person with post-stroke lateropulsion continue?
Please list the factors that influence the decision to discontinue rehabilitation.
Please outline considerations that should be made and steps that should be undertaken when discharging a person with post-stroke lateropulsion from the inpatient setting to: Home or a private residence; and Residential care.
What do you see as the top three priorities for future research in post-stroke lateropulsion? (Results of this component of the study are published elsewhere.)

### Improving access to stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a policy statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^115wuM1c]. Stroke (2025). High credibility.

American Heart Association/American Stroke Association policy statement — research and public policy priorities to improve access to stroke rehabilitation include to "Increase resources dedicated to health services research of stroke rehabilitation and establish a mechanism to ensure that the research questions addressed directly reflect the practical, day-to-day challenges faced by clinicians, families, and patients who need poststroke rehabilitation" and to "Create an open-access comprehensive surveillance system that collects ongoing data across the full spectrum of stroke type, stroke severity, demographics (eg, age, race, ethnicity, sex), health systems, hospitals, and payer sources to gain greater understanding of the use of rehabilitation and other PAC services, direct and indirect costs, and patient outcomes at the population level". The statement calls to "Conduct health services research to understand how variability in rehabilitation care is influenced by health systems, hospitals, type of insurance, and alternative payment models to optimize patient recovery. There should be no variation in access, quality of rehabilitation care, and patient outcomes across different hospitals, health systems, regions, populations, and care settings" and to "Conduct a comprehensive inventory of the stated coverage policies of all major payers/insurers in the United States to tackle the challenges faced in accessing rehabilitation care, and conduct field surveys of acute hospital discharge planners to determine the type and prevalence of barriers that prevent patients getting access to the recommended level of care, and whether the stated coverage policies of insurers are being implemented as stated". It further prioritizes to "Assess the comparative effectiveness of alternative strategies, preferably with randomized controlled trials, including formal cost-effectiveness studies where feasible" and to "Collect a comprehensive set of patient-reported outcomes measured 90 days, 6 months, and 1 year after the index stroke event for a representative sample of all stroke events" with outcomes including "survival, function, well-being, quality of life, satisfaction, return to home, return to work, return to community and social engagement, and unmet needs". Additional priorities are to "Understand and optimize the care and outcomes of patients with stroke as they transition back to home", "Expand clinical training programs for acute hospital staff, including neurologists, internists, nurses, care coordinators, acute stroke center managers, and social workers", "Research optimal communication within and between health care professionals and postacute rehabilitation settings with better incorporation of CMS outcome measures", "Explore innovative models of care targeted at the hospital system level that optimize acute stroke rehabilitation and recovery", and to "Understand and optimize emotional and mental health status as a key recovery outcome".

### The impact of a patient-directed activity program on functional outcomes and activity participation after stroke during inpatient rehabilitation-a randomized controlled trial [^115yjprM]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Individuals post stroke are inactive, even during rehabilitation, contributing to ongoing disability and risk of secondary health conditions. Our aims were to (1) conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of a "Patient-Directed Activity Program" on functional outcomes in people post stroke during inpatient rehabilitation and (2) examine differences threemonths post inpatient rehabilitation discharge.

Design

Randomized control trial.

Setting

Inpatient rehabilitation facility.

Subjects

Patients admitted to inpatient rehabilitation post stroke.

Interventions

Patient-Directed Activity Program (PDAP) or control (usual care only). Both groups underwent control (threehours of therapy/day), while PDAP participants were prescribed two additional 30-minute activity sessions/day.

Main Measures

Outcomes (Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement Measure, Functional Independence Measure, balance, physical activity, Stroke Impact Scale) were collected at admission and discharge from inpatient rehabilitation and three-month follow-up.

Results

Seventy-three patients (PDAP (n = 37); control (n = 36)) were included in the primary analysis. Patients in PDAP completed a total of 23.1 ± 16.5 sessions (10.7 ± 8.5 upper extremity; 12.4 ± 8.6 lower extremity) during inpatient rehabilitation. No differences were observed between groups at discharge in functional measures. PDAP completed significantly more steps/day (PDAP = 657.70 ± 655.82, control = 396.17 ± 419.65; P = 0.022). The Stroke Impact Scale showed significantly better memory and thinking (PDAP = 86.2 ± 11.4, control = 80.8 ± 16.7; P = 0.049), communication (PDAP = 93.6 ± 8.3, control = 89.6 ± 12.4; P = 0.042), mobility (PDAP = 62.2 ± 22.5, control = 53.8 ± 21.8; P = 0.038), and overall recovery from stroke (PDAP = 62.1 ± 19.1, control = 52.2 ± 18.7; P = 0.038) for PDAP compared to control. At threemonths post discharge, PDAP (n = 11) completed significantly greater physical activity (P = 0.014; 3586.5 ± 3468.5 steps/day) compared to control (n = 10; 1760.9 ± 2346.3 steps/day).

Conclusion

Functional outcome improvement was comparable between groups; however, PDAP participants completed more steps and perceived greater recovery.

### Which road to recovery? factors influencing postacute stroke discharge destinations: a Delphi study [^116weoBd]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

The criteria for determining the level of postacute care for patients with stroke are variable and inconsistent. The purpose of this study was to identify key factors influencing the selection of postacute level of care for these patients.

Methods

We used a collaborative 4-round Delphi process to achieve a refined list of factors influencing postacute level of care selection. Our Delphi panel of experts consisted of 32 panelists including physicians, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, nurses, stroke survivors, administrators, policy experts, and individuals associated with third-party insurance companies.

Results

In round 1, 207 factors were proposed, with subsequent discussion resulting in consolidation into 15 factors for consideration. In round 2, 15 factors were ranked with consensus on 10 factors; in round 3,10 factors were ranked with consensus on 9 factors. In round 4, the final round, 9 factors were rated with Likert scores ranging from 5 (most important) to 1(not important). The percentage of panelists who provided a rating of 4 or above were as follows: likelihood to benefit from an active rehabilitation program (97%), need for clinicians with specialized rehabilitation skills (94%), need for active and ongoing medical management and monitoring (84%), ability to tolerate an active rehabilitation program (74%), need for caregiver training to return to the community (48%), family/caregiver support (39%), likelihood to return to community/home (39%), ability to return to physical home environment (32%), and premorbid dementia (16%).

Conclusions

This study provides an expert, consensus-based set of key factors to be considered when determining where stroke patients are discharged for postacute care. These factors may be useful in developing a decision support tool for use in clinical settings.

Module B: Outpatient/Community-Based Rehabilitation — post-stroke outpatients follow a decision pathway beginning with screening for mood and team resources, then structured rehabilitation and discharge steps. Branch: "Does the patient have depression?" If yes, "Continue or initiate mental health treatment including, psychotherapy, medication, or both (e.g. SSRI, SNRI)". Branch: "Is an interdisciplinary stroke rehabilitation team available?" If yes, "Refer to interdisciplinary stroke rehabilitation team"; if no, "Consult PM&R". Subsequent steps include "Assess the patient… and identify patient's rehabilitation goals", then "Consult appropriate rehabilitation services". Treatment progression assesses, "Has the patient met rehabilitation treatment goals?" If no, "Initiate/continue rehabilitation intervention", then reassess via "Did the patient meet rehabilitation treatment goals or reach plateau?" If no, "Continue treatment and reassesses periodically"; if goals are achieved or a plateau is reached, "Discharge patient from rehabilitation and arrange for primary care, neurology, and specialty care follow-up, as needed".

### Physical rehabilitation approaches for the recovery of function and mobility following stroke [^111DUBtZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Various approaches to physical rehabilitation to improve function and mobility are used after stroke. There is considerable controversy around the relative effectiveness of approaches, and little known about optimal delivery and dose. Some physiotherapists base their treatments on a single approach; others use components from several different approaches.

Objectives

Primary objective: To determine whether physical rehabilitation is effective for recovery of function and mobility in people with stroke, and to assess if any one physical rehabilitation approach is more effective than any other approach.

Secondary Objective

To explore factors that may impact the effectiveness of physical rehabilitation approaches, including time after stroke, geographical location of study, intervention dose/duration, intervention provider, and treatment components. Stakeholder involvement: Key aims were to clarify the focus of the review, inform decisions about subgroup analyses, and co-produce statements relating to key implications.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched the Cochrane Stroke Trials Register (last searched November 2022), CENTRAL (2022, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2022), Embase (1980 to November 2022), AMED (1985 to November 2022), CINAHL (1982 to November 2022), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (to November 2022).

Selection Criteria

Inclusion criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of physical rehabilitation approaches aimed at promoting the recovery of function or mobility in adult participants with a clinical diagnosis of stroke.

Exclusion Criteria

RCTs of upper limb function or single treatment components.

Primary Outcomes

measures of independence in activities of daily living (IADL) and motor function.

Secondary Outcomes

balance, gait velocity, and length of stay.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent authors selected studies according to pre-defined eligibility criteria, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

In this review update, we included 267 studies (21,838 participants). Studies were conducted in 36 countries, with half (133/267) in China. Generally, studies were heterogeneous, and often poorly reported. We judged only 14 studies in meta-analyses as at low risk of bias for all domains and, on average, we considered 33% of studies in analyses of primary outcomes at high risk of bias. Is physical rehabilitation more effective than no (or minimal) physical rehabilitation? Compared to no physical rehabilitation, physical rehabilitation may improve IADL (standardised mean difference (SMD) 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 1.56; 52 studies, 5403 participants; low-certainty evidence) and motor function (SMD 1.01, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.22; 50 studies, 5669 participants; low-certainty evidence). There was evidence of long-term benefits for these outcomes. Physical rehabilitation may improve balance (MD 4.54, 95% CI 1.36 to 7.72; 9 studies, 452 participants; low-certainty evidence) and likely improves gait velocity (SMD 0.23, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.42; 18 studies, 1131 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), but with no evidence of long-term benefits. Is physical rehabilitation more effective than attention control? The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of physical rehabilitation, as compared to attention control, on IADL (SMD 0.91, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.75; 2 studies, 106 participants), motor function (SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.38; 5 studies, 237 participants), and balance (MD 6.61, 95% CI -0.45 to 13.66; 4 studies, 240 participants). Physical rehabilitation likely improves gait speed when compared to attention control (SMD 0.34, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.54; 7 studies, 405 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Does additional physical rehabilitation improve outcomes? Additional physical rehabilitation may improve IADL (SMD 1.26, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.71; 21 studies, 1972 participants; low-certainty evidence) and motor function (SMD 0.69, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.92; 22 studies, 1965 participants; low-certainty evidence). Very few studies assessed these outcomes at long-term follow-up. Additional physical rehabilitation may improve balance (MD 5.74, 95% CI 3.78 to 7.71; 15 studies, 795 participants; low-certainty evidence) and gait velocity (SMD 0.59, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.91; 19 studies, 1004 participants; low-certainty evidence). Very few studies assessed these outcomes at long-term follow-up. Is any one approach to physical rehabilitation more effective than any other approach? Compared to other approaches, those that focus on functional task training may improve IADL (SMD 0.58, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.87; 22 studies, 1535 participants; low-certainty evidence) and motor function (SMD 0.72, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.22; 20 studies, 1671 participants; very low-certainty evidence) but the evidence in the latter is very uncertain. The benefit was sustained long-term. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of functional task training on balance (MD 2.16, 95% CI -0.24 to 4.55) and gait velocity (SMD 0.28, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.56). Compared to other approaches, neurophysiological approaches may be less effective than other approaches in improving IADL (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.06; 14 studies, 737 participants; low-certainty evidence), and there may be no difference in improving motor function (SMD -0.60, 95% CI -1.32 to 0.12; 13 studies, 663 participants; low-certainty evidence), balance (MD -0.60, 95% CI -5.90 to 6.03; 9 studies, 292 participants; low-certainty evidence), and gait velocity (SMD -0.17, 95% CI -0.62 to 0.27; 16 studies, 630 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain about the effect on gait velocity. For all comparisons, the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of physical rehabilitation on adverse events and length of hospital stay.

Authors' Conclusions

Physical rehabilitation, using a mix of different treatment components, likely improves recovery of function and mobility after stroke. Additional physical rehabilitation, delivered as an adjunct to 'usual' rehabilitation, may provide added benefits. Physical rehabilitation approaches that focus on functional task training may be useful. Neurophysiological approaches to physical rehabilitation may be no different from, or less effective than, other physical rehabilitation approaches. Certainty in this evidence is limited due to substantial heterogeneity, with mainly small studies and important differences between study populations and interventions. We feel it is unlikely that any studies published since November 2022 would alter our conclusions. Given the size of this review, future updates warrant consensus discussion amongst stakeholders to ensure the most relevant questions are explored for optimal decision-making.

### Are aerobic programs similar in design to cardiac rehabilitation beneficial for survivors of stroke? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111s1e2s]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Description of Studies

The review identified 19 qualified studies, 33, 35, 36, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58 some with multiple eligible treatment groups, for a total of 23 qualified treatment groups, including 485 participants with treatment group mean ages between 54 (SD, 8.6) and 71 (SD, 7) years. PRISMA process results are presented in Figure 1. Details on the study and treatment group characteristics are provided in Table S1. Only 4 of the 19 qualified studies were performed in the United States; the remaining were performed in Australia (n = 2), Canada (n = 2), Europe (n = 8), Israel (n = 1), Jamaica (n = 1), and Taiwan (n = 1). Frequency, duration, and activity type varied. Frequency of sessions was either 2 or 3 times per week. Session duration varied from 30 to 90 minutes, with the longer sessions including activities in addition to the primary aerobic exercise. Walking (treadmill or over ground) was the most common aerobic exercise performed (47%), followed by stationary cycling (21%), mixed‐mode aerobic exercise (21%), and recumbent stepping (11%). Aerobic activity was performed at various intensities and was either continuous (ie, 1 bout of 30 minutes) or interval (ie, 3 bouts of 10 minutes). Additional activity was included in some studies and was composed of resistance training (21%), flexibility interventions (5%), and education (5%). Participant time since stroke varied (treatment group means from 0.06 [SD, 0.06] to 9.15 [SD, 12.72] years), with 1 study 52 in the acute phase (≤ 30days poststroke), 4 studies 45, 48, 53, 55 in the subacute phase (> 30 days to < 6 months poststroke), 12 studies * in the chronic phase (≥ 6 months poststroke), and 2 studies 56, 57 not reporting time since stroke. The functional level of participants at the start of the studies varied, with all except one study requiring some level of independent ambulation (with or without an assistive device); the exception was a cycling study, the study by Vanroy et al (2017), 55 which required pedaling at 50 revolutions per minute.

### Art skill-based rehabilitation training for upper limb sensorimotor recovery post-stroke: a feasibility study [^1139bqwM]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Interventions which include participants with more severe upper limb deficits frequently require additional support or supervision from a therapist, which is a key barrier in the implementation of supplementary stroke rehabilitation programs. As healthcare professionals face increasing demands of their time, exacerbated by system-based fiscal constraints and patient complexity, trained non-healthcare professionals, or by extension volunteers, are an essential resource to enhance patient support in stroke rehabilitation. In the current study trained, non-healthcare professionals (ART facilitators) were able to safely and effectively deliver a rehabilitation intervention to patients with upper limb impairments and other complicated, co-existing deficits using manually guided assistance when necessary. This is a unique feature of the ART program and this study as there is limited literature evaluating the delivery of additional exercise programs by trained, non-healthcare professionals in stroke rehabilitation. It is worth acknowledging that the effective incorporation of non-healthcare providers or volunteers to extend the reach of clinicians in clinical contexts requires careful consideration due to issues related to patient safety, confidentiality, reliability, role overlap, limited resources, and communication between these individuals and the clinical team. In light of this, future research examining the role of volunteers in the delivery of stroke rehabilitation training, such as ART, is warranted.

Cognitive impairments are a common sequelae of stroke and can greatly affect functional recovery through reduced participation in rehabilitation. Numerous studies have identified that even mild impairments in cognitive faculties (e.g. MoCA < 26) can lead to significantly lower levels of participation in stroke rehabilitation across all activity domains (e.g. low-demand tasks, high-demand tasks, social/educational). Patient characteristics, provider perceptions, practice guidelines, and available treatment options are all variables that may impact the relationship between cognitive impairment and rehabilitation participation. For instance, some rehabilitation programs may not be designed to effectively respond to cognitive impairment, or stroke-affected individuals with cognitive deficits may not be provided the same level of rehabilitation if they are perceived as poor candidates. The ART program was mindfully designed in consideration of individuals with varying neurocognitive post-stroke deficits and we were able to successfully include and engage survivors with mild (e.g. MoCa < 26) and moderate (e.g. MoCA 11–17)cognitive impairment in directed drawing tasks.

American Heart Association/American Stroke Association stroke rehabilitation — exercise prescription after stroke emphasizes early initiation and structured aerobic training with defined frequency, duration, and intensity. Active participation in exercise should be initiated early after stroke and, in contrast to very early mobilization, initiation of aerobic exercise in the subacute period (ie, a mean of 11–78 days after stroke) is safe and effective. For program structure, the frequency of structured aerobic exercise should be at least 3 d/ wk for a minimum of 8 weeks, and the duration of each session should be a minimum of 20 minutes in the training zone in addition to 3- to 5-minute warm-up and cool-down. Intensity is guided by heart rate; resting rate is measured after a minimum of 5 minutes of quiet sitting, and recommended training zones include 40% to 70% of heart rate reserve (maximal heart rate minus resting heart rate) or 50% to 80% of maximal heart rate, with evidence that intensities as low as 30% of heart rate reserve can induce a cardiovascular training effect in extremely unfit individuals.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113dFEuc]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

Adult stroke rehabilitation — assessment of disability and rehabilitation needs recommendations state: It is recommended that all individuals with stroke be provided a formal assessment of their ADLs and IADLs, communication abilities, and functional mobility before discharge from acute care hospitalization and the findings be incorporated into the care transition and the discharge planning process. It is recommended that all individuals with stroke discharged to independent community living from postacute rehabilitation or SNFs receive ADL and IADL assessment directly related to their discharge living setting. A functional assessment by a clinician with expertise in rehabilitation is recommended for patients with an acute stroke with residual functional deficits. Determination of postacute rehabilitation needs should be based on assessments of residual neurological deficits; activity limitations; cognitive, communicative, and psychological status; swallowing ability; determination of previous functional ability and medical comorbidities; level of family/caregiver support; capacity of family/ caregiver to meet the care needs of the stroke survivor; likelihood of returning to community living; and ability to participate in rehabilitation. It is reasonable that individuals with stroke discharged from acute and postacute hospitals/ centers receive formal follow-up on their ADL and IADL status, communication abilities, and functional mobility within 30 days of discharge. The routine administration of standardized measures can be useful to document the severity of stroke and resulting disability, starting in the acute phase and progressing over the course of recovery and rehabilitation. A standardized measure of balance and gait speed (for those who can walk) may be considered for planning postacute rehabilitation care and for safety counseling with the patient and family.

### Effect of a novel transition program on disability after stroke: a trial protocol [^115zh78p]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is a novel enhanced rehabilitation transition program, Community Participation Transition After Stroke (COMPASS), more effective at improving community participation and daily activity performance and reducing environmental barriers among stroke survivors than an equivalent dose of attentional control?

Findings

In this phase 2b, single-blind, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial, 180 adults who have had ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes will be studied as they transition home from inpatient rehabilitation.

Meaning

Removing environmental barriers faced by stroke survivors as they transition home may improve daily activity performance as well as home and community participation.

### Rehabilitation transition program to improve community participation among stroke survivors: a randomized clinical trial [^112YTYmk]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is a rehabilitation transition program more efficacious than attentional control for improving community participation and activity of daily living performance and for reducing environmental barriers in the home and community after stroke?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 185 stroke survivors, both rehabilitation transition program participants and control participants experienced improvements in community participation. Rehabilitation transition program participants had greater improvements in self-rated performance and satisfaction with daily activities and greater reduction in environmental barriers than attentional control participants.

Meaning

A rehabilitation transition program may bridge the gap from inpatient rehabilitation to home by reducing environmental barriers and fostering quicker engagement in activities of daily living to improve stroke survivors' health outcomes.

### Sexual function in post-stroke patients: considerations for rehabilitation [^115HSDqe]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

While the rehabilitation goals of post-stroke patients include improving quality of life and returning to functional activities, the extent to which sexual activity is addressed as part of the standard rehabilitation process is unknown. Moreover, the specific sexual concerns of stroke patients, including the effect of stroke on intimate relationships and sexuality of the partner, the ability to physically engage in sex, and the effect of psychological components such as role identity, depression, and anxiety on sexuality, all warrant examination by rehabilitation professionals.

Aim

The aim of this study is to examine the existing literature on sexuality and stroke patients in order to better understand how the sexual lives of stroke patients and their partners are affected and to provide recommendations to rehabilitation professionals for addressing sexuality as part of treatment.

Methods

Narrative review, PubMed, PEDro, ISI Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases (inception-December 2012) were searched for the key words "stroke", "sexual dysfunction", "sexuality", "quality of life", and their combination. All relevant articles in English and secondary references were reviewed.

Main Outcome Measures

We report the results of the literature review.

Results

Sexual dysfunction and decreased sexual satisfaction are common in the post-stroke population and are related to physical, psychosocial, and relational factors. However, they are not adequately addressed in post-stroke rehabilitation.

Conclusions

As sexual function is an important component to quality of life and activities of daily living, physicians and rehabilitation specialists, including physical, occupational, and speech therapists, should receive training in addressing sexuality in the treatment of post-stroke patients. Sexologists and sex therapists should be an integral part of the rehabilitation team.

### Improving access to stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a policy statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^117D2end]. Stroke (2025). High credibility.

American Heart Association/American Stroke Association policy statement — improving access to stroke rehabilitation and recovery — emphasizes that stroke rehabilitation is an integral component of comprehensive care and that inequities in access can widen the disability gap, disproportionately affecting underinsured patients, rural patients, and patients from underrepresented races and ethnicities. It notes that even insured patients face obstacles, with prior authorization, peer-to-peer reviews, and appeals increasing length of the acute care stay and undermining appropriate postacute placement. The statement focuses on (1) provision of quality stroke rehabilitation, (2) evidence-based policies to improve equitable access, effectiveness, and efficiency of postacute care, (3) development and use of performance measures aligned with AHA/ASA Guidelines to incentivize optimal care, and (4) identification of research priorities; it is a call for positive and sustained action. It adds that systems of care in the United States are inadequate with resulting gaps and inequities, that discharge destination and rehabilitation access "should be driven solely by the stroke survivor's needs" yet studies show factors unrelated to needs or clinical assessment determine access to postacute rehabilitation, and that nonmotor symptoms such as cognitive impairment, aphasia, neglect, depression, and anxiety remain largely unaddressed by the system of care.

Stroke and Stroke Rehabilitation Knowledge

Patients and care partners viewed providers as experts who understood and could explain the physical and emotional aspects of stroke and what could be done to improve function.

[The physiotherapist] was just very knowledgeable and very well rounded. She gave specific exercises to me in my particular level of progression… And she gave good explanations. (Peter, Program D)

Especially appreciated was explanation of stroke-related issues patients could do to address these.

I'll do it to the best that I can, sometimes… until I have — I come to a stop and I meltdown. I do these meltdowns where it's, like, I can't even think (Tina, patient, Program C).

That is an issue, and they've figured that one out too (Jenn, care partner).

Yeah, they've just figured that one out, yeah (Tina).

Finally, patients and care partners appreciated team members' ability to navigate the health care system in efforts to solve complex problems. For example, Martin (patient, Program A) had a complex swallowing problem worsened by a fall. From Martin's health records, it was clear that the speech-language pathologist had spent considerable time skillfully exploring the problem and testing potential solutions, and then helping Martin access medical specialists to diagnose his complex problem so that it could be effectively addressed.

Providers shared their passion for helping patients make sense out of their experiences of stroke and accompanying body changes. They were excited to further develop their knowledge of stroke and stroke rehabilitation. Administrators expected stroke rehabilitation expertise from staff and provided multiple opportunities to maintain and improve knowledge and skills. In addition to using formal sources of education, providers regularly sought out the expertise of other members of their team.

Stroke and stroke rehabilitation expertise formed the background of exemplary care. It consisted of concrete knowledge, expertly shared and applied. The next component, relationship built through respectful personalized care, consisted of more abstract elements.

Relationship Built Through Respectful Personalized Care

Five factors contributed to the building of relationships: friendliness, individualized care, attention to emotions, comprehensive commitment, and consideration of care partners.

### Considerations for developing complex post-stroke upper limb behavioural interventions: an international qualitative study [^116LofNf]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Subtheme 4C. Multidimensional dose

Participants in all groups identified the importance of multiple different dimensions of dose to post-stroke upper limb motor recovery. Participants identified amount of therapy, difficulty of task and intensity of practice as important drivers of post-stroke upper limb motor recovery.

All groups identified the importance of a large amount of practice. Participants in the preclinical research group discussed animal studies demonstrating that large amounts of training were essential for motor skill learning. These participants mentioned repetitions, volume of time in a therapy space, and volume of time on task as potential quantifiable metrics of the amount of an intervention.

Participants in the preclinical research, clinical research and clinical experience groups all identified difficulty as an important consideration of dose. Participants in the preclinical research group emphasised the importance of a task being on the edge of one's capacity. Maintaining optimal difficulty (or challenge point) ensures that the behavioural intervention sufficiently activates and engages the neural circuitry involved in motor recovery. Exercises that stroke survivors could easily complete were considered redundant as they would not engage sufficient neural circuitry to drive recovery.

Make it progressive or regressive… we can't have a fixed point and we probably can't have the same point for everyone. Clinical Research #1

Participants in the preclinical and clinical research groups identified intensity as an important consideration of dose. However, there was no consensus on what was meant by intensity.

Knowledge gaps and future research — Behavior change interventions after stroke: Current gaps include unknown optimal intervention and delivery window, limited long-term outcome evidence for lifestyle interventions, unclear theoretical underpinnings, and insufficient clarity on caregiver roles; future work requires specific design and reporting elements. Current knowledge gaps include that the optimal behavior change intervention to reduce recurrent stroke is unknown, as is the optimal window to deliver such interventions. Multiple systematic reviews identify a gap in evidence for the long-term impact of lifestyle-based behavioral interventions. Many published post-stroke behavioral interventions fail to specify whether a behavior change theory underpinned the intervention, and there is a significant gap regarding the role of family caregivers and dyads. To address these shortfalls, future prospective, multicentered randomized controlled trials are required that specify a behavior change theory, document the time point after stroke for targeted delivery, provide detailed intervention description including frequency, duration, personnel, setting, and skill level/training in behavioral counseling, and collect data permitting disaggregation by sex and other characteristics to identify responders and nonresponders.

### Optimal intensity and duration of walking rehabilitation in patients with chronic stroke: a randomized clinical trial [^115L15aF]. JAMA Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

For walking rehabilitation after stroke, training intensity and duration are critical dosing parameters that lack optimization.

Objective

To assess the optimal training intensity (vigorous vs moderate) and minimum training duration (4, 8, or 12 weeks) needed to maximize immediate improvement in walking capacity in patients with chronic stroke.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter randomized clinical trial using an intent-to-treat analysis was conducted from January 2019 to April 2022 at rehabilitation and exercise research laboratories. Survivors of a single stroke who were aged 40 to 80 years and had persistent walking limitations 6 months or more after the stroke were enrolled.

Interventions

Participants were randomized 1:1 to high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or moderate-intensity aerobic training (MAT), each involving 45 minutes of walking practice 3 times per week for 12 weeks. The HIIT protocol used repeated 30-second bursts of walking at maximum safe speed, alternated with 30- to 60-second rest periods, targeting a mean aerobic intensity above 60% of the heart rate reserve (HRR). The MAT protocol used continuous walking with speed adjusted to maintain an initial target of 40% of the HRR, progressing up to 60% of the HRR as tolerated.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was 6-minute walk test distance. Outcomes were assessed by blinded raters after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of training.

Results

Of 55 participants (mean [SD] age, 63 [10] years; 36 male [65.5%]), 27 were randomized to HIIT and 28 to MAT. The mean (SD) time since stroke was 2.5 (1.3) years, and mean (SD) 6-minute walk test distance at baseline was 239 (132) m. Participants attended 1675 of 1980 planned treatment visits (84.6%) and 197 of 220 planned testing visits (89.5%). No serious adverse events related to study procedures occurred. Groups had similar 6-minute walk test distance changes after 4 weeks (HIIT, 27 m [95% CI, 6–48 m]; MAT, 12 m [95% CI, -9 to 33 m]; mean difference, 15 m [95% CI, -13 to 42 m]; p = 0.28), but HIIT elicited greater gains after 8 weeks (58 m [95% CI, 39–76 m] vs 29 m [95% CI, 9–48 m]; mean difference, 29 m [95% CI, 5–54 m]; p = 0.02) and 12 weeks (71 m [95% CI, 49–94 m] vs 27 m [95% CI, 3–50 m]; mean difference, 44 m [95% CI, 14–74 m]; p = 0.005) of training; HIIT also showed greater improvements than MAT on some secondary measures of gait speed and fatigue.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings show proof of concept that vigorous training intensity is a critical dosing parameter for walking rehabilitation. In patients with chronic stroke, vigorous walking exercise produced significant and meaningful gains in walking capacity with only 4 weeks of training, but at least 12 weeks were needed to maximize immediate gains.

### Effects of a transitional home-based care program for stroke survivors in harbin, China: a randomized controlled trial [^113C5THS]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

China has the biggest stroke burden in the world. Continued measures have been taken to enhance post-stroke rehabilitation management in the last two decades. The weak link is with home-based rehabilitation, with more attention and resources devoted to inpatient rehabilitation.

Objective

to address the service gap, this study tested a home-based transitional care model for stroke survivors.

Methods

a randomized controlled trial was conducted from February 2019 to May 2020 in Harbin, China, involving 116 patients with ischemic stroke. The intervention group participants (n = 58, 50%) received a 12-week home-based care program with components of transitional care measures and the national guidelines for facilitating patients to perform home-based exercises with continued monitoring and gradual progression. Control group participants received standard care including medication advice, rehabilitation exercise and one nurse-initiated follow-up call. Data were collected at baseline and after a 90-day (post-intervention) and a 180-day (post-intervention) follow-up. The primary outcome was quality of life (QOL), measured using the EuroQol-Five Dimension 5-Level scale (EQ-5D-5L).

Results

both intervention and control groups showed improvement in EQ-5D-5L from baseline to post-intervention (0.66 versus 0.83, P < 0.001) and (0.66 versus 0.77, P < 0.001), respectively, and there was significant group-by-time interaction in EuroQol-Visual Analogue Scale from baseline to post-intervention at 90 days and follow-up at 180 days with the intervention group experiencing better improvement. Similarly, significant interaction effects were also found in the Stroke Impact Symptom scale, self-efficacy and modified Barthel Index.

Conclusions

home-based transitional care was effective in improving QOL, symptoms, self-efficacy and activities of daily living.

### Combined cardiorespiratory and resistance training for people with stroke [^115N1Mfj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Levels of physical activity and physical fitness, including both cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength, are often low after stroke and are associated with post-stroke disability. Multicomponent exercise interventions that increase muscle strength and cardiorespiratory fitness could be effective for improving physical function and disability, and for secondary prevention.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review is to determine whether combined cardiorespiratory fitness and resistance training after stroke has any effects on death, disability, adverse events, risk factors, fitness, walking, and indices of physical function when compared to a non-exercise control.

Search Methods

In January 2024, we searched nine databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, WoS, PEDro, and DORIS) and two trial registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP). We also undertook reference checking, citation tracking, and contact with experts in the field, in order to identify eligible studies.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared combined cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength training against usual care, no intervention, or a non-exercise intervention for people with stroke.

Outcomes

Our critical outcome domains were death, disability, adverse events, risk factors, fitness, walking, and indices of physical function. We assessed outcomes at the end of intervention and at the end of follow-up. Our other important outcome domains were indices of quality of life, mood, cognition, and fatigue.

Risk Of Bias

We used the Cochrane tool RoB 1 to assess bias in the included studies.

Synthesis Methods

Where possible, we synthesised results for each outcome at the end of intervention and end of follow-up using random-effects meta-analyses on arm-level data. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk difference (RD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we calculated a mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD), and 95% CI. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for critical outcomes.

Included Studies

We included 30 studies with 1519 participants, who had an average age of 63.7 years. Most studies recruited ambulatory participants (28 of the 30 studies) during the early subacute (14 studies) and chronic (14 studies) stages of recovery. Most studies (26) took place in high-income countries. Most study interventions lacked a balanced dose of control exposure (23 studies). Eleven studies included a follow-up period (mean 7.3 months; range 3 to 12 months). Most interventions combined cardiorespiratory training (usually walking or ergometer-based) and resistance training (weights, machines, bodyweight or elastic resistance) in a circuit-type format. Training occurred two to five days a week for between four weeks and one year.

Synthesis Of Results

Combined training does not increase or decrease deaths at the end of intervention (risk difference RD -0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.01; 26 studies, 1352 participants; high certainty) or end of follow-up (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.02; 8 studies, 531 participants; high certainty). Combined training may improve indices of disability slightly at the end of intervention (standardised mean difference SMD 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.36; 13 studies, 789 participants; low certainty) but has little or no effect at the end of follow-up (SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.28; 8 studies, 614 participants; low certainty). Combined training does not increase or reduce the incidence of secondary cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events at the end of intervention (RD -0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.01; 8 studies, 684 participants; high certainty) or end of follow-up (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.09; 4 studies, 285 participants; high certainty). Combined training may have little or no effect on systolic blood pressure (mmHg) at the end of intervention, but the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference MD -1.83, 95% CI -9.60 to 5.95; 5 studies, 140 participants; very low certainty); there were no follow-up data. Combined training may improve indices of cardiorespiratory fitness and musculoskeletal fitness (lower limb strength), but the evidence is very uncertain. Few data were available at follow-up. Combined training may improve comfortable walking speed (metres per second) at the end of intervention (MD 0.09, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.14; 13 studies, participants not available; very low certainty) but may have little or no effect at the end of follow-up (MD 0.03, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.13; 7 studies, 605 participants; very low certainty), although the evidence is very uncertain for both time points. Combined training may improve balance slightly at the end of intervention (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.39; 16 studies, 839 participants; low certainty) and end of follow-up (SMD 0.24, 95% CI -0.00 to 0.49; 6 studies, 535 participants; low certainty). In terms of acceptability and tolerability, interventions were closely adhered to, with no pattern of concerning adverse effects or participant losses attributable to combined training. Overall, our certainty about the evidence is limited by imprecision (small number of studies and participants) and risks of bias (e.g. from imbalanced exposure doses).

Authors' Conclusions

Combined training after stroke does not affect mortality or the incidence of secondary events at the end of intervention or end of follow-up. Since these events are infrequent, conclusions cannot be drawn about any protective effect on mortality or secondary events. Small beneficial effects on physical fitness and blood pressure at the end of intervention may represent a reduced risk of secondary events, but this is very uncertain. Combined training may cause small improvements in fitness, disability, walking speed, and balance at the end of intervention. The small benefit observed for balance may be preserved after a follow-up period. The evidence for these effects is of low or very low certainty. Combined training interventions were adhered to successfully without serious adverse events or adverse effects; the interventions were acceptable to and well tolerated by participants. Limited data at follow-up restricts the conclusions we can draw about the retention of any benefits observed. Larger, well-designed trials are needed to determine the optimal regimen for exercise prescription, the benefits, and long-term effects.

### Considerations for developing complex post-stroke upper limb behavioural interventions: an international qualitative study [^11191Dy9]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Something that we don't measure much that's huge to normal function and post-stroke function is the social circle. Clinical Research #2

Education was identified as important to upper limb motor recovery by participants in the clinical research, clinical experience and lived experience groups. Education may be used to inform the participant of specific foci during a behavioural intervention, e.g. different components of a movement to be practised. Participants in the lived experience group identified that understanding the purpose of an exercise was critical to remaining engaged.

Being able to explain what one is doing and why, that's something very important. Lived Experience #8

Accessibility to therapists was identified as key to maintaining engagement and adherence by participants from the clinical research, clinical and lived experience groups. Stroke survivors identified ongoing access to behavioural interventions as essential to drive recovery. Participants in the clinical research, clinical and lived experience groups identified that practice of some parts of a behavioural intervention should be able to be replicated without a therapist.

Participants in the clinical and lived experience groups identified the importance of hope in maintaining engagement with an intervention. Clinical experience group participants described a nuanced version of hope, where unrealistic goals should be compartmentalised into smaller achievable goals with the stroke survivor. Lived experience participants stated firmly that they disliked being told about the potential ceiling of their post-stroke upper limb function. They instead sought encouragement to come to peace with their disability on their terms.

All I want from my professional viewpoint is what's realistic, realistic hope based on what's happening… I'm not asking to make judgements. Lived Experience #2

Ensuring that survivor and caregiver needs are met after a stroke is essential in ongoing care to ensure optimal quality of life. Despite health care professionals making significant strides in poststroke symptom management, education, and rehabilitative support, the common poststroke symptom of sexual dysfunction is rarely addressed. Multiple barriers across health care settings and systems have contributed to this gap. The purpose of this article is to provide evidence that supports the importance of addressing sexual health by health care providers with the stroke survivor and their partner as they transition through the recovery process. We have the following recommendations to optimize care and quality of life for stroke survivors: (1) comprehensive sex education must include information on healthy sex and sexuality for people with neurological disabilities; (2) rehabilitation programs offered in postacute settings should include a structured culturally sensitive interprofessional sexual rehabilitation component that addresses sexuality of the stroke survivor in collaboration with their intimate partners; (3) sexual rehabilitation programs should be tailored for each person based on a thorough assessment of the person's health literacy and learning needs; and (4) the American Heart Association should develop an extensive toolkit for health care providers and survivors that is easily and readily available to the public. Health care providers, survivors, and their partners have a stake in optimal stroke recovery. Sexuality and sexual function are important quality of life indicators thus conversations addressing issues must be included as part of the recovery process. This discussion is best initiated by a health care provider to address system barriers and misconceptions across care transitions. Likewise, survivors and their partners must be encouraged to take ownership to address sexuality issues and initiate the conversation with their health care partners to achieve full recovery.

### Understanding the facilitators and barriers of stroke survivors' adherence to recovery-oriented self-practice: a thematic synthesis [^115GHz2z]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Stroke survivors receive considerable rehabilitation efforts as inpatients, but one-on-one therapy decreases after discharge. The gap between the amount of required therapy and the lack of its availability in this phase of care may be partly overcome by self-practice. However, patient's adherence to prescribed programs is often low. While single studies have examined factors affecting adherence in this specific case, they have not been reviewed and synthesised previously.

Methods

A thematic synthesis of qualitative studies explored factors affecting stroke survivors' adherence to prescribed, recovery-oriented self-practice. Five databases were systematically searched for references: Medline, Psycinfo, CINAHL, Embase, and ASSIA. Quality assessment was undertaken using the CASP tool.

Results

From 1308 references, 68 potential papers were read in full, and 12 were included in the review. An overarching theme was identified as: "Tailoring and personalization rather than standardization". It was informed by the following three analytical themes: "The meaning of 'self' in self-practice", "Identifying self-practice as a team effort", and "Self-practice that is grounded in one's reality".

Conclusion

To have a positive effect on adherence to self-practice, clinicians are advised to spend time learning about each individual's life circumstances, so they can tailor proposed exercise programs to patients' personal situations, preferences, and needs. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONThe topic of patient's adherence to self-practice of prescribed exercise is a common concern, often voiced by frustrated rehabilitation health professionals. Bridging the gap between the patient's needs for post-discharge intensive therapy and the inability of healthcare systems to provide it could be filled partly by self-practice. Adherence to self-practice has become even more essential since the COVID 19 pandemic and the decrease in face-to-face delivery of rehabilitation due to social distancing requirements. Adherence to exercise is a broad topic. Reasons for poor adherence differ between patient populations and the exercises they are prescribed. This study focuses on post-discharge stroke survivors' adherence to recovery targeted exercise that could be described as repetitive and less physically demanding movements and functions. Reviewed studies were qualitative and usually included a relatively small number of participants within a specific context. Using thematic synthesis, we combined these small pieces of the puzzle into a larger picture, to produce recommendations that could be drawn on by clinicians to improve self-practice adherence.

### Clinical performance measures for stroke rehabilitation: performance measures from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^111UUatq]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association released the adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery guidelines in 2016. A working group of stroke rehabilitation experts reviewed these guidelines and identified a subset of recommendations that were deemed suitable for creating performance measures. These 13 performance measures are reported here and contain inclusion and exclusion criteria to allow calculation of rates of compliance in a variety of settings ranging from acute hospital care to postacute care and care in the home and outpatient setting.

### Considerations for developing complex post-stroke upper limb behavioural interventions: an international qualitative study [^115cA3YU]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

All participants suggested that complex interventions with multiple overlapping and interacting intervention elements will be required to optimise upper limb recovery. Intervention elements (engagement, content, dose and therapist) have multiple dimensions requiring consideration when developing complex post-stroke upper limb behavioural interventions. Several contextual factors were identified for behavioural intervention development, including the purpose (research question to be addressed), goal (restitution or compensation focused) and intended recipient (personalisation requirements).

The perception of what was a favourable post-stroke upper limb motor outcome varied depending on the participant group and the lens through which they examined recovery. Lived experience participants prioritised outcomes in the domains of activity and participation, while preclinical research participants prioritised impairment. These perspectives align with those previously reported for stroke survivorsand researchers. Therefore, primary outcome measures should be selected dependent on which WHO ICFdomain(s) is/are expected to improve, consistent with the Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Roundtable recommendations for multidomain measurement. All participant groups emphasised inclusion of real-world performance via participation measures.

### Gaps in guidelines on long-term management strategies for post-stroke dysphagia [^1142LC4P]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Aims and Hypothesis

This position paper synthesizes current guideline recommendations on PSD management, highlights critical gaps in long‐term care, and underscores the need for standardized, evidence‐based follow‐up strategies. We propose that structured reassessment intervals and individualized rehabilitation approaches could improve long‐term outcomes for stroke survivors with persistent dysphagia.

### Early rehabilitation after stroke [^114vWC7g]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Early rehabilitation is recommended in many guidelines, with limited evidence to guide practice. Brain neurobiology suggests that early training, at the right dose, will aid recovery. In this review, we highlight recent trials of early mobilization, aphasia, dysphagia and upper limb treatment in which intervention is commenced within 7 days of stroke and discuss future research directions.

Recent Findings

Trials in this early time window are few. Although the seminal AVERT trial suggests that a cautious approach is necessary immediately (< 24h) after stroke, early mobility training and mobilization appear well tolerated, with few reasons to delay initiating some rehabilitation within the first week. The results of large clinical trials of early aphasia therapy are on the horizon, and examples of targeted upper limb treatments with better patient selection are emerging.

Summary

Early rehabilitation trials are complex, particularly those that intervene across acute and rehabilitation care settings, but these trials are important if we are to optimize recovery potential in the critical window for repair. Concerted efforts to standardize 'early' recruitment, appropriately stratify participants and implement longer term follow-up is needed. Trial standards are improving. New recommendations from a recent Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Roundtable will help drive new research.

### Improving access to stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a policy statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^114J1R8M]. Stroke (2025). High credibility.

American Heart Association/American Stroke Association consensus guidelines — prevention during and after stroke rehabilitation state that Individuals with stroke should be provided a formal fall prevention program during hospitalization, that Individuals with stroke who have poor balance, low balance confidence, and fear of falls or are at risk for falls should be provided with a balance training program, and that Functional tasks should be practiced; that is, task-specific training, in which the tasks are graded to challenge individual capabilities, practiced repeatedly, and progressed in difficulty on a frequent basis.

### The stroke transitional care intervention for older adults with stroke and multimorbidity: a multisite pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^114miWfx]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Control arm: usual care

Older adults who were randomly assigned to the control group continued to receive usual care services offered through their outpatient stroke rehabilitation program. For the two hospital outpatient clinics, this included the provision of stroke rehabilitation services, appointments to see outpatient medical providers, e.g. primary care, neurology, rehabilitation, and referrals to other community-based health and social services. Usual care typically involved 2–3 visits per week for a maximum of 3 months. The specific services that comprise outpatient stroke rehabilitation differed between the two study sites in terms of access to different types of healthcare providers, proportion of visits offered in person or virtually, and the intensity and duration of rehabilitation. During the study period, because of the pandemic, many in-person outpatient rehabilitation visits were not classified as essential services, resulting in reduced access to in-person care, or closure of the clinic. Up to 70% of outpatient rehabilitation visits were offered virtually with the onset of the pandemic. The details of usual care at each site were carefully documented.

Figure 1 provides a summary of the key components of the intervention and elucidates the differences between the intervention and usual care groups. The key differences between the TCSI intervention and usual care (control) that the TCSI introduced included: 1) dedicated Care Coordinator who provided system navigation support and referral to community-based services, 2) regular monthly IP team conferences, 3) regular monthly visits over a 6-month period (usual outpatient rehabilitation services typically last a maximum of 3 months), 4) post-discharge telephone follow-up call within 2 days of hospital discharge by the Care Coordinator. 5) Social Worker and Registered Nurse included in IP team, 6) self-management education and support using a strengths-based approach, 7) use of My Stroke Recovery Journey Website to support self-management and system navigation, 8) standardized clinical assessment tools, including tools to assess for depressive symptoms, and 9) development and ongoing evaluation of an individualized patient-centred plan of care.

### The stroke transitional care intervention for older adults with stroke and multimorbidity: a multisite pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^114tT9Es]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Alongside these improvements in the organization and provision of acute stroke care services has been relatively short hospital length of stays in most developed countries, thus most of the stroke patients' recovery occurs after the patient is discharged from the hospital. Up to 60% of older adults hospitalized with a stroke are discharged directly home after an acute care or in-patient rehabilitation hospital stay, and up to 60% will require ongoing rehabilitation in the community that supports continued recovery and re-integration to life after stroke. This trend toward shorter hospital lengths of stay and increasing numbers of stroke survivors' being discharged to the community, underscores the importance of post-acute systems of care such as early supported discharge (ESD) and transitional care (TC) services. ESD services consist of a multidisciplinary specialized team that provides rehabilitation in a home or community-based setting for selected patients at the same intensity and mix of skills as an acute stroke unit and can include a home visit prior to discharge to tailor the care plan to the patient's environment. ESD can include a wide range of services from full service with a mobile rehabilitation team through to minimal counselling prior to discharge. Systematic reviews have shown that ESD can reduce disability, length of time in hospital, and healthcare costs for selected people with stroke. Unfortunately, most of the trials included in these reviews are at least 20 years old and occurred prior to the modern reconfigurations of acute stroke services, thus recent research is needed to determine establish/verify these effects.

TC includes a broad spectrum of services that are often included in the same category as ESD for post-acute care of stroke. Transitions are defined as movements of patients across healthcare settings, locations, and providers, and are "marked by changes in patients' physical, mental, emotional, and cognitive capacities" (p. 790). TC includes the development of individualized discharge care plans as well as a range of support services that assist patients with managing changes – e.g. providing comfort, listening to problems, providing self-management training, and screening/assessing health status and the home environment to assist with emotional and mental health challenges and address accessibility and safety concerns; providing education and instruction on exercises and the use of associated rehabilitation devices to address physical and cognitive challenges; providing training, support with household chores, and facilitating linkages to community-based resources to assist with instrumental activities etc.

### Integrated care for optimizing the management of stroke and associated heart disease: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology council on stroke [^113QB8r5]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Between 20 and 30% of all strokes are recurrent strokes. An integrated care approach to stroke care can reduce the likelihood of CVD events, but should they occur, it is vital that evidence-based care pathways are in place, with equitable care available for everyone, at any timepoint. These pathways need to provide seamless, integrated, and individualized care and be delivered by a workforce that have the right knowledge, skills, and behaviours, depending on their role along the pathway. All such efforts then need to undergo rigorous evaluation and adaption in order to spend healthcare resources efficiently.

In the UK, the knowledge and skills for stroke-specific care have been clearly laid out in the Stroke-Specific Education Framework (stroke-education.org.uk), which includes 16 Elements of Care from awareness raising of stroke symptoms, through to end of life care, rehabilitation, and return to work. Whilst these have been developed for stroke specialist and stroke relevant staff, many of the knowledge, skills, and behaviours apply equally to the cardiac workforce and care pathways. The need for such standardized and integrated post stroke programmes and follow-up care after rehabilitation seems evident, but programmes are not widely available. Such programmes will help improve the quality of care, as well as help avoid unnecessary variations in patient care, and in patient outcomes as well. They also inform quality standards and allow benchmarking of services and care against recommended standards. In UK stroke care, the standards have informed the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Package (SSNAP;) which has underpinned developments in many aspects of stroke care since its inception as the National Sentinel Audit in 1997. The action plan for stroke in Europe also emphasizes the integrated stroke and secondary prevention care.

### Considerations for developing complex post-stroke upper limb behavioural interventions: an international qualitative study [^111dFNP8]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Our thematic analysis highlights that effective upper limb behavioural interventions require the interaction of multiple intervention elements shaped by various contextual considerations. Developing such interventions will require careful consideration of the purpose of an intervention and presentation of each individual. Personalised complex behavioural interventions can be created by combining multiple interventions elements.

Clinical messages

Post-stroke upper limb behavioural interventions are comprised of multiple intervention elements.
Behavioural interventions can be personalised based on contextual considerations including the purpose of the intervention, the desired outcome of the intervention, and who the intervention is intended to benefit.
Perception of what is a favourable post-stroke upper limb motor outcome varies depending on the participant group and the lens through which they examine recovery.

### Physical rehabilitation approaches for the recovery of function and mobility following stroke [^113uiVVJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Various approaches to physical rehabilitation to improve function and mobility are used after stroke. There is considerable controversy around the relative effectiveness of approaches, and little known about optimal delivery and dose. Some physiotherapists base their treatments on a single approach; others use components from several different approaches.

Objectives

Primary objective: To determine whether physical rehabilitation is effective for recovery of function and mobility in people with stroke, and to assess if any one physical rehabilitation approach is more effective than any other approach.

Secondary objective: To explore factors that may impact the effectiveness of physical rehabilitation approaches, including time after stroke, geographical location of study, intervention dose/duration, intervention provider, and treatment components.

Stakeholder involvement: Key aims were to clarify the focus of the review, inform decisions about subgroup analyses, and co‐produce statements relating to key implications.

Search methods

For this update, we searched the Cochrane Stroke Trials Register (last searched November 2022), CENTRAL (2022, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2022), Embase (1980 to November 2022), AMED (1985 to November 2022), CINAHL (1982 to November 2022), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (to November 2022).

Selection criteria

Inclusion criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of physical rehabilitation approaches aimed at promoting the recovery of function or mobility in adult participants with a clinical diagnosis of stroke.

Exclusion criteria: RCTs of upper limb function or single treatment components.

Primary outcomes: measures of independence in activities of daily living (IADL) and motor function.

Secondary outcomes: balance, gait velocity, and length of stay.

Data collection and analysis

Two independent authors selected studies according to pre‐defined eligibility criteria, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main results

In this review update, we included 267 studies (21,838 participants). Studies were conducted in 36 countries, with half (133/267) in China. Generally, studies were heterogeneous, and often poorly reported. We judged only 14 studies in meta‐analyses as at low risk of bias for all domains and, on average, we considered 33% of studies in analyses of primary outcomes at high risk of bias.

Is physical rehabilitation more effective than no (or minimal) physical rehabilitation?

Compared to no physical rehabilitation, physical rehabilitation may improve IADL (standardised mean difference (SMD) 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 1.56; 52 studies, 5403 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and motor function (SMD 1.01, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.22; 50 studies, 5669 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There was evidence of long‐term benefits for these outcomes.

Physical rehabilitation may improve balance (MD 4.54, 95% CI 1.36 to 7.72; 9 studies, 452 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and likely improves gait velocity (SMD 0.23, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.42; 18 studies, 1131 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), but with no evidence of long‐term benefits.

Is physical rehabilitation more effective than attention control?

The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of physical rehabilitation, as compared to attention control, on IADL (SMD 0.91, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.75; 2 studies, 106 participants), motor function (SMD 0.13, 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.38; 5 studies, 237 participants), and balance (MD 6.61, 95% CI ‐0.45 to 13.66; 4 studies, 240 participants).

Physical rehabilitation likely improves gait speed when compared to attention control (SMD 0.34, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.54; 7 studies, 405 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Does additional physical rehabilitation improve outcomes?

Additional physical rehabilitation may improve IADL (SMD 1.26, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.71; 21 studies, 1972 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and motor function (SMD 0.69, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.92; 22 studies, 1965 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Very few studies assessed these outcomes at long‐term follow‐up.

Additional physical rehabilitation may improve balance (MD 5.74, 95% CI 3.78 to 7.71; 15 studies, 795 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and gait velocity (SMD 0.59, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.91; 19 studies, 1004 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Very few studies assessed these outcomes at long‐term follow‐up.

Is any one approach to physical rehabilitation more effective than any other approach?

Compared to other approaches, those that focus on functional task training may improve IADL (SMD 0.58, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.87; 22 studies, 1535 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and motor function (SMD 0.72, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.22; 20 studies, 1671 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) but the evidence in the latter is very uncertain. The benefit was sustained long‐term.

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of functional task training on balance (MD 2.16, 95% CI ‐0.24 to 4.55) and gait velocity (SMD 0.28, 95% CI ‐0.01 to 0.56).

Compared to other approaches, neurophysiological approaches may be less effective than other approaches in improving IADL (SMD ‐0.34, 95% CI ‐0.63 to ‐0.06; 14 studies, 737 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and there may be no difference in improving motor function (SMD ‐0.60, 95% CI ‐1.32 to 0.12; 13 studies, 663 participants; low‐certainty evidence), balance (MD ‐0.60, 95% CI ‐5.90 to 6.03; 9 studies, 292 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and gait velocity (SMD ‐0.17, 95% CI ‐0.62 to 0.27; 16 studies, 630 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain about the effect on gait velocity.

For all comparisons, the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of physical rehabilitation on adverse events and length of hospital stay.

Authors' conclusions

Physical rehabilitation, using a mix of different treatment components, likely improves recovery of function and mobility after stroke. Additional physical rehabilitation, delivered as an adjunct to 'usual' rehabilitation, may provide added benefits. Physical rehabilitation approaches that focus on functional task training may be useful. Neurophysiological approaches to physical rehabilitation may be no different from, or less effective than, other physical rehabilitation approaches.

Certainty in this evidence is limited due to substantial heterogeneity, with mainly small studies and important differences between study populations and interventions. We feel it is unlikely that any studies published since November 2022 would alter our conclusions. Given the size of this review, future updates warrant consensus discussion amongst stakeholders to ensure the most relevant questions are explored for optimal decision‐making.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of stroke rehabilitation [^115LztYE]. DoD/VA (2024). High credibility.

Chronic post-stroke aphasia — intensive therapy randomized controlled trial results: Two intensive interventions in addition to usual care were compared with usual care alone; after a 2-week intervention period, evaluations occurred immediately and at 12-week follow-up, and treatment was administered 3.0 hours per day, 5 days per week, for a total of 30.0 hours. Across all cohorts, fewer than 50% received no aphasia therapy outside the intervention, and usual-care therapy included a median 10 speech therapy sessions over the 15-week trial period. The primary outcome of aphasia severity was not significantly different between groups, while secondary outcomes showed statistically significant improvement in high-intensity groups at the post-intervention timepoint; only word retrieval benefits were maintained at 12-week follow-up and the difference was not clinically significant. Naming used the Constraint-induced or Multi-modal Personalized Aphasia Rehabilitation (COMPARE) battery composed of 180 items with 80 trained items for intensive groups and none trained for usual care, and the statistically significant adjusted MD was noted for these 80 trained items but not for untrained items.

### Primary care of adult patients after stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^112pDBQG]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Post-stroke primary care — cycle and initial visit timing are outlined as follows: A first post stroke visit is generally within 1–3 weeks of discharge to establish the foundation for post-stroke management, followed by a cycle that includes Establish/Confirm the Patient & Family's Perspective (contentment with present course; gaps between aspirations and status), Identify Unmet Needs (knowledge; functional/physical; psychological; social), General Goals (achieve patient-centered care; prevent recurrent brain injury; maximize function; prevent late complications; optimize quality of life), Characterize Control of Chronic Stroke Risk Factors, Affirm the Management Plan (set specific goals; address etiologic evaluation; gaps between patient's goals/aspirations and status; unmet needs; risk factor control; consultations), Implement the Plan (educate patient/carers; implement treatment; coordinate care; address barriers; schedule return visit), and a Follow-Up Visit to solicit the patient's agenda and review and update stroke and medical/social/medication history. After the first visit, it is helpful to document a brief narrative of the patient's stroke to anchor stroke-specific care for future visits, and foundational work for every visit includes monitoring the consequences of the stroke and updating the medical and social history. The burden of ongoing symptoms is common: Approximately 60% of stroke survivors have some neurological symptoms, and 5% to 50% have moderate disability, requiring some assistance with basic activities of daily living.

### Resistance training for people with stroke [^1135kjkT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Levels of physical activity and physical fitness are low after stroke. Low muscle strength is common, particularly on the affected side, and is associated with post-stroke disability. Resistance training exercise interventions could increase muscle strength, improve physical function and reduce disability, and may benefit secondary prevention.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review is to determine whether resistance training after stroke has any effects on death, disability, adverse events, risk factors, fitness, walking, and indices of physical function when compared to a non-exercise control.

Search Methods

In January 2024, we searched nine databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, WoS, PEDro and DORIS) and two trial registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP), together with reference checking, citation tracking and contact with experts in the field, to identify eligible studies.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing resistance training interventions with comparators of either usual care, no intervention, or a non-exercise intervention in people with stroke.

Outcomes

Our critical outcome domains were death, disability, adverse events, risk factors, fitness, walking and indices of physical function. We assessed outcomes at the end of intervention and at the end of the longest follow-up. Our other important outcome domains were indices of quality of life, mood, cognition and fatigue.

Risk Of Bias

We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias 1.0 tool to assess bias in the included studies.

Synthesis Methods

Where possible, we synthesised results for each outcome at the end of the intervention and at the end of follow-up using random-effects meta-analyses on arm-level data. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk difference (RD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we calculated a mean difference (MD), or standardised mean difference (SMD), and 95% CI. For outcomes not analysed using meta-analysis, we followed the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) guidance. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for critical outcomes.

Included Studies

We included a total of 27 studies with 1004 participants, with an average age of 62 years. Most studies recruited ambulatory participants (18/27) during the sub-acute (10/27) and chronic (16/27) stages of recovery living in high-income countries (18/27). Most study interventions lacked a balanced dose of control exposure (17/27). A follow-up period was included in 8/27 studies (mean 9.9 months; range 2 to 48 months). Interventions typically involved exercise machines (16/27) or bodyweight exercises (10/27) delivered two to three days per week for between two and 12 weeks, which progressed on the basis of intensity and/or volume.

Synthesis Of Results

Resistance training does not increase (or decrease) deaths at the end of intervention (risk difference RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.02; I² = 0%; 24 studies, 880 participants; high-certainty) or follow-up (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.05; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 202 participants; high-certainty). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of resistance training on indices of disability at the end of intervention (standardised mean difference SMD 0.55, 95% CI -0.24 to 1.33; 1 study, 26 participants; very low-certainty). There is a moderate-sized effect (SMD > 0.5) but there was only one small study. No data were available at follow-up. Resistance training may have little or no effect on the incidence of secondary cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (all-cause) at the end of intervention (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.31; 1 study, 10 participants; very low-certainty). There was only one small study. No data were available at follow-up. Resistance training may reduce systolic blood pressure (mmHg) at the end of intervention, but the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference MD -5.00, 95% CI -34.42 to 24.42; 1 study, 22 participants; very low-certainty). There was only one small study. No data were available at follow-up. Resistance training probably improves multiple indices of musculoskeletal fitness at the end of intervention (overall moderate-certainty). Improvements in muscle strength occurred in the legs on the affected (moderate effect SMD > 0.5) and least affected sides (large effect SMD > 0.8), and both arms (moderate effect SMD > 0.5) although the evidence is less certain on the affected arm. Overall, there were very few data at the end of follow-up and overall effects were very uncertain. Resistance training probably results in little or no beneficial effect on comfortable walking speed (m/sec) at the end of intervention (MD -0.00, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.07; I² = 43%; 6 studies, 212 participants; moderate-certainty) or the end of follow-up (MD 0.12, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.26; 1 study, 93 participants; low-certainty). Resistance training may improve indices of balance slightly (small effect SMD > 0.2) at the end of intervention (SMD 0.45, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.80; I² = 24%; 5 studies, 190 participants; low-certainty) and end of follow-up (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.85; 1 study, 93 participants; low-certainty). There was no evidence concerning adverse effects attributable to participating in resistance training interventions. Adherence was good, although there were some dropouts attributable to the resistance training intervention. Overall, evidence certainty was limited by imprecision and risk of bias concerns.

Authors' Conclusions

Resistance training does not affect mortality at the end of intervention or after follow-up. We could not draw conclusions about resistance training effects on disability, secondary prevention of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events or the risk of these because the data were inadequate. Resistance training probably increases muscle strength in the arms and legs, particularly on the unaffected side at the end of intervention. There was little or no effect on comfortable walking speed, possibly because the interventions were insufficiently task-related to walking. However, there may be a small improvement in balance which persists at follow-up. Resistance training interventions were adhered to without serious adverse events or adverse effects, but may not be acceptable to everyone. Inadequate data at follow-up prevented conclusions about retention of benefits. Further well-designed randomised trials are needed to determine the optimal exercise prescription, the benefits and long-term effects.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of stroke rehabilitation [^113cf9b4]. DoD/VA (2024). High credibility.

Stroke rehabilitation — transitions to community recommendations include the following: We suggest using case management services at time of discharge from the acute care hospital or post-acute care facility to improve activities of daily living and functional independence (Weak for; Reviewed, New-added). We suggest the following interventions for patients and their caregivers: Behavioral health/psychosocial interventions to improve patient and caregiver depression; Psychoeducation to improve family function, patient functional independence, and quality of life (Weak for; Reviewed, New-added). There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against implementing transitional care rehabilitation interventions (e.g., home-based services after hospital discharge) or early supported discharge to improve activities of daily living or functional disability following stroke (Neither for nor against; Reviewed, New-replaced). There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against community participation interventions to improve community engagement for survivors of stroke (Neither for nor against; Reviewed, New-added).

### Four birds with one stone? Reparative, neuroplastic, cardiorespiratory, and metabolic benefits of aerobic exercise poststroke [^111iSaqq]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Converging evidence from animal models of stroke and clinical trials suggests that aerobic exercise has effects across multiple targets.

Recent Findings

The subacute phase is characterized by a period of heightened neuroplasticity when aerobic exercise has the potential to optimize recovery. In animals, low intensity aerobic exercise shrinks lesion size and reduces cell death and inflammation, beginning 24h poststroke. Also in animals, aerobic exercise upregulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor near the lesion and improves learning. In terms of neuroplastic effects, clinical trial results are less convincing and have only examined effects in chronic stroke. Stroke patients demonstrate cardiorespiratory fitness levels below the threshold required to carry out daily activities. This may contribute to a 'neurorehabilitation ceiling' that limits capacity to practice at a high enough frequency and intensity to promote recovery. Aerobic exercise when delivered 2–5 days per week at moderate to high intensity beginning as early as 5 days poststroke improves cardiorespiratory fitness, dyslipidemia, and glucose tolerance.

Summary

Based on the evidence discussed and applying principles of periodization commonly used to prepare athletes for competition, we have created a model of aerobic training in subacute stroke in which training is delivered in density blocks (duration×intensity) matched to recovery phases.

### The stroke transitional care intervention for older adults with stroke and multimorbidity: a multisite pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^113tYPae]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Noteworthy, is that one of the hospital-based outpatient stroke rehabilitation clinic study sites consisted of both urban and rural communities. People who live in rural areas may have difficulties in accessing health care due to a lack of services, isolation, or a lack of mobility. Given the challenge of delivering community-based stroke rehabilitation in rural areas, this virtual intervention may provide an effective and efficient strategy to improve post-acute care for stroke survivors living in rural areas. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual stroke care (Telestroke) — which involved connecting with a healthcare provider by email, phone, text, or video call — for acute stroke management were well established in many regions. However, the use of these same technologies to deliver stroke rehabilitation and support reintegration was underused and rare.

While many challenges arise conducting pragmatic trials testing complex interventions under 'normal' circumstances, managing a trial during a pandemic added an additional layer of complexity, resulting in many uncertainties and unique challenges. A noteworthy strength of the trial was our ability to work together to overcome a broad range of unique methodological and logistical challenges, including consenting and recruiting new participants, data collection and management, and intervention delivery, to name a few. An important strength of the trial was that we were able to revise the intervention from in-person to virtual delivery prior to initiating the intervention, which helped to lessen the impact of COVID on intervention delivery.

Study limitations

Several limitations to this study should be noted. First, our study took place within two hospital-based outpatient stroke rehabilitation programs in Ontario, Canada, which may limit the generalizability to other settings. Sites may differ on characteristics that can affect implementation of the intervention thereby influencing intervention effectiveness. For example, staffing is known to vary across outpatient stroke rehabilitation programs in Ontario. Future RCTs should involve multiple sites, to explore how the intervention performs across a broader range of settings and contexts. Second, while efforts to identify the key components that make interventions effective have been done in ESD and ASU studies, our study was not powered to detect these effects and the complex nature of our intervention suggests that it may be misleading to attribute the effects seen in our study to specific intervention components. Third, the study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite our efforts to minimize the effects of the pandemic, we do not know what would have been the results of the study if the study was conducted under 'normal' circumstances, e.g. not under the constraints of the pandemic.

### Considerations for developing complex post-stroke upper limb behavioural interventions: an international qualitative study [^114tfwxY]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Subtheme 4B. Content is crucial

The content of a behavioural intervention was identified as crucial by participants from all groups. Considerations under the content subtheme were perceived to be 'what is done', intervention adjuvants, specificity and transference. 'What is done' was said to incorporate what actions were completed by the patient and the therapist, how they are completed, and what equipment was used.

Movement quality was perceived as an important driver of post-stroke upper limb recovery by participants in all groups. Those in the preclinical research group identified quality as practicing how the upper limb normally moves during functional tasks (i.e. normal movement patterns). Clinical experience group participants identified that normal movement patterns could be broken down and individual movements isolated for part practice. These individual movements could be trained to recover the missing pieces of a normal movement pattern.

I would focus on what's not working in their impairments… I care about quality of movement. Clinical Experience Participant #1

Participants in the preclinical, clinical research and clinical experience groups discussed adjuvants designed to increase the potential benefit derived from a behavioural intervention. Participants in the preclinical and clinical research groups identified pharmacological options, transcranial magnetic stimulation and implantable stimulation devices as potential adjuvants. Participants in the clinical experience group identified adjuvants as primers of the nervous system before the active content of the intervention. Participants in the preclinical and clinical research groups emphasised that adjuvants must be combined with behavioural interventions and should not be considered interventions in isolation.

Participants in all groups discussed specificity in training and transference to everyday life. Preclinical research, clinical research and clinical experience group participants discussed the importance of practising specific movements contributing to multiple skills. Participants suggested that a skill recovered in a specific context should be transferred into real-world scenarios.

Post-thrombectomy rehabilitation and follow-up — All patients admitted with acute stroke should have an initial assessment by multidisciplinary rehabilitation professionals (physical, occupational, and speech therapy) as soon as possible after admission, preferably within the first 24–36 hours (Class II, level of evidence B). Due to impact on outcome, every effort should be made to establish aggressive rehabilitation placement for this patient population (Class II, level of evidence B). Ninety-day outcome assessment after thrombectomy is a reasonable and appropriate standard follow-up (Class II, level of evidence C).

### The clinical effectiveness of tele-rehabilitation interventions on balance and activities of daily living in post-stroke survivors: an umbrella review of systematic reviews [^1166B6Rh]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose: The clinical effectiveness of tele-rehabilitation (TR) for improving motor function and activities of daily living (ADLs) has been regularly debated in post-stroke survivors. The objective was to harmonize the current evidence-base by performing an umbrella review. Materials and methods: Randomized controlled trials examining the impact of exercise-based TR interventions in people following stroke were interrogated. We assessed the individual quality of the systematic reviews by applying the Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2 checklist (AMSTAR-2). Results: Evidence from six (for balance) to seven (ADLs) high quality systematic reviews with meta-analyses indicated that TR was effective for improving balance (n = 443; SMD = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.52–1.91; eOR = 9.08, 95% CI: 2.57–32.7), and ADLs (n = 1342; SMD = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.06–0.54; eOR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.12–2.66), compared to usual-care controls. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the positive impact of TR interventions, supporting their adoption as a front-line post-stroke rehabilitation strategy. Benefits of improved balance may reduce falls risk leading to increased safety and independence. Enhanced ability to perform ADLs contribute to better quality of life, allowing stroke survivors to perform daily tasks more easily and confidently.

### Considerations for developing complex post-stroke upper limb behavioural interventions: an international qualitative study [^113r9F9B]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As many as half of all stroke survivors experience upper limb motor impairment early after stroke. Behavioural interventions are currently the only treatment options available to drive recovery in stroke survivors whose upper limb impairment persists for months and years post-stroke, leading to its recognition as a priority research area.

Researchers are encouraged to progress testing of new interventions systematically along a continuum from preclinical research in the laboratory through to implementation in clinical practice, to ultimately impact health outcomes. There are two potential translation blocks along this research continuum: preclinical research to early-phase clinical trials, and late-phase clinical trials to clinical practice. Preclinical research, clinical research, clinical experience and lived experience groups often contribute evidentiary input isolated to their domain when developing post-stroke upper limb behavioural interventions. – These groups rarely contribute simultaneously during the development of behavioural interventions for stroke recovery. Incorporating all perspectives (preclinical and clinical research, clinical and lived experience) may enable the field to better navigate potential translation blocks from preclinical research to early-phase clinical trials, as well as late-phase clinical trials to clinical practice. A pluralist approachto behavioural intervention development may leverage the unique knowledge of each group to advance our collective understanding of the requirements for post-stroke upper limb behavioural interventions across the continuum of research.

Behavioural interventions for post-stroke upper limb motor recovery are complex. Behavioural interventions combine multiple ingredients or intervention elements (such as dose – and content). It is plausible that the interaction between these elements may be responsible for driving recovery. The development of behavioural interventions may be further complicated by contextual considerations such as the characteristics of the person undertaking a behavioural intervention or how long post-stroke an intervention is delivered. Identifying broader contextual considerations for upper limb behavioural intervention development, like their intended purpose, may provide the field with a deeper understanding of what influences post-stroke upper limb motor recovery. Therefore, our aim was to simultaneously explore the perspectives and opinions of people with experience in preclinical research, clinical research, clinical experience and lived experience on the important considerations for the development of upper limb behavioural interventions to drive optimal post-stroke upper limb motor recovery.

### Neurorehabilitation of stroke [^115E71vb]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Despite ongoing improvements in the acute treatment of cerebrovascular diseases and organization of stroke services, many stroke survivors are in need of neurorehabilitation, as more than two-thirds show persisting neurologic deficits. While early elements of neurorehabilitation are already taking place on the stroke unit, after the acute treatment, the patient with relevant neurologic deficits usually takes part in an organized inpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation program and eventually continues with therapies in an ambulatory setting afterwards. A specialized multidisciplinary neurorehabilitation team with structured organization and processes provides a multimodal, intense treatment program for stroke patients which is adapted in detail to the individual goals of rehabilitation. There are many parallels between postlesional neuroplasticity (relearning) and learning in the development of individuals as well as task learning of healthy persons. One key principle of neurorehabilitation is the repetitive creation of specific learning situations to promote mechanisms of neural plasticity in stroke recovery. There is evidence of achieving a better outcome of neurorehabilitation with early initiation of treatment, high intensity, with specific goals and active therapies, and the coordinated work and multimodality of a specialized team. In this context, interdisciplinary goal-setting and regular assessments of the patient are important. Furthermore, several further potential enhancers of neural plasticity, e.g., peripheral and brain stimulation techniques, pharmacological augmentation, and use of robotics, are under evaluation.

### Square-stepping exercise in older inpatients in early geriatric rehabilitation. A randomized controlled pilot study [^116gsds1]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Rehabilitation in older people is known to be an important component in maintaining or regaining independent living after an acute event such as a stroke, hip fracture, etc. Geriatric rehabilitation itself is defined as an approach of multidimensional diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for patients affected by multimorbidity and geriatric syndromes. The aim is to focus on individual preferences and deficits, maintain functional reserve and improve physical function. Across Europe, the structure of geriatric rehabilitation varies. In Germany, geriatric rehabilitation is provided post-acutely in rehabilitation centers or during hospitalization for acute illness, called early geriatric rehabilitation. Early geriatric rehabilitation is aimed at geriatric inpatients with acute illnesses (e.g. stroke, pneumonia, hip fracture). The length of stay is usually two to three weeks. The core principle is a treatment by a multiprofessional team with daily physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and neuropsychological therapy. The main goals are to maintain independence and regain the ability to perform activities of daily living. These two components are included under the umbrella term of mobility, which is closely related to physical and mental health in older age. This also corresponds to the concept of healthy ageing as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). Although physiotherapy plays a key role in mobilization in this setting there are no clear recommendations, and evidence for early rehabilitation in geriatric patients in Europe is currently inconclusive. As a result, different reviews on the benefits of early rehabilitation in hospitalized older people show heterogeneous results. In the included studies, the intervention content of the rehabilitation treatment varies. In general, it is not described which specific interventions were chosen as part of the physiotherapy treatment. There is also little information about the duration, intensity and frequency of the chosen interventions. Furthermore, the choice of outcome measurements varies, leading to heterogeneous results across studies. The individuality of the interventions used additionally complicates standardization. Therefore, further research with standardized programs in this specific setting is needed. The introduction of specific and well-studied exercise programs to improve lower limb function is particularly important for maintaining mobility and preventing falls. An evaluated and effective intervention for older people in the community setting is the Square-Stepping Exercise (SSE) program. SSE combines a specific and adaptive approach. It is a simultaneous motor-cognitive training that focuses on the lower limb function for motor skills and on executive function and working memory for cognitive skills. By combining a physical and a cognitive aspect, SSE seems to be particularly suitable as exercise intervention in the geriatric clientele. It is also easy to implement, inexpensive, and offers a playful additional component for conventional physiotherapy. Originally developed by Shigematsu and Okura in Japan, the program was primarily designed to improve the functional fitness of the lower extremities. The aim was to improve the walking ability of older people in the general population and to minimize the risk of falls. In SSE, step patterns are performed on a mat consisting of 40 squares. The level of difficulty is adaptive and can be supplemented with additional elements. SSE follows the principle of proactive and reactive response improvement. This improves the ability to regain balance by taking a corrective step after a stumble. SSE training has been shown to be effective in improving physical function. In addition, due to the high cognitive demands, SSE in older people has been shown to have an additional effect on cognitive performance in the functional domains of executive function and working memory. Fisseha et al. provided an overview of the study landscape in their systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of SSE for fall prevention and fall injuries. SSE was found to be effective in reducing fear of falling in older people, as well as improving their subjectively perceived health status.

### Stroke systems of care in south-east Asia region (SEAR): commonalities and diversities [^111rEoKk]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Pragmatic solutions to improve stroke care services in SEAR

The stroke care services in SEAR countries urgently need to be strengthened and improved. Most data in our evidence-based repository comes from HICs, but when trying to replicate those practices, we must be aware of these nations' geographical, cultural, social, and economic disparities. The Global Stroke Action Plan of the World Stroke Organization suggests setting realistic goals and context-appropriate targets while acknowledging the need to consider the diversity of stroke care systems worldwide.

Effective primary prevention and reduction in treatment delays depend on raising public knowledge of stroke and its risk factors. Applying behavioral modification programs and governmental policies such as taxes on high-risk behavior is essential to control lifestyle determinants. Increasing social literacy on stroke through wide dissemination of FAST and BEFAST programs, specialized stroke recognition training for paramedical staff, creating a national stroke hotline number to expedite referrals, and adopting hospital pre-notification are steps to establish better stroke care systems.

Costly interventions like IVT and EVT may not be accessible and affordable for all in these resource-strained countries. Cost-effective interventions like stroke units, adoption of care protocols such as FeSS protocol, bowel/bladder care, and early mobilization can help offset mortality and morbidity. Alternative models of stroke care, such as the hub-and-spoke, task-sharing, and physician-led models, are effective models that should be implemented in countries with inadequate trained personnel. Tele-stroke networks, digital technology, and mobile apps can be leveraged within and across countries for knowledge sharing. An example of mHealth strategy to increase non-specialists' capacity to provide stroke care is the ENIGMA (ENhancing Stroke Care Interventions for Global Medical Assistance) app. The development of nationally standardized training programs for stroke professionals and standardized clinical practice guidelines for stroke and post-stroke rehabilitation is vital. Conscious of this need, the Global Consortium for Stroke Rehabilitation in Low- and Middle-income countries is an initiative to develop LMIC-specific CPGs for stroke rehabilitation. Lastly, integrating stroke care into national healthcare programs is essential to achieve sustainable goals in stroke care. Stroke care performance measures should be integrated as health service indicators.

### Intensity versus task-specificity after stroke: how important is intensity? [^114QdgUn]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

Recent evidence suggests that intense training regimens can increase the use and function of the more affected limbs of stroke patients. The efficacy of these intense regimens has led some to conclude that intense training regimens should be more widely applied clinically and has caused some physicians to attempt implementation of more intense training regimens with stroke patients. However, intense protocols may not be needed to produce positive motor changes in some patients and may not be plausible in some environments or with some patients. In this commentary, we review the evidence supporting the efficacy of less intense, task-specific training regimens emphasizing the use of the more affected limb. We submit that intensity does not need to be altered to induce substantial clinical improvements, as some have suggested. Rather, the results of the studies suggest that the nature of stroke motor therapy itself can be altered to be more task-specific while remaining within the typical contact time parameters (i.e., 30–45 min/session), yet can be more efficacious than more traditional motor rehabilitative approaches.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^1126nhB8]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

High-intensity exercise after chronic stroke — two pilot exercise studies provided early evidence supporting the safe and effective use, at least in the chronic stroke population, of high-intensity exercise defined as 60%–80% of heart rate reserve and 85%–95% of peak heart rate.

### Associations between time after stroke and exercise training outcomes: a meta-regression analysis [^1147xdEg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

While guidelines endorse physical activity and exercise across all phases of stroke recovery, the optimal time between stroke and initiation of ET to support improvements in CRF, functional mobility, gait speed, and balance has not been well established. The Stroke Roundtable Consortium advocated to focus recovery trials on the first week to the first month after stroke (acute and early subacute phases). The rationale for early interventions is that rapid changes and most behavioral recovery is reported to occur within this time frame, which is a critical time for neural plasticity and brain repair processes, and patients are most responsive to treatment. Specifically, evidence from preclinical studies indicates that key molecular, genetic, and cellular changes occur in this window, triggering elevated dendritic sprouting, changes in gene expression, and the suppression of neuronal apoptosis. However, there is some evidence that time‐dependent recovery may fall within distinct post‐stroke phases. For example, some studies report that most patients reach their peak walking function between 2 and 3 months after stroke. Other studies report no further improvements after 6 months, and others have estimated it to extend beyond a year following the stroke event. Yet there is little clinical evidence to show that starting an exercise intervention earlier yields an advantage.

### Improving access to stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a policy statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^117NsTfc]. Stroke (2025). High credibility.

Stroke rehabilitation — therapy approach and management across care settings states that intensive, repetitive mobility task training is recommended for all individuals with gait limitations after stroke. All individuals with stroke should receive activities of daily living (ADL) training tailored to individual needs and eventual discharge setting, and should receive instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) training tailored to individual needs and eventual discharge setting. After completion of formal stroke rehabilitation, participation in a program of exercise or physical activity at home or in the community is recommended. Individuals with stroke discharged to the community should participate in exercise programs with balance training to reduce falls. Individuals with stroke should be prescribed and fit with an assistive device or orthosis if appropriate to improve balance. An ankle foot orthotic (AFO) is recommended for individuals with remediable gait impairments (eg, foot drop) to compensate for foot drop and to improve mobility and paretic ankle and knee kinematics, kinetics, and energy cost of walking. Organized community-based and coordinated interprofessional rehabilitation care is recommended in outpatient or home-based settings. Speech and language therapy is recommended for individuals with aphasia, and treatment for aphasia should include communication partner training.

### Implementation interventions to promote the uptake of evidence-based practices in stroke rehabilitation [^116cx6np]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Rehabilitation based upon research evidence gives stroke survivors the best chance of recovery. There is substantial research to guide practice in stroke rehabilitation, yet uptake of evidence by healthcare professionals is typically slow and patients often do not receive evidence-based care. Implementation interventions are an important means to translate knowledge from research to practice and thus optimise the care and outcomes for stroke survivors. A synthesis of research evidence is required to guide the selection and use of implementation interventions in stroke rehabilitation.

Objectives

To assess the effects of implementation interventions to promote the uptake of evidence-based practices (including clinical assessments and treatments recommended in evidence-based guidelines) in stroke rehabilitation and to assess the effects of implementation interventions tailored to address identified barriers to change compared to non-tailored interventions in stroke rehabilitation.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and eight other databases to 17 October 2019. We searched OpenGrey, performed citation tracking and reference checking for included studies and contacted authors of included studies to obtain further information and identify potentially relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We included individual and cluster randomised trials, non-randomised trials, interrupted time series studies and controlled before-after studies comparing an implementation intervention to no intervention or to another implementation approach in stroke rehabilitation. Participants were qualified healthcare professionals working in stroke rehabilitation and the patients they cared for. Studies were considered for inclusion regardless of date, language or publication status. Main outcomes were healthcare professional adherence to recommended treatment, patient adherence to recommended treatment, patient health status and well-being, healthcare professional intention and satisfaction, resource use outcomes and adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence using GRADE. The primary comparison was any implementation intervention compared to no intervention.

Main Results

Nine cluster randomised trials (12,428 patient participants) and three ongoing trials met our selection criteria. Five trials (8865 participants) compared an implementation intervention to no intervention, three trials (3150 participants) compared one implementation intervention to another implementation intervention, and one three-arm trial (413 participants) compared two different implementation interventions to no intervention. Eight trials investigated multifaceted interventions; educational meetings and educational materials were the most common components. Six trials described tailoring the intervention content to identified barriers to change. Two trials focused on evidence-based stroke rehabilitation in the acute setting, four focused on the subacute inpatient setting and three trials focused on stroke rehabilitation in the community setting. We are uncertain if implementation interventions improve healthcare professional adherence to evidence-based practice in stroke rehabilitation compared with no intervention as the certainty of the evidence was very low (risk ratio (RR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 2.64; 2 trials, 39 clusters, 1455 patient participants; I² = 0%). Low-certainty evidence indicates implementation interventions in stroke rehabilitation may lead to little or no difference in patient adherence to recommended treatment (number of recommended performed outdoor journeys adjusted mean difference (MD) 0.5, 95% CI -1.8 to 2.8; 1 trial, 21 clusters, 100 participants) and patient psychological well-being (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.02, 95% CI -0.54 to 0.50; 2 trials, 65 clusters, 1273 participants; I² = 0%) compared with no intervention. Moderate-certainty evidence indicates implementation interventions in stroke rehabilitation probably lead to little or no difference in patient health-related quality of life (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.05; 2 trials, 65 clusters, 1242 participants; I² = 0%) and activities of daily living (MD 0.29, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.73; 2 trials, 65 clusters, 1272 participants; I² = 0%) compared with no intervention. No studies reported the effects of implementation interventions in stroke rehabilitation on healthcare professional intention to change behaviour or satisfaction. Five studies reported economic outcomes, with one study reporting cost-effectiveness of the implementation intervention. However, this was assessed at high risk of bias. The other four studies did not demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of interventions. Tailoring interventions to identified barriers did not alter results. We are uncertain of the effect of one implementation intervention versus another given the limited very low-certainty evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain if implementation interventions improve healthcare professional adherence to evidence-based practice in stroke rehabilitation compared with no intervention as the certainty of the evidence is very low.

B: Better functional and psychological status — interventions for those with disability, physiotherapy, care packages, etc

For all stroke patients, whether ischaemic or ICH, whether suitable for hyperacute interventions or not, the focus of care should not only be on limiting the effects of the initial event, but on limiting brain damage as well as preventing complications, and initiating rehabilitation. These are the basis for good quality organized acute stroke care and result in better patient outcomes.

The stroke pathway is not straightforward as up to 40% of patients get worse after they come into the stroke unit, mostly within the first 24 h. This is referred to as early neurological deterioration, which, if it persists, is termed stroke progression and reflects secondary brain injury. This fluctuation in patient's condition can be the result of potentially reversible physiological or neurological factors (brady-/tachycardia, high or low blood glucose, increased metabolic rate in infection) although sometimes they are irreversible (e.g. mass effect, brain stem herniation).

A goal of holistic post-stroke care is to achieve improved functional and psychological status and, given its multifactorial nature, will require a multidisciplinary approach. There have been incremental gains in terms of interventions delivered by the multi-disciplinary teams and focused on rehabilitation and functional recovery (Supplementary material online, Table S1). Important examples include arm-robot therapy and mirror therapy which reduced motor deficits and electro-mechanical gait training which increased the number of stroke patients that re-gained the ability to walk. Similarly, the use of treadmill training helped to improve walking speed and walking endurance among ambulatory stroke survivors. However, the absence of standard templates for designing and performing large-scale stroke rehabilitation trials has somewhat limited further progress in the field. In the wake of the digital revolution, telemedicine, virtual reality, and robotics have been tried and tested but are yet to translate to real, measurable functional benefits after a stroke. Innovative approaches that integrate stroke survivors into the exercise portion of an existing hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation programme have shown promise, improving endurance, health status, and quality of life for survivors of stroke and providing an opportunity for self-management.

Consensus statements

The co-occurring and inter-linked nature of CVD requires an integrated care action plan to prevent, identify, treat, and rehabilitate people. This targets the prevention of recurrent stroke, improves patient functional status and symptoms, and manages cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and lifestyle changes

A post-stroke ABC pathway is proposed as a more holistic approach to integrated stroke care and would include three pillars of management:

A: Appropriate Antithrombotic therapy.
B: Better functional and psychological status.
C: Cardiovascular risk factors and Comorbidity optimization (including lifestyle changes).

Appropriate thromboprophylaxis should be targeted to the underlying comorbidity, for example, anticoagulation for patients with AF.

When stroke patients have both AF and vascular disease, anticoagulation monotherapy would suffice.
In high-risk stable atherosclerotic vascular disease patients without AF, combination therapy with rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid and aspirin provides some benefits on CVD events (including on stroke) even in the absence of associated AF, but at the risk of more major bleeding.
In the absence of AF, antiplatelet drugs are used for secondary stroke prevention for non-cardioembolic stroke with either aspirin and clopidogrel or ticagrelor. Both the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin and ticagrelor and aspirin have been found to be superior to aspirin alone for 90-day treatment of acute minor strokes and high-risk TIAs. The combination of clopidogrel and aspirin has also been utilized for intracranial atherosclerotic ISs.

Better functional and psychological status requires care packages and management pathways to be established and implemented, including tailored rehabilitation and personalized appropriately to the patient's needs, both in hospital, during rehabilitation, and post-discharge. Assessment of PSD, anxiety, and cognitive impairment should be undertaken as part of post-stroke care, with appropriate intervention where required.

Cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities are common in stroke patients, and all need to be considered and addressed in a holistic manner, with treatment targets as per CVD prevention guidelines.

A considerable burden of previously unknown AF can be detected when long-term monitoring is applied in at-risk patients.

Across the stroke continuum, there is a need for multi-disciplinary collaboration and coordination of care, including the complex treatment of cardiovascular conditions with the overarching goal to improve recovery, prevent recurrence, and enhance survival and quality of life for the patient with stroke.

Clinical science

Birth of the stroke recovery and rehabilitation guideline

One of the most important milestones in 2016 was the release of the first 'Guideline for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professional from American Heart Association/American Stroke Association'by American Stroke Association. This guideline was endorsed by five professional rehabilitation societies — The American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, American Physical Therapy Association, American Occupational Therapy Association, American Society of Neurorehabilitation and American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine. The guideline reflects collaborative work from many rehabilitation professionals. The total of 229 recommendations in the guideline address 41 recovery topics, and these recommendations were presented and organised into five primary categories (the rehabilitation programme, prevention and medical management of comorbidities, assessment, sensorimotor impairments and treatments/interventions, transitions in care and community rehabilitation). Now rehabilitation professionals have a universal document to guide their clinical practice.

### Effect of a novel transition program on disability after stroke: a trial protocol [^111M6x7U]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

A gap in care for stroke survivors exists at the point of transition from inpatient rehabilitation to home, when survivors encounter new environmental barriers because of the cognitive and sensorimotor sequelae of stroke. Resolving these barriers and improving independence in the community have the potential to significantly improve stroke survivors' long-term morbidity.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of a novel enhanced rehabilitation transition program to reduce environmental barriers and improve daily activity performance and community participation among stroke survivors.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a phase 2b, single-blind, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial. Participants will be randomized using a 1:1 allocation ratio, stratified by Functional Independence Measure and age, to either attentional control or the intervention. Community Participation Transition After Stroke (COMPASS) is a complex intervention that uses 2 complementary evidence-based interventions: home modifications and strategy training delivered in the home. Community participation after stroke, measured by the Reintegration to Normal Living Index, is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include quality of life after stroke, measured by the Stroke Impact Scale, and daily activity performance and magnitude of environmental barriers in the home, both measured by the In-Home Occupational Performance Evaluation. An intention-to-treat analysis will be used. A total of 180 participants, who are 50 years or older, were independent in activities of daily living prior to stroke, and are undergoing inpatient rehabilitation following stroke with a plan to be discharged home, will be included in the study.

Discussion

Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability in the United States. The COMPASS study is ongoing. To date, 99 participants have been recruited and 77 randomized, with 37 in the treatment group and 40 in the control group. Resumption of previous activities immediately after discharge can improve immediate and long-term community participation. Results from this study will fill a critical gap in stroke rehabilitation evidence by providing important information about the long-term community participation and daily activity performance among stroke survivors as well as environmental barriers in their homes.

Exclusion criteria: studies of specific interventions not included in this review

During the screening of potential studies from Chinese databases for this review update, we identified that there are now hundreds of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) exploring the effectiveness of programmes of stroke rehabilitation that include a physical rehabilitation element as part of a broader post‐stroke rehabilitation programme. These are often described using phrases such as 'comprehensive nursing intervention', 'systematic rehabilitation nursing', 'stroke unit nursing', or 'rehabilitation nursing training', and often described as 'early' interventions (e.g. 'early rehabilitation nursing'). The interventions were multi‐faceted, involving speech and language and psychological therapy, as well as physical therapy and training to enhance function during activities of daily living. These trials often included measures of motor function and activities of daily living. The review authors made the decision that (i) it was not practical to include this large body of evidence within this review and (ii) the studies exploring the effectiveness of these multi‐faceted rehabilitation programmes do not directly address the research question addressed by this Cochrane review, which is specifically focussed on the effect of different approaches to physical rehabilitation. We consider that these trials would best be synthesised within a separate (new) Cochrane review.

### Stroke systems of care framework… [^114gm5sN]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- The Framework highlights the four key components of stroke systems of care that effectively treat patients from the time they have a stroke. Overview Stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability in the United States. State health departments and other organizations can help reduce the number of premature deaths and disabilities from stroke by applying the strategies outlined in the Stroke Systems of Care Framework. The Framework highlights the four key components of stroke systems of care: 1) Pre-hospital 2) EMS 3) Acute Stroke Treatment and 4) Stroke Rehabilitation. These components effectively treat patients from the time they have a stroke, through emergency medical services transport to the hospital and in-hospital care, and through their discharge from the hospital and to outpatient care.

The Framework provides links to a wide range of tools and resources, developed by the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Program grantees, that can help health departments establish or enhance support for integrated stroke systems of care in their state or community. Explore these resources and adapt the strategies to support your program's stroke activities.

### Task-oriented rehabilitation and recovery following motor stroke… [^114i5Aum]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Structured, task-oriented upper extremity training; dose-equivalent occupational therapy; or monitoring-only occupational therapy. The DEUCC group was prescribed 30 one-hour sessions over 10 weeks; the UCC group was only monitored, without specification of dose. Two large rehabilitation trials performed in the long-term phase of stroke, after initial rehabilitation had been completed, suggested that intensive, high-repetition, task-oriented training was superior to usual care for improving upper extremity motor outcomes. 2, 3 With rehabilitation training implemented after spontaneous recovery, improvements can be attributed more directly to the training. Even though the rehabilitation interventions differed in these studies, both incorporated the same principles of high movement repetitions and structured task-oriented practice.

Despite this evidence and expert opinion that more practice enhances recovery, these findings have not been incorporated into clinical practice when patients with stroke actually receive rehabilitation therapy. Typical outpatient treatment sessions last 36 minutes, during which patients engage in an average of only 12 purposeful actions within an otherwise unstructured treatment session.
4. The goal of the Interdisciplinary Comprehensive Arm Rehabilitation Evaluation was to test the efficacy of the same task-oriented approaches during the outpatient phase of rehabilitation, which typically begins within a month after stroke occurrence. ICARE compared 2 different treatment strategies among patients undergoing outpatient rehabilitation for moderate arm motor impairment after stroke.

An overview of the interventions in each treatment group is shown in eTable 2 in Supplement 2. The investigational intervention, a structured, task-oriented upper extremity motor training program, termed the Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program, is a best-practice synthesis implementing neuroscientific evidence regarding motor training approaches and schedules. This program is principle based, impairment focused, 7 task specific, 3 intense, 4 engaging, collaborative, self-directed, 8, 9 and patient centered10; it has been previously described and feasibility tested. 5, 8, 9, 11–14 The ASAP intervention included an initial evaluation and 30 one-hour treatment sessions.

### Recovery after stroke… [^1179UYt2]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Stroke can affect the body in various ways, and rehabilitation is often an important aspect of recovery after stroke. A stroke is an injury to part of the brain that results in the death of brain cells. A stroke can be caused by blockage of blood flow to part of the brain or by a tear of a blood vessel causing bleeding into the brain. After someone experiences a stroke, doctors determine the cause of the stroke, give treatments to limit the amount of brain injury, and recommend therapies to reduce the risk of another stroke. Despite the best medical care, people are often left with impairments after a stroke. The particular deficits that a person might have depend on which part of the brain was injured.

Common deficits after stroke include weakness, numbness, vision problems, slurred speech and swallowing problems, difficulties with language, balance and coordination problems, and problems with thinking. Recovery After Stroke One of the goals after a stroke is to regain as much function and independence as possible. Stroke rehabilitation encompasses a spectrum of activities designed to optimize recovery after stroke. Stroke rehabilitation often involves a team of people with various specializations: Physiatrists and rehabilitation neurologists are medical doctors who specialize in rehabilitation. Rehabilitation nurses coordinate care and provide support throughout the rehabilitation process. Physical therapists focus on improving balance and walking. Occupational therapists focus on improving function in daily activities such as bathing, dressing, and personal hygiene. Speech and language therapists assess and treat problems with speech and language, swallowing, and thinking.

Therapies can take place in hospitals, nursing facilities, outpatient offices or clinics, or at home. Formal rehabilitation programs commonly last for up to 3 or 4 months, but additional recovery efforts may be continued if ongoing improvements are noted. Complications After Stroke In addition to impairments caused by direct brain injury from the stroke, complications can also occur because of changes in the stroke survivor's abilities. For example, if a limb that has been weakened by a stroke is not used or moved for a prolonged period, a contracture may develop. A contracture is a fixed shortening of the muscles or supportive tissues around a joint that limits movement of the joint. Topic: Neurology Muth CC. Recovery After Stroke. JAMA. 2016; 316:

### Use of outpatient rehabilitation among adult stroke survivors… [^113xrX3c]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

1, 2). Approximately 800, 000 American adults experience a stroke each year. Currently, approximately 6 million stroke survivors live in the United States. Participation in stroke rehabilitation, which occurs in diverse settings, has been determined to reduce stroke recurrence and improve functional outcomes and quality of life. Despite longstanding national guidelines recommending stroke rehab, it remains underutilized, especially in the outpatient setting. Professional associations and evidence-based guidelines support the increasing stroke rehab use in health systems and are promoted by the public health community. An analysis of 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data revealed that 30. 7% of stroke survivors reported participation in outpatient rehab for stroke after hospital discharge in 21 states and the District of Columbia.

3), highlighting missed opportunities to reach stroke survivors. Stroke recovery can be a long and complex process, involving multiple domains of therapy and occurs in inpatient rehabilitation facilities, skilled nursing facilities, and outpatient rehabilitation facilities. Benefits of stroke outpatient rehab have been determined to improve patient functional status, survival, cardiovascular risk profiles, and quality of life and reduce risks for recurrent strokes and psychological or stress disorders. Increasing participation in stroke outpatient rehab has been recognized as a national priority. Healthy People 2020* aims to increase the proportion of adult stroke survivors who are appropriately and effectively assessed and referred for rehabilitation services.

The estimates from the Healthy People 2020 objective are high; however, they are reflective of assessment or referral, not participation. The CDC-supported Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Program †† seeks to better understand the care provided to stroke survivors to identify disparities and support quality improvement around the assessment for, effective referral to, and provision of stroke rehab services. Experiences from such programs can support system-level changes that encourage use of stroke rehab services across all subgroups and geographies. Although estimates of stroke outpatient rehab referral might be high, participation in stroke outpatient rehab remains suboptimal. Barriers to participation in stroke outpatient rehab are evident (.
