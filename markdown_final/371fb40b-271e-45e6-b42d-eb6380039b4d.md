## Question

Will Keflex cover streptococcus b foot infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Keflex (cephalexin) is effective for treating a streptococcus B foot infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "streptococcus B" means clinically and whether it is the likely pathogen in a foot infection. Then, I should verify cephalexin's intrinsic activity against Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus, GBS). Next, I will review guideline-based therapy for foot infections, especially diabetic foot infections, to see if cephalexin is recommended empirically. After that, I need to check the FDA label to confirm labeled indications and any caveats. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, severity-based recommendation and note any exceptions or modifications needed for special circumstances.

> Let me first confirm the organism and context. "Streptococcus B" refers to Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS), which is a beta-hemolytic streptococcus and can be isolated from diabetic foot infections, though Staphylococcus aureus remains the predominant pathogen overall; GBS accounts for a meaningful minority in some series, so I should not dismiss it as a possibility in the right clinical setting [^1128w9RX] [^113gFwoU].

> Now, I need to check cephalexin's activity against GBS. Cephalexin is a first-generation oral cephalosporin with reliable in vitro activity against streptococci, including beta-hemolytic streptococci such as GBS; the FDA microbiology section lists activity against streptococcal species, and GBS is among the streptococci covered in clinical indications for skin and skin structure infections, which supports expected activity against GBS in soft-tissue foot infections [^112gCEso] [^111xPr9M].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify guideline alignment for foot infections. The IWGDF/IDSA 2023 guideline recommends, for mild diabetic foot infection without complicating factors, empiric therapy targeting gram-positive cocci with a first-generation cephalosporin such as cephalexin or a semisynthetic penicillinase-resistant penicillin, which directly supports using cephalexin when GBS is a plausible pathogen in a mild presentation [^117HEqj8]. For moderate or severe infections, broader coverage is advised, but that does not negate cephalexin's appropriateness in mild disease or as step-down once cultures and clinical response guide narrowing [^117HEqj8].

> Wait, let me verify the FDA label to ensure there isn't a hidden limitation. The cephalexin label indicates use for skin and skin structure infections caused by susceptible gram-positive bacteria, explicitly including Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, and by extension encompasses streptococcal species such as GBS in appropriate clinical contexts. There is no label restriction excluding GBS from skin and soft tissue indications, which supports its use for streptococcal foot infections when clinically indicated [^113rJUm6] [^111xPr9M].

> I should double-check severity modifiers and when cephalexin would be insufficient. In moderate to severe diabetic foot infection, polymicrobial flora including gram-negative rods and anaerobes are more likely, so empiric regimens should be broader than cephalexin monotherapy; in those settings, agents such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, ertapenem, or combination therapy with MRSA coverage may be indicated initially, with de-escalation to cephalexin if cultures confirm streptococci and the clinical course is favorable [^117HEqj8]. But wait, what if there is concern for MRSA or Pseudomonas? Then cephalexin alone would be inadequate, and guideline-directed MRSA or antipseudomonal coverage should be added or substituted based on risk factors and local epidemiology [^117HEqj8] [^114L4rBo].

> Let me consider dosing and duration to ensure practical accuracy. For adults with a mild foot infection, cephalexin 500 mg orally four times daily for about 7–14 days is reasonable, with adjustments based on clinical response. In children, weight-based dosing of 25–50 mg/kg/day divided every 6–8 hours is standard, with higher doses up to 75–100 mg/kg/day used for severe infections, and duration individualized to response and culture data [^117Kysaj] [^1112uFJm]. I should confirm that therapy is shortened to about 5 days if there is clear improvement by day 5 in uncomplicated cellulitis, but foot infections often warrant at least 7–14 days depending on severity and resolution, consistent with DFI guidance for 1–2 weeks in soft-tissue disease [^116QtZHg] [^112k9Q94].

> But wait, what if the patient has a true immediate penicillin allergy? I need to ensure I don't overstate cross-reactivity. For severe IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, avoid cephalexin and choose non–beta-lactam options; for nonsevere delayed rashes, many clinicians accept first-generation cephalosporins given low cross-reactivity, though I should confirm local policy and patient history before proceeding [^117G3KFZ]. If beta-lactams are contraindicated, clindamycin is a reasonable alternative for streptococcal coverage, acknowledging local resistance patterns and the need to monitor for inducible resistance in staphylococci when present [^117HEqj8].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes — cephalexin will cover streptococcus B (GBS) in a foot infection, and it is an appropriate first-line oral agent for mild, nonpurulent foot infections when gram-positive cocci are the presumed pathogens, with therapy tailored to severity, culture results, and clinical response. For moderate to severe infections or when MRSA or Pseudomonas risk is present, broader empiric therapy is indicated initially, with step-down to cephalexin if cultures and course support streptococcal predominance and clinical improvement [^117HEqj8] [^114L4rBo] [^111xPr9M].

---

Keflex (cephalexin) is appropriate for **mild streptococcal foot infections** [^117HEqj8] because it reliably covers beta-hemolytic streptococci, including group B Streptococcus [^113rJUm6]. It is not active against MRSA [^112gCEso], so add MRSA coverage if risk factors are present [^112z7Dvu] [^114pSATx]. For moderate to severe infections, use broader agents or combination therapy [^117HEqj8] [^1112LV6w], and tailor therapy to culture results [^116jzxmM].

---

## Microbiological coverage of cephalexin against Streptococcus species

Cephalexin is a first-generation cephalosporin with **reliable activity against streptococci**, including group B Streptococcus (GBS) [^113rJUm6]. It is indicated for skin and soft tissue infections caused by susceptible streptococci [^111xPr9M] and is recommended for mild infections when streptococci are the likely pathogens [^117HEqj8].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines support cephalexin for **mild streptococcal foot infections** [^117HEqj8], including those caused by GBS [^1128w9RX]. For moderate to severe infections, broader-spectrum agents or combination therapy are recommended [^117HEqj8] [^115Y6DyW], with therapy tailored to culture results [^116jzxmM].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting cephalexin use in streptococcal foot infections

Although direct RCTs for GBS foot infections are limited, cephalexin is effective for streptococcal skin infections, and **RCTs in cellulitis** show cephalexin achieves high cure rates for streptococcal infections [^1112uFJm] [^1148wif9]. Its efficacy against streptococci is well established [^113rJUm6].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **MRSA coverage**: Cephalexin is not active against MRSA [^112gCEso]; add MRSA coverage if risk factors are present [^112z7Dvu].
- **Polymicrobial infections**: Chronic or severe foot infections may be polymicrobial; consider broader coverage initially [^117HEqj8] [^116jzxmM].
- **Allergies**: Use caution in patients with beta-lactam allergies [^113mHoGr].

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapies

When cephalexin is unsuitable, consider:

| **Antibiotic** | **Coverage** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | - MSSA <br/> - Streptococci <br/> - Some Gram-negatives | Moderate infections [^117HEqj8] |
| Clindamycin | - MSSA <br/> - Streptococci <br/> - Anaerobes | Beta-lactam allergy or MRSA risk [^117HEqj8] [^112z7Dvu] |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | MRSA | MRSA risk or failure of beta-lactams [^112z7Dvu] [^1152eBNE] |
| Linezolid | - MRSA <br/> - Streptococci | Severe infections or beta-lactam allergy [^115KTVPq] |

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Cephalexin achieves high clinical cure rates in streptococcal skin infections, and **RCTs in cellulitis** demonstrate efficacy comparable to combination regimens for uncomplicated cases [^1112uFJm] [^1148wif9]. Effectiveness depends on adherence, dosing, and infection severity [^114pSATx] [^117Kysaj].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Cephalexin is effective for **mild streptococcal foot infections**, including GBS [^1128w9RX] [^117HEqj8]. For moderate to severe infections, use broader agents or combination therapy initially, then tailor to culture results [^1112LV6w] [^116jzxmM]. Add MRSA coverage when risk factors are present [^112z7Dvu] [^114pSATx].

### Treating foot infections in diabetic patients: a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial of linezolid versus ampicillin-sulbactam / amoxicillin-clavulanate [^116aDjbF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Foot infections in diabetic patients are predominantly caused by gram-positive cocci, many of which are now antibiotic resistant. Because linezolid is active against these pathogens, we compared the efficacy and safety of intravenous and oral formulations with that of intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam and intravenous and oral amoxicillin-clavulanate given for 7–28 days in a randomized, open-label, multicenter study of all types of foot infection in diabetic patients (ratio of linezolid to comparator drug recipients, 2:1). Among 371 patients, the clinical cure rates associated with linezolid and the comparators were statistically equivalent overall (81% vs. 71%, respectively) but were significantly higher for linezolid-treated patients with infected foot ulcers (81% vs. 68%; p = 0.018) and for patients without osteomyelitis (87% vs. 72%; p = 0.003). Cure rates were comparable for inpatients and outpatients and for both oral and intravenous formulations. Drug-related adverse events were significantly more common in the linezolid group, but they were generally mild and reversible. Linezolid was at least as effective as aminopenicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitors for treating foot infections in diabetic patients.

### A rare case of osteomyelitis of the clavicle in a child due to group A streptococcal infection [^115GoG8d]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Acute osteomyelitis of the clavicle is rare in the paediatric age group. We treated a 5-year-old boy who presented initially with fever and left shoulder pain, and subsequently developed swelling in the region of the left clavicle. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) was isolated in blood culture. MRI of the clavicle showed osteomyelitis of the medial clavicle. The child had incision and drainage of his clavicular collection. The child received intravenous benzylpenicillin and oral cephalexin in the initial presentation; he was treated with 2 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone and 4 weeks of oral penicillin thereafter with the resolution of his symptoms. There are no previous case reports of osteomyelitis of the clavicle in children caused by GAS. This case highlights the importance of identifying the microbial aetiology in these children to ensure early initiation of treatment with appropriate antibiotics.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116QtZHg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114pSATx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — evaluation and treatment recommendations are as follows: Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cutaneous and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent SSTI; Figure 1) systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against MSSA (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients (as defined in question 13), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infection (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high). Elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). Hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Empirical therapy for diabetic foot infections: are there clinical clues to guide antibiotic selection? [^113MVkuR]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Initial antibiotic therapy for diabetic foot infections is usually empirical. Several principles may help to avoid selecting either an unnecessarily broad or inappropriately narrow regimen. First, clinically severe infections require broad-spectrum therapy, while less severe infections may not. Second, aerobic Gram-positive cocci, particularly Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) for patients at high-risk) should always be covered. Third, therapy should also be targeted at aerobic Gram-negative pathogens if the infection is chronic or has failed to respond to previous antibiotic therapy. Fourth, anti-anaerobe agents should be considered for necrotic or gangrenous infections on an ischaemic limb. Parenteral therapy is needed for severe infections, but oral therapy is adequate for most mild or moderate infections.

American Dental Association guideline — reported penicillin allergy and alternative antibiotics: Although approximately 10% of the population self-reports having a penicillin allergy and less than 1% of the entire population is truly allergic, clinicians should proceed with nonpenicillin drug class antibiotics until further confirmation of a true penicillin allergy, and the panel suggests prescribing oral cephalexin, oral azithromycin, or oral clindamycin; some antibiotics may be less effective or carry a greater risk of harming patients through allergic reactions (penicillin) or Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), the prevention of CDI should be a community priority in addition to a hospital priority, and according to a United Kingdom–based study, the incidence of CDI can be reduced through the appropriate use of antibiotics.

### Effect of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole vs cephalexin alone on clinical cure of uncomplicated cellulitis: a randomized clinical trial [^1112uFJm]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, β-hemolytic streptococci are presumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial regimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared with treatments lacking MRSA activity.

Objective

To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole yields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin alone.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, double-blind, randomized superiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 years with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from April 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound performed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was August 2012.

Interventions

Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n = 248 participants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n = 248 participants).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome determined a priori in the per-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (> 25%), swelling, or tenderness (days 3–4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 8–10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 14–21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than 10%.

Results

Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol analysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15–78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had diabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 (85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to 5.7%; p = 0.50). In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure occurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin group (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 15.5%; p = 0.07). Between-group adverse event rates and secondary outcomes through 7 to 9 weeks, including overnight hospitalization, recurrent skin infections, and similar infection in household contacts, did not differ significantly.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with uncomplicated cellulitis, the use of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone did not result in higher rates of clinical resolution of cellulitis in the per-protocol analysis. However, because imprecision around the findings in the modified intention-to-treat analysis included a clinically important difference favoring cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, further research may be needed.

### Phenotypic and genotypic correlates of penicillin susceptibility in nontoxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae, British columbia, Canada, 2015–2018 [^116SvfaJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Reports of C. diphtheriae outbreaks are becoming increasingly common. In particular, nontoxigenic strains pose a major threat to public health because they are not targeted by the current diphtheria toxoid vaccine and can cause invasive infections. Most (44/45) C. diphtheriae isolates collected at our institution during 2015–2018 were reported as penicillin-intermediate in accordance with the updated 2015 CLSI M45 breakpoints. However, this reclassification of susceptibility does not appear to be supported by evidence of resistance to penicillin at the phenotypic or genotypic level, at least within isolates identified from our institution's inner-city catchment area. In addition, the distribution of MICs for penicillin does not appear to have changed substantially over the 4-year study period.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed 2.2% of isolates in our study were erythromycin-resistant, but none were penicillin-resistant. These results are similar to those from a 2015 study in Canada by Bernard et al. in which 32/195 (16.4%) isolates were erythromycin-resistant (MIC of > 2 mg/L) by broth microdilution susceptibility testing, but none were penicillin-intermediate or penicillin-resistant (MIC of > 1 mg/L).

Misclassification of penicillin susceptibility could have clinical implications. A preference for erythromycin over penicillin as a first-line therapy for C. diphtheriae infection could increase rates of inappropriate treatment because of greater rates of erythromycin resistance observed to date. Another disadvantage of using erythromycin for treating patients with cutaneous diphtheria is that wound cultures positive for C. diphtheriae often are concurrently positive for group A Streptococcus, for which penicillin is the optimal antimicrobial agent.

Maintaining effective antimicrobial options is essential to curtailing future outbreaks. The change in the breakpoint for penicillin susceptibility published in the CLSI M45 third edition in 2015 could affect treatment decisions by clinicians. Clinical outcomes are unclear for patients with C. diphtheriae infection with MICs in the 0.12–1 mg/L range. A 2011 case report in Canada described a multidrug resistant C. diphtheriae isolate harboring the ermX gene and exhibiting resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, and sulfonamide. The isolate had an MIC of penicillin of 0.25 mg/L and the patient ultimately was treated successfully with cephalexin.

### The role of novel antibiotics in the management of diabetic foot infection [^112QRpZM]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Ceftazidime/Avibactam

The combination of ceftazidime, a third generation cephalosporin, and avibactam, a non- β -lactam inhibitor of β -lactamases, is effective against a spectrum of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa, KPC, ESBL and oxacillinase (OXA) 48, but not against Acinetobacter and Ambler class B metallo- β -lactamases (MBL), while it has poor activity against anaerobic bacteria. It is approved for complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI). Notably, case series suggest that ceftazidime/avibactam is effective in the treatment of bone and joint infection. Moreover, current guidelines recommend the use of ceftazidime monotherapy for moderately severe or severe infections to cover gram-negative bacteria and Pseudomonas. Therefore, ceftazidime/avibactam might have a role in the management of diabetic foot infection caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa. However, ceftazidime/avibactam is affected by mechanisms of resistance such as efflux pumps and porin channel mutations that are commonly used by multidrug resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas and is less effective in vitro than ceftolozane/tazobactam against MDR Pseudomonas.

Ceftolozane-Tazobactam

Ceftolozane is a fifth-generation cephalosporin and is effective against P. aeruginosa. Its combination with tazobactam was first approved in 2015 for the management of complicated cUTIs and cIAIs. Ceftolozane/tazobactam is effective against gram-negative bacilli, including ESBL Enterobacteriaceae and MDR P. aeruginosa, but has minimal activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly Streptococcus and Enterococcus species. Therefore, ceftolozane/tazobactam might have a role in diabetic foot infection caused by MDR gram-negative bacteria. A case of a patient with diabetic foot infection due to MDR P. aeruginosa who was successfully managed with ceftolozane-tazobactam in combination with fosfomycin was recently reported.

### IWGDF / IDSA guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes-related foot infections (IWGDF / IDSA 2023) [^116jzxmM]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Diabetic foot infection pathogens and stewardship — management notes emphasize that in case of mild infections the most likely causative organisms are gram‑positive pathogens (beta‑haemolytic streptococci and S. aureus), Pseudomonas species are less commonly isolated in studies from North America and Europe but more prevalent in studies from (sub)tropical climates, and for these mild infections there is time to adjust antibiotic therapy based on cultures, with therapy adjusted to target cultured bacteria if the infection does not resolve. Given the complexity and often polymicrobial nature of DFI, definitive treatment "should especially be based on principles of antibiotic stewardship", including source control with surgery if possible, starting empiric therapy with the narrowest spectrum, shortest duration, fewest adverse effects, safest and least expensive route, and switching to targeted (preferably oral) therapy based on cultured pathogens. To avoid colonisers and unjustified broad‑spectrum prescribing, sample quality is stressed, and "clinicians should consider consulting the infectious diseases/microbiology expert" for difficult cases such as those due to unusual or highly resistant pathogens. Evidence synthesis indicates that "no antibiotic class or agent has been found to be superior" for DFIs except for two studies (tigecycline significantly worse than ertapenem; ertapenem slightly lower clinical cure rate than piperacillin‑tazobactam), and "two recent retrospective studies, and one systematic review of RCTs", confirmed the absence of evidence to recommend any specific antibiotic choice regarding efficacy and final cure.

### Recommendations for systemic antimicrobial therapy in fracture-related infection: a consensus from an international expert group [^111AzsSA]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Streptococcus Species

The expert group recommendations for streptococcal infections are based on the IDSA PJI guidelines. Beta-lactam antibiotics are the agent of choice, although it is known that antibiotics that target the cell wall may be ineffective once the initial phase has passed, due to the slower growth rate of adherent bacteria, during which cell wall synthesis is reduced. However, poor efficacy of these beta-lactams has not been demonstrated in streptococcal implant-associated infections.– Intravenous beta-lactam therapy should be given for up to a week followed by oral therapy with amoxicillin (Table 1).

After prompt debridement, it is recommended (if there is no history of penicillin allergy) to start with IV benzyl penicillin 4 million units (2.4 g) every 4 hours (24 MU/day) or 5 million units (3.0 g) every 6 hours (20 MU/day). When the MIC value is < 0.1 mg/L, the dosage can be adjusted to 12–18 MU/day. If there is a history of nonimmediate, nonsevere penicillin allergy (eg, a delayed rash), an alternative is ceftriaxone or cefotaxime (Table 1). In case of penicillin allergy, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, and clindamycin are alternatives, depending on susceptibility testing.

Despite good activity of rifampicin against planktonic streptococci, it has been observed in clinical studies that it has no activity on streptococcal biofilms. Therefore, despite some studies showing a beneficial effect of rifampicin, the expert group does currently not recommend rifampicin for streptococcal FRI infections.

Appropriate culture and susceptibility studies should be performed to determine the susceptibility of the causative organisms to CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP. Therapy may be started while awaiting the results of these studies.

In randomized comparative studies, CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP and cephalothin were comparably safe and effective in the management of infections caused by gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods susceptible to the cephalosporins. CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP has a high degree of stability in the presence of bacterial beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases.

Many infections caused by aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacteria resistant to some cephalosporins respond to CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP. Similarly, many infections caused by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria resistant to some penicillin antibiotics (ampicillin, carbenicillin, penicillin G) respond to treatment with CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP. Many infections caused by mixtures of susceptible aerobic and anaerobic bacteria respond to treatment with CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP.

Prevention:

CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP is indicated for the prophylaxis of infection in patients undergoing uncontaminated gastrointestinal surgery, vaginal hysterectomy, abdominal hysterectomy, or cesarean section.

If there are signs of infection, specimens for culture should be obtained for identification of the causative organism so that appropriate treatment may be instituted.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP and other antibacterial drugs, CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Occurrence of group A β-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis in the four months after treatment of an index episode with amoxicillin once-daily or twice-daily or with cephalexin [^1116x8JG]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Prospective studies using bacterial eradication as the endpoint have demonstrated that once-daily amoxicillin is as effective as twice-daily amoxicillin for treatment of group A β-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine, in a retrospective study, whether treatment of symptomatic GABHS pharyngitis with once-daily amoxicillin was as effective in preventing clinical recurrences as twice-daily amoxicillin or cephalexin in pediatric office practice, using patient-initiated return visits for streptococcal pharyngitis as a pragmatic, clinical endpoint.

Methods

The charts of consecutive patients 2 years of age and older with laboratory-proven GABHS pharyngitis for a period of 2 years were reviewed to identify index cases of streptococcal pharyngitis and subsequent episodes. Age, weight, antibiotic treatment and time from index to subsequent episodes of GABHS pharyngitis were recorded.

Results

In 1402 index episodes, patients received amoxicillin once-daily (231), amoxicillin twice-daily (846) or cephalexin (325). The risk of symptomatic streptococcal pharyngitis in the 4 months after treatment of the index episode was not statistically different among the 3 treatment groups: amoxicillin once-daily (15.1%), amoxicillin twice-daily (19.6%) and cephalexin (19.1%). There was a trend toward reduction in the risk of recurrences in the 6 weeks after completion of antibiotics in the cephalexin (9%) group compared with the combined amoxicillin (13%) groups.

Conclusions

Amoxicillin once-daily or twice-daily was equally effective in terms of frequency of recurrence of symptomatic GABHS pharyngitis.

### Β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: a dose-response meta-analysis [^111iSPHV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Since the discovery of penicillin, antibiotics have contributed significantly in extending human life expectancy by 23 years. Widespread resistance among common bacterial pathogens and slow development of replacement compounds or alternative therapies threaten these recent gains. It is estimated that approximately 1.27 million annual deaths are attributable to bacterial antimicrobial resistance.

Antibiotic resistance is selected for when bacteria are exposed to subtherapeutic levels of antibiotics that would otherwise inhibit their growth or kill them, making the remedy itself one of the primary drivers and risk factors for antibiotic resistance. The relationship between antibiotics and resistance is dose dependent: Higher antibiotic consumption correlates with more resistant infections. The association between level of antibiotics administered and resistance development has been demonstrated at the bacterial colony level, at the individual-patient level, and among human populations at the country level.

However, resistance is not necessarily a persistent trait of pathogens, and decreased resistance rates have been demonstrated following antibiotic withdrawal both at the individual and community levels. Prolonged treatment to ensure clearing the infection, therefore, comes at the cost of providing more sustained periods over which resistant pathogens have a competitive advantage. This has led to a recent challenge in the dogma of always completing antibiotic courses. For example, randomized controlled trials have shown that shorter treatment schedules for both hospital- and community-acquired pneumonia yield equivalent outcomes to longer courses, but with fewer infection recurrences and reduced rates of antibiotic resistance. Understanding the patient-level temporality of resistance emergence and waning thereby offers important insight into prescriptive practice.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have provided useful indication of this temporality. Costelloe et al investigated subsequent antibiotic resistance in individuals prescribed antibiotics in primary care, showing a 2.5 increase in odds of resistance within 2 months of treatment for urinary tract infections, which waned to 1.3 within 12 months. However, among those treated for respiratory tract infections, the odds of antibiotic resistance remained 2.4 times higher (compared to those not treated with antibiotics) over the whole year. Bakhit et al pooled analyses across bacterial species instead of infection site, showing a 4.2 increase in odds of resistance after receiving penicillin-class treatment for Streptococcus pneumoniae within the first week posttreatment, waning to a 1.7 increase in odds after 1 month. A similar trend was found for cephalosporin-class treatment of this pathogen: 2.2 increase in odds within the first week, waning to 1.6 increase in odds after 1 month.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^1162fyQt]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot infection — surgical, antimicrobial, and wound management is outlined as follows: Life-threatening infections necessitate immediate surgical attention without delay. Polymicrobial infection should be anticipated with gram positive cocci, gram negative rods, and anaerobic organisms predominating; accordingly, empirical antibiotic therapy typically includes broad-spectrum coverage for isolates from each of these three categories, and fully comprehensive empiric coverage is usually unnecessary unless the infection is life-threatening. Hospital therapies are usually initiated with intravenous medications, although most oral fluoroquinolones and oral linezolid have the same bioavailability as parenteral therapy, and current evidence available supports the efficacy of initial parenteral therapy followed by the appropriate oral agent. If recurrent infection develops during therapy, repeat cultures should be obtained to assess for superinfection. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci must be detected early and treated appropriately to avoid further tissue loss or extension of infection. The surgical wound may require repeated surgical debridement; wound care is initiated on day 1 or day 2 postsurgery and may initially involve saline gauze dressing changes, and negative pressure wound therapy (V. A.C. KCI, San Antonio, TX) has been found particularly useful. If the wound fails to show signs of healing, the patient's vascularity, nutritional status, infection control, and wound off-loading must be re-evaluated. Once soft tissue infection is under control and osseous infection management has been initiated, consideration may be given to wound closure or definitive amputation. Osteomyelitis and septic arthritis identified clinically or by imaging require a sampling of bone for microbiologic and histopathologic evaluation.

### The role of novel antibiotics in the management of diabetic foot infection [^117PYicF]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic foot infection is a leading cause of non-traumatic lower limb amputation. It is also associated with increased risk for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. According to current guidelines, the management of severe diabetic foot infection consists of assessment for need for surgical treatment, evaluation for peripheral arterial disease and urgent management if present and administration of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment targeting both gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobes. The antibiotic therapy should then be adjusted based on both the clinical response and culture findings. The most common pathogens causing diabetic foot infection are Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, whereas almost one fifth of cases are polymicrobial. However, the presence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens is becoming more frequent in diabetic foot infection. Indeed, almost 20% of bacteria causing diabetic foot infection are multidrug resistant, particularly S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Accordingly, the incidence of failure of antibiotic treatment is also rising. Overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics is a major cause of the emergence of resistant bacteria. An earlier meta-analysis did not identify clear differences in resolution of diabetic foot infection among conventional carbapenems, antipseudomonal penicillins and cephalosporins. In this context, recently approved antibiotics might have a role in the management of difficult-to-treat diabetic foot infections.

In the present review, we summarize the role of novel antibiotics in the management of these patients. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any new studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113voFEA]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Dosing and duration of prophylactic antibiotics — women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) most commonly receive daily dosing; fosfomycin used prophylactically is dosed every 10 days. Intermittent versus daily prophylaxis showed no difference in risk of ≥ 1 UTI (2 studies; RR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.50, I2 = 0%); in individual trials, single-dose exposures versus daily antibiotics had RR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.51, and single-dose ciprofloxacin after sexual intercourse versus daily dosing had RR: 1.24; 95% CI: 0.29 to 5.32. Reported prophylaxis duration ranged from 6 to 12 months, while in practice it can be from three to six months to one year with periodic assessment, and continuing prophylaxis for years is not evidence-based. Continuous prophylaxis dosing options include: TMP 100 mg once daily; TMP-SMX 40 mg/200 mg once daily; TMP-SMX 40 mg/200 mg thrice weekly; Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 50 mg daily; Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg daily; Cephalexin 125 mg once daily; Cephalexin 250 mg once daily; Fosfomycin 3 g every 10 days.

Cefoxitin Injection, USP has a high degree of stability in the presence of bacterial beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases.

Many infections caused by aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacteria resistant to some cephalosporins respond to cefoxitin. Similarly, many infections caused by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria resistant to some penicillin antibiotics (ampicillin, carbenicillin, penicillin G) respond to treatment with Cefoxitin Injection, USP. Many infections caused by mixtures of susceptible aerobic and anaerobic bacteria respond to treatment with Cefoxitin Injection, USP.

### Efficacy of cephalexin two vs. three times daily vs. cefadroxil once daily for streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis [^114KHMjC]. Clinical Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare the bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of oral cephalexin twice vs. three times daily vs. cefadroxil once daily as therapy for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) tonsillopharyngitis. A prospective open-label, observational cohort study was conducted over 18 months (January 2000-June 2001). Children enrolled had an acute onset of symptoms and signs of a tonsillopharyngeal illness and a laboratory-documented GABHS infection. Follow-up examination and laboratory testing occurred 21 ± 4 days following enrollment. Two hundred seventy-one patients were enrolled (intent to treat group): 63 received cephalexin twice daily, 124 received cephalexin three times daily, and 84 received cefadroxil once daily. Fifty-three children did not return for the follow-up visit, leaving 218 patients in the per-protocol group: 54 cephalexin twice-daily treated, 94 cephalexin 3-times daily treated, and 70 cefadroxil once-daily treated. In the per-protocol group, bacteriologic cure for those treated with cephalexin twice daily was 87%, for cephalexin 3 times daily, it was 81% and for cefadroxil once daily it was 81% (p = 0.61). The clinical cure rate for cephalexin twice-daily treatment was 91%; for three-times daily, it was 86%; and for cefadroxil once daily, it was 84% (p = 0.56). Because treatment allocation was not randomized, logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for treatment group differences. Younger age of patient was significantly associated with bacteriologic (p = 0.04) and clinical (p = 0.01) failure independent of treatment group but in the adjusted logistic model no differences were found among the 3 treatment regimens. Cephalexin dosed twice daily or three times daily and cefadroxil dosed once daily appear equivalent in bacteriologic and clinical cure of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis.

### Over prescription of antibiotics for adult pharyngitis is prevalent in developing countries but can be reduced using mcIsaac modification of Centor scores: a cross-sectional study [^115xmsaM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

First-line antibiotics included penicillin (oral penicillin V 500 mg every 8 hours for 10 days; benzyl penicillin 0.6–1.2 million units IM once; oral ampicillin 500 mg every 6 hours for 10 days; oral amoxicillin 500 mg every 8 hours for 10 days). Appropriate alternative second-line agents included cephalexin (500 mg every 12 hours for 10 days) and other first-generation cephalosporins, cefaclor (500 mg every 8 hours orally for 10 days), a second-generation cephalosporin and erythromycin for penicillin-allergic patients (250 mg p.o. every 6 hours or 500 mg every 12 or 6 hours for 10 days).

Third-line agents were considered inappropriate, because they are too broad-spectrum, or do not have adequate activity. Broad-spectrum agents included amoxicillin-clavulanate (500–875 mg orally every 12 hours for 10 days), second-generation macrolides such as clarithromycin (250 mg orally every 12 hours for 5 days), azithromycin (500 mg orally on day 1; 250 mg on days 2–5 for 5 days) and roxithromycin (150 mg orally every 12 hours or 300 mg once daily for 10 days), broader-spectrum second-generation cephalosporins like cefuroxime (250 mg or 500 mg every 12 hours for 5–10 days) and third-generation cephalosporins like cefixime (400 mg orally daily for 5 days). Use of erythromycin for non-penicillin allergic patients was also considered inappropriate. Finally, antibiotics not recommended for Gram-negative pathogens were also considered to be inappropriate or third-line agents; these included fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin); sulfonamides such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and tetracyclines (e.g. doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline, and oxytetracycline).

Study outcomes and statistics

The primary outcome was the prevalence of GABHS infection in the adult pharyngitis patients from a low socioeconomic setting. Secondary outcomes included 1) number of prescriptions used for adult pharyngitis; 2) appropriateness of prescribed antibiotics; and 3) diagnostic accuracy of the Modified Centor criteria.

By comparing patients' culture results, we could determine the prevalence of infection. To determine whether patients received appropriate or inappropriate prescriptions, culture results were compared with antibiotic prescriptions. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive value of the McIsaac score approach was determined by ratios of false positives, true positives, false negatives and true negatives.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^111MrCFQ]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

PIDS/IDSA pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) empiric therapy decisions are best informed by review of the most recent data on ABA pathogens identified in a clinician's region, particularly with respect to susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) isolates. Across reports, bacterial pathogens other than S. aureus accounted for from 15.4% to 92.1%, with Group A Streptococcus representing up to 14% in some studies; outside S. aureus, Kingella kingae, and group A Streptococcus, no other pathogen occurred in greater than 5% of cases in any study. For S. aureus coverage, many isolates remain susceptible to anti-staphylococcal penicillins (ASP) such as oxacillin and nafcillin and to first-generation cephalosporins such as cefazolin and cephalexin; cefazolin and nafcillin/oxacillin are considered therapeutically equivalent in pediatric ABA, although no comparative data are available for an ASP and cefazolin. In regions with low rates of CA-MRSA arthritis (less than ~10%), some experts begin therapy with oxacillin/nafcillin or cefazolin for children with mild to moderate illness, watching closely for a response to treatment. Where resistance to methicillin is estimated to be 10–20% or greater, consideration should be given for empiric therapy to include agents active against invasive CA-MRSA, and effective empiric therapy for CA-MRSA ABA is expected with clindamycin (unless local clindamycin resistance rates are high), vancomycin, daptomycin, ceftaroline, and linezolid. Clindamycin resistance occurs in both MRSA and MSSA and should be a factor in selecting empiric therapy, with documented rates of 5% to 40% of all S. aureus isolates.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^114QfSin]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Which Empirical Antimicrobial Agents Are Preferred for Osteomyelitis?

Based on data from observational studies, if antibiotic therapy cannot be delayed until culture availability, it is reasonable to empirically cover aerobic gram-positive cocci, especially S aureus, and gram-negative bacilli (Table 2; eTable 2 in Supplement 2). Many practitioners routinely provide anaerobic coverage for DFO; however, comparative data are not available to establish the clinical benefit or harm of this approach. Inclusion of empirical therapy targeting methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa depends on the presence of specific risk factors (addressed below). In all cases, local susceptibility patterns, patient-specific risk factors, and prior culture data influence the choice of antibiotic selection. Culture results can be used to tailor empirical therapy when possible.

Table 2.
Reasonable Empirical Antimicrobial Therapy Options With Published Data a

Abbreviations: PJI, prosthetic joint infection; TMP-SMX, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

When Should Antimicrobial Coverage Targeting MRSA Be Included?

Based on culture data from observational studies, inclusion of empirical anti-MRSA coverage depends on local prevalence and patient-specific risk factors, such as known colonization status (which is the biggest individual risk factor), prior positive cultures, and health care exposure. In a setting with low MRSA incidence, no known MRSA colonization or prior positive cultures, and minimal health care contact, it is reasonable to withhold empirical MRSA coverage.

When Should Antimicrobial Coverage Against P Aeruginosa Be Included?

Based on culture data from observational studies, routine use of empirical antipseudomonal therapy for osteomyelitis is unnecessary. Such agents are added in the presence of specific risk factors, including patients with chronic wounds who have: (1) been exposed to multiple prior courses of antibiotics; (2) previously had cultures positive for P aeruginosa; (3) gangrenous wounds; (4) had a recent surgical procedure (eg, within 3 months, as with early PJI); or (5) specific sites of infection particularly associated with pseudomonal infection (eg, malignant otitis externa).

Does Bone Penetration of an Antimicrobial Agent Matter Clinically, and Should It Be Used to Select Therapy?

Outcome data related to antibiotic bone penetration are limited for osteomyelitis. Thus, theoretical bone penetration (eTable 3 in Supplement 2) is not the primary driver of antibiotic selection; published clinical outcomes data are more relevant.

Table 4 — empirical antibiotic therapy according to clinical presentation and microbiological data aligns infection severity and risk factors with likely pathogens and candidate agents. For mild infection with no complicating factors targeting gram‑positive cocci (GPC), potential regimens include semisynthetic penicillinase‑resistant penicillin (cloxacillin) or 1st generation cephalosporins (cephalexin). For mild infection with β‑lactam allergy or intolerance (GPC), options include clindamycin, fluoroquinolone (levo/moxi‑floxacin), trimethoprim‑sulfamethoxazole, or doxycycline. For moderate or severe infection without complicating factors (GPC ± GNR), options include β‑lactam; β‑lactamase inhibitor regimens (amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam), 2nd or 3rd generation cephalosporins (cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), or group 1 carbapenem (ertapenem). For moderate or severe infection with MRSA risk factors, the table states to "consider adding, or substituting with" glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin), linezolid, daptomycin, fusidic acid, trimethoprim‑sulfamethoxazole, or doxycycline. Footnotes specify practical use: antibiotics enclosed in boxes are cited as examples; "where more than one agent is listed, only one of them should be prescribed unless otherwise indicated"; "oral antibiotic agents should generally not be used for severe infections, except as a follow‑on (switch) after initial parenteral therapy"; and clinicians should "consider modifying doses or agents selected for patients with comorbidities such as azotaemia, liver dysfunction, and obesity".

Question 2: What is the most common cause of leukocytoclastic vasculitis?
A. Infection
B. Connective tissues disease
C. Idiopathic
D. Malignancy
E. Drug induced

Answers:
A. Infection – Incorrect. Many infections have previously been associated with LCV; however, most cases are found to be idiopathic.
B. Connective tissues disease – Incorrect. Connective tissues diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis have been found in association with LCV.
C. Idiopathic – Correct. The etiology of LCV is broad, encompassing various infections, connective tissue diseases, cryoglobulinemia, malignancies, and drugs. A majority of cases are idiopathic.
D. Malignancy – Incorrect. LCV has been associated with lymphoproliferative diseases, solid organ tumors, and other hematologic malignancies.
E. Drug induced – Incorrect. While many medications have been associated with LCV, thiazides, sulfonamides, penicillamine, gold, and allopurinol have most commonly been implicated.

Question 3: What is the best treatment for this condition?
A. Valacyclovir
B. Supportive treatment
C. IM penicillin
D. Prednisone
E. Cephalexin

Answers:
A. Valacyclovir – Incorrect. Valacyclovir is used to treat herpes virus related infections.
B. Supportive treatment – Incorrect. Supportive treatment can be used in cases of LCV where an underlying causative factor has not been identified.
C. IM penicillin – Correct. Treatment of the causative factor of LCV, which in this case was syphilis, led to prompt resolution of the patient's symptoms.
D. Prednisone – Incorrect. Prednisone can be used to treat a multitude of conditions associated with LCV, such as connective tissue disease.
E. Cephalexin – Incorrect. Antibiotic treatment with cephalexin would only be warranted if this condition was thought to be due to an infection from streptococcus or staphylococcus bacteria.

### Antibiotic therapy in necrotizing soft tissue infections: a narrative review of the greater paris SURFAST consortium [^115ULRtz]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are uncommon, yet rapidly progressive and potentially fatal conditions. However, evidence-based guidance on antibiotic therapy remains limited. Current recommendations emphasize the need for broad-spectrum empirical coverage, including gram-positive, gram-negative, anaerobes, and Streptococcus pyogenes when clinically indicated. We aimed at developing a practical, evidence-based framework for empirical antibiotic therapy in NSTIs. This narrative review is informed by a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, without date restrictions. We propose a structured decision-making algorithm for empirical antibiotic selection in NSTIs, integrating key clinical parameters: infection site, healthcare-associated versus community-acquired origin, risk factors for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and signs of sepsis or septic shock. Alternative regimens are provided for patients with severe β-lactam allergies. Special considerations for immunocompromised and other vulnerable host populations are also addressed. This review offers clinicians a pragmatic, stepwise approach to antibiotic therapy in NSTIs, while identifying critical knowledge gaps and priorities for future research.

### Update on treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections [^117G3KFZ]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Dermatologists treat a variety of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (uSSSIs) such as folliculitis, impetigo, erysipelas, cellulitis, furuncles, carbuncles, and non-perirectal abscesses. Most uSSSIs are caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The new extended-spectrum cephalosporins (cefdinir, cefpodoxime) offer efficacy against most Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Despite recently published guidelines, many physicians do not prescribe cephalosporins for uSSSIs out of concern that these agents will produce a hypersensitivity reaction in patients allergic to penicillin. Although the rate of cephalosporin reaction in penicillin-allergic patients is often quoted as up to 10%, this rate does not take into account the 1% to 3% risk for allergy to cephalosporin alone and the nonspecific increased risk of penicillin-allergic patients to develop hypersensitivity to other drugs. When these additional risks are considered, the likelihood of a reaction in known penicillin-allergic patients, especially to most third-generation and extended spectrum cephalosporins, becomes less than 1%. Cephalosporins with side chains unlike those of penicillin or ampicillin side chains are less likely to result in an allergic reaction in penicillin or ampicillin-allergic patients than cephalosporins with similar side chains. Although both cefdinir and cefpodoxime are considered to carry a very low risk of cross reactivity with penicillin or ampicillin, the former demonstrates better activity against S. aureus. Among the late-generation cephalosporins, cefdinir is the most potent oral agent when tested against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, 4- to 16-fold more active than cefprozil and cephalexin, respectively.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^1152eBNE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Executive summary

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions involving the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle and ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing infections that may involve the dermal, subcutaneous, fascia, and muscle layers.

SSTIs may affect any part of the body, although the lower extremities, the perineum, and the abdominal wall are the most common sites of involvement. SSTIs are a relatively infrequent clinical problem; however, surgeons are often called upon for their management.

These guidelines focus mainly on necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs). The mortality resulting from NSTIs appears to have decreased over the past decade, possibly due to improved recognition and earlier delivery of more effective therapy.

Successful management of NSTIs involves prompt recognition, timely surgical debridement or drainage, aggressive resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

A worldwide international panel of experts developed evidenced-based guidelines for management of soft tissue infections. The guidelines outline clinical recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy criteria summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Grading of recommendations from Guyatt and colleagues

Surgical site infections

1) Surgical site infections require prompt and wide opening of the surgical incision. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended for deep incisional surgical site infections if systemic signs of sepsis are present, if source control is incomplete or in immunocompromised patients (Recommendation 1 C).

2) In patients who have had clean operations, antimicrobial therapy should cover gram-positive organisms; in contrast, in patients who have had procedures on the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract antimicrobial therapy should cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (Recommendation 1 C).

Non necrotizing superficial soft tissue infections

3) Erysipelas, and cellulitis are managed by antimicrobial therapy against Gram-positive bacteria (Recommendation 1 C).

4) Lack of clinical response for cellulitis may be due to resistant strains of staphylococcus or streptococcus, or deeper processes, such as necrotizing fasciitis or myonecrosis (Recommendation 1 C).

5) Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours (Recommendation 1 C).

6) If a streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is suspected, an antiribosomal agent such as clindamycin or linezolid can be used to reduce exotoxin and superantigen production (Recommendation 1 C).

### Meta-analysis of cephalosporin versus penicillin treatment of group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis in children [^117KLMJ9]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To conduct a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials of cephalosporin versus penicillin treatment of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) tonsillopharyngitis in children.

Methodology

Medline, Embase, reference lists, and abstract searches were conducted to identify randomized, controlled trials of cephalosporin versus penicillin treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis in children. Trials were included if they met the following criteria: patients < 18 years old, bacteriologic confirmation of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis, random assignment to antibiotic therapy of an orally administered cephalosporin or penicillin for 10 days of treatment, and assessment of bacteriologic outcome using a throat culture after therapy. Primary outcomes of interest were bacteriologic and clinical cure rates. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of careful clinical illness descriptions, compliance monitoring, GABHS serotyping, exclusion of GABHS carriers, and timing of the test-of-cure visit.

Results

Thirty-five trials involving 7125 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The overall summary odds ratio (OR) for the bacteriologic cure rate significantly favored cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR: 3.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.49–3.67, with the individual cephalosporins [cephalexin, cefadroxil, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefprozil, cefixime, ceftibuten, and cefdinir] showing superior bacteriologic cure rates). The overall summary OR for clinical cure rate was 2.33 (95% CI: 1.84–2.97), significantly favoring the same individual cephalosporins. There was a trend for diminishing bacterial cure with penicillin over time, comparing the trials published in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Sensitivity analyses for bacterial cure significantly favored cephalosporin treatment over penicillin treatment when trials were grouped as double-blind (OR: 2.31; 95% CI: 1.39–3.85), high-quality (OR: 2.50; 95% CI: 1.85–3.36) trials with well-defined clinical status (OR: 2.12; 95% CI: 1.54–2.90), with detailed compliance monitoring (OR: 2.85; 95% CI: 2.33–3.47), with GABHS serotyping (OR: 3.10; 95% CI: 2.42–3.98), with carriers eliminated (OR: 2.51; 95% CI: 1.55–4.08), and with test of cure 3 to 14 days posttreatment (OR: 3.53; 95% CI: 2.75–4.54). Analysis of comparative bacteriologic cure rates for the 3 generations of cephalosporins did not show a difference.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis indicates that the likelihood of bacteriologic and clinical failure of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis is significantly less if an oral cephalosporin is prescribed, compared with oral penicillin.

### Lower limb cellulitis and its mimics: part I. lower limb cellulitis [^115JcYR7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

An aging population and obesity have both contributed to a rising incidence of lower limb cellulitis; the most important predisposing factors include older age, obesity, venous insufficiency, saphenous venectomy, and edema. Streptococci are the most commonly implicated pathogen, and often reside in the interdigital toes spaces. Any disruption of the skin surface can allow the organism to invade. Effective management requires an appropriate antibiotic and attention to the predisposing factors. This article summarizes the epidemiology and treatment of this common infection.

### Cefdinir: an advanced-generation, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin [^112FMZJx]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Cefdinir is an advanced-generation, broad-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agent that has been approved for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute maxillary sinusitis, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, acute bacterial otitis media, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections in adult and pediatric patients.

Objective

The purpose of this article was to review the in vitro antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, and potential role of cefdinir.

Methods

Studies were identified by a MEDLINE search (January 1983-September 2001) of the English-language medical literature, a review of identified articles and their bibliographies, and a review of data on file with the manufacturer. Clinical efficacy data were selected from all published trials mentioning cefdinir. Information concerning in vitro susceptibility, safety, chemistry, and the pharmacokinetic profile of cefdinir also was reviewed.

Results

Cefdinir has a broad spectrum of activity against many gram-negative and gram-positive aerobic organisms, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefdinir is stable to hydrolysis by 13 of the common beta-lactamases. It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (mean time to peak plasma concentration, 3 hours) and is almost entirely eliminated via renal clearance of unchanged drug. The terminal disposition half-life of cefdinir is approximately 1.5 hours. Efficacy has been demonstrated in 19 clinical trials in adults and children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (eg, pharyngitis, sinusitis, acute otitis media, acute bronchitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia), and skin and skin-structure infections. The adverse-event profile is similar to that of comparator agents, although in 4 adult and adolescent studies and 1 adult study, diarrhea occurred significantly more frequently in cefdinir recipients than in recipients of penicillin V, cephalexin, cefaclor, and cefprozil.

Conclusions

Cefdinir is an alternative to other antimicrobial agents and can be dosed once or twice daily for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections. Similar to other oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, cefdinir has activity against common pathogens of the respiratory tract and skin and is stable in the presence of selected beta-lactamases. The clinical choice of an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin will be based on patient acceptance, frequency of administration, and cost.

### Cephalexin [^112gCEso]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Cephalexin is a cephalosporin antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption:

Cephalexin is acid stable and may be given without regard to meals. Following doses of 250 mg, 500 mg, and 1 g, average peak serum levels of approximately 9, 18, and 32 mcg/mL, respectively, were obtained at 1 hour. Serum levels were detectable 6 hours after administration (at a level of detection of 0.2 mcg/mL).

Distribution:

Cephalexin is approximately 10% to 15% bound to plasma proteins.

Excretion:

Cephalexin is excreted in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Studies showed that over 90% of the drug was excreted unchanged in the urine within 8 hours. During this period, peak urine concentrations following the 250 mg, 500 mg, and 1 g doses were approximately 1000, 2200, and 5000 mcg/mL respectively.

Drug Interactions:

In healthy subjects given single 500 mg doses of cephalexin and metformin, plasma metformin mean Cmaxand AUC increased by an average of 34% and 24%, respectively, and metformin mean renal clearance decreased by 14%. No information is available about the interaction of cephalexin and metformin following multiple doses of either drug.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Cephalexin is a bactericidal agent that acts by the inhibition of bacterial cell-wall synthesis.

Resistance

Methicillin-resistant staphylococci and most isolates of enterococci are resistant to cephalexin. Cephalexin is not active against most isolates of Enterobacter spp. Morganella morganii, and Proteus vulgaris. Cephalexin has no activity against Pseudomonas spp., or Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae is usually cross-resistant to beta-lactam antibacterial drugs.

Antimicrobial Activity

Cephalexin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Gram-positive bacteria

Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only)

Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates)

Gram-negative bacteria

Escherichia coli

Haemophilus influenzae

### Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in community-acquired skin infections [^116meoHB]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our report demonstrates that the proportion of patients with community-acquired SSTI caused by MRSA is increasing, and CA-MRSA is now the most common cause of community-acquired SSTIs at our center. Other reports have suggested that CA-MRSA is becoming more common in other geographic areas in the United States and Europe. A high proportion of CA-MRSA strains (such as the USA 300 ST:8 strain) have been found to carry the Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene, which has been associated with SSTI and necrotizing pneumonia. We have noted anecdotally that many patients with CA-MRSA exhibit a spontaneous abscess or furunculosis that the patient thinks was caused by a spider bite.

The bacterial causes of common community-acquired SSTIs are generally gram-positive organisms such as S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Because of the predictable etiology of these infections, most physicians do not routinely obtain cultures from these patients. Obtaining cultures of SSTIs is now of greater importance to monitor the extent of CA-MRSA infections in one's community and guide therapy in areas in which CA-MRSA is already prevalent.

Most community-acquired SSTIs are treated with antimicrobial drugs such as cephalexin and dicloxacillin. Patients requiring intravenous therapy are most commonly given agents such as cefazolin or oxacillin. In areas with a high prevalence of CA-MRSA, empiric treatment for SSTIs with β-lactam agents such as cephalexin or dicloxacillin may no longer be appropriate. Oral agents such as clindamycin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and rifampin should be considered for CA-MRSA. Although inducible clindamycin resistance was not found in the few patients we tested, clinical failure due to inducible clindamycin resistance among CA-MRSA has been reported. Whether the addition of rifampin to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole improves outcomes in SSTI is not clear, but this combination appears to be more effective in eradicating MRSA colonization. Macrolides, tetracycline, and fluoroquinolones have inconsistent activity against the MRSA isolates identified in our study and other reports of CA-MRSA. For severe infections treated in the inpatient setting, clindamycin or vancomycin should be included as part of empiric therapy.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113MEu1L]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis — surgical and antimicrobial management centers on urgent debridement, broad coverage for aerobes including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and targeted therapy for group A streptococcus. Surgical intervention is the primary therapeutic modality and is indicated when infection is confirmed or suspected, and most patients should return to the operating room 24–36 hours after the first debridement and then daily until no further debridement is needed. In the absence of definitive trials, antimicrobial therapy should continue until further debridement is unnecessary, the patient has improved clinically, and fever has been absent for 48–72 hours. For polymicrobial infections, treatment should cover both aerobes, including MRSA, and anaerobes, using vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin combined with one of piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem (imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, and ertapenem), ceftriaxone plus metronidazole, or a fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole, with coverage modified once microbiology is known. Necrotizing fasciitis and/or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by group A streptococcus should be treated with both clindamycin and penicillin; clindamycin suppresses streptococcal toxin and cytokine production and observational studies suggest greater efficacy than β-lactams. Reported macrolide resistance in group A streptococci is < 5.0% in the United States, 8.2% in Germany, and 18.3% in Spain, and no resistance to clindamycin was found from invasive strains in Chicago.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^117K3jjR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although effectiveness increases in participants with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated.

Objectives

To assess the evidence on the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing relapse; and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to March week 3, 2016), Embase Elsevier (1974 to March 2016), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (2010 to March 2016). We also searched clinical trials registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications or adverse events, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion, and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and used the GRADE tool to assess the overall quality of evidence for the outcomes.

Main Results

We included 19 trials (5839 randomised participants); seven compared penicillin with cephalosporins, six compared penicillin with macrolides, three compared penicillin with carbacephem, one trial compared penicillin with sulphonamides, one trial compared clindamycin with ampicillin, and one trial compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All included trials reported clinical outcomes. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. The overall quality of the evidence assessed using the GRADE tool was low for the outcome 'resolution of symptoms' in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and very low for the outcomes 'resolution of symptoms' of evaluable participants and for adverse events. We downgraded the quality of evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both, heterogeneity, and wide confidence intervals (CIs). There was a difference in symptom resolution in favour of cephalosporins compared with penicillin (evaluable patients analysis odds ratio (OR) for absence of resolution of symptoms 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 20, N = 5, n = 1660; very low quality evidence). However, this was not statistically significant in the ITT analysis (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.12; N = 5, n = 2018; low quality evidence). Clinical relapse was lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; NNTB 50, N = 4, n = 1386; low quality evidence), but this was found only in adults (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.88; NNTB 33, N = 2, n = 770). There were no differences between macrolides and penicillin for any of the outcomes. One unpublished trial in children found a better cure rate for azithromycin in a single dose compared to amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; NNTB 18, N = 1, n = 482), but there was no difference between the groups in ITT analysis (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; N = 1, n = 673) or at long-term follow-up (evaluable patients analysis OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; N = 1, n = 422). Children experienced more adverse events with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; N = 1, n = 673). Compared with penicillin carbacephem showed better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children combined (ITT analysis OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14, N = 3, n = 795), and in the subgroup analysis of children (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.99; NNTB 8, N = 1, n = 233), but not in the subgroup analysis of adults (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.22, N = 2, n = 562). Children experienced more adverse events with macrolides compared with penicillin (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.15; N = 1, n = 489). Studies did not report on long-term complications so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications.

Authors' Conclusions

There were no clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Limited evidence in adults suggests cephalosporins are more effective than penicillin for relapse, but the NNTB is high. Limited evidence in children suggests carbacephem is more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. Data on complications are too scarce to draw conclusions. Based on these results and considering the low cost and absence of resistance, penicillin can still be regarded as a first choice treatment for both adults and children. All studies were in high-income countries with low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities where risk of complications remains high.

### Treatment of skin and soft tissue infections [^1145FNnq]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Group A streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common bacterial etiologies of skin and soft tissue infections that range in virulence from very mild to limb/life threatening. Antibiotic coverage recommendations are varying and subject to controversy. Antibiotic resistance patterns are evolving with many different biochemical mechanisms. Rapid bacterial identification using mass spectrometry is on the horizon. Therapeutic considerations should include cost and adherence issues.

### Clinical trial: comparative effectiveness of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus cephalexin alone for treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis: a randomized controlled trial [^1148wif9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) is the most common organism isolated from purulent skin infections. Antibiotics are usually not beneficial for skin abscess, and national guidelines do not recommend CA-MRSA coverage for cellulitis, except purulent cellulitis, which is uncommon. Despite this, antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are prescribed commonly and increasingly for skin infections, perhaps due, in part, to lack of experimental evidence among cellulitis patients. We test the hypothesis that antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are beneficial in the treatment of cellulitis.

Methods

We performed a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from 2007 to 2011. We enrolled patients with cellulitis, no abscesses, symptoms for < 1 week, and no diabetes, immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease, or hospitalization (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00676130). All participants received cephalexin. Additionally, each was randomized to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or placebo. We provided 14 days of antibiotics and instructed participants to continue therapy for ≥ 1 week, then stop 3 days after they felt the infection to be cured. Our main outcome measure was the risk difference for treatment success, determined in person at 2 weeks, with telephone and medical record confirmation at 1 month.

Results

We enrolled 153 participants, and 146 had outcome data for intent-to-treat analysis. Median age was 29, range 3–74. Of intervention participants, 62/73 (85%) were cured versus 60/73 controls (82%), a risk difference of 2.7% (95% confidence interval, -9.3% to 15%; p = 0.66). No covariates predicted treatment response, including nasal MRSA colonization and purulence at enrollment.

Conclusions

Among patients diagnosed with cellulitis without abscess, the addition of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to cephalexin did not improve outcomes overall or by subgroup.

Clinical Trials Registration

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral cephalexin in children with osteoarticular infections [^113gdiN5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarticular infections lead to significant morbidity in children. Cephalexin has in vitro activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, a predominant pathogen in osteoarticular infection. However, cephalexin pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) are poorly described in children. This study described cephalexin PK in children treated for osteoarticular infection and assessed the proportion of children achieving surrogate PK/PD target for efficacy in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus infection.

Methods

Children with osteoarticular infection, 1 to 18 years of age, were eligible for this study if they were receiving oral cephalexin per standard of care. PK plasma samples were collected at specified times after multiple doses. PK parameters were estimated using noncompartmental analysis. PK/PD target for efficacy was calculated using the child's PK parameters, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the isolate when available and previously described MIC of 2 and 4 mg/L.

Results

Twelve children were enrolled and PK profiles were obtained from 11 of them. Median age was 7 years, and median cephalexin dose was 40 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours. Median apparent oral clearance, apparent oral volume of distribution and elimination half-life (T1/2) were 0.29 L/h/kg, 0.44 L/kg and 1.1 h, respectively. Time above MIC (T > MIC) was greater than 40% of the dosing interval in 100%, 90% and 80% of the children when MICs were 0.25, 2 and 4 mg/L, respectively.

Conclusions

Oral cephalexin achieved optimal plasma exposure and was well tolerated in children with osteoarticular infection. Correlation between osteoarticular infection clinical outcome and PK/PD parameters needs further evaluation.

Diabetes-related osteomyelitis of the foot (DFO) antibiotic duration — Recommendation 16 states: Consider a duration of up to 3 weeks of antibiotic therapy after minor amputation for diabetes-related osteomyelitis of the foot and positive bone margin culture and 6 weeks for diabetes-related foot osteomyelitis without bone resection or amputation (Conditional; Low). The rationale adds that we suggest administrating antibiotic agents at their upper recommended dosage range and usually for a total duration substantially longer than for soft-tissue infection, and that long-term suppressive antibiotic therapy is generally warranted only for individuals with retained orthopaedic hardware or extensive necrotic bone not amenable to complete debridement. Supporting data note two randomized controlled studies suggesting total duration for non-surgically treated DFO need not be as long as previously proposed, that duration after surgical debridement is likely shorter than for non-surgical treatment, and that in a pilot trial patients receiving either a 3- or 6-week course had similar outcomes and antibiotic-related adverse events.

Pediatric AHO — TMP/SMX, daptomycin, and linezolid evidence: Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) has in vitro activity against CA-MRSA and effectiveness for skin infections, but no controlled data exist for osteomyelitis, with only limited retrospective data in 11 children. For children unable to use beta-lactams, vancomycin, or clindamycin due to allergies or intolerance, parenteral daptomycin and parenteral/oral linezolid provide additional options; in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind pediatric osteomyelitis study, 73 daptomycin-treated children were compared with 73 receiving standard-of-care antibiotics (vancomycin 51%, nafcillin/oxacillin 33%, cephalexin 18%, and clindamycin 1%), with statistically similar early outcomes at the day 5 time point (78% response vs 83% response), pathogens isolated from 62 children, only 4 children with CA-MRSA in each group, and treatment-emergent adverse events in 46% vs 63% respectively. In a single-center retrospective study of children treated with linezolid, cure was described in 11 of the 13 subjects, and use of linezolid for more than 2 weeks is associated with an increased risk of bone marrow suppression and peripheral neuropathy; these adverse effects usually resolve over many weeks once linezolid is discontinued.

3.2 Patients and infections

We included 221 DFI evaluations (121 of which were episodes of DFO) that occurred in 88 individual adult patients (41 (19%) of which were in female patients), with and without concomitant foot ischaemia. Culture specimens grew P. aeruginosa in 22 cases (overall prevalence 10%; six were DFOs and six were monomicrobial infections). All monomicrobial infections due to Pseudomonas were from a specimen of bone (ie cases of DFO). In the 100 exclusively soft‐tissue infections, only four Pseudomonas cases demonstrated a green colour on the wound or the dressing, and most of these were more yellow than green. There were a total of 62 different microbiological results, with the most frequent groups being Staphylococcus aureus (n = 82; 37%), streptococci (n = 28; 13%), enterococci (n = 27; 12%) and Enterobacter spp, (n = 18; 8%). Overall, specimens from 51 DFIs (23%) grew Gram‐negative bacteria. The delay in return of the microbiological results lagged between 2 and 4 days. This delay was indifferent for cultures with and without pseudomonal involvement. In 77 episodes (77/221; 35%), the patients were taking empirical oral antibiotic therapy before the wound sampling, including the following: co‐amoxiclav (n = 51; 66%), 3 levofloxacin (n = 16; 21%), clindamycin (n = 4; 5%) or other antibiotic combinations. The isolated pathogens were susceptible to this pre‐sampling antibiotic agent in 58 episodes (58/77; 75%) and resistant in 19 cases (25%).

### Fosfomycin: use beyond urinary tract and gastrointestinal infections [^113nXmyK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The shortage of new antimicrobial agents has made the scientific community reconsider the potential value of old antibiotics. A search of the literature was performed to compile relevant evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of fosfomycin for the treatment of patients with gram-positive and/or gram-negative bacterial infections (excluding urinary tract infection and gastrointestinal infection). Of 1311 potentially relevant studies, 62 studies were reviewed in detail. Of 1604 patients with various gram-positive and gram-negative infections of various body sites (including pneumonia and other respiratory infections; osteomyelitis; meningitis; ear, nose, and throat infections; surgical infections; obstetric and gynecological infections; arthritis; septicemia; peritonitis; cervical lymphadenitis; eye infections; diabetic foot infections; and typhoid fever) being treated with fosfomycin alone or in combination with other antibiotics, cure was achieved in 1302 (81.1%) of the patients, and improvement was noted in 47 (2.9%). In comparative perioperative prophylaxis trials that included a total of 1212 patients (mainly patients undergoing colorectal surgery), the fosfomycin-metronidazole combination led to results that were similar to those achieved with the combination of other antibiotics (doxycycline, ampicillin, or cephalothin) and metronidazole. In an era in which there is a shortage of new antibiotics, fosfomycin might be considered to be an alternative treatment agent for infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, in addition to its traditional use in treating uncomplicated urinary tract and gastrointestinal infections. Further research on the in vitro antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin, especially against multidrug-resistant pathogens (such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and/or metallo-beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and on the effectiveness and safety of the drug in the treatment of patients with such infections may be warranted.

### Diabetes-related foot infections: diagnosis and treatment [^1128w9RX]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Diabetes-related foot infections occur in approximately 40% of diabetes-related foot ulcers and cause significant morbidity. Clinicians should consider patient risk factors (e.g., presence of foot ulcers greater than 2 cm, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, poor vascular perfusion, comorbid illness) when evaluating for a foot infection or osteomyelitis. Indicators of infection include erythema, induration, tenderness, warmth, and drainage. Superficial wound cultures should be avoided because of the high rate of contaminants. Deep cultures obtained through aseptic procedures (e.g., incision and drainage, debridement, bone culture) help guide treatment. Plain radiography is used for initial imaging if osteomyelitis is suspected; however, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography may help if radiography is inconclusive, the extent of infection is unknown, or if the infection orientation needs to be determined to help in surgical planning. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae are the most commonly isolated pathogens, although polymicrobial infections are common. Antibiotic therapy should cover commonly isolated organisms and reflect local resistance patterns, patient preference, and the severity of the foot infection. Mild and some moderate infections may be treated with oral antibiotics. Severe infections require intravenous antibiotics. Treatment duration is typically one to two weeks and is longer for slowly resolving infections or osteomyelitis. Severe or persistent infections may require surgery and specialized team-based wound care. Although widely recommended, there is little evidence on the effectiveness of primary prevention strategies. Systematic assessment, counseling, and comorbidity management are hallmarks of effective secondary prevention for diabetes-related foot infections.

Antibiotic follow-up and modification — patients with a history of a penicillin allergy (with or without anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives): Clinicians should reevaluate patient within 3 d (for example, in-person visit or phone call), and dentists should instruct patient to discontinue antibiotics 24 h after patient's symptoms resolve, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 d. In cases in which patients with a history of a penicillin allergy and with or without a history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives with penicillin, ampicillin, or amoxicillin fail to respond to first-line treatment with oral cephalexin, oral azithromycin, or oral clindamycin, the panel suggests that dentists should broaden antibiotic therapy to complement first-line treatment with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d).

Cephalosporins

Ceftaroline

Ceftaroline is a fifth-generation cephalosporin and is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSI) (with additional approval for S. aureus bacteremia associated with ABSSSI) and community-acquired pneumonia. Ceftaroline exhibits activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) through binding penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a), but also against many gram-positive and -negative pathogens [Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS), Klebsiella spp, E. coli], with the exception of non-fermentative (P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii) and multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli [extended spectrum β -lactamase (ESBL) or Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) producing isolates]. Ceftaroline is used at a standard intravenous dose of 600 mg every 12 h if creatinine clearance is > 50 ml/min and the dose may be increased to 600 mg every 8 h in the case of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) caused by S. aureus with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) 2 or 4 mg/l to ceftaroline. Dosage adjustment is required for altered kidney function with creatinine clearance ≤ 50 ml/min. Ceftaroline is well tolerated, and its most common adverse reactions are gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea), headache, pruritus and Clostridium difficile infection, even though there are some post-market reports of myelotoxicity related to prolonged (> 7 days) ceftaroline exposure.

A 47-year-old man's history was notable only for right ankle and subtalar arthritis. He underwent right ankle fusion with a nail placement in October 2000. In April 2001, he went to the emergency department for ankle pain secondary to a newly displaced fracture. The fusion nail was removed in the operating room; placement of a new longer nail was uncomplicated. One month later, he developed an ankle hematoma; it was drained, and he was given cephalexin for 7 days. Over the next several weeks, the area became erythematous and swollen; it spontaneously drained purulent material. The patient underwent irrigation and debridement on May 31, 2001. Gross pus was obtained and sent for Gram stain and culture. The patient was discharged with a prescription for amoxicillin/clavulanate tablets.

### A 39-year-old man with a skin infection [^116ZHwAY]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

The case of Mr M, a previously healthy 39-year-old man with erythema and swelling of his finger, illustrates the issues involved in treating community-acquired skin and soft tissue infections since the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the community. Most community-acquired infections of the skin and soft tissues are caused by S aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Until recently, infections due to such organisms in the United States could safely be treated with an oral antistaphylococcal penicillin or an oral first-generation cephalosporin. However, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci as community-acquired pathogens has changed the picture as far as empirical therapy is concerned. Not only do community-acquired MRSA bacteria cause furunculitis and cellulitis, they have also been involved in a variety of more serious and life-threatening infections. Most of these organisms are susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, minocycline, doxycycline, and rifampin, and these agents, along with clindamycin, have been used in the therapy of such infections, even though no clinical trials have proven their efficacy. For more serious, life-threatening infections, linezolid or parenteral agents such as vancomycin or daptomycin should be considered.

### Frequency of dosing of cephalexin for oral step-down therapy of pediatric osteoarticular infections caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus [^113R34ep]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Osteoarticular infections are one of the more common invasive bacterial infections encountered in children. There exist significant practice variations in both the diagnosis and treatment of such infections. However, the practice of transitioning from parenteral therapy to oral antibiotics has been well validated by several studies. For methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), cephalexin is often recommended. Prospective, controlled data regarding optimal dosing of cephalexin in pediatric osteomyelitis are not available. We sought to review our retrospective, uncontrolled data on four times daily (QID) versus three times daily (TID) dosing of cephalexin for pediatric osteoarticular infections. Children ≥ 1 month to < 18 years of age admitted to Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego with a diagnosis of osteomyelitis or septic arthritis between January 1, 2002, and November 30, 2007, were identified and previously reported. Only patients with culture-positive MSSA infections are included in this report. Demographic and clinical data were manually extracted from the electronic medical record. Fifty-nine patients were treated with cephalexin and had records available for review through our electronic medical record. Thirty-eight patients (64.4%) were treated QID, and 21 patients (35.6%) were treated TID. Clinical cure was achieved in all patients with only one adverse event occurring in the QID group. In this retrospective chart review of children with osteoarticular infections caused by MSSA treated with cephalexin, similar clinical outcomes were found with QID versus TID dosing.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^1113RHL3]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot infections — empiric initiation, culture guidance, and monitoring: Reliable specimens for cultures may be obtained through curettage of the infected ulcer, and oral antibiotic therapy is usually sufficient as initial therapy. Antimicrobial treatment should be started as soon as possible with an agent providing adequate gram positive coverage, recognizing that gram negative organisms might also be involved. Although the incidence of MRSA infections has increased, methicillin-sensitive S aureus (MSSA) remains the most likely pathogen in community-acquired diabetic foot infections; therefore, initial antibiotic coverage must be tailored to cover MSSA unless culture/sensitivity or pathogen history indicates specific coverage, and antibiotics should be adjusted according to culture results and the patient's response to treatment. While many useful oral agents such as cephalexin, clindamycin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and levofloxacin are available for mild to moderate infections, relatively few have been studied or have demonstrated superiority and IDSA guidelines contain no specific recommendations. All antibiotic treatments should be monitored for development of resistance, and most cases of cellulitis respond within 3 to 5 days of initiation of appropriate antibiotics; if cellulitis is slow to respond, worsens, or recurs following several days of treatment, the ulceration should be reassessed and possibly reevaluated. Bacteria frequently develop resistance, especially with prolonged therapy, which is not uncommon with the quinolones.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

MSSA acute bacterial arthritis antimicrobial choice and cephalexin dosing — For children with ABA caused by MSSA, a beta-lactam agent is preferred for initial parenteral treatment (cefazolin, nafcillin or oxacillin) and for definitive oral treatment (cephalexin). "High dose" cephalexin (100 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses) was first studied and remains adequate as convalescent therapy following initial parenteral therapy and surgical management. Modeling using a pharmacodynamic driver of 40% T > MIC suggests higher doses may be required for strains with MICs of 2 and 4 mg/L, and the MIC90 for MSSA is 4–8 mg/L, suggesting oral therapy should follow initial parenteral therapy, surgical debridement, and clinical response. The higher doses (120 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours) needed to achieve this target in 100%, 90% and 80% of children for MSSA with MICs of 0.25, 2 and 4 mg/L, respectively, do not appear necessary for good outcomes after oral transition. Using the same target, proposed cephalexin dosages (administered Q8H) are 45 mg/kg/day for MSSA with an MIC of 1 mg/L; 75 mg/kg/day for an MIC of 2 mg/L; and 135 mg/kg/day for an MIC of 4 mg/L, with those doses proposed for children weighing 10–15 kg.

### Maternal origins of neonatal infections: what Do obstetrician-gynecologist should / could Do? [^115XEBqz]. American Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Neonatal infections are responsible for 20% of neonatal deaths yearly. In this review, we focused on the origins of the commoner neonatal infections, and we define the role of obstetricians. Regarding group B Streptococcus, a key measure for the prevention of neonatal infection is the vaginal-rectal culture screening at term pregnancy. Intravenous penicillin is the first-line prophylaxis at the start of labor, with intravenous ampicillin as an alternative. First-generation cephalosporins or clindamycin are recommended in case of penicillin allergy. Concerning urinary tract infections (UTIs), guidelines recommend complete urinalysis and urine culture in the first trimester of pregnancy for the screening of asymptomatic bacteriuria. For lower UTIs, guidelines recommend nitrofurantoin as first-choice antibiotic. Amoxicillin or cefalexin are second-line antibiotics. For upper UTIs, guidelines recommend cephalexin per os as first line. Candida spp. colonization affects 20% of pregnant women; however, congenital fetal candidosis and Candida amnionitis are rare. First-line treatment in case of symptomatic vaginitis during pregnancy or asymptomatic colonization during the third trimester is vaginal clotrimazole. Fluconazole is not approved in pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. Genital mycoplasmas colonization during pregnancy is usually asymptomatic and associated with bacterial vaginosis. Colonization is related to neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), pneumonia, chorioamnionitis, and sepsis. Macrolides are the first-line treatment along with lactobacillus supplementation. In cases of preterm premature rupture of membranes or preterm labor, ceftriaxone, clarithromycin, and metronidazole are required to prevent intra-amniotic infection. Intra-amniotic infection affects 1 to 5% of deliveries at term and one-third of preterm ones and is associated with perinatal death, early-onset neonatal sepsis, RDS, BPD, pneumonia, meningitis, and prematurity-related diseases. Guidelines recommend a combination of ampicillin and gentamicin, and in case of caesarean section, an additional dose of clindamycin or metronidazole is required. In conclusion, obstetricians should be aware that the treatment of maternal infection during pregnancy can prevent potentially lethal infections in the newborn. KEY POINTS: · Part of neonatal infections starts from maternal infections that must be treated during pregnancy. · Streptococcus group B and asymptomatic bacteriuria should be investigated in pregnancy and treated. · Mycoplasma and ureaplasma vaginal colonization during pregnancy is related to negative neonatal outcomes.

In April 2015 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE, and EBSCO CINAHL. We also searched in the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE; The Cochrane Library), the Health Technology Assessment database (HTA; The Cochrane Library), the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS-EED; The Cochrane Library), unpublished literature in OpenSIGLE and ProQuest Dissertations and on-going trials registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of systemic antibiotics (oral or parenteral) in people with a DFI. Primary outcomes were clinical resolution of the infection, time to its resolution, complications and adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data. Risk ratios (RR) were estimated for dichotomous data and, when sufficient numbers of comparable trials were available, trials were pooled in a meta-analysis.

Main Results

We included 20 trials with 3791 participants. Studies were heterogenous in study design, population, antibiotic regimens, and outcomes. We grouped the sixteen different antibiotic agents studied into six categories: 1) anti-pseudomonal penicillins (three trials); 2) broad-spectrum penicillins (one trial); 3) cephalosporins (two trials); 4) carbapenems (four trials); 5) fluoroquinolones (six trials); 6) other antibiotics (four trials). Only 9 of the 20 trials protected against detection bias with blinded outcome assessment. Only one-third of the trials provided enough information to enable a judgement about whether the randomisation sequence was adequately concealed. Eighteen out of 20 trials received funding from pharmaceutical industry-sponsors. The included studies reported the following findings for clinical resolution of infection: there is evidence from one large trial at low risk of bias that patients receiving ertapenem with or without vancomycin are more likely to have resolution of their foot infection than those receiving tigecycline (RR 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 0.99; 955 participants). It is unclear if there is a difference in rates of clinical resolution of infection between: 1) two alternative anti-pseudomonal penicillins (one trial); 2) an anti-pseudomonal penicillin and a broad-spectrum penicillin (one trial) or a carbapenem (one trial); 3) a broad-spectrum penicillin and a second-generation cephalosporin (one trial); 4) cephalosporins and other beta-lactam antibiotics (two trials); 5) carbapenems and anti-pseudomonal penicillins or broad-spectrum penicillins (four trials); 6) fluoroquinolones and anti-pseudomonal penicillins (four trials) or broad-spectrum penicillins (two trials); 7) daptomycin and vancomycin (one trial); 8) linezolid and a combination of aminopenicillins and beta-lactamase inhibitors (one trial); and 9) clindamycin and cephalexin (one trial). Carbapenems combined with anti-pseudomonal agents produced fewer adverse effects than anti-pseudomonal penicillins (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.84; 1 trial). An additional trial did not find significant differences in the rate of adverse events between a carbapenem alone and an anti-pseudomonal penicillin, but the rate of diarrhoea was lower for participants treated with a carbapenem (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.93; 1 trial). Daptomycin produced fewer adverse effects than vancomycin or other semi-synthetic penicillins (RR 0.61, 95%CI 0.39 to 0.94; 1 trial). Linezolid produced more adverse effects than ampicillin-sulbactam (RR 2.66; 95% CI 1.49 to 4.73; 1 trial), as did tigecycline compared to ertapenem with or without vancomycin (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.60; 1 trial). There was no evidence of a difference in safety for the other comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for the relative effects of different systemic antibiotics for the treatment of foot infections in diabetes is very heterogeneous and generally at unclear or high risk of bias. Consequently it is not clear if any one systemic antibiotic treatment is better than others in resolving infection or in terms of safety. One non-inferiority trial suggested that ertapenem with or without vancomycin is more effective in achieving clinical resolution of infection than tigecycline. Otherwise the relative effects of different antibiotics are unclear. The quality of the evidence is low due to limitations in the design of the included trials and important differences between them in terms of the diversity of antibiotics assessed, duration of treatments, and time points at which outcomes were assessed. Any further studies in this area should have a blinded assessment of outcomes, use standardised criteria to classify severity of infection, define clear outcome measures, and establish the duration of treatment.

Diabetes-related foot infection (DFI) adjuncts — The guideline states: "We suggest not using the following treatments to address DFIs: (a) adjunctive G-CSF treatment or (b) topical antiseptics, silver preparations, honey, bacteriophage therapy, or negative-pressure wound therapy (with or without instillation)". Rationale indicates that "G-CSF to a diabetes-related foot treatment does not significantly affect the likelihood of resolution of infection, healing of the wound, or the duration of systemic antibiotic therapy", although "It does seem to be associated with a reduced likelihood of lower extremity surgical interventions (including amputation) and a reduced duration of hospital stay, although the profile of patients who might benefit is unclear, especially in relation to the costs and potential adverse effects". For topical agents, "the available evidence does not support any beneficial effect for most of them", and "Silver compounds do not offer benefits in ulcer healing (as described in the IWGDF wound healing guidelines) and there is no evidence to support their effectiveness in the treatment of the infectious aspects of a DFU".

### Twice-and thrice-daily cephalexin dosing for Staphylococcus aureus infections in children [^115fAxVQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cephalexin is used for the treatment of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infections in children. Although 4 times daily dosing is recommended, less frequent dosing regimens are often prescribed to improve treatment acceptability and adherence. We developed a population pharmacokinetic model of cephalexin in children to determine a twice-daily (BID) and thrice-daily (TID) cephalexin dosing regimen for MSSA infections.

Methods

A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using a nonlinear mixed effects modeling approach. The dataset used was from a prospective open-label pharmacokinetic study of orally administered cephalexin in 12 children 1–16 years of age with bone and joint infections. Simulations were performed to determine a BID and TID dosing regimen so that ≥ 90% of children in this age group would achieve the pharmacodynamic target for MSSA (ie, time that the free drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration of the bacteria for at least 40% of the dosing interval).

Results

The final model was 1 compartment with a transit compartment model to account for delay in oral absorption. For BID dosing, doses of 22–45 and 80mg/kg were required for MSSA with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 1–2 and 4mg/L, respectively. For TID dosing, the respective required doses were 15–25 and 45mg/kg.

Conclusions

Our study proposes a BID and TID cephalexin dosing regimen that can be prospectively evaluated. Through reducing the dose frequency of this widely prescribed antibiotic, we can reduce the medication burden for children and improve treatment compliance for MSSA infections.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^114AaBsW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2020.

Objectives

To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 3 September 2020: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), Embase Elsevier (from 1974), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (from 2010). We also searched clinical trial registers on 3 September 2020.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics, and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and used the GRADE approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes. We have reported the intention-to-treat analysis, and also performed an analysis of evaluable participants to explore the robustness of the intention-to-treat results.

Main Results

We included 19 trials reported in 18 publications (5839 randomised participants): six trials compared penicillin with cephalosporins; six compared penicillin with macrolides; three compared penicillin with carbacephem; one compared penicillin with sulphonamides; one compared clindamycin with ampicillin; and one compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All participants had confirmed acute GABHS tonsillopharyngitis, and ages ranged from one month to 80 years. Nine trials included only, or predominantly, children. Most trials were conducted in an outpatient setting. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both; heterogeneity; and wide confidence intervals. Cephalosporins versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference in symptom resolution (at 2 to 15 days) for cephalosporins versus penicillin (odds ratio (OR) for absence of symptom resolution 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.12; 5 trials; 2018 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results of the sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants differed (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 5 trials; 1660 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; 4 trials; 1386 participants; low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence showed no difference in reported adverse events. Macrolides versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference between macrolides and penicillin for resolution of symptoms (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.35; 6 trials; 1728 participants; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants resulted in an OR of 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.09; 6 trials; 1159 participants). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be different (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.03; 6 trials; 802 participants; low-certainty evidence). Azithromycin versus amoxicillin Based on one unpublished trial in children, we are uncertain if resolution of symptoms is better with azithromycin in a single dose versus amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis for per-protocol analysis resulted in an OR of 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; 1 trial; 482 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are also uncertain if there was a difference in relapse between groups (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; 1 trial; 422 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were more common with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Carbacephem versus penicillin There is low-certainty evidence that compared with penicillin, carbacephem may provide better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14.3; 3 trials; 795 participants). Studies did not report on long-term complications, so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain if there are clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Low-certainty evidence in children suggests that carbacephem may be more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the other comparisons in this review. Data on complications were too scarce to draw conclusions. These results do not demonstrate that other antibiotics are more effective than penicillin in the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis. All studies were conducted in high-income countries with a low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is a need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities, where the risk of complications remains high.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112z7Dvu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis without abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage — empiric antibiotic selection and MRSA coverage is outlined as follows: treatment with β-lactams, such as cefazolin or oxacillin, was successful in 96% of patients, suggesting MRSA-directed therapy is usually unnecessary; however, MRSA coverage may be prudent with penetrating trauma, illicit drug use, purulent drainage, or concurrent MRSA elsewhere. Options for MRSA include intravenous vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, or telavancin, or oral doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP; if oral coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired, use clindamycin alone or combine SMX-TMP or doxycycline with a β-lactam (eg, penicillin, cephalosporin, or amoxicillin). The activity of doxycycline and SMX-TMP against β-hemolytic streptococci is not known, and in the absence of abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage, β-lactam monotherapy is recommended; a double-blind study showed SMX-TMP plus cephalexin was no more efficacious than cephalexin alone in pure cellulitis.

### Diabetic foot infection [^1112LV6w]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Foot infections are common in patients with diabetes and are associated with high morbidity and risk of lower extremity amputation. Diabetic foot infections are classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci, are the most common pathogens in previously untreated mild and moderate infection. Severe, chronic, or previously treated infections are often polymicrobial. The diagnosis of diabetic foot infection is based on the clinical signs and symptoms of local inflammation. Infected wounds should be cultured after debridement. Tissue specimens obtained by scraping the base of the ulcer with a scalpel or by wound or bone biopsy are strongly preferred to wound swabs. Imaging studies are indicated for suspected deep soft tissue purulent collections or osteomyelitis. Optimal management requires aggressive surgical debridement and wound management, effective antibiotic therapy, and correction of metabolic abnormalities (mainly hyperglycemia and arterial insufficiency). Treatment with antibiotics is not required for noninfected ulcers. Mild soft tissue infection can be treated effectively with oral antibiotics, including dicloxacillin, cephalexin, and clindamycin. Severe soft tissue infection can be initially treated intravenously with ciprofloxacin plus clindamycin; piperacillin/tazobactam; or imipenem/cilastatin. The risk of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection should be considered when choosing a regimen. Antibiotic treatment should last from one to four weeks for soft tissue infection and six to 12 weeks for osteomyelitis and should be followed by culture-guided definitive therapy.

### Linezolid (Zyvox) [^116mv8C8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1	Nosocomial Pneumonia

ZYVOX is indicated for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates) or Streptococcus pneumoniae [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.2	Community-acquired Pneumonia

ZYVOX is indicated for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, including cases with concurrent bacteremia, or Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.3	Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

ZYVOX is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections, including diabetic foot infections, without concomitant osteomyelitis, caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, or Streptococcus agalactiae. ZYVOX has not been studied in the treatment of decubitus ulcers [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.4	Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

ZYVOX is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) or Streptococcus pyogenes [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.5	Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium Infections

ZYVOX is indicated for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, including cases with concurrent bacteremia [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.6	Limitations of Use

ZYVOX is not indicated for the treatment of Gram-negative infections. It is critical that specific Gram-negative therapy be initiated immediately if a concomitant Gram-negative pathogen is documented or suspected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
The safety and efficacy of ZYVOX formulations given for longer than 28 days have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.7	Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZYVOX and other antibacterial drugs, ZYVOX should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.
