## Question

can you use steroids in renal failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether corticosteroids can be used in renal failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the type of renal dysfunction and whether it changes steroid dosing or pharmacology. Then, I should verify the indication-specific evidence where steroids help versus harm. Next, I should review contraindications and high‑risk scenarios, followed by practical dosing, tapering, and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a decision framework that balances benefits and risks in renal failure, while double‑checking for disease‑specific caveats and implementation details.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because the answer is not binary; it hinges on acuity and stage of kidney disease (AKI versus CKD versus ESKD), the underlying indication for steroids (e.g., transplant immunosuppression, glomerular disease, AIN, sarcoidosis, myeloma), and patient‑specific risks such as volume status, blood pressure, diabetes, and infection risk, and I should verify each of these before recommending therapy.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should check for situations where steroids are relatively contraindicated or clearly harmful, and here systemic sclerosis stands out because exogenous glucocorticoids increase the risk of scleroderma renal crisis, so minimizing or avoiding them is recommended, and severe alcohol‑related hepatitis with ACLF or uncontrolled infection is another scenario where steroids should be avoided, especially in ACLF, so I need to screen for these before proceeding [^116raBRN] [^113KX3qA].

> Next, I will examine kidney transplantation because perioperative and early post‑transplant corticosteroids remain part of standard immunosuppression, yet I should confirm whether early steroid withdrawal is reasonable in standard‑risk recipients; yes, guidelines support initial steroids with consideration of early withdrawal in standard immunologic risk on tacrolimus plus mycophenolate, but I must remember that withdrawal increases acute rejection risk, even though some long‑term studies show no clear mortality disadvantage and nuanced trade‑offs for graft outcomes, so patient selection and monitoring are key [^113cVdki] [^115mrLp3] [^1121eU2L] [^111NAwmC].

> Wait, let me verify adrenal physiology after chronic low‑dose steroids in transplant; secondary adrenal insufficiency is common even on 5–7.5 mg prednisolone daily and may be under‑recognized, so screening with morning cortisol and confirmatory testing during tapering or prior to complete discontinuation is reasonable to reduce the risk of adrenal crisis, which means I need a plan for stress dosing and endocrinology input if tests are abnormal [^116j9377] [^114NWj5T] [^112rM3Qg].

> I should now review glomerular diseases where steroids may be beneficial but toxic; in IgA nephropathy, oral methylprednisolone reduces adverse kidney outcomes but increases adverse events, with older data suggesting high‑dose, time‑limited courses confer more renal benefit than prolonged low‑dose regimens, so I should reserve steroids for higher‑risk IgA nephropathy and counsel thoroughly on toxicity, especially in patients with impaired baseline kidney function where risks may be amplified [^116dxE68] [^114chEK3] [^116XcdhB].

> Let me double‑check minimal change disease in adults with nephrotic syndrome; steroids remain first‑line, and recent randomized data support either conventional oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day or an initial two‑week IV methylprednisolone sequence before transitioning to oral therapy, with close monitoring for volume, electrolytes, and metabolic adverse effects during induction and taper [^1147fwJP] [^112eRi82].

> For drug‑induced acute interstitial nephritis, I need to check the timing signal; although evidence is observational, earlier initiation of prednisone around 0.8 mg/kg/day within the first 1–2 weeks after culprit drug withdrawal is associated with better renal recovery, whereas extending high‑dose therapy beyond approximately 2–4 weeks or total duration beyond 8 weeks does not clearly improve outcomes, so a focused, time‑sensitive course with taper appears prudent while avoiding steroids when heavy chronic fibrosis or active infection is present [^1117cJiV].

> I should confirm the stance in multiple myeloma with renal failure; high‑dose dexamethasone is beneficial for renal recovery by rapidly reducing light‑chain burden, and delay diminishes reversibility, so early initiation of dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1–4 (repeated per cycle) is a reasonable bridge to definitive myeloma therapy, with vigilant infection surveillance given the immunosuppressive risk of higher doses [^112zYxDU] [^111Y7UpL].

> Let me consider renal sarcoidosis and ANCA vasculitis; granulomatous interstitial nephritis from sarcoidosis generally responds to glucocorticoids, whereas ANCA‑associated vasculitis requires glucocorticoids combined with agents like rituximab or cyclophosphamide, so monotherapy is inadequate in the latter and I should tailor dose and taper to disease severity and remission induction strategies while watching renal parameters closely [^116rAeKy] [^112eRi82].

> Now, I need to assess pharmacology and dosing in CKD; most glucocorticoids are hepatically metabolized, so no routine renal dose adjustment is required, but adverse effects are magnified in CKD due to sodium retention, edema, hypertension, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and bone loss, which means dietary sodium restriction, frequent BP and weight checks, electrolyte and glucose monitoring, and bone protection should be proactive, and tapering must be gradual to mitigate HPA‑axis suppression and crisis risk [^116bEPoD] [^111Y7UpL] [^114LMcDS] [^11619Br5].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said steroids tend to cause hyperkalemia; that would conflate them with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, because glucocorticoids more often promote potassium loss via mineralocorticoid activity, whereas MRAs like spironolactone increase hyperkalemia risk, especially in CKD and transplant recipients, so I should clearly separate glucocorticoids from MRAs when discussing "steroids" in renal failure to avoid medication errors [^112fPPH9] [^115ZDHC7] [^116PddYK].

> Next, I should review monitoring requirements; before starting, I need baseline eGFR, electrolytes, bicarbonate, calcium and phosphate, HbA1c or glucose, BP and weight, vaccination status, TB screening when relevant, and bone health assessment if treatment will exceed three months, and during therapy I should track renal function, electrolytes, BP, weight, and glucose more frequently early on, with dose adjustments and diuretics as needed, and during taper or planned cessation I should screen for adrenal insufficiency and provide sick‑day rules to reduce crisis risk [^111jMeFn] [^112dY1B2] [^113uLZzA] [^116Enp9S].

> Hold on, I should verify tapering guidance because abrupt cessation is dangerous in CKD patients who accumulate toxicity; current endocrine guidance endorses the lowest effective dose and a gradual taper individualized to disease control and patient risk, with either symptom‑guided taper or biochemical assessment of HPA recovery using morning cortisol and, if needed, ACTH stimulation before full discontinuation, and patient education with caregiver involvement improves safety during this process [^116dvsHw] [^113uLZzA] [^116Enp9S].

> But wait, what if we can avoid or minimize glucocorticoids; in some glomerular diseases or maintenance settings, non‑steroidal immunosuppressants can spare steroid exposure, and in CKD with diabetes and albuminuria, non‑steroidal MRAs like finerenone improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes with potassium monitoring, although this is a different drug class from glucocorticoids and carries a hyperkalemia signal that is accentuated in advanced CKD or dialysis, so patient selection and lab surveillance are essential [^1179cfSc] [^112fPPH9] [^115ZDHC7].

> I should double‑check sepsis‑related contexts since renal failure often coexists with critical illness; in shock states, low‑dose physiologic hydrocortisone strategies can be beneficial in select patients per critical care guidance, but indiscriminate high‑dose regimens increase metabolic complications, so I must align dosing with critical care protocols rather than kidney function per se and avoid use when uncontrolled infection risk clearly outweighs benefit in specific liver failure phenotypes [^116JLrhW] [^111dX9R5] [^113KX3qA].

> Bringing this together, steroids can be used in renal failure when there is a clear indication and when I can mitigate cardio‑renal, metabolic, infectious, and endocrine risks through careful selection, dosing, and monitoring; I should avoid or minimize steroids in systemic sclerosis or in alcohol‑related hepatitis with ACLF or uncontrolled infection, and I must actively manage volume and blood pressure, electrolytes and glucose, bone health, and HPA‑axis suppression throughout the course to keep the benefit–risk balance favorable [^116raBRN] [^113KX3qA] [^111Y7UpL] [^116bEPoD].

> Practically, if the indication is kidney transplant induction or rejection treatment, I will use perioperative or bolus steroids per transplant protocols with consideration of early withdrawal in standard‑risk recipients on tacrolimus plus mycophenolate, while counseling about adrenal insufficiency and planning surveillance during taper; if the indication is IgA nephropathy at higher risk, I will use time‑limited courses with explicit toxicity monitoring and shared decision‑making; if the indication is minimal change disease, I will induce with oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day or a brief IV methylprednisolone sequence followed by oral therapy; if AIN is suspected and not improving after culprit drug cessation, I will start an early, finite prednisone course; and if myeloma‑related renal failure is present, I will initiate high‑dose dexamethasone promptly as a bridge to definitive therapy, all with CKD‑adapted monitoring rather than renal dose adjustment of the glucocorticoid itself [^113cVdki] [^115mrLp3] [^116dxE68] [^1147fwJP] [^1117cJiV] [^112zYxDU].

> Finally, I need to ensure a structured follow‑up: weekly checks early for BP, weight, electrolytes, glucose, and kidney function with tighter intervals in unstable patients, bone protection if prolonged therapy is anticipated, vaccination and latent infection assessment when feasible, and a planned, slow taper with biochemical assessment of HPA recovery where appropriate, recognizing that CKD amplifies steroid toxicities even though pharmacokinetic renal dose adjustments are generally unnecessary for glucocorticoids [^114LMcDS] [^111jMeFn] [^116bEPoD] [^111Y7UpL].

---

Yes, **steroids can be used in renal failure** when clinically indicated, such as for glomerular diseases [^112eRi82], transplant immunosuppression [^113cVdki], or adrenal insufficiency [^116dvsHw]. They **do not require dose adjustment** for renal impairment, but **close monitoring** is essential due to increased risks of fluid retention, hypertension [^111Y7UpL], hyperglycemia, infection, and adrenal suppression [^116bEPoD]. Use the lowest effective dose and taper gradually [^111Y7UpL]; **avoid or minimize steroids in scleroderma renal crisis** [^116raBRN] and monitor for hyperkalemia with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [^111mNFQj].

---

## Indications for steroid use in renal failure

Steroids are indicated in renal failure for specific conditions, including:

- **Glomerular diseases**: Minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, lupus nephritis, and IgA nephropathy [^1147fwJP] [^112eRi82] [^114chEK3] [^116dxE68].

- **Acute interstitial nephritis**: Steroids may improve renal recovery in drug-induced AIN [^1117cJiV].

- **Kidney transplantation**: Steroids are part of standard immunosuppression and for acute rejection [^113cVdki] [^111xiTWE].

- **Adrenal insufficiency**: Physiologic replacement is required in secondary adrenal insufficiency from chronic steroid use [^112Bs4iG].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of steroids in renal failure

Steroids are primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Renal impairment can reduce clearance, increase exposure, and heighten adverse-effect risk [^114jrtsW]. Hypoalbuminemia increases the free steroid fraction and the risk of toxicity. Most steroids are not significantly removed by dialysis, so **dosing is generally unchanged**.

---

## Risks and adverse effects of steroid use in renal failure

Steroids carry significant risks in renal failure, including:

- **Fluid retention and hypertension**: Sodium retention and edema [^111Y7UpL] can worsen hypertension and heart failure [^116bEPoD].

- **Hyperglycemia and diabetes**: Steroids can induce or worsen hyperglycemia, increasing diabetes risk [^116bEPoD].

- **Infection risk**: Immunosuppression increases susceptibility to infections, including opportunistic pathogens [^116bEPoD].

- **Adrenal suppression**: Chronic use can cause secondary adrenal insufficiency, requiring careful tapering [^112Bs4iG].

- **Bone disease**: Steroids accelerate osteoporosis and fracture risk, especially in CKD [^114LMcDS].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Steroids can cause hypokalemia and hypernatremia, complicating CKD management [^115Nabv5].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

KDIGO 2024 recommends **using validated eGFR equations** for drug dosing [^117BPkL1] and for monitoring eGFR, electrolytes, and drug levels in CKD [^111jMeFn]. EAU 2025 **supports corticosteroids perioperatively and early post-transplant** [^113cVdki] and suggests that withdrawal may be considered in standard-risk patients on calcineurin inhibitor and mycophenolic acid regimens after the early post-transplant period [^115mrLp3] [^1121eU2L]. BSR 2024 **advises minimizing corticosteroids in systemic sclerosis** due to the increased risk of scleroderma renal crisis [^116raBRN].

---

## Dose adjustments and monitoring

Steroids generally do not require dose adjustment in renal impairment, but **careful monitoring is essential**:

- **Blood pressure and fluid status**: Monitor closely to detect and manage fluid overload and hypertension [^111jMeFn].

- **Blood glucose**: Regular monitoring to detect steroid-induced hyperglycemia [^116bEPoD].

- **Electrolytes**: Monitor potassium and sodium levels regularly [^113T27Vu].

- **Adrenal function**: Monitor for adrenal insufficiency, especially during tapering or discontinuation [^113uLZzA].

---

## Alternative therapies

To minimize steroid use, **immunosuppressive alternatives** include calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab for glomerular diseases and transplantation [^112eRi82] [^113cVdki]. NSAIDs have limited roles due to nephrotoxicity but may be used cautiously in select situations [^113FnHx9]. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists can be used cautiously in CKD with monitoring for hyperkalemia [^111mNFQj] [^112fPPH9].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

Steroid use in renal failure is associated with both beneficial and adverse outcomes. Benefits include improved renal function in glomerular diseases [^116dxE68], reduced acute rejection in transplantation [^111xiTWE], and better management of adrenal insufficiency [^112Bs4iG], whereas harms include increased risks of infection, cardiovascular complications, metabolic disturbances, and bone disease [^116bEPoD] [^114LMcDS].

---

Steroids can be used in renal failure when indicated, but require **careful monitoring and risk mitigation** [^111jMeFn]. Use the lowest effective dose, taper gradually [^111Y7UpL], and monitor for fluid retention, hypertension, hyperglycemia, infection, adrenal suppression, and electrolyte disturbances [^111jMeFn].

- **Cardio-renal**: Average and large doses of corticosteroids can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. Literature reports suggest an apparent association between the use of corticosteroids and left ventricular free wall rupture following a recent myocardial infarction; therefore, therapy with corticosteroids should be used with great caution in these patients. There have been cases reported in which the concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, Amphotericin B injection and potassium-depleting agents).

- **Endocrine**: Hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and hyperglycemia are potential issues. Monitor patients for these conditions with chronic use. Corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted.

Regarding the medical management of chronic kidney disease, specifically concerning RAAS inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of a steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist for the treatment of heart failure, hyperaldosteronism, or refractory hypertension. It is important to recognize that this treatment may cause hyperkalemia or a reversible decline in glomerular filtration, especially in patients with a low GFR.

### Dexamethasone [^111Y7UpL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The lowest possible dose of corticosteroids should be used to control the condition under treatment. When a reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Since complications of treatment with corticosteroids depend on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case regarding the dose and duration of treatment and whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.

- **Cardio-renal**: As sodium retention with resultant edema and potassium loss may occur in patients receiving corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency.

- **Endocrine**: Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by the gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently.

- **Gastrointestinal**: Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and nonspecific ulcerative colitis, as they may increase the risk of perforation. Signs of peritoneal irritation following gastrointestinal perforation in patients receiving corticosteroids may be minimal or absent. There is an enhanced effect due to decreased metabolism of corticosteroids in patients with conditions such as liver dysfunction or hypothyroidism.

### Intravenous methylprednisolone for nephrotic syndrome with minimal change lesions in adults: a randomized controlled trial [^1147fwJP]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

After confirmation of eligibility, patients were randomly assigned in a concealed fashion to either an oral group or a sequential group according to a random number label. Patients in the sequential group received IV methylprednisolone for 2 weeks, followed by a conventional oral prednisone regimen. Patients in the oral group received conventional oral steroid therapy, consisting of oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day (maximum 80 mg/day) for 8–12 weeks, according to the treatment response. If the treatment was effective and had been administered for a sufficient period, the dose was reduced every 2 weeks by 10%. At approximately 30 mg, the dose was reduced by half a tablet, or 2.5 mg each time. In the sequential group, patients received IV methylprednisolone at 0.8 mg/kg/day infusions (maximum 64 mg/day) for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, the treatment was changed to oral prednisone at 1.0 mg/kg/day. Anticoagulation was administered to patients aged 50 years. Diuretics, lipid-lowering drugs, and human albumin were not used as routine medications. Other immunosuppressive drugs were not used in the trial.

Randomization was performed 1:1 using a web-based tool, including stratified block randomization with varying age and gender as stratification factors. This trial was open-label, with no masking of patients or study staff to treatment allocation.

Patients were followed up for 48 weeks after randomization. They were followed up weekly in the hospital for the first 4 weeks, then monthly thereafter.

### Corticosteroids for treating sepsis [^113tKS4r]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Sepsis occurs when an infection is complicated by organ failures as defined by a sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score of two or higher. Sepsis may be complicated by impaired corticosteroid metabolism, and administering corticosteroids may benefit patients. The original review was published in 2004 and was updated in 2010 and again in 2015.

- **Objectives**: To examine the effects of corticosteroids on death at one month in patients with sepsis, and to examine whether dose and duration of corticosteroids influence patient response to this treatment.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (October 2014), EMBASE (October 2014), Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS; October 2014), and reference lists of articles, and we contacted trial authors. The original searches were performed in August 2003 and in October 2009.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials of corticosteroids versus placebo or supportive treatment in patients with sepsis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: All review authors agreed on the eligibility of trials. One review author extracted data, which were checked by the other review authors and by the primary author of the paper when possible. We obtained some missing data from trial authors and assessed the methodological quality of trials.

- **Main results**: We identified nine additional studies since the last update, for a total of 33 eligible trials (n = 4268 participants). Twenty-three of these 33 trials were at low risk of selection bias.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^112dY1B2]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to drug dose adjustments, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a thorough medication review periodically and at transitions of care to assess adherence, continued indication, and potential drug interactions, as patients with CKD often have complex medication regimens and are seen by multiple specialists.

### Cortifoam [^115Nabv5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement.

- **Cardio-renal**: As sodium retention with resultant edema and potassium loss may occur in patients receiving corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency.

- **Endocrine**: Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently.

- **Gastrointestinal**: Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and nonspecific ulcerative colitis, since they may increase the risk of a perforation. Where surgery is imminent, it is important to manage risk appropriately.

### Early corticosteroid cessation vs long-term corticosteroid therapy in kidney transplant recipients: Long-term outcomes of a randomized clinical trial [^111NAwmC]. JAMA Surgery (2021). High credibility.

The complications of corticosteroids make the inclusion of these drugs in immunosuppressive protocols for kidney transplant patients undesirable. However, cessation of corticosteroids is associated with a higher risk of short-term rejection, and the long-term outcomes of patients withdrawn from corticosteroids remain uncertain.

The objective of this study was to compare long-term kidney transplant outcomes of patients randomized to continue or withdraw corticosteroids.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This prospective multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted between November 1999 and December 2002. It linked to a mandatory national registry with validated outcome ascertainment until June 8, 2018. The study included 28 kidney transplant centers in the United States and involved 386 low- to moderate-immune risk adult recipients of a living or deceased donor kidney transplant, without delayed graft function or short-term rejection in the first week after transplant. Analyses were intention to treat, with analysis beginning in September 2018 and ending in June 2019.

- **Interventions**: Patients were randomized to receive tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil with or without corticosteroids 7 days after transplant.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Kidney allograft failure from any cause, including death, and allograft failure censored for patient death, defined by the requirement for long-term dialysis or repeat transplant.

- **Results**: Of 385 patients, 191 were assigned to withdraw from corticosteroids (mean [SD] age, 46.5 [12.1] years), and 194 patients were assigned to continued therapy.

### Glucocorticoid induced adrenal insufficiency is common in steroid treated glomerular diseases - proposed strategy for screening and management [^112rM3Qg]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

A strength of our study is that we ensured that patients were off Prednisolone for 24 hours prior to the assessment of adrenal function. All common corticosteroids except Dexamethasone can cross-react with the assay to some degree. The half-life for these agents is approximately 0.5–4.0 hours, so it is important that Prednisolone is paused for at least 24 hours prior to baseline cortisol measurements. We switched patients identified with adrenal insufficiency to twice daily Hydrocortisone, which has a shorter half-life than Prednisolone and is more favorable for bone mineral density. Patients are also educated on sick day rules and retested at six-month intervals until recovery.

Our study also adds to understanding by evaluating the duration and predictors of recovery. We have shown that patients can take a considerable time to recover, which raises concerns over the safety of the conventional practice of unmonitored tapering. A higher initial post-synacthen cortisol concentration can predict earlier recovery and, therefore, could inform prognosis discussions with patients. The latest recovery was 23 months after discontinuation of Prednisolone, with not a single patient recovering more than two years following Prednisolone discontinuation (three patients with the latest follow-up at 27, 33, and 36 months, respectively). This finding suggests that there may be a cohort of patients that do not recover and have permanent adrenal insufficiency. A similar study done in patients with inflammatory bowel disease found a longer time to recovery with a mean of 3.1 ± 2.5 years (mean ± SD), however, comparison between this study and our findings is limited.

### In IgA nephropathy, oral methylprednisolone reduced adverse kidney outcomes but increased adverse events [^116dxE68]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The trial explored the effects of oral methylprednisolone on kidney function decline or kidney failure in patients with IgA nephropathy. The study found that methylprednisolone effectively reduced adverse kidney outcomes. However, it also led to an increase in adverse events. This highlights the need for careful consideration of the risks and benefits when prescribing this treatment to patients with IgA nephropathy.

### Steroid withdrawal after renal transplantation: A retrospective cohort study [^111GdkXs]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

In agreement with others, we found that steroid withdrawal was associated with an increased risk of acute rejection. However, in contrast to previous reports, our results revealed an increased rate of graft loss following steroid withdrawal within the first 18 months after transplantation compared to steroid maintenance during this time. Although an increased risk of acute rejection does not necessarily imply an increased rate of graft loss, we argue that the majority of trials were too small, with fewer than 300 participants, and too short, with a follow-up between 1 and 3 years, to determine long-term outcomes.

It is not surprising that the rate of graft loss, as shown in our analysis, is higher if steroids are withdrawn within the first 18 months following engraftment as the immunological risk is higher earlier after transplantation. It is reasonable to assume that graft loss requires a larger amount of time to develop compared to acute rejection, which is an earlier outcome and is thus not observed in clinical trials. Our findings challenge recommendations to abstain from steroid withdrawal in kidney transplantation beyond 1 week after engraftment, as well as proposals for safe steroid withdrawal between 3 and 6 months despite the absence of long-term evidence from randomized trials.

In line with previous analyses, we found no significant difference in mortality between steroid withdrawal and maintenance at any time point after transplantation despite the availability of long-term follow-up data in our registry. However, this does not only suggest that steroid withdrawal is…

### Using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in volume depleted children can precipitate acute renal failure [^113FnHx9]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are increasingly popular in hospital medicine and general practice and are readily available over the counter. The vast majority of healthy children who ingest therapeutic doses of NSAIDs for a limited duration tolerate them without any significant adverse effects. However, the risk of renal toxicity is potentially increased in situations where there is stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system, such as with volume depletion or in pre-existing chronic renal disease. We describe four cases that illustrate this complication occurring in a children's hospital. Although we have not proven cause and effect, further research is needed to define the true risk of the potential renal complications of NSAIDs in patients at risk of dehydration.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and reno-protection: What's the evidence & where do they fit? A guide for non-specialists [^116eZaqX]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

The role of aldosterone has yet to be well appreciated in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Two variables define CKD: an estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria of 30mg/g; both are needed for an accurate diagnosis. The presence of CKD at this level is associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular death and a greater risk of CKD progression to kidney failure and subsequent dialysis. This paper presents an overview of aldosterone's importance in CKD and its contribution to the inflammatory processes involved in CKD development.

Data on outcomes, both surrogate and hard, related to CKD progression will also be discussed in the context of mineralocorticoid blockade. Based on recent epidemiological data, as well as data examining markers of diabetic kidney disease progression, it is clear that the use of both renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and aldosterone receptor antagonists play a significant role in altering the natural history of kidney disease progression itself. Additionally, they help reduce the risk of cardiovascular events that generally accompany long-standing kidney disease.

This paper will discuss these issues and the management of consequent hyperkalaemia when both steroidal and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are used in detail.

### The effect of steroids in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass: An individual patient meta-analysis of two randomized trials [^111KffhW]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). High credibility.

Steroids suppress the inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass, but the impact on death at 30 days, myocardial infarction or injury, stroke, renal failure, respiratory failure, new atrial fibrillation, transfusion requirement, infection, and length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays are uncertain.

- **Objective**: Steroids suppress the inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass, but their impact on various postoperative outcomes is uncertain.

- **Design**: A meta-analysis was conducted using patient-level data from two randomized trials.

- **Setting**: The study involved 88 cardiac surgical centers across 19 countries.

- **Participants**: A total of 11,989 patients from the Steroids in Cardiac Surgery trial and the Dexamethasone in Cardiac Surgery study were included. All participants underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.

- **Interventions**: Participants were randomized to receive either steroids or a placebo.

- **Measures and main results**: Outcomes assessed included mortality at 30 days, myocardial infarction or injury, stroke, renal failure, respiratory failure, new atrial fibrillation, transfusion requirement, infection, and length of ICU and hospital stays. There was no significant difference in death at 30 days between the steroid and placebo groups (odds ratio [OR], 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–1.07). Myocardial infarction did not differ significantly (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.93–1.47); however, myocardial injury was higher in the steroid group (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.12–1.40). There were no significant differences for the outcomes of stroke, renal failure, new atrial fibrillation, or transfusion. Steroids significantly reduced respiratory failure (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75–0.99), infection (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72–0.89), and length of ICU stays (p < 0.001).

### Reporting of corticosteroid use in systemic disease trials: Evidence from a systematic review of the potential impact on treatment effect [^116TAr5i]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

To study how corticosteroid therapy is planned and described in reports of systemic disease trials and estimate the impact of the between-arm difference in corticosteroid dose on treatment effect, we performed a systematic review of PubMed and Cochrane databases on all reports of randomized systemic disease trials with corticosteroids as a cointervention. Data were extracted on the trial characteristics and results, planning of corticosteroid use, and dose. Success rates were adjusted for corticosteroid use for studies with available data and a binary outcome. As the exact impact of between-arm differences in corticosteroid dose on success rates is unknown, we tested different values for the impact of a difference of 1 unit (1 mg for daily dosage or 250 mg for cumulative dose at the end of the trial).

A total of 139 trials were identified, including 79 investigating lupus and 30 investigating vasculitis. Planned management of corticosteroid use was specified in 101 reports (72.7%), with a fully described tapering scheme in 33 (23.7%). Corticosteroid consumption for each arm was given in 60 reports (43.2%), with a comparison of daily or cumulative dosage at the end of the trial in 32 (23.0%). An attempt to adjust for corticosteroid use was described in 2 (1.5%). With a value of 2.5% for the impact of a 1-unit difference in corticosteroid dose, adjustment yielded changes in success rate differences exceeding 10% in 11 (46%) of the 24 reports analyzed.

For systemic disease trials, use of corticosteroids as a cointervention is of significant interest.

### Safety and efficacy of steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients with kidney failure requiring dialysis: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115ZDHC7]. Lancet (2025). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists can prevent cardiovascular events in patients with heart failure and non-severe chronic kidney disease, but their effects in patients with kidney failure requiring dialysis are uncertain. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in this patient population.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we updated our previous systematic review by searching MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature for randomised controlled trials published between database inception and March 18, 2025. Trials comparing a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with placebo or standard of care in adults (aged ≥ 18 years) receiving maintenance dialysis were eligible. Studies that did not report an outcome of interest (cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalisation, hyperkalaemia, gynaecomastia or breast pain, or hypotension) were excluded. Two reviewers independently identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The main outcome was cardiovascular mortality assessed using the empirical Bayes random-effects models, stratified by risk-of-bias. The protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251008119).

- **Findings**: Nineteen trials of steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists including 4675 participants met eligibility criteria. Effect estimates differed in trials with low and high risk of bias.

### Effect of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists on proteinuria and progression of chronic kidney disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gFXxQ]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

The search strategy in Additional file 1: Appendix 1 identified titles and abstracts. Both reviewers assessed titles and abstracts independently, discarding those not meeting inclusion criteria. Full texts of remaining trials were independently assessed. A third author (PM) settled discrepancies. Data extraction was performed using specific extraction forms (Appendix 2, see Additional file 1). Original authors were contacted for further information.

- **Assessment of risk of bias**: Two independent reviewers (GC, AT) assessed trial quality using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias assessment tool. Items assessed were adequate sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, trial personnel and outcome assessors, reporting of incomplete outcome data, suggestion of selective outcome reporting, and intention to treat analysis (Additional file 1: Table S1).

- **Statistical analysis**: Random effects meta-analysis was performed for continuous and categorical outcomes. For continuous outcomes, weighted mean differences were performed using two approaches: in analyses of continuous data, final visit results were compared for treatment and control arms after verifying by meta-analysis that baseline data for the relevant outcome were no different between trial arms; second, where sufficient data were available, change in weighted mean difference from baseline to final visit was calculated by meta-analysis. For categorical outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) as the ratio of cumulative incidence and 95% CIs from available data for trial participants.

### Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis [^114LMcDS]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is a significant problem in patients receiving glucocorticoids after transplantation and for the treatment of parenchymal renal disease and rheumatological disorders. Frequently, patients are not evaluated or treated appropriately for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Bone loss occurs early after the administration of high-dose glucocorticoid therapy. Elderly patients with low bone densities before the initiation of glucocorticoid therapy are at particular risk of developing significant bone loss that could result in fractures.

New information is now available concerning the mechanisms by which glucocorticoid-associated bone disease occurs. New therapies with anti-resorptive agents, such as bisphosphonates, and with anabolic agents, such as parathyroid hormone, offer the prospect of effective treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.

### Effects of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for chronic kidney disease: A systemic review and meta-analysis [^112fPPH9]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor blockade could be a potential approach for the inhibition of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. The benefits and harms of different mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in CKD are inconsistent.

- **Objectives**: The aim of the study was to summarize the benefits and harms of MRAs for CKD patients.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane databases for trials assessing the effects of MRAs on non-dialysis-dependent CKD populations. Treatment and adverse effects were summarized using meta-analysis.

- **Results**: Fifty-three trials with six different MRAs involving 22,792 participants were included. Compared with the control group, MRAs reduced urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (weighted mean difference [WMD], -90.90 mg/g, 95% CI, -140.17 to -41.64 mg/g), 24-hour urinary protein excretion (WMD, -0.20 g, 95% CI, -0.28 to -0.12 g), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (WMD, -1.99 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI, -3.28 to -0.70 mL/min/1.73 m²), chronic renal failure events (RR, 0.86, 95% CI, 0.79–0.93), and cardiovascular events (RR, 0.84, 95% CI, 0.77–0.92). MRAs increased the incidence of hyperkalemia (RR, 2.04, 95% CI, 1.73–2.40) and hypotension (RR, 1.80, 95% CI, 1.41–2.31). MRAs reduced the incidence of peripheral edema (RR, 0.65, 95% CI, 0.56–0.75) but not the risk of acute kidney injury (RR, 0.94, 95% CI, 0.79–1.13). Nonsteroidal MRAs (RR, 0.66, 95% CI, 0.57–0.75) but not steroidal MRAs (RR, 0.20, 95% CI, 0.02–1.68) significantly reduced the risk of peripheral edema. Steroidal MRAs (RR, 5.68, 95% CI, 1.26–25.67) but no further detail was provided in the incomplete sentence.

### Steroid withdrawal after renal transplantation: A retrospective cohort study [^1121YNqV]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Kidney transplantation is the most cost-effective treatment option for eligible patients with end-stage renal disease since transplantation is superior in terms of quality and quantity of life whilst being less costly compared to long-term dialysis treatment. However, choosing the appropriate immunosuppressive treatment strategy is a key decision for sustained allograft function. Despite the development of novel immunosuppressants in recent years, serious side effects, such as increased cardiovascular risk, impaired immune system detection of cancer cells, and antiviral defense, still result from long-term intake of immunosuppressive drugs. Therefore, various strategies to reduce immunosuppression are being investigated with the aim to alleviate toxicity associated with this treatment.

Maintenance immunosuppression usually consists of three components, one of which is frequently a corticosteroid. Steroids are effective in preventing acute rejection, which is one of the main risk factors for reduced long-term graft survival when not appropriately diagnosed and treated. Although triple immunosuppression allows lower steroid doses, the disadvantageous association of steroids with weight gain, hyperlipidemia, high blood pressure, impaired glucose metabolism, and osteoporosis persists. Consequently, several randomized trials have been performed to investigate the efficacy of steroid withdrawal after kidney transplantation. However, clinical trials can only investigate withdrawal at a specific time point, which likely may not be the optimal choice.

### Chronic kidney disease in diabetes: A clinical practice guideline [^1179cfSc]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, the 2025 DC guidelines recommend initiating a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with proven efficacy, such as finerenone, alongside potassium monitoring. This is advised for adult patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy, defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 25–90 mL/min/1.73 m² and an albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 3–30 mg/mmol, with or without diabetic retinopathy. More specific recommendations are provided for those with an eGFR of 25–60 mL/min/1.73 m² or an eGFR greater than 25 mL/min/1.73 m² with an albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 30–500 mg/mmol. These patients should be on the maximally tolerated or maximally prescribed doses of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, with serum potassium levels ≤ 4.8 mmol/L, to improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes.

### Do high-dose corticosteroids improve outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients [^113kjc2p]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by a dysregulated hyperimmune response, and steroids have been shown to decrease mortality. However, whether higher dosing of steroids results in better outcomes has been debated. This was a retrospective observation of COVID-19 admissions between March 1, 2020, and March 10, 2021. Adult patients (≥ 18 years) who received more than 10 mg daily methylprednisolone equivalent dosing (MED) within the first 14 days were included. We excluded patients who were discharged or died within 7 days of admission.

We compared the standard dose of steroids (40 mg MED). Inverse probability weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) was used to examine whether higher dose steroids resulted in improved outcomes. The outcomes studied were in-hospital mortality, rate of acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring hemodialysis, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), hospital-associated infections (HAI), and readmissions. Of the 1,379 patients meeting study criteria, 506 received less than 40 mg of MED (median dose 30 mg MED) and 873 received more than or equal to 40 mg of MED (median dose 78 mg MED).

Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was higher in patients who received high-dose corticosteroids (40.7% vs. 18.6%, p < 0.001). On IPWRA, the use of high-dose corticosteroids was associated with higher odds of death (odds ratio [OR] 2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45–3.14, p < 0.001) but not with the development of HAI, readmissions, or requirement of IMV. High-dose corticosteroids were associated with lower rates of AKI requiring hemodialysis.

### Efficacy and safety of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in kidney transplant patients: An updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116PddYK]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In a prior meta-analysis, the authors found that while MRAs increase the risk of hyperkalemia, it did not correlate with a higher risk of clinical complications, emphasizing that the benefits of taking MRAs outweighed the risk of this adverse effect. In kidney transplant (KT) recipients, MRAs are generally used with caution because these patients are already at risk of hyperkalemia due to the concomitant use of drugs, such as calcineurin inhibitors, that can elevate potassium levels. Our analysis confirmed a significantly higher risk of hyperkalemia in patients treated with steroidal MRAs compared to placebo, reinforcing prior evidence and highlighting this safety concern in the KT population. The GRADE assessment supported this finding with high-certainty evidence.

Gynecomastia has previously been reported in patients treated with steroidal MRAs. The SPIREN trial was the only study that specifically evaluated this outcome, reporting 19 cases of gynecomastia in the spironolactone group compared to 12 cases in the placebo group.

Studies demonstrate that MRAs may reduce fibrosis in KT, potentially preserving graft function for longer. Our analysis showed that there were no significant differences between treatment groups regarding interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) scores, independent of their severity. Notably, in the SPIREN trial, the MRA-treated group included older kidney allografts with initial biopsies showing more chronic lesions in the spironolactone group. This may have rendered these allografts less responsive to the beneficial effects of the treatment over time.

### Duration of treatment with corticosteroids and recovery of kidney function in acute interstitial nephritis [^1117cJiV]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis represents an emerging cause of acute kidney disease, especially among polymedicated elderly patients. Although corticosteroids are frequently used, controversy exists about the timing of initiation, efficacy, safety, and duration of treatment.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: We performed a retrospective study of 182 patients with biopsy-proven drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis from 13 Spanish centers. Exposure was defined as the length of corticosteroid treatment. The main outcome was the level of serum creatinine at month 6, with respect to baseline values.

- **Results**: The most common offending agents were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (27%). In 30% of patients, the offending drug could not be identified. The median time to suspected drug withdrawal was 11 days (interquartile range, 5–22). All patients presented with acute kidney disease and were treated with corticosteroids. The mean initial dose of prednisone was 0.8 ± 0.2 mg/kg per day. High-dose corticosteroid treatment was maintained for 2 weeks (interquartile range, 1–4). After 6 months, the mean recovered GFR was 34 ± 26 ml/min per 1.73 m², and ten patients required maintenance dialysis. Use of high-dose corticosteroids for 3 weeks or treatment duration > 8 weeks were not associated with better recovery of kidney function. In the multivariable analysis, delayed onset of steroid treatment (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 1.04) and the presence of interstitial fibrosis of > 50% on the kidney biopsy specimen.

### Treatment of renal sarcoidosis: Is there a guideline? Overview of the different treatment options [^116rAeKy]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology characterized by the presence of non-caseating granulomas. It may affect any organ, including the kidney. Disordered calcium metabolism is most often responsible for the development of renal failure. Granulomatous interstitial nephritis is the most typical histological finding, but it rarely leads to renal insufficiency.

Since the development of renal insufficiency in sarcoidosis is uncommon, large randomized trials concerning the treatment of this disorder are lacking. Most information is derived from case reports and small series. Our knowledge of pulmonary sarcoidosis is more comprehensive. However, it is impossible to treat renal manifestations identically because some of the drugs used in pulmonary sarcoidosis are nephrotoxic. Moreover, renal sarcoidosis is a specific entity with its own characteristics and response to therapy.

A guideline for treatment is currently missing. Based on a review of the literature, this overview of different treatment options aims to promote a more uniform and scrutinized approach to this disease. Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria can be treated with corticosteroids, (hydroxy)chloroquine, or ketoconazole. Preventive measures play a supportive role. In granulomatous interstitial nephritis, glucocorticoids are the standard of care. In patients with failure of or a contraindication to corticosteroids or in those patients who need a high maintenance dose of corticosteroids, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil can be used. TNF-alpha inhibitors are useful in cases of steroid resistance.

### Corticosteroid and calcineurin inhibitor sparing regimens in kidney transplantation [^112nURY6]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a major public health problem associated with increased risks of kidney disease progression, cardiovascular disease, and death. Kidney transplantation remains the renal replacement therapy of choice for patients with end-stage kidney disease. Despite impressive strides in short-term allograft survival, there has been little improvement in long-term kidney graft survival, and rates of death with a functioning allograft remain high. The long-term safety profiles of existing immunosuppressive regimens point to a need for continued search for alternative agents. This overview discusses emerging evidence on a few promising therapeutic approaches, juxtaposes conflicting findings, and highlights remaining knowledge gaps.

### Corticosteroid therapy in IgA nephropathy [^114chEK3]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

The benefits and risks of steroids for the treatment of IgA nephropathy remain uncertain. We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials of corticosteroid therapy for IgA nephropathy published between 1966 and March 2011. We identified nine relevant trials that included 536 patients who had urinary protein excretion > 1 g/d and normal renal function. Forty-six (8.6%) of these patients developed a kidney failure event, defined as the doubling of serum creatinine, halving of the GFR, or ESRD. Overall, steroid therapy was associated with a lower risk for kidney failure (relative risk, 0.32 [95% confidence interval, 0.15–0.67]; P = 0.002) and a reduction in proteinuria (weighted mean difference, -0.46 g/d [95% CI, -0.63 to -0.29 g/d]), with no evidence of heterogeneity in these outcomes.

- **Subgroup analysis**: Suggested that the dose modifies the effect of steroids for renal protection (P for heterogeneity = 0.030). Relatively high-dose and short-term therapy (prednisone > 30 mg/d or high-dose pulse intravenous methylprednisolone with duration ≤ 1 year) produced significant renal protection, whereas low-dose, long-term steroid use did not.

Steroid therapy was associated with a 55% higher risk for adverse events. The quality of the included studies was low, however, limiting the generalizability of the results. In conclusion, steroids appear to provide renal protection in patients with IgA nephropathy but increase the risk for adverse events. Reliably defining the efficacy and safety of steroids in IgA nephropathy requires a high-quality study.

### Adrenal insufficiency in kidney transplant patients during low-dose prednisolone therapy: a cross-sectional case-control study [^116j9377]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

Maintenance immunosuppressive regimens after renal transplantation (RTx) most often include prednisolone, which may induce secondary adrenal insufficiency. This condition is a potentially life-threatening side effect of glucocorticoid (GC) treatment due to the risk of acute adrenal crisis. We investigated the prevalence of prednisolone-induced adrenal insufficiency in RTx patients receiving long-term low-dose prednisolone treatment.

- **Methods**: We performed a case-control study of patients on renal replacement therapy differing in terms of GC exposure. The study included 30 RTx patients transplanted more than 11 months before enrolment in the study and treated with prednisolone (5 or 7.5 mg prednisolone/day for ≥ 6 months) and 30 dialysis patients not treated with prednisolone. Patients underwent testing for adrenal insufficiency using a 250-µg Synacthen test performed fasting in the morning following a 48-hour prednisolone pause. Normal adrenal function was defined as P-cortisol ≥ 420 nmol/L 30 minutes after Synacthen injection. This cut-off is used routinely for the new Roche Elecsys Cortisol II assay and is validated locally based on the Synacthen test responses in 100 healthy individuals.

- **Results**: Thirteen RTx patients {43% [95% confidence interval (CI) 27–61]} had an insufficient response to the Synacthen test compared with one patient in the control group [3% (95% CI 0.6–17)] (P = 0.0004). Insufficient responses were seen in 9/25 and 4/5 RTx patients treated with 5 and 7.5 mg prednisolone/day, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: We found a high prevalence of adrenal insufficiency among RTx patients receiving long-term low-dose prednisolone therapy.

### High-dose glucocorticoids improve renal failure reversibility in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma [^112zYxDU]. American Journal of Hematology (2011). Low credibility.

One-fifth of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients present with renal failure (RF) [1–3]. Glucocorticoids (GCs) may improve RF in MM by: (1) rapid reduction of paraprotein production, (2) lessening inflammation and fibrosis in renal parenchyma, and (3) decreasing serum calcium levels. We hypothesized that lower dose GCs may be less effective in restoring renal function and retrospectively compared RF reversibility between newly diagnosed MM patients treated with GCs equivalent to ≥ 160 mg dexamethasone (DX) over 4 days (high-dose GC group, n = 16) versus those treated with < 160 mg (low-dose/no GC group, n = 8). There was no difference in age, baseline calcium, and creatinine levels between the two groups. Renal function was restored in seven patients in the high-dose GC group (44%) and in none of the patients in the low-dose/no GC group (P = 0.026). The only other factor found to impact RF reversibility was the delay in GC initiation. Four and one patients developed a severe infection in the high- and low-dose/no GC groups, respectively.

### Adrenal function testing in dialysis patients - a review of the literature [^116wNZtd]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI) due to long-term glucocorticoid medication in patients on hemodialysis (HD) is a diagnostic challenge, as many kidney diseases are treated with corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive therapy after renal transplantation often includes prednisolone. This is further complicated, as AI and renal replacement treatment may both lead to the same unspecific symptoms like fatigue and orthostatic hypotonia.

Undetected adrenal insufficiency may be life-threatening; therefore, testing adrenal function in HD patients, especially after glucocorticoid therapy or in chronic hypotensive patients, is a common procedure. The adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) test is a standard test for diagnosing AI. The 250 μg ACTH test is more suitable for primary AI, while the low-dose (1 μg) ACTH test is more sensitive for secondary AI. Both tests are usually carried out in the morning, as the daily physiological value of baseline cortisol is highest at this point. Importantly, peak cortisol values after ACTH stimulation are not dependent on diurnal rhythms.

For patients on HD, who usually spend three half-days per week in the hospital or in community-based centers, additional appointments and time-consuming tests are cumbersome. Furthermore, finding an accessible suitable additional vein for venous puncture is often difficult in these patients. Therefore, performing testing for AI during ongoing HD would facilitate the procedure. There are concerns about metabolism and clearance for adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol in addition to hemoconcentration.

### Use of corticosteroids in Norwegian patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy progressing to end-stage kidney disease: a retrospective cohort study [^113QTGWg]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids did not delay progression to ESKD in our cohort of high-risk Norwegian patients when comparing corticosteroid therapy to patients who only received supportive therapy and also reached ESKD (p = 0.98). This finding is similar to the STOP-IgAN trial. Moreover, in our study, the STOP-IgAN and TESTING trials reported adverse effects and a temporary reduction in proteinuria during corticosteroid therapy, which did not persist for several years after tapering off the corticosteroids.

There were several differences among the three studies. The included patients in the TESTING and STOP-IgAN trials had similar kidney function parameters at the time of enrollment in the randomized trial phase. However, patients in both these trials had better kidney functions at the time of initiation of corticosteroid therapy than those in our study. Similar differences have been observed among supportive care groups in the two aforementioned drug trials and our study. These differences might have affected the study outcomes; however, they were expected, as we only included patients who had progressed to ESKD and thus had a known aggressive IgAN. Additionally, the TESTING trial included younger patients and almost twice as many women as those in our study and the STOP-IgAN trial. Sex differences in the clinical progression of non-diabetic kidney diseases, such as IgAN, have been reported; however, they are controversial.

### Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients: Consensus statements from an international task force by the American College of Critical Care Medicine [^1177twrz]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

To develop consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients, a multidisciplinary, multispecialty task force of experts in critical care medicine was convened. Members were drawn from the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, with additional participation from international experts in endocrinology.

The task force reviewed published literature and provided expert opinion to derive the consensus statements. A modified Delphi methodology was used to develop these statements. The strength of each recommendation was quantified using the Modified GRADE system, which classifies recommendations as strong (grade 1) or weak (grade 2), and the quality of evidence as high (grade A), moderate (grade B), or low (grade C), based on study design, result consistency, and evidence directness.

The task force introduced the term "critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency" to describe the dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during critical illness. This condition is a result of adrenal insufficiency combined with tissue corticosteroid resistance and is characterized by an exaggerated and prolonged proinflammatory response. It should be suspected in hypotensive patients who respond poorly to fluids and vasopressor agents.

### Steroid avoidance or withdrawal for kidney transplant recipients [^1121eU2L]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Steroid-sparing strategies have been attempted in recent decades to avoid morbidity from long-term steroid intake among kidney transplant recipients. Previous systematic reviews of steroid withdrawal after kidney transplantation have shown a significant increase in acute rejection. Various protocols exist to withdraw steroids after kidney transplantation, and their possible benefits or harms are subject to systematic review. This is an update of a review first published in 2009.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of steroid withdrawal or avoidance for kidney transplant recipients.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 15 February 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which steroids were avoided or withdrawn at any time point after kidney transplantation were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Assessment of risk of bias and data extraction was performed by two authors independently, and disagreements were resolved by discussion. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model, and dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risk (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals.

- **Main results**: We included 48 studies (224 reports) that involved 7,803 randomized participants. Of these, three studies were conducted in children (346 participants). The 2009 review included 30 studies (94 reports, 5,949 participants).

### Adrenal insufficiency is common amongst kidney transplant recipients receiving maintenance prednisolone and can be predicted using morning cortisol [^114NWj5T]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

Interval screening with a basal serum cortisol concentration is appropriate for identifying patients maintained on immunosuppressive glucocorticoid therapy who are at risk of adrenal insufficiency (AI). However, in the event of discontinuation or reduction of glucocorticoid dose below AI replacement dosing (< 3–5 mg prednisolone/day), a short Synacthen test (SST) is required to ensure adequate adrenal function. Should these patients have AI, they are at risk of adrenal crisis in the absence of adequate glucocorticoid replacement and should be commenced on physiological replacement glucocorticoids such as hydrocortisone 10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the afternoon. In this case, we would suggest referral to an endocrinologist to ensure that adequate glucocorticoid replacement is prescribed.

- **Screening for AI in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) using a morning serum cortisol**: *Serum cortisol concentration measured using a second-generation immunoassay.*

In conclusion, AI is common in KTRs receiving low-dose prednisolone as immunosuppressive therapy and is largely undiagnosed. A greater awareness of this risk of AI among both KTRs and clinicians caring for this patient group is key in reducing the potential risk of an adrenal crisis. We would advocate that steroid sick day rules education should be considered as part of routine clinical care for all KTRs receiving glucocorticoid-based immunosuppression. A single morning serum cortisol concentration is a useful screening tool in this patient cohort and may help to identify patients at the highest risk of AI. Finally, we would strongly encourage clinicians to perform an asse

### Glucocorticoids in the treatment of glomerular diseases: Pitfalls and pearls [^112eRi82]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids exert anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities through both genomic and nongenomic effects. The classic genomic effects are mediated by cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors, which can upregulate the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins in the nucleus (transactivation) or repress the translocation of proinflammatory transcription factors from the cytosol into the nucleus (transrepression). The nongenomic effects are likely mediated by membrane glucocorticoid receptors. Glucocortoid receptors are also expressed in podocytes, and experimental data suggest that glucocorticoids may protect against podocyte injury.

Glucocorticoids have a low therapeutic index and may cause various time-dependent and dose-dependent side effects. Measures to prevent or mitigate these side effects include single-morning administration of short-acting glucocorticoids, dietary counseling, increased physical activity, frequent monitoring, and adapting doses to the patient's clinical condition. Synthetic glucocorticoids, either given alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive drugs, remain cornerstone therapies in multiple glomerular disorders. However, glucocorticoids offer limited benefit in C3 glomerulopathy and may be potentially deleterious in patients with maladaptive focal glomerulosclerosis. Their efficacy is contingent not only on the type and severity of glomerular disease but also on the timeliness of administration, dosage, and duration of treatment. Excessive use of glucocorticoids can result in severe toxicity, while inadequate doses may not provide the desired therapeutic effect.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112Bs4iG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Despite their efficacy as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents, chronic use of glucocorticoids can induce manifestations of Cushing syndrome, along with concomitant central and later permanent adrenal insufficiency (suppression of the entire HPA axis). For this reason, clinicians prescribing glucocorticoids for non-endocrine reasons are advised to employ the lowest effective dose and duration of therapy, considering tapering glucocorticoid doses when treatment is no longer necessary for the underlying condition.

Given the widespread use of glucocorticoids, it is imperative that treating physicians of any discipline be well-versed in the clinical consequences of long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. It is equally critical to recognize signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and be experienced in methods to taper and/or stop glucocorticoids once their pharmacologic effects are no longer required.

The management of glucocorticoid therapy is considered a general medical skill that should be managed by the prescribing clinician, also taking into consideration the underlying disease as a determinant of tapering speed. Furthermore, the affected number of patients (at least 1% of the general population) is too large with too few endocrinology providers to perform consultations for each instance of glucocorticoid tapering. When prescribing clinicians decide that glucocorticoid therapy is no longer required, they should educate their patients on methods.

### Steroid-free maintenance immunosuppression in kidney transplantation: Is it time to consider it as a standard therapy [^111VodYg]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Steroid-free immunosuppression in kidney transplantation has gained popularity over the past decade, evidenced by a continuous and steady rise in the number of kidney transplant patients discharged on steroid-free regimens. This increased interest is fueled by the recognition that half of transplant loss is related to patient death due to cardiovascular disease and/or infectious complications, with the long-term use of steroids contributing significantly to elevated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The availability of newer and more potent immunosuppressive agents has furthered this interest.

Many clinical trials over the past two decades have demonstrated the feasibility of steroid-free regimens, with a slight increase in the rate of acute rejection, which is an important endpoint in any clinical trial of relatively short duration. The largest epidemiological study at the time reassured the transplant community that the selective use of steroid-free immunosuppression in kidney transplant patients provides no inferior outcome in patient and graft survival at the intermediate term. Steroid-free regimens have the potential to improve cardiovascular risk profiles.

The challenges that remain include identifying the subset of kidney transplant patients who may not benefit from steroid-free immunosuppression and demonstrating the survival advantage of steroid-free immunosuppression in suitable kidney transplant candidates.

### Safety and tolerability of the novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist BAY 94–8862 in patients with chronic heart failure and mild or moderate chronic kidney disease: A randomized, double-blind trial [^114NBnHQ]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were adult males and females without childbearing potential with a clinical diagnosis of HFrEF, classified under New York Heart Association class II–III and a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%. Patients needed to be treated with evidence-based therapy for HFrEF, have a serum potassium concentration ≤ 4.8 mmol/L at the screening visit, and an eGFR between 60 and < 90 mL/min/1.73 m² (part A) or 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m² (part B) as per the MDRD formula.

- **Study medication**: Patients in both parts of the study received the study drug for 4 weeks, beginning within 14 days post the initial screening visit. The randomization assignments were generated using a validated automated system. In part A, patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive oral BAY 94–8862 at doses of 2.5, 5, or 10 mg q.d. or placebo. In part B, patients were randomized 1:1:1:1:1:1 to receive oral BAY 94–8862 at doses of 2.5, 5, or 10 mg q.d., 5 mg twice daily (b.i.d.), placebo, or open-label oral spironolactone, initially dosed at 25 mg q.d. and up-titrated to 50 mg q.d. on day 15 ± 1 if serum potassium concentration remained ≤ 4.8 mmol/L.

- **Investigations**: Patients were assessed at various stages, including the screening visit, baseline/day 1, day 4 ± 1, and day 8 ± 1, followed by weekly checks until the end of the study and a follow-up 14 days after the last intake of the study drug. Assessments were conducted promptly for patients who ended the study prematurely.

Empowering patients with knowledge of the benefits and risks of glucocorticoid therapy is critical. Patients require information in a format appropriate to their age, education level, and learning style, along with access to supportive social resources such as family members, care providers, and disease-oriented support groups. We recommend the inclusion of at least one family member or primary caregiver in all education sessions.

Patient education and empowerment to adjust glucocorticoid doses according to stressors are essential to prevent severe symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis. A large study surveying patients with adrenal insufficiency, including those with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, demonstrated low confidence in self-management to prevent adrenal crisis. Poor disease knowledge and lack of awareness of adrenal insufficiency subtype diagnosis were associated with higher rates of adrenal crisis. Standardized patient education programs for patients and their relatives proved to be useful for sustainably improving the level of knowledge regarding the prevention of adrenal crisis, as well as self-confidence in dealing with the disease.

The risk for developing adrenal insufficiency and the potential for adrenal crisis during glucocorticoid treatment and taper is low but increases with the cumulative number of risk factors, including glucocorticoid potency, administration route, dose, and treatment duration.

### Steroids as treatment for glomerulonephritis: Time for a rethink [^116XcdhB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids have been a cornerstone of treatment for inflammatory and autoimmune kidney diseases for almost 70 years, yet it is fair to say we still do not know how 'best' to use them. Significant adverse events are associated with their continued use, which contribute to premature patient mortality. Steroid avoidance or minimization is possible and has been tested in various glomerular diseases as a result of novel agents or innovative regimens using established therapeutics. It is now time to seriously address our use of steroids and educate physicians on better ways of managing inflammatory kidney diseases.

### Steroid avoidance or withdrawal for kidney transplant recipients [^1129YBpe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Steroid-sparing strategies have been attempted during the last two decades to avoid morbidity in kidney transplant recipients. Previous systematic reviews of steroid withdrawal after kidney transplantation have shown significant increases in acute rejection and an increase in graft failure rates. Steroid avoidance in kidney transplantation is increasingly attempted, and the possible benefits or harms have not been systematically reviewed.

- **Objectives**: To assess the safety and efficacy of steroid withdrawal or avoidance in patients receiving a kidney transplant.

- **Search strategy**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, as well as reference lists and abstracts from international transplantation society scientific meetings.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled studies (RCTs) of steroid avoidance or withdrawal were included, provided that one treatment arm consisted of steroid avoidance or withdrawal, and intention-to-treat rates of acute rejection and graft failure were clearly established after steroid avoidance, use, withdrawal, or continuation. Observational studies were tabulated.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Main results**: We included 30 RCTs (5949 participants). Steroid-sparing strategies showed no effect on mortality or graft loss, including death. Patients on any steroid-sparing strategy showed a higher ri… (text appears truncated and incomplete).

### Efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in critically ill patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116JLrhW]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). High credibility.

In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides evidence supporting the potential benefits of early initiation, low-dose, and prolonged administration of corticosteroids in critically ill patients, demonstrating a statistical association with reduced mortality. The findings suggest that such a regimen may optimize the balance between therapeutic efficacy and safety, potentially mitigating risks linked to higher-dose or short-term steroid use, such as hyperglycemia. However, the heterogeneity among included studies, variations in patient populations, and differences in adjuvant therapies highlight the need for cautious interpretation. The use of low-dose corticosteroids in select critically ill patients, guided by individualized risk-benefit assessments and monitored for adverse effects, appears to represent a reasonable therapeutic strategy.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^113uLZzA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Once glucocorticoids are tapered down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy. Selecting one approach over the other might be driven by patient-related aspects, including comorbidities, co-medication, age, and pre-test probability for adrenal insufficiency. It may also depend on the medical context, such as the training and experience of the treating clinician or accessibility to laboratory diagnostics. There are no studies showing the superiority of any of these approaches in terms of clinical outcomes or cost-benefit.

- **Proposed approach to systemic glucocorticoid discontinuation**:
	- Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, the glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until the recovery of the HPA axis is documented. If the patient does not experience any symptoms, tapering proceeds until glucocorticoid discontinuation.
	- Alternatively, patients may undergo testing with a morning serum cortisol (sample collected between 8:00 and 9:00) for the determination of HPA axis recovery. If adrenal insufficiency is documented, exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of physiologic replacement dose ranges to ensure adequate replacement for adrenal insufficiency while still providing a stimulus for HPA-axis recovery. Patients should be retested according to recommendations.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111pknCB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency can occur with any glucocorticoid formulation, and there is no established safe level of dose exposure. Published studies provide some guidance on the overall degree of risk in patients treated with glucocorticoids; however, establishing the risk on an individual basis is challenging and relies on clinical judgment. Evidence suggests that some groups of non-oral glucocorticoid users may carry a higher risk, although this evidence is limited.

Adrenal insufficiency should be suspected in patients with recent use of non-oral glucocorticoid formulations presenting with signs and symptoms indicative of adrenal insufficiency. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency are often non-specific and can overlap with other conditions, including those for which glucocorticoids were prescribed. It is therefore imperative that healthcare professionals maintain a high degree of suspicion for the presence of adrenal insufficiency.
