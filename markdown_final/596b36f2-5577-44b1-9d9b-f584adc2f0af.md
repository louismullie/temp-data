## Question

What is the etiology of LLQ flank pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the etiology of left lower quadrant (LLQ) flank pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomic pain locus and involved organ systems. Then, I should prioritize time-sensitive emergencies. Next, I will organize common etiologies by system (gastrointestinal, genitourinary, gynecologic, vascular/splenic, abdominal wall/neuropathic), align them with key history, exam, and laboratory discriminators, and map appropriate imaging pathways. Finally, I should consider pitfalls, special populations, and a practical initial algorithm for triage and testing, verifying recommendations against guideline-based sources at each step [^1147mvFJ] [^117PDmzo] [^114Hh4Ji].

> Let me first confirm the anatomical framework: LLQ flank pain sits at the intersection of the left lower abdominal quadrant and the lateral flank, implicating sigmoid/descending colon, left ureter and kidney, left adnexa in females, retroperitoneal structures, and the abdominal wall; pathophysiology spans luminal obstruction (e.g., ureteral calculus), inflammatory processes (e.g., diverticulitis, pyelonephritis), ischemia/infarction, torsion, hemorrhage/compressive lesions, and neuropathic causes such as zoster; I need to ensure I do not over-attribute flank localization solely to renal causes because retroperitoneal colonic or pancreatic tail processes can refer laterally as well [^1147mvFJ] [^114Hh4Ji].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should first screen for high-risk and time-sensitive diagnoses: abdominal aortic aneurysm or iliac aneurysm rupture or leak, splenic injury in the appropriate context, ectopic pregnancy or ovarian torsion in women of childbearing potential, colonic perforation with peritonitis, renal infarction or dissection, and even pulmonary embolism masquerading as flank pain; missing these would be consequential, so vitals, hemodynamic stability, pregnancy testing, vascular risk factors, and rapid imaging when unstable are key [^1177iMjD] [^114HqG8W] [^117Bao4o] [^114YoNX8] [^115TV4Jx].

> Let me consider gastrointestinal sources next; acute sigmoid diverticulitis is the leading LLQ diagnosis when accompanied by fever and leukocytosis, with CT abdomen/pelvis the preferred test both to confirm diverticulitis and to identify complications or mimics; I should also remember epiploic appendagitis as a benign, localized, self-limited mimic of diverticulitis that presents with focal, nonmigratory LLQ pain and often normal labs, typically confirmed on CT by an oval fat-attenuation lesion with a central dot sign; and I need to keep rare left-sided appendicitis in mind due to malrotation, situs inversus, or a redundant colon when the clinical picture does not fit straightforward diverticulitis [^1147mvFJ] [^117PDmzo] [^112pgiSH] [^111i2amD] [^113WTJTm] [^1146ihfd].

> Wait, let me verify the genitourinary contributors; nephrolithiasis is common and classically causes acute colicky flank pain, sometimes with hematuria — though absence of hematuria does not exclude stones — so risk stratification with clinical tools like the STONE score can help, with imaging tailored by patient factors; unenhanced CT is highly accurate for ureteral stones, but ultrasound is preferred first in pregnancy and may be reasonable in younger or low-risk patients, while MRI or contrast-enhanced options can be considered if CT is nondiagnostic; I should also consider that nonobstructing renal calculi can still produce significant pain in a subset of patients; on the infectious side, acute pyelonephritis typically adds fever, CVA tenderness, and pyuria or bacteriuria; more unusual renal causes include nutcracker syndrome with chronic left flank pain and hematuria, Page kidney from a subcapsular hematoma compressing the parenchyma, and venous thrombosis mimicking a calculus on ultrasound [^112vwgDG] [^113KcCn9] [^1133mYfn] [^114KVLtP] [^115ZRV7b] [^117SEQxU] [^114XW7Zf] [^116kWkn6] [^115qgcxk].

> I should confirm gynecologic etiologies in females with LLQ flank or pelvic pain; ovarian torsion, ruptured ovarian cyst, tubo-ovarian abscess, and ectopic pregnancy can localize to the left side and sometimes present with flank-dominant pain if irritation is lateralized; transvaginal pelvic ultrasound is the initial study of choice, with pregnancy testing mandatory; I also need to remember iatrogenic risk states like ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome from gonadotropins, which can present with severe pelvic/abdominal pain and require urgent evaluation; rare müllerian anomalies or adnexal torsion-mimics can present atypically and may only declare themselves on laparoscopy if imaging is nonrevealing [^112vMdzN] [^117WDHBC] [^113ndLGU] [^117Bao4o].

> Next, I will examine vascular, splenic, pancreatic, and thoracoabdominal mimics; although LLQ flank pain initially sounds below the spleen, referred pain patterns and patient factors matter — splenic injury, infarct, or even splenic artery aneurysm can involve left-sided pain with shoulder radiation or peritoneal signs, and I should double-check for trauma or procedures like ESWL that can injure the spleen; pancreatitis of the tail can present primarily with left flank pain and be misdiagnosed as renal disease on first pass; and pulmonary embolism can surprisingly present as isolated flank pain with incidental lung-base findings on abdominal CT, so I need to keep that in the back of my mind when the story does not fit urinary or colonic disease [^114HqG8W] [^115ATkx7] [^113Zw6SU] [^116RsY8r] [^115TV4Jx].

> Let me first confirm the imaging pathway because diagnostic yield depends on matching modality to the suspected system and patient context; for general undifferentiated LLQ abdominal pain, CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast is recommended to narrow the wide differential and detect complications, while in women of childbearing potential, pelvic ultrasound is prioritized for gynecologic pathology; for suspected urolithiasis, noncontrast CT is most sensitive, but ultrasound is preferred initially in pregnancy and is acceptable to reduce radiation in selected patients, with MR urography or contrast-enhanced CT as problem-solving studies if needed; I should double-check that both CT and ultrasound can reveal alternative flank pain causes beyond stones, reinforcing the value of imaging even when colic is suspected [^1147mvFJ] [^117PDmzo] [^112vwgDG] [^113KcCn9] [^1133mYfn] [^112Ge6Uv] [^116F1Q4Z].

> Now, I need to ensure the history, physical, and basic labs guide pretest probabilities before imaging; focused features include fever, migration, bowel habit change, urinary symptoms, nausea/vomiting, and gynecologic history; urinalysis for hematuria and pyuria/bacteriuria, CBC and CRP, serum creatinine, pregnancy test in all women with childbearing potential, and careful CVA tenderness assessment help discriminate stones and pyelonephritis from colonic or gynecologic disease; the STONE score components (sex, timing, origin/ethnicity, nausea/vomiting, hematuria) can stratify stone likelihood, but I should verify that low-probability patients still receive an evaluation for alternative causes; when features suggest abdominal wall or musculoskeletal origin, provocation with movement, deep breathing, or twisting and absence of visceral red flags can redirect testing appropriately [^117SEQxU] [^114KVLtP] [^1126sLNk] [^1147mvFJ].

> But wait, what about pitfalls and common missteps; epiploic appendagitis often masquerades as diverticulitis but is self-limited and managed conservatively, pulmonary embolism can be missed when imaging is limited to the abdomen unless lung bases are reviewed, renal colic can be overdiagnosed when hematuria misleads, and conversely, stones can occur without hematuria; infectious or viral illnesses, including COVID-19, may present with flank pain and lung-base findings; and unenhanced CT for stones provides a bonus: frequent identification of alternative pathologies that account for pain, which I should review systematically in every scan [^112pgiSH] [^111i2amD] [^115TV4Jx] [^112Kt5Np] [^116W5N2S] [^1152jgsx].

> Hmm, wait a minute — initially I almost labeled all left-sided upper quadrant findings as irrelevant to LLQ flank pain, but I should correct that: diaphragmatic irritation and retroperitoneal spread can blur boundaries, so splenic and pancreatic tail processes can project to the flank and even to lower quadrants depending on body habitus and inflammation, which reinforces my earlier emphasis on imaging correlation rather than strict reliance on surface quadrants alone [^114HqG8W] [^1147mvFJ].

> To synthesize an initial approach, I will start with vitals and red flags (hemodynamic instability, peritonitis, pregnancy status, uncontrolled pain), perform targeted labs (UA, CBC, CRP, BMP, hCG when applicable), and select imaging based on dominant suspicion: CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast for undifferentiated LLQ pain or suspected diverticulitis, pelvic ultrasound for suspected gynecologic pathology, and noncontrast renal CT or ultrasound-first strategy for suspected stones with adjustments for pregnancy and radiation concerns; management follows diagnosis: antibiotics and possible drainage for complicated diverticulitis, NSAIDs/alpha-blockers or urology consult for stones depending on size and obstruction, early antibiotics for pyelonephritis, emergent surgical/gynecologic consultation for torsion or ectopic pregnancy, and vascular or interventional pathways for aneurysm or infarction; I should double-check that follow-up and return precautions are clear if a benign diagnosis like epiploic appendagitis is made conservatively [^1147mvFJ] [^117PDmzo] [^112vwgDG] [^117SEQxU].

Left lower quadrant (LLQ) flank pain most commonly arises from **diverticulitis** and **nephrolithiasis**, but the differential is broad and includes gastrointestinal, genitourinary, gynecologic, vascular, and musculoskeletal causes [^1147mvFJ] [^114Hh4Ji]. A focused history, exam, and labs guide initial evaluation, but **CT is the preferred imaging** for most adults, with ultrasound for pregnant patients or when radiation is a concern [^113Y3yaq] [^112vwgDG]. Prompt imaging is essential to identify complications or alternative diagnoses and to direct timely management [^117PDmzo].

---

## Gastrointestinal causes

- **Diverticulitis**: Most common LLQ pain; presents with LLQ pain, fever, leukocytosis, and may complicate with abscess, perforation, or fistula [^113Y3yaq] [^1137Md8C] [^1147mvFJ].

- **Colitis**: Infectious or inflammatory colitis (e.g. IBD) can cause LLQ pain with diarrhea, fever, and systemic symptoms [^114Hh4Ji] [^117PDmzo].

- **Epiploic appendagitis**: Benign, self-limited inflammation of epiploic appendages; mimics diverticulitis but typically lacks systemic symptoms [^111i2amD] [^112pgiSH].

- **Left-sided appendicitis**: Rare, usually due to anatomical variants (e.g. situs inversus, malrotation) [^113WTJTm] [^1146ihfd].

---

## Genitourinary causes

- **Nephrolithiasis**: Common cause of flank pain; may radiate to groin with hematuria and dysuria [^114Hh4Ji] [^112vwgDG] [^114KVLtP].

- **Pyelonephritis**: Flank pain with fever, chills, dysuria, and systemic infection signs [^114Hh4Ji] [^117SEQxU].

- **Ureteral obstruction**: From strictures, tumors, or external compression; causes flank pain and hydronephrosis [^114Hh4Ji] [^112Ge6Uv].

---

## Gynecological causes (in females)

Gynecological causes include **ovarian cysts or torsion** [^114Hh4Ji], which present with acute LLQ pain and adnexal tenderness; torsion is a surgical emergency [^115UKSfw]. **Ectopic pregnancy** is life-threatening and should be considered in reproductive-age women with LLQ pain and a positive pregnancy test [^111kDKdj]. **Endometriosis** causes chronic, often cyclical LLQ pain associated with menstruation [^116iLtBW].

---

## Vascular causes

Vascular causes include **abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)** — rare but life-threatening — and should be considered in older patients with risk factors [^1177iMjD]. **Renal artery or vein thrombosis** is also rare and presents with acute flank pain and possible hematuria [^112j39SF] [^115qgcxk].

---

## Musculoskeletal causes

Musculoskeletal causes include **muscle strain or spasm**, which are common, especially after recent physical activity or trauma [^1126sLNk], and **hernias** (inguinal or femoral), which can cause localized LLQ pain [^111kDKdj].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic approach** is essential, beginning with the history and physical examination to characterize the pain, associated symptoms, and risk factors [^1114fmQt]. Initial laboratory tests include CBC, urinalysis, a pregnancy test (in females), and renal function tests [^113vzEV8]. CT abdomen/pelvis is the **preferred imaging modality**; ultrasound is used for pregnant patients or when radiation is a concern [^113Y3yaq] [^112vwgDG].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring immediate evaluation

- **Severe**, sudden-onset pain [^111kDKdj]
- **Hemodynamic instability** (hypotension, tachycardia) [^113vzEV8]
- **Signs of peritonitis** (rebound tenderness, guarding) [^1111Jzaz]
- Gross **hematuria** [^112vwgDG]
- **Positive pregnancy test** with acute pain [^115UKSfw]

---

LLQ flank pain has a broad differential, but **diverticulitis and nephrolithiasis** are most common [^1147mvFJ]. A focused history, exam, and labs guide evaluation, with **CT as the primary imaging** to identify complications or alternative diagnoses and enable timely management [^112vwgDG] [^117PDmzo].

### Left lower-quadrant pain: Guidelines from the American College of Radiology appropriateness criteria [^113Y3yaq]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of left lower-quadrant pain includes gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and renal/ureteric pathology. Imaging is helpful in evaluating left lower-quadrant pain and is generally guided by the clinical presentation. Acute sigmoid diverticulitis should be suspected when the clinical triad of left lower-quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis is present. The severity of disease varies from mild pericolonic and peridiverticular inflammation to severe inflammatory changes with complications such as perforation, peritonitis, abscess, or fistula formation.

Computed tomography is the preferred test in evaluating clinically suspected diverticulitis. It is used to evaluate the severity and extent of the disease and to identify complications, but it also may diagnose other causes of left lower-quadrant pain that can mimic diverticulitis. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to assess left lower-quadrant pain. It has superior resolution of soft tissues and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation; however, it is expensive and requires more time to perform. Transabdominal ultrasonography with graded compression is another effective technique but is limited by its high operator dependency and technical difficulties in scanning patients who are obese. Pelvic ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality in women of childbearing age. Radiography with contrast enema is less sensitive than computed tomography in diagnosing diverticulitis and is seldom used.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, specifically in relation to diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining an ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder retroperitoneal as the initial or follow-up imaging for pregnant patients with acute-onset flank pain and suspicion of stone disease. Consideration should also be given to obtaining a color Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance urography, or unenhanced CT in these patients.

### Right-sided diverticulitis mimics appendicitis [^1164tyD8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Right-sided diverticulitis is a rare source of right lower quadrant pain in Western society; however, it is quite common in Asian societies. It presents very similarly to appendicitis, with right lower quadrant pain, fever, nausea, and laboratory abnormalities, and is often seen in young patients.

- **Objectives**: In this report, we present a case of right-sided diverticulitis and review its diagnosis and management. It is important to diagnose right-sided diverticulitis because it is a good mimic of appendicitis and ideally should be diagnosed before a patient has unnecessary surgery.

- **Case report**: A 26-year-old Asian woman presented for evaluation of right lower quadrant pain and fever. She was initially thought to have appendicitis clinically but was diagnosed with right-sided diverticulitis by computed tomography (CT) scan. She was admitted and received intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest. Her right-sided diverticulitis resolved in 3 days.

- **Conclusions**: Severe right lower quadrant pain in young patients of Asian descent can be right-sided diverticulitis. This condition is benign and managed medically, mimicking appendicitis. CT imaging seems to be the best way to avoid unnecessary surgery.

- **Adverse reactions in Trial 5**: In Trial 5, adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency of ≥ 2% in LINZESS-treated patients (N = 411 in each LINZESS 72 mcg and 145 mcg group) and at a higher rate than placebo (N = 401) included:
	- Diarrhea: LINZESS 72 mcg (19%); LINZESS 145 mcg (22%); placebo (7%)
	- Abdominal distension: LINZESS 72 mcg (2%); LINZESS 145 mcg (1%); placebo (< 1%)

### Flank pain and hematuria is not always a kidney stone [^116kWkn6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with flank pain and hematuria commonly present in the emergency department as cases of nephrolithiasis. Physicians may focus on this etiology and potentially overlook less common differential diagnoses. We present a case of a patient with hematuria and flank pain, typical of nephrolithiasis, who was diagnosed with a Page kidney causing secondary hypertension.

A 50-year-old male, with no significant past medical history, presented to the Emergency Department with severe left-sided flank pain, vomiting, and blood-tinged urine. While pursuing a diagnosis of nephrolithiasis, we discovered a left renal subcapsular hematoma on a non-contrast CT scan. Subsequently, a CTA was performed, revealing no active hemorrhage. The patient had no history of recent trauma but was found to be hypertensive upon evaluation. Urology was consulted, and management for the patient's hypertension was initiated. He was diagnosed with Page Kidney and admitted for observation and hypertension management with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.

Page Kidney is a condition characterized by the compression of the renal parenchyma by a hematoma or mass, causing secondary hypertension through the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Causes may include traumatic subcapsular hematoma, renal cyst rupture, tumor, hemorrhage, or arteriovenous malformation, among others. Treatment may involve conservative measures, such as hypertension management, or more invasive procedures like evacuation or nephrectomy. We described the case of a patient presumed to have nephrolithiasis, who presented with typical left-sided flank pain but was diagnosed with Page Kidney.

### Prospective multicenter evaluation of pain before and after removal of nonobstructing renal calculi: A CoRE initiative [^115ZRV7b]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Flank pain associated with stone disease is typically caused by a stone that obstructs urine flow. However, it is plausible that nonobstructing kidney stones may still cause pain. We performed a multicenter, observational trial to evaluate whether treatment of small nonobstructing calyceal stones improves pain and kidney stone-specific health-related quality of life.

- **Materials and methods**: Patients aged 18 years or older with nonobstructing renal stone(s) up to 10 mm in longest diameter and moderate to severe pain were recruited. All participants completed three questionnaires: the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System pain interference form 6a, and the Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life questionnaire. Thereafter, all participants underwent ureteroscopy for renal stone treatment. All three questionnaires were repeated at 2, 6–8, and 12 weeks postprocedure. The primary outcomes were change in preoperative to 12-week postoperative mean BPI score and worst BPI pain score.

- **Results**: A total of 43 patients with nonobstructing kidney stones and associated flank pain were recruited. All stones were removed. Preoperatively, BPI scores for mean pain and worst pain were 5.5 and 7.2, respectively, which decreased to 1.8 and 2.8, respectively, at 12 weeks postoperatively. The Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life questionnaire mean score increased from 70.4 to 115.3 at 12 weeks postoperatively. A total of 86% and 69% of patients had at least a 20% and 50% reduction in their mean pain scores, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: This study determined the impact of treating nonobstructing renal calculi on pain and quality of life.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® left lower quadrant pain: 2023 update [^1147mvFJ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

The differential diagnosis for left lower quadrant pain is wide, with conditions ranging from benign and self-limited to life-threatening surgical emergencies. Along with patient history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, imaging is often critical to limit the differential diagnosis and identify life-threatening abnormalities. This document discusses the guidelines for the appropriate use of imaging in the initial workup for patients presenting with left lower quadrant pain, including patients with suspected diverticulitis and those with suspected complications from diverticulitis.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles, such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Nonhemolytic, nonmotile gram-positive rods indicative of Bacillus anthracis [^117Bao4o]. Emerging infectious diseases (2003). Low credibility.

A 40-year-old woman, with no significant medical history, was seen at the emergency room because of worsening left lower quadrant abdominal pain. The pain, which had started a few days previously, was constant, localized to the left lower quadrant of the abdomen, and described as dull and moderately to severely intense. The pain was not related to meals or bowel movements and was not accentuated or relieved by any specific position. The patient noted constipation but had no nausea or vomiting. No rectal bleed or melena occurred, and she reported no urinary symptoms or vaginal discharge. Her last normal menstrual period was 8 days before. She felt warm but did not check her temperature and did not experience chills. Her primary medical physician prescribed ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice a day for the presumptive diagnosis of colitis. She took the antibiotic for 2 days without improvement.

In the emergency room, the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. The physical examination showed tenderness on palpation of the left lower quadrant of the abdomen with minimal rebound tenderness. The pelvic examination showed left adnexal tenderness with a possible mass. Results of urinalysis and a urine pregnancy test were negative. No leukocytosis was noted. A pelvic ultrasonograph showed a left ovarian complex mass measuring 14 cm x 9 cm x 6 cm as well as a moderate amount of free fluid in the cul-de-sac. The study suggested left ovarian mass torsion. A laparoscopic resection was performed successfully. The patient received intravenous cefazolin perioperatively.

### Left lower quadrant pain of unusual cause [^112kNK7i]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of left lower quadrant abdominal pain in an adult man includes a variety of conditions. Among them are sigmoid diverticulitis, leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm, renal colic, epididymitis, incarcerated hernia, bowel obstruction, regional enteritis, and psoas abscess. In this rare instance, the cause is situs inversus with acute appendicitis. We report a case of situs inversus totalis with left-sided appendicitis along with a brief review of the literature. Several subtle indicators of total situs inversus were present but missed by the physicians and surgeons who initially evaluated the patient prior to surgery. However, a computed tomography scan with contrast revealed the diagnosis immediately, leading to successful treatment.

### Modern approach of diagnosis and management of acute flank pain: Review of all imaging modalities [^112Ge6Uv]. European Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Acute flank pain is a common and complex clinical problem caused by various urinary and extraurinary abnormalities, with ureterolithiasis being the most frequent cause. Over the last decades, plain abdominal radiographs combined with intravenous urography (IVU) have been the standard imaging procedures for evaluating acute flank pain. Direct detection of even small ureteral calculi is achieved in 40–60% of cases. Using indirect signs such as ureteral and renal pelvic dilatation, stone detection is possible in up to 80–90% of cases. However, IVU might be hampered by poor quality due to lack of bowel preparation, nephrotoxicity of contrast agents, and serious allergic and anaphylactic reactions occurring in 10% and 1% of patients, respectively, along with significant radiation exposure.

Use of ultrasonography (US) in managing acute flank pain has been growing. By combining findings of pyeloureteral dilatation, direct visualization of stones, and the absence of ureteral ejaculation, the sensitivity to detect ureteral dilatation can be as high as 96%. Recently, unenhanced helical CT (UHCT) has been introduced as an imaging modality with high sensitivity and specificity for evaluating acute flank pain. UHCT has demonstrated superiority since:

- **It detects ureteral stones**: With a sensitivity and specificity from 98% to 100%, regardless of size, location, and chemical composition.
- **It identifies extraurinary causes of flank pain**: In about one-third of all patients presenting with acute flank pain.

### Acute flank pain: Comparison of unenhanced helical CT and ultrasonography in detecting causes other than ureterolithiasis [^116F1Q4Z]. Emergency Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Several conditions can clinically mimic renal colic. We assessed the accuracy of non-contrast-enhanced helical CT and ultrasonography (US) in offering an alternative explanation for flank pain. Over a 3-year period, 181 patients with acute flank pain underwent US and non-contrast-enhanced helical CT in a blinded sequence. Their efficacy in detecting both alternative causes of pain and additional findings unrelated to the pain was assessed in 160 cases with a confirmed diagnosis. An alternative cause was identified in 23 cases (14%).

- **Ultrasonography results**: US yielded 4 false-negative results (1 acute appendicitis, 1 ovarian cyst torsion, 1 diverticulitis, and 1 papillary necrosis) and 2 false-positive results (1 acute pyelonephritis and 1 diverticulitis). The sensitivity for non-lithiasic causes was 78%, and specificity was 98%.

- **CT results**: CT produced 5 false-negative results (1 complicated ovarian cyst, 1 pleuritis, 1 epididymitis, 1 acute pyelonephritis, and 1 papillary necrosis) and 1 false-positive result (1 simple ovarian cyst described as a complicated lesion). The sensitivity for diagnosing alternative causes was 74%, with a specificity of 99%.

There were 130 additional US findings in 68 patients and 151 additional CT findings in 77 patients. A wide spectrum of findings can be identified in subjects imaged for flank pain. Non-contrast-enhanced helical CT and US have comparable accuracy in diagnosing causes other than stone disease.

### Derivation and validation of a clinical prediction rule for uncomplicated ureteral stone — the STONE score: Retrospective and prospective observational cohort studies [^114KVLtP]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Derivation sample

Of 5,383 "flank pain protocol" CT scans — that is, the name for a non-enhanced CT scan using a renal colic protocol at our institution — performed in the emergency departments on patients 18 years of age or older during the retrospective period, 1,853 (34.4%) were randomly selected for full record review. Of these, 1,040 were complete records with no exclusion criteria. Approximately half (49.5%; 515 of 1,040) of the patients had a ureteral stone that was causing symptoms on their computed tomogram, whereas 2.9% (30 of 1,040) had acutely important alternative causes of symptoms. Inter-rater reliability for categorization of the CT result yielded a κ of 0.75–0.80, indicating excellent agreement.

### Midgut malrotation presenting with left-sided acute appendicitis and CT inversion SIGN [^1146ihfd]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

In patients presenting with abdominal pain, appendicitis is the most common surgical disorder. Appendicitis causing pain in the left lower quadrant is extremely rare and can occur due to congenital abnormalities. These may include a true left-sided appendix or an atypical presentation of a right-sided long appendix, which projects into the left lower quadrant. We report a case of a 69-year-old man showing midgut malrotation with acute appendicitis presenting as left lower quadrant abdominal pain.

### Derivation and identification of questions that act as predictors of abdominal pain of musculoskeletal origin [^1126sLNk]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Although most causes of abdominal pain have a visceral origin, the musculoskeletal system must be considered when the cause is not obvious. This prospective study aimed to identify questions that would aid the diagnosis of patients with abdominal pain of musculoskeletal origin.

- **Design**: Assessment of consecutive patients with abdominal pain recruited from gastroenterological outpatient clinics to develop diagnostic pointers to identify abdominal pain arising from musculoskeletal disorders.

- **Participants**: Subjects with benign abdominal pain, with or without a change in bowel habit, were recruited from gastroenterological clinics. Patients with inflammatory or neoplastic disease were excluded.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted in the Physiotherapy Department, Addenbrooke's NHS Trust Hospital, Cambridge.

- **Main outcome measures**: A set of questions developed to indicate a musculoskeletal cause of a patient's abdominal symptoms. The questions 'Does taking a deep breath aggravate your symptoms?' and 'Does twisting your back aggravate your symptoms?' had a significant positive indication of abdominal symptoms of musculoskeletal origin. The questions 'Has there been any change in bowel habit since onset of your symptoms?', 'Does eating foods aggravate your symptoms?' and 'Has there been any weight change since onset of symptoms?' had a significant negative indication for abdominal symptoms not of musculoskeletal origin. A combination of these questions gave 96% specificity and 67% sensitivity.

These questions may help with the early identification of abdominal pain caused by musculoskeletal issues.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^114TeDKQ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Typical of complex, ambiguous cases in the early stage, the clinician appropriately considers a very broad differential diagnosis. Three categories — infection, autoimmune conditions, and malignancy — provide structure for thinking through this case. The clinician uses the patient's age, gender, and significant travel history to help focus the extensive differential diagnosis in each category. The problem representation is now a 43-year-old woman with acute, unremitting LUQ pain and a subacute history of night sweats, weight loss, and recent travel to Mexico.

She was in moderate distress due to abdominal pain. Her temperature was 38.1°C, blood pressure 96/43 mmHg, heart rate 125 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. She had scleral icterus. Lung and heart exams were normal, except for tachycardia. The abdomen was nondistended with normal bowel sounds, but diffusely tender, particularly in the LUQ. Liver span was 15 cm to percussion, and the spleen was not palpable. She had no peritoneal signs or costovertebral angle tenderness, and a pelvic examination was normal. Her neurological and skin examinations were normal.

Her appearance and vital signs suggest the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which requires prompt evaluation, stabilization, and usually empiric antibiotic treatment. Jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain prioritize acute bacterial cholangitis as an immediate concern, despite the uncertainty surrounding the nature of the subacute underlying illness. Hepatomegaly is typically explained by liver inflammation, infiltration, or congestion.

### Lower abdominal pain [^115UKSfw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Although most frequently presenting with lower abdominal pain, appendicitis, colitis, and diverticulitis can cause pain throughout the abdomen and may lead to peritoneal and retroperitoneal symptoms. Evaluation and management of lower intestinal disease require a nuanced approach by the emergency physician. This often necessitates the use of computed tomography, ultrasonography, MRI, layered imaging, shared decision making, serial examination, and/or close follow-up. Once a presumed or confirmed diagnosis is made, appropriate treatment is initiated, which may include surgery, antibiotics, and/or steroids. Patients with appendicitis should be admitted. Diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease can frequently be managed on an outpatient basis, but may require admission and surgical consultation.

### Diagnostic imaging of acute abdominal pain in adults [^117PDmzo]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common presentation in the outpatient setting and can represent conditions ranging from benign to life-threatening. If patient history, physical examination, and laboratory testing do not identify an underlying cause of pain and serious pathology remains a clinical concern, diagnostic imaging is indicated. The American College of Radiology has developed clinical guidelines, the Appropriateness Criteria, based on the location of abdominal pain to help physicians choose the most appropriate imaging study. Ultrasonography is the initial imaging test of choice for patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for evaluating right or left lower quadrant pain. Conventional radiography has limited diagnostic value in the assessment of most patients with abdominal pain. The widespread use of CT raises concerns about patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Strategies to reduce exposure are currently being studied, such as using ultrasonography as an initial study for suspected appendicitis before obtaining CT and using low-dose CT rather than standard-dose CT. Magnetic resonance imaging is another emerging technique for the evaluation of abdominal pain that avoids ionizing radiation.

### Left-sided acute appendicitis: A pitfall in the emergency department [^113WTJTm]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis continues to be a condition at high risk for missed and delayed diagnosis. It characteristically presents with right lower quadrant pain after vague epigastric or periumbilical discomfort. Left-sided appendicitis is an atypical presentation and has been reported rarely. The majority of these cases have been associated with congenital midgut malrotation, situs inversus, or an extremely long appendix. We report a case of left-sided acute appendicitis occurring in a patient with a redundant and hypermobile ascending colon.

- **Objectives**: To alert emergency physicians to an anatomical anomaly that could delay the diagnosis of appendicitis.

- **Case report**: A 50-year-old man presented with fever and left lower abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed local tenderness over the left lower quadrant. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a redundant, floating ascending colon and an inflammatory appendix adhering to the descending colon over the left lower abdomen. Exploratory laparotomy was performed, and perforated appendicitis with turbid ascites was found during the surgery. An appendectomy was performed, and the patient recovered uneventfully.

- **Conclusion**: This case is presented to increase awareness among emergency physicians of this anatomical variant and atypical presentation of appendicitis.

### Acute abdominal pain in a 15-year-old male patient [^111p4GSv]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

A 15-year-old male patient presented with acute abdominal pain.

- **Presentation and assessment**: The patient reported severe, localized pain in the lower right quadrant, which began approximately 12 hours prior to arrival at the emergency department.

- **Diagnostic process**: Initial evaluation included a thorough history and physical examination, followed by laboratory tests and imaging studies. Blood tests revealed elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. An abdominal ultrasound was performed, revealing an inflamed appendix.

- **Diagnosis and management**: The final diagnosis was acute appendicitis. The recommended treatment was an appendectomy, which was successfully performed without complications. Post-operative care included administration of antibiotics and pain management. The patient was discharged in stable condition with instructions for follow-up care.

### Do all patients with left costal margin injuries require radiographic evaluation for intraabdominal injury [^116GJj2G]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The study aimed to determine whether all patients with pain or tenderness to the left lower ribs after blunt traumatic injury require abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning for the detection of splenic injury.

- **Methods**: This prospective, observational cohort study involved all blunt-trauma patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) of a Level I trauma center with pain or tenderness in the left lower ribs. Enrollment criteria included a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score greater than 13 and pain or tenderness to the left lower ribs (ribs 7 to 12). Patients were classified as having pleuritic pain if their pain increased with inspiration or coughing. All hemodynamically stable patients underwent abdominal CT scanning for detection of intraabdominal injuries. Data on medical history and physical examination were collected before radiographic imaging. Patients were deemed to have "isolated" left lower rib injury if they were without the following: systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg (in ED or out-of-hospital), abdominal or flank tenderness, pelvic or femur fractures, and gross hematuria.

- **Results**: Out of 875 patients with left lower rib pain or tenderness, 63 patients (7.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.6% to 9.1%) experienced splenic injuries, and 20 patients (2.3%; 95% CI 1.4% to 3.5%) had left renal injuries. A total of 574 patients presented additional indications for abdominal imaging, leaving 301 patients.

### Nutcracker syndrome (a Delphi consensus) [^114XW7Zf]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Consensus was reached on the combination of clinical signs of nutcracker syndrome (NCS) and stenosis of the left renal vein (LRV) being a cause of these symptoms. Flank pain was ranked as the most relevant symptom in NCS, being the main symptom differentiating it from other causes of pelvic venous disorders. The distinction between NCS and pelvic venous disorders remains a challenge in the diagnostic workup. It is not within the scope of this article to gauge consensus on concomitant NCS and pelvic venous disorders. Further research is needed to standardize the assessment of pelvic venous disorders and NCS.

No consensus was reached on the pathological cause of hematuria and proteinuria in NCS, despite presenting the panel with known theories. The mechanism remains unknown. Therefore, statements 1.1.4 and 1.1.5 were removed from the survey after the first round. Furthermore, proteinuria was ranked as the least relevant symptom of NCS because it is most likely to be solely present in cases of kidney injury. It was emphasized that these symptoms individually are nonspecific. Because NCS is not an acute pathology, the persistent character of symptoms should be verified. The panel agreed that symptoms of NCS should last ≥ 6 months and that compression should be demonstrated. The mechanism for alternating asymptomatic and symptomatic episodes in NCS remains unknown due to a lack of evidence.

The expert panel agreed on the different diagnostic modalities that can be used in diagnosing NCS and noted that there is no gold standard in the diagnostic process of NCS.

### Parasitic diseases as a cause of acute abdominal pain: Imaging findings [^113DuEMd]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

A 16-year-old girl was admitted to the emergency department with an acute onset of right upper quadrant pain and fever.

- **Axial contrast-enhanced CT image**: Demonstrates the imaging findings of intraperitoneal rupture of a hydatid cyst. Focal outward bulging found at the lateral wall of the cyst indicates the site of rupture (arrowheads, a). Mild fluid collection adjacent to the hepatic capsule was also noted (asterisk).
- **Axial CT image from the lower abdomen**: Shows mural thickening of the jejunal loops (arrows) and adjacent fat tissue stranding (arrowheads), indicating the local allergic reaction of the bowel wall secondary to a ruptured hydatid cyst. Surgical findings confirmed the intraperitoneal rupture of the hydatid cyst.

A 21-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with a 2-week history of jaundice and upper right quadrant pain.

- **Axial contrast-enhanced CT image**: Demonstrates a heterogeneous infiltrative liver mass (asterisk) with irregular margins (arrows). The presence of biliary dilatation (arrowhead) due to compression of the mass was also noted. The diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis was made by histopathological examination.
- **Fat saturated T2-weighted MR image**: Demonstrates internal heterogeneity of the mass, mimicking primary liver malignancy. Chest CT findings were unremarkable for hydatid disease (not shown).

A 25-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of fever, voiding difficulty, and bilateral flank pain. Blood analysis revealed leukocytosis and elevated serum creatinine levels. Unfortunately, the description of the medical imaging findings is cut off, and further details are not provided.

### Acute abdominal pain as a result of a ruptured hematosalpinx: a rare complication of an unusual müllerian anomaly [^113ndLGU]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

A 15-year-old virgin Caucasian female presented to the emergency room with a 40-hour history of acute left lower quadrant abdominal pain and nausea. Evaluation suggested a left pelvic kidney with obstructed ureter as the etiology. Her pain continued to escalate, so further workup with laparoscopy was performed. This demonstrated a left pelvic sidewall hemi-uterus with ruptured hematosalpinx. This is an unusual clinical presentation of a müllerian anomaly not previously documented.

- **Discussion**: The differential diagnosis of acute unilateral abdominal pain in adolescent females should include müllerian anomalies. The incidence of this diagnosis is low, but the evaluation and treatment can be performed expeditiously if the diagnosis is considered. The laparoscopic excision of a unilateral noncommunicating uterine horn is a valid and recommended treatment approach for this rare malformation.

### Spontaneous idiopathic bilateral adrenal haemorrhage: a rare cause of abdominal pain [^114hXfvQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

We describe a case of a 62-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease who presented to the emergency department with left lower quadrant abdominal pain, flank pain with nausea, and no history of preceding trauma. The patient had finished a course of azithromycin and oral methylprednisolone 1 day prior to presentation. An abdominal and pelvic CT scan identified changes suggestive of bilateral adrenal haemorrhage. The patient did not show signs of acute adrenal insufficiency but was started on steroid replacement therapy because of concerns about possible disease progression. All recognized causes of adrenal haemorrhage were excluded, suggesting this was a case of spontaneous idiopathic bilateral adrenal haemorrhage, a rarely reported phenomenon in the literature. The patient was discharged after clinical improvement following six days in the hospital, taking oral steroid replacement.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra-abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^115CmY7q]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a very common presentation in the emergency department. It is vital for the physician to understand and be familiar with the presentations of common diseases that cause this symptom. Patients with acute abdominal pain are a heterogeneous group that consumes a significant amount of a surgical department's resources. To streamline efficiency and ensure cost-effectiveness, it would be beneficial to identify clinical and laboratory parameters in patients admitted with acute abdominal pain that indicate no significant intra-abdominal pathology, thereby encouraging early discharge back to the community.

Women of childbearing age often present with right iliac fossa pain; however, most do not have appendicitis. Those lacking the classical features of appendicitis and without evidence of peritonitis on examination can be safely managed by active observation or diagnostic laparoscopy. This study aimed to identify the clinical and laboratory red flags. Recognizing these red flags in history, physical examination, initial imaging, and laboratory findings helps determine which patients may have a serious underlying disease process and therefore warrant more expedited evaluation and treatment.

### An approach to the patient with chronic undiagnosed abdominal pain [^114HA7ey]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for referral to a gastroenterologist. The workup of patients with chronic abdominal pain can be extremely challenging, as clinicians are responsible for determining whether the patient can be observed, treated symptomatically, or if this abdominal pain heralds a more systemic disease. The differential is typically wide, and given the innervation of the abdomen, localization of abdominal pain does not always provide clear insight into the etiology.

This review attempts to help the gastroenterologist narrow down that broad differential and focus on key elements of the patient visit. We emphasize the importance of a detailed history from the patient, along with review-specific details of their history and physical examination that can provide clues about the etiology of the abdominal pain. We review the causes of diffuse abdominal pain that may not first be considered, along with uncommon causes of localized abdominal pain. We also review the functional causes of abdominal pain and the importance of identifying these disorders to avoid unnecessary testing that commonly occurs with these patients.

- **Cardiovascular and vascular conditions**: Aortic aneurysm, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), increased aortic width, hypertension, shock, acute arterial occlusion, pulsatile abdominal mass, tachycardia

- **Genetic and lifestyle factors**: Genetic predispositions, tobacco use, cigarette smoking, male sex

- **Respiratory symptoms**: Dyspnea

### Acute renal artery infarction secondary to dysfibrinogenemia [^112j39SF]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

The patient's initial presentation of flank pain has a broad differential diagnosis. Early in the case, nephrolithiasis was the leading diagnosis given the exquisite flank pain that did not resolve with position changes. However, urinalysis did not reveal microscopic haematuria, and recent non-contrast CT was negative for calculi or hydronephrosis. Given the patient's medical history of rhabdomyolysis and recent intense exercise, acute rhabdomyolysis was also considered but excluded based on a normal creatine kinase level. With no acute urinary complaints of hesitancy, frequency, or dysuria and no objective evidence of infection (no fever, no leucocytosis, benign urinalysis, and no fluid collections on radiography), acute urinary tract infection or occult abscess was low on the differential diagnosis. Prior to the contrast CT, a musculoskeletal exacerbation of a previous injury, such as an insult to the psoas or quadratus lumborum muscles, was also considered.

On follow-up imaging, radiology suggested a possible aneurysm, which expanded the differential diagnosis to also include infarction due to dissection in addition to the diagnosis of renal artery infarction due to thrombus formation or embolism. Spontaneous renal artery dissection and/or aneurysm is quite rare, with an incidence of less than 0.05%, with approximately only 180 cases having been reported. In a longitudinal study of 438 patients with renal infarction, 21 patients had renal artery dissection or aneurysm, and 29 patients had hypercoagulable states. Given the rarity of the spontaneous dissection and…

### CT imaging findings of epiploic appendagitis: An unusual cause of abdominal pain [^112pgiSH]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of epiploic appendagitis is challenging due to the lack of pathognomonic clinical signs or laboratory markers. Clinical presentation may vary among patients. This condition is often an underestimated and overlooked mimicker, easily misdiagnosed with other causes of abdominal pain requiring urgent care or surgical evaluation in the emergency department, particularly acute diverticulitis (left iliac pain) or acute appendicitis (right iliac pain). On physical examination, patients complain of focal non-migratory abdominal pain in the lower abdominal quadrants (left more commonly than right), not exacerbated by physical movement, without significant guarding or rigidity, and in the absence of a palpable mass. The pain is typically circumscribed, and the patient may often point directly to the location of the lesion. Patients may also report postprandial fullness, swelling, vomiting, early satiety, diarrhea, and, rarely, mild fever. White blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein levels are within normal range in the majority of patients, while mild leukocytosis may occasionally be observed due to the inflammatory response.

Epiploic appendagitis is a benign, self-limiting condition which spontaneously resolves within two weeks from the onset of symptoms. Surgery is not indicated since the treatment is conservative with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, according to the patient's symptoms. The risk of recurrence is low, and complications are even rarer. Some authors believed that surgical intervention with ligation is unnecessary in such cases.

### Imaging of acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain: Differential diagnoses beyond appendicitis [^111Ttnh6]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluation of acute right lower quadrant pain remains a common and challenging clinical scenario for emergency medicine physicians due to frequent nonspecific signs, symptoms, and physical examination findings. Therefore, imaging has evolved to play a pivotal role in the emergency setting. While appendicitis is a common cause for acute pain, there are numerous other important differential considerations of which the radiologist must be aware. The purpose of this review is to list an anatomy-based, encompassing differential diagnosis in addition to acute appendicitis for right lower quadrant pain; demonstrate the key imaging findings of numerous differential considerations; and describe helpful imaging and clinical features useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis.

### Rupture of ectopic pelvic dysplastic kidney after blunt abdominal trauma presenting as left lower quadrant pain [^1151XsA9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Ectopic pelvic dysplastic kidney is very rare. To our knowledge, there is no case report in the literature that discusses the diagnosis and management of ectopic pelvic dysplastic kidney in trauma.

- **Objectives**: To report an unusual organ injury after abdominal blunt trauma.

- **Case report**: A 23-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with complaints of left lower quadrant pain after blunt abdominal trauma. Rupture of an ectopic pelvic dysplastic kidney was suspected from ultrasonography and then confirmed by a computed tomography scan. The patient was managed successfully with conservative therapy.

- **Conclusions**: The focused assessment with sonography for trauma examination is beneficial to hemodynamically stable blunt abdominal trauma patients because unusual organ injuries can be detected early.

### Alternative diagnoses to stone disease on unenhanced CT to investigate acute flank pain [^1152jgsx]. Emergency Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Acute flank pain is a common problem in emergency medicine. Although the most frequent cause is urolithiasis, many other entities can cause the same clinical presentation. In many institutions, unenhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is used in this setting. One of the major advantages of unenhanced CT is its ability to detect other pathologies causing flank pain. In this pictorial review, we present the CT findings of pathologies other than stone disease in patients with acute flank pain.

### Left flank pain as the sole manifestation of acute pancreatitis: A report of a case with an initial misdiagnosis [^116RsY8r]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is not an uncommon disease in an emergency department (ED). It manifests as upper abdominal pain, sometimes with radiation of pain to the back and flank region. Isolated left flank pain as the sole manifestation of acute pancreatitis is very rare and not previously identified in the literature. In this report, we present a case of acute pancreatitis presenting solely with left flank pain. Having negative findings on an ultrasound initially, she was misdiagnosed as having possible "acute pyelonephritis or other renal diseases". A second radiographic evaluation with computed tomography showed pancreatitis in the tail with abnormal fluid collection extending to the left peri-renal space. We conducted a literature review and discussed this rare occurrence of acute pancreatitis. We also discussed the clinical pitfalls in this case.

### Epiploic appendagitis: a non-surgical cause of acute abdomen [^111i2amD]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans were performed on two patients: one with right lower quadrant abdominal pain (A: coronal reformat, B: axial) and another with left lower quadrant abdominal pain (C: coronal reformat, D: axial). The CT scans demonstrated the presence of oval-shaped, fat density paracolonic lesions, indicated by white circles, with a high-attenuation central "dot" marked by a white arrow. These were located at the antimesenteric edge of the ascending colon for the first patient (A, B) and the descending colon for the second patient (C, D), respectively. Inflammatory changes in the adjacent pericolonic fat were also detected, more prominently in the second patient.

Primary epiploic appendagitis (EA) is a benign, localized, sterile inflammation of the epiploic appendages, resulting from torsion or spontaneous venous thrombosis of a draining vein, usually involving the sigmoid colon or cecum. Secondary EA is associated with inflammation of adjacent organs, such as diverticulitis, appendicitis, or cholecystitis. Patients present with acute abdominal pain mostly localized in the affected area, with local tenderness on physical examination. Rebound tenderness may also be present, mimicking the clinical picture of acute abdomen and frequently leading to misdiagnoses such as acute appendicitis or diverticulitis.

Notably, primary EA has been reported in 2–7% of patients in whom there was a clinical suspicion of diverticulitis and in 0.3–1% of patients suspected of having appendicitis. However, in cases of EA, symptoms like fever, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and altered bowel function are usually absent, while inflammatory markers are often not indicative.

### A surprising cause of acute right upper quadrant pain [^116uf6Ki]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A 42-year-old African-American woman was admitted for severe acute right upper quadrant pain. Her liver function tests showed a cholestatic pattern of hepatitis. She had no known history of liver disease or sarcoidosis. Imaging of her liver and biliary tree did not reveal any apparent cause for her right upper quadrant pain. A liver biopsy was performed, which showed granulomatous disease. This prompted a CT chest scan that showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy. A biopsy of the mediastinal lymph node revealed non-caseating granulomas. Despite having no pulmonary symptoms or history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, she was diagnosed with systemic pulmonary sarcoidosis. She was treated with corticosteroids and had complete resolution of symptoms over the next several weeks.

### Parasitic diseases as a cause of acute abdominal pain: Imaging findings [^114JypQc]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

A 24-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with an acute onset of right flank pain and fever. Increased serum levels of acute-phase reactants, leukocytosis, and elevated serum creatinine levels were evident upon blood analysis. Axial and coronal contrast-enhanced CT images demonstrate a large renal subcapsular Gharbi type 3 hydatid cyst rupture into the pelvicalyceal system. The loss of integrity of the renal parenchyma found on the CT image indicates the site of rupture. Daughter cysts within the cyst and also in the pelvicalyceal system are noted. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination following surgery.

A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a pelvic abscess with extraluminal air. Intravenous antibiotics were initiated, and CT-guided percutaneous drainage was performed. The drain was removed one week after discharge. However, one week later, he presented with dysuria and pneumaturia and was started on antibiotics. A colonoscopy confirmed diverticulosis with no other mucosal abnormalities. He subsequently underwent a successful laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with colovesical fistula takedown.

### A mysterious cause of a surgical abdomen [^1157nYop]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Epiploic appendagitis is a rare cause of acute-onset abdominal pain. The severity of pain at presentation and the infrequency with which it is encountered make it a diagnostic challenge.

- **Objectives**: To present a case report exemplifying a diagnostic challenge posed by acute-onset abdominal pain that eventually led to the diagnosis of epiploic appendagitis.

- **Case report**: A 50-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department complaining of excruciating, sudden-onset lower abdominal pain. All routine laboratory investigations were within normal limits, as was an acute abdominal X-ray series. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed a focal fatty infiltration in the left lower quadrant with fat-stranding towards the colon, representing the classical radiological presentation of epiploic appendagitis. The patient was admitted and successfully managed conservatively with intravenous fluids and ibuprofen. The patient made a full recovery and was discharged three days after admission.

- **Conclusions**: Due to its benign, self-limited course, it is important to recognize this disease process to avoid unnecessary surgical and medical interventions. Epiploic appendagitis should be suspected in patients presenting with acute onset abdominal pain localized to the left lower quadrant or right lower quadrant with no associated systemic manifestations. Improvements in imaging technology have enabled confirmation of the diagnosis with non-invasive methods.

### Abdominal pain caused by a potentially fatal attraction [^116TGm64]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a challenging presentation in children. Examination findings and etiology vary greatly, spanning a vast spectrum from flatulence to frank peritonitis with septic shock. Here, we discuss a 10-year-old boy with 24 hours of progressively worsening lower abdominal pain, nausea, and subjective fevers. History and physical examination findings were consistent with appendicitis. However, physicians were surprised when the single-view abdominal radiograph showed an unanticipated, somewhat perplexing discovery.

### Epiploic appendagitis: An overlooked entity by clinicians [^113wMoXA]. Annals of gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

A 41-year-old woman was referred to our department for persistent lower left-sided abdominal pain. Two weeks prior, she complained of diarrhea lasting two days. Immediately afterward, she began experiencing increasingly sharp and severe abdominal pain in the left lower quadrant, for which she visited the emergency department twice; however, no definite diagnosis was established, and irritable bowel syndrome was suspected. Physical examination showed localized pain with tenderness in the left lower quadrant. Laboratory testing revealed an increased C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 9.4 mg/L.

Primary epiploic appendagitis (PEA) is the inflammation process of the epiploic appendage, which is composed of fat and blood vessels and protrudes from the serosal surface of the colon. The clinical picture of PEA includes an acute onset of abdominal pain with left or right lower quadrant tenderness. Some patients report fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or nausea.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^1111Jzaz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The study shows that patients who present with abdominal pain, without vomiting, guarding, or a raised white cell count, are unlikely to have significant intra-abdominal pathology and can be considered for early discharge back to the community. An abnormal liver function test can indicate the possibility of biliary colic, as can microscopic hematuria, which may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common in emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign, self-limiting illnesses with no clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. However, high white blood cell (WBC) counts and left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years. Indeed, for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain, the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness, pain migration, and vomiting may help differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease, where patients tend to have a raised white cell count and demonstrate signs of peritonism, which can make the differentiation between the two diagnoses on clinical grounds difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically, and commonly, patients undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging, such as ultrasound, is helpful in these cases.

### Right flank pain: a case report of an interesting sonographic finding [^113Wn8sZ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Focused bedside ultrasound is a screening tool frequently used by emergency physicians to evaluate hepatobiliary and renal pathology in patients presenting with abdominal complaints in the emergency department (ED).

- **Objective**: This case report describes a sonographic finding that was interpreted as free fluid in the right upper quadrant. Computed tomography (CT) was used to confirm the diagnosis.

- **Case report**: A 44-year-old man presented to the ED with the sudden onset of right-sided abdominal pain and exhibited right costovertebral angle tenderness on physical examination. Focused bedside ultrasound of the right upper quadrant revealed severe hydronephrosis of the right kidney and free fluid of either subcapsular, perinephric, or peritoneal location, represented by an anechoic stripe in Morison's pouch. On CT evaluation, this patient was found to have perinephric fluid accumulation from a presumed ruptured renal calyx in the setting of chronic ureteropelvic junction obstruction with severe hydronephrosis.

- **Conclusion**: The exact location of anechoic fluid in the abdomen is not always apparent on bedside ultrasound. To minimize misinterpreting focused bedside ultrasound examination findings, we recommend a number of sonographic techniques to identify possible mimics of free fluid. Suspected free fluid findings on bedside ultrasound should always be evaluated within the clinical context of the patient's presentation.

### Parasitic diseases as a cause of acute abdominal pain: Imaging findings [^113YhoCv]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

The most common extraintestinal manifestation of the disease is a liver abscess. Symptoms of liver abscess include fever, right upper quadrant pain, and tenderness. Amebic abscesses are predominantly solitary, oval or round-shaped, and located near the liver capsule in the right lobe of the liver.

Sonographic features of an amebic abscess consist of a hypoechoic lesion with low-level internal echoes and the absence of significant wall echoes. On a CT scan, it appears as a low-density lesion with a peripheral enhancing rim and thickened wall. A mild contrast enhancement around the abscess in the adjacent liver parenchyma occurs due to the peripheral zone of edema. Amebic liver abscesses frequently occur together with right-sided pleural effusion and perihepatic fluid.

### Sono case series: 35-year-old male patient with flank pain [^112Kt5Np]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2020). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of obstructing nephrolithiasis by emergency physicians have undergone significant advancements in recent years. It is no longer necessary for all patients with suspected renal colic to undergo a CT scan and receive an immediate urology consult. In this presentation, we outline a classic case of obstructing nephrolithiasis, supplemented by point-of-care ultrasound images. We guide the reader through a series of questions and answers to discuss the patient's diagnosis, using the most evidence-based recommendations.

### A comparison of the accuracy of ultrasound and computed tomography in common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain [^116r4nEm]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

After clinical assessment at the ED, all consenting patients underwent ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) within a few hours of presentation to the ED. Ultrasound and CT were independently evaluated by two different blinded observers. Between 5 PM and 11 PM, when often only one attending radiologist or radiological resident was present, both ultrasound and CT were evaluated by the same observer. The ultrasound examination was performed and evaluated by the attending radiologist or radiological resident, not by a sonographer. To ensure a blinded evaluation for study purposes, ultrasound was performed first and documented in the case record form. CT was only evaluated after finalizing the ultrasound part of the case record form.

The CT findings with immediate treatment consequences were communicated to the treating physician. In cases presenting after hours, CT examinations were re-evaluated by an abdominal radiologist the next morning, and these findings were documented in the case record form. This radiologist was blinded to the ultrasound evaluation and had access to the same details on clinical findings as the person evaluating the ultrasound examination. This second reading was used for this comparative study, so all CT examinations were read or supervised by a radiologist, contrary to ultrasound examinations, which were performed by radiological residents alone after hours.

To evaluate the effects of experience, all observers were asked to record the number of abdominal ultrasounds they had performed (< 100, 100–500, 500–1,000, 1,000–5,000).

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^116PVW9q]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Left upper quadrant pain commonly results from conditions such as gastritis, colitis (splenic flexure), pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, splenic enlargement or infarction, or left lower lobe pneumonia. Intermittent headaches frequently accompany systemic illness, posing a challenge in determining if the associated fever signals an intracranial infectious process such as meningitis, encephalitis, or brain abscess. The severity and duration of the headache, lack of previous headache history, and the presence of meningeal signs and neurological deficits are common indications for imaging the central nervous system and analyzing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

### Laparoscopic resection of an accessory spleen in a patient with chronic lower abdominal pain [^1146fipt]. Surgical Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

During a diagnostic laparoscopy in a patient with chronic lower abdominal pain, we found a pediculated accessory spleen (AS) near the left adnexa. The pedicle was dissected by ultrascision, cut with an Endo GIA, and the AS was extracted. AS occurs in 25–40% of the population. They are always situated on the left side, including the hilum of the spleen, splenic artery, pancreas, splenocolic ligament, greater omentum, mesenterium, adnexal region, and scrotum. In most cases, they are asymptomatic. In hematological disorders, they can take over the function of the original spleen after splenectomy. Sometimes, AS can mimic tumors in other organs, such as the pancreas, kidney, or liver. There are also descriptions of AS in the scrotum, spermatic cord, adnexes, uterus, stomach, small intestine, or heart.

In rare cases, they can cause pain due to cysts, abscesses, hemorrhage, or spontaneous rupture. Acute pedicle torsion can lead to infarction, presenting as an acute abdomen, which is most often seen in young patients. In our case, the pain was caused by pedicle torsions or mechanical irritation of the adnexa. The variable localization of the pain was due to the long pedicle. In describing this case, we highlight the advantages of diagnostic laparoscopy in patients with chronic lower abdominal pain.

### Unenhanced helical CT in the investigation of acute flank pain [^116tBF7J]. Clinical Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Unenhanced helical CT has emerged as the imaging technique of choice for the investigation of patients presenting with acute flank pain and suspected nephroureteric stone disease. There are several signs identifiable on unenhanced CT that support a diagnosis of stone disease. However, there are many pitfalls that may confound a correct diagnosis. Some of the common pitfalls, together with methods to avoid such occurrences, will be discussed. A review of some of the common alternative diagnoses that may mimic the symptoms of nephroureteric stone disease is illustrated.

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults [^111kDKdj]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain can represent a spectrum of conditions, ranging from benign and self-limited diseases to surgical emergencies. Evaluating abdominal pain requires a comprehensive approach that relies on the likelihood of disease, patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The location of pain is a useful starting point and will guide further evaluation. For example, right lower quadrant pain strongly suggests appendicitis.

Certain elements of the history and physical examination are helpful; for example, constipation and abdominal distension strongly suggest bowel obstruction, whereas others are of little value. Anorexia, for instance, has little predictive value for appendicitis. The American College of Radiology has recommended different imaging studies for assessing abdominal pain, based on pain location. Ultrasonography is recommended to assess right upper quadrant pain, while computed tomography is recommended for right and left lower quadrant pain.

It is also important to consider special populations, such as women, who are at risk of genitourinary disease, which may cause abdominal pain, and the elderly, who may present with atypical symptoms of a disease.

### Acute pyelonephritis in adults [^117SEQxU]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Acute pyelonephritis is a condition that can manifest through various symptoms and laboratory findings. It is often associated with abdominal pain, a positive blood bacterial culture, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Patients may present with cloudy urine, a positive urine bacterial culture, and flank pain. Other common symptoms include vomiting, burning sensation during urination, and inflammation. Vesicoureteral reflux and infections are also possible indicators.

Laboratory findings might show an increased white blood cell (WBC) count, presence of urine WBCs, and lactic acidosis. Urinary analysis could reveal urine WBC casts, a positive urine dipstick leukocyte esterase test, and bacteriuria. Physical examination may show costovertebral angle tenderness and hemodynamic instability. Additionally, patients may experience nausea, increased urinary frequency, foul-smelling urine, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fever, and increased serum creatinine levels. Urinary urgency and leukocyturia are also notable characteristics of acute pyelonephritis.

### Ureterocele as a cause of chronic intractable abdominal pain [^1159BNr1]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A ureterocele is a submucosal, cystic dilation of the terminal ureter, either congenital or acquired, as it enters the bladder. It is a rare clinical entity that can be entirely asymptomatic and present as an incidental finding or can manifest in the form of distressing symptoms such as unremitting abdominal pain, haematuria, and obstructive uropathy, among others.

The authors present a case of abdominal pain in a 43-year-old woman, initially attributed to various clinical entities, who was finally referred to the chronic pain clinic. The patient underwent numerous diagnostic tests, psychological evaluations, and therapeutic interventions, including surgeries, over the years, all of which failed to mitigate her symptoms until urologic imaging identified an intravesical ureterocele as the underlying disorder. This case report details the diagnostic challenge faced by the authors along with the clinical characteristics of ureterocele.

### Spleen injury following left extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) [^113Zw6SU]. BMC Urology (2015). High credibility.

A 54-year-old anxious male presented to the emergency room after experiencing 12 hours of severe, medically recalcitrant left flank pain. A CT scan and KUB demonstrated a 15 mm by 8 mm left mid-polar renal calculus. The patient underwent left ESWL under regional anesthesia, which was performed with 1–7 KV power at 120 shocks per minute for a total of 2500 shocks. Although the patient's pain was controlled, he was very nervous and had to be repositioned eight individual times.

Approximately 6 hours after the ESWL, the patient phoned the urologist, complaining of severe left flank pain unlike any previous episode of renal colic. An emergency room evaluation noted a hypotensive patient with left upper and lower quadrant pain and peritoneal signs. A CT scan demonstrated a stage 3 splenic injury with hemoperitoneum. The left kidney showed no extravasation or parenchymal injury but had a fractured calculus, illustrating that the stone was effectively treated.

A general surgery consultation was obtained, and the general surgeon performed an emergent splenectomy. The surgeon drained 2.0 liters of hemoperitoneum while transfusing the patient with six units of packed red blood cells. The patient experienced an uneventful recovery.

### Menopur [^117WDHBC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

What are the possible side effects of Menopur?

Menopur may cause serious side effects, including:

- **Ovaries that are too large**: Menopur may cause your ovaries to be abnormally large. Symptoms of large ovaries include bloating or pain in your lower stomach (pelvic) area. If your ovaries become too large, your healthcare provider may advise against intercourse (sex) to prevent rupturing an ovarian cyst.

- **Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)**: Using Menopur may cause OHSS, a serious medical condition that can occur when your ovaries produce too many eggs (overstimulated). OHSS can cause fluid to suddenly build up in the area of your stomach, chest, and heart, and it can cause blood clots to form. OHSS may also happen after stopping Menopur. Stop using Menopur and call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms of OHSS:
	- Severe pelvic or stomach pain
	- Nausea
	- Vomiting
	- Sudden weight gain
	- Swollen stomach
	- Diarrhea
	- Trouble breathing
	- Decreased or no urine

- **Lung problems**: Menopur may cause serious lung issues that can sometimes lead to death, including fluid in the lungs, trouble breathing, and worsening of asthma.

- **Blood clots**: Menopur may increase your risk of blood clots in your blood vessels. Blood clots can lead to:
	- Blood vessel problems (thrombophlebitis)
	- Stroke
	- Loss of your arm or leg
	- Blood clot in your lung (pulmonary embolus)

- **Twisting (torsion) of your ovary**: Menopur may increase the risk of your ovary twisting, especially if you have certain conditions such as OHSS or pregnancy.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute onset flank pain-suspicion of stone disease (urolithiasis) [^1133mYfn]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2023 guidelines recommend considering magnetic resonance urography, contrast-enhanced CT, or contrast-enhanced CT urography as the next imaging step. This recommendation applies to patients with acute-onset flank pain and suspicion of stone disease if unenhanced CT is inconclusive for the presence of stones.

### Flank pain as a symptom of COVID-19 [^116W5N2S]. Urology (2021). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 disease is spreading rapidly worldwide, and no vaccine or very effective drug has been found yet. However, the transmission rate of the disease can be reduced by taking precautions. Therefore, it is essential to detect the patients early to prevent the spread of the disease. We report a case of a 26-year-old male patient who was admitted to our urology outpatient clinic with the complaint of flank pain and had incidental findings of COVID-19 in the lung bases on abdominal CT.

### Renal vein thrombosis mimicking urinary calculus: a dilemma of diagnosis [^115qgcxk]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

A 38-year-old woman presented to the emergency room in a regional hospital with nausea and left flank pain that had suddenly started 12 hours earlier. She had a history of left flank trauma, having fallen from a 2-meter height 5 years earlier. Physical examination revealed no tenderness over the abdomen or flank and normal chest auscultation. Blood analysis was within normal limits, except for leukocytosis (12.7 × 10^9/L). Routine urine analysis showed microscopic hematuria without white blood cells or proteins. Abdominal ultrasonography showed an enlarged kidney and a 16-mm hyperechoic focus in the left renal pelvis, suggesting a diagnosis of renal calculus. The patient was therefore administered extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy at the regional hospital. A follow-up ultrasound examination 2 weeks later showed that the shape and size of the hyperechoic focus had not changed.

Due to left lower back pain and the persistent left hyperechoic focus in the renal area, the patient was referred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Urine analysis and ultrasound examination showed the same results as in the regional hospital. An abdominal plain film showed a left-sided renal calcification, but there was no evidence of a palpable tender mass or an audible abdominal bruit. Laboratory data, except for urinalysis results, were within normal limits. Because of the failure of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, percutaneous lithotomy was recommended.

### A rare case of right lower quadrant abdominal pain [^1164WR4w]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Isolated fallopian tube torsion without involvement of the ovary is a rare condition most frequently presenting during the reproductive years. Imaging, vitals, physical exam, and laboratory findings all fail to establish a definitive diagnosis. The majority of the diagnoses are made on the operating table. Physical examination most often reveals unilateral and localized abdominal pain, often with nausea and vomiting, but few other reliably common findings. Diagnosis becomes even more challenging due to the fact that isolated tubal torsion often occurs in pregnancy and preferentially on the right, further complicating the clinical picture.

We describe a case of isolated tubal torsion, unique in that localized necrosis and inflammation from the torsion triggered a secondary appendicitis. The patient required surgical intervention, including an appendectomy and salpingectomy emergently. Given its elusive and rare nature, awareness and early intervention are required by the emergency physician to recognize tubal torsion. Operative intervention is crucial and can lead to the preservation of fertility and improved fetal survival.

### Pulmonary embolism presenting as flank pain: a case series [^115TV4Jx]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially fatal disease that can be effectively treated once diagnosed. Due to insidious and often cryptogenic presentations, the diagnosis of this disease can easily elude clinicians. Over the last several years, the use of computed tomography (CT) scanning has improved clinicians' ability to diagnose PE. Additionally, the widespread use of CT to investigate complaints such as flank and abdominal pain could theoretically result in identifying radiographic findings not previously recognized, which could aid in diagnosing PE. The case series reveals the unexpected and initially unrecognized CT finding of a pulmonary infarct in two patients presenting with flank pain; a third patient presented with flank pain and was also found to have a PE.

- **Objective**: We describe three cases of patients who presented to the Emergency Department with flank pain and were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism.

- **Case reports**: The cases reported here discuss patients who presented with flank pain and were ultimately diagnosed with PE. In the first two cases, the patients had incidental findings of pulmonary infiltrates on abdominal CT scans, which prompted further diagnostic investigation. In the third case, the patient had risk factors for PE and presented with flank pain. The diagnosis was quickly made by CT imaging.

- **Conclusion**: Physicians should consider pulmonary embolism in the differential diagnosis of patients with isolated flank pain. Additionally, unexpected pulmonary findings on abdominal CT scans may help suggest the diagnosis of PE.

### Considerations in the diagnosis and therapy for acute loin pain [^114YoNX8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of an acute onset of nausea, vomiting, and flank pain, in combination with an acute elevation of blood pressure, should raise a high suspicion of renal infarction. However, because of its nonspecific presentation, the diagnosis may be delayed. We report the case of a 63-year-old man who presented with a 2-day history of right flank pain that was initially treated as a renal stone. He had a background history of atrial fibrillation. Further investigations confirmed this as a case of renal infarction.

Renal infarction is often underdiagnosed due to the similarity of its presentation to other renal pathologies. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of loin pain, particularly in a patient with atrial fibrillation.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic pelvic pain in women: The urologist's approach [^116iLtBW]. Nature Reviews Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain in women can be caused by a host of gynecological, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and urologic disorders. An initial broad differential diagnosis is essential. At times, overlapping symptoms and vague physical findings necessitate a multidisciplinary diagnostic approach. A thorough history, which carefully characterizes all aspects of the patient's symptoms, can usually direct the differential toward the bladder when this organ is the source of the pain. Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) should be included in the differential diagnosis, but it should not be used as an expeditious diagnosis when pain coexists with frequency and urgency.

Multiple other urologic conditions, such as overactive bladder, urinary tract infection, urethral diverticulum, periurethral masses (Skene gland cyst or abscess), and even urethral stricture disease, have overlapping symptom complexes with IC/PBS. They must not be overlooked as they are much more easily diagnosed and treated. By using a stepwise approach and an evidence-based thought process, the obscurity of chronic bladder and urethral pain can evolve into a progressively narrowing differential.

### A 66-year-old male with lower abdominal lump: An unusual presentation of an uncommon abdominal pathology [^112UTqBQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

A 66-year-old Caucasian male was admitted following symptoms of intermittent umbilical pain, which was aggravated after meals and associated with vomiting. Physical examination revealed a tender, partially reducible swelling, which was suspicious of a complicated umbilical hernia. An abdominal x-ray revealed dilated small bowel loops, which appeared consistent with the clinical diagnosis. He underwent a laparotomy that revealed a small defect in the linea alba with viable small bowel and two firm mesenteric masses encroaching on the lumen approximately two feet from the ileocecal junction. The histology of the excised bowel and masses revealed that the tumor was composed of bland spindle cells with slender to plump nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mesenteric fibromatosis is the most common primary tumor of the mesentery and constitutes about 3.5% of all fibrous tissue tumors. Intra-abdominal desmoids are very rare and benign tumors but are very aggressive and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain.
