## Question

Procalcitonine use

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about procalcitonin use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where procalcitonin is most validated. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for initiation versus discontinuation of antibiotics. Next, I will review guideline positions and real-world implementation challenges. After that, I need to check special populations and limitations. Finally, I will synthesize practical, safety-focused recommendations and a concise conclusion, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts with the strongest evidence base. Procalcitonin has the most consistent, high-quality support in acute respiratory tract infections across primary care, emergency department, and hospital settings, and in sepsis/ICU care for guiding antibiotic discontinuation, with multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses showing reduced antibiotic exposure without increased mortality or treatment failure [^116xZDtu] [^114pd9oe] [^113UfcNV] [^113LwrXj] [^114rvATp].

> Wait, let me verify the distinction between using procalcitonin to start versus stop antibiotics, because conflating these leads to misapplication. For initiation, evidence is mixed and often neutral in high pretest probability settings; for example, in radiographically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia, guidelines recommend empiric antibiotics regardless of initial procalcitonin, and a large U.S. pragmatic ED trial showed no reduction in antibiotic-days with procalcitonin guidance, whereas in low-probability presentations like bronchitis or COPD exacerbations, procalcitonin can safely reduce unnecessary antibiotics [^1129tjB2] [^115YVDN7] [^113gtUrD] [^116xZDtu].

> Hold on, I should verify the discontinuation evidence more carefully. In sepsis and ICU populations, multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show that procalcitonin-guided algorithms that incorporate clinical improvement and a drop in procalcitonin to less than 0.5 ng/mL or an 80–90% decrease from peak reduce antibiotic duration by roughly 1–2 days and are associated with improved 28-day mortality in pooled analyses, albeit with low-to-moderate certainty and heterogeneity in protocols and adherence [^113LwrXj] [^114rvATp] [^116n6Lq2] [^112HBHNb] [^114HW2MX].

> I need to check guideline positions to ensure alignment. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests using procalcitonin alongside clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antimicrobials in adults with sepsis or septic shock once source control is adequate, but recommends against using procalcitonin to guide initiation of antibiotics in suspected sepsis due to limited diagnostic accuracy and lack of outcome benefit, and ATS/IDSA pneumonia guidelines similarly advise not basing initial antibiotic decisions on procalcitonin in confirmed CAP [^113JyKUf] [^114rvATp] [^114z2U45] [^1129tjB2] [^115YVDN7].

> Let me consider real-world implementation, because efficacy in trials often fails to translate without systems support. Observational data show frequent discordance between procalcitonin results and antibiotic decisions, with antibiotics continued despite low procalcitonin and minimal impact of decision support, highlighting the need for embedded protocols, education, and stewardship oversight to realize benefits [^115nuUMX] [^114f9tQH].

> Next, I should review special populations and limitations so I don't overgeneralize. In pediatrics, a large pragmatic RCT found no reduction in intravenous antibiotic duration with procalcitonin guidance compared with usual care, arguing against routine adoption where pediatric stewardship is already robust, while in COVID-19, procalcitonin has limited utility for distinguishing bacterial coinfection and should not drive empiric antibiotics without clinical suspicion [^117ES47K] [^116XSJXh] [^115LFTpE]. In immunocompromised hosts, neutropenia, and certain surgical contexts, procalcitonin kinetics may be blunted or less reliable, necessitating caution and integration with clinical judgment [^1112Lddr] [^117SdwAz].

> I should double-check the biological rationale and thresholds to avoid misinterpretation. Procalcitonin rises within 4–6 hours of bacterial infection and has better specificity than CRP for bacterial versus viral etiologies, but levels also reflect disease severity and noninfectious inflammation; thus, single values are insufficient, and trends over 24–72 hours are more informative for response and discontinuation decisions, with commonly used stopping rules anchored to less than 0.5 ng/mL or an 80–90% decline from peak when clinically improving [^115am5HV] [^117SdwAz] [^113LwrXj].

> Let me synthesize practical, safety-focused recommendations. Use procalcitonin primarily to guide discontinuation in sepsis or severe respiratory infections once the patient is clinically improving and source control is addressed, applying validated algorithms with built-in override criteria for deterioration or high-risk features; avoid using procalcitonin alone to withhold initial antibiotics in suspected sepsis or confirmed CAP, and preferentially target lower-acuity respiratory presentations or equivocal cases where procalcitonin can reduce unnecessary therapy; ensure serial measurements, document clinical rationale when overriding results, and embed within stewardship programs to improve adherence and outcomes [^113JyKUf] [^114rvATp] [^112BABX6] [^116xZDtu].

> But wait, what if the baseline antibiotic durations are already short? I should confirm that effect sizes shrink as standard durations approach 7 days. Indeed, in settings with guideline-concordant short courses, the absolute reduction from procalcitonin is smaller, and emerging data suggest diminishing returns, reinforcing that procalcitonin is most impactful where overtreatment is common and durations are prolonged [^114arBZM] [^116tEQXf].

> In conclusion, procalcitonin is a useful adjunct for antibiotic stewardship, with the clearest benefits in reducing antibiotic exposure across respiratory infections and in guiding safe discontinuation in sepsis when combined with clinical assessment; it is not a stand-alone diagnostic test and should be integrated into protocols with attention to pretest probability, trends, and patient-specific factors to optimize safety and effectiveness [^116xZDtu] [^113LwrXj] [^114rvATp].

Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker that **helps distinguish bacterial from viral infections** and guides antibiotic decisions in acute respiratory infections and sepsis [^116xZDtu] [^113LwrXj]. It is most useful for **reducing unnecessary antibiotics** in lower respiratory tract infections and for **shortening antibiotic duration** in sepsis without increasing mortality or treatment failure [^114pd9oe] [^113LwrXj]. PCT should not be used alone to start or stop antibiotics; it must be integrated with clinical judgment and local protocols [^117SdwAz] [^112BABX6]. It is less reliable in immunocompromised patients, chronic kidney disease, and certain viral infections, and is not recommended for routine use in COVID-19 or pediatric fever without a source [^115LFTpE] [^1112Lddr] [^116XSJXh] [^117FjTj4].

---

## Clinical indications and guidelines

PCT is **supported by guidelines** for specific clinical scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Acute respiratory infections (ARI) | Strong evidence supports PCT-guided algorithms to reduce antibiotic exposure without increasing mortality or treatment failure [^116xZDtu] [^114pd9oe] |
| Sepsis and septic shock | Weak recommendation to use PCT with clinical evaluation to guide antibiotic discontinuation; not recommended to guide initiation [^113JyKUf] [^114z2U45] |
| Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) | Not recommended to guide initiation; may be considered to guide discontinuation in select cases [^1129tjB2] [^115YVDN7] |
| Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) | Not recommended to guide initiation; clinical criteria alone are advised [^114BiX12] [^115915z1] |

---

## Clinical benefits

PCT-guided therapy provides **several benefits**:

- **Reduced antibiotic exposure**: Significant reductions in antibiotic use across multiple settings, including primary care, emergency departments, and ICUs [^116xZDtu] [^114pd9oe].
- **Improved clinical outcomes**: Lower mortality and fewer antibiotic-related side effects in some studies, particularly in sepsis and respiratory infections [^116n6Lq2] [^114pd9oe].
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Reduced antibiotic use and shorter hospital stays can lower healthcare costs [^112bkxQz].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Despite its benefits, PCT has **important limitations**:

- **False positives and negatives**: Elevated PCT can occur in non-infectious inflammatory states (e.g. surgery, trauma, malignancy), and low levels can occur in localized infections or early viral disease [^113PR4W4] [^115LFTpE].
- **Patient populations**: Less reliable in immunocompromised patients, those with chronic kidney disease, and certain viral infections (e.g. COVID-19) [^115LFTpE] [^1112Lddr].
- **Assay variability**: Different assays and cutoffs can affect interpretation; standardized protocols are essential [^115hU5oS] [^112BABX6].

---

## Practical implementation

Effective PCT use requires **structured implementation**:

- **Clear protocols**: Define when to measure PCT, how to interpret results, and when to start or stop antibiotics [^112BABX6].
- **Training**: Educate clinicians on PCT interpretation and integration with clinical judgment [^111HXjSD].
- **Monitoring**: Track adherence and outcomes to ensure safe and effective use [^115nuUMX].

---

## Conclusion

PCT is a **valuable tool** for antibiotic stewardship, particularly in respiratory infections and sepsis, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use without compromising outcomes. It should be used alongside clinical assessment and local protocols, with awareness of its limitations and the clinical context [^113LwrXj] [^112BABX6].

## References

### How to: implement procalcitonin testing in my practice [^112BABX6]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Adding procalcitonin (PCT) to antibiotic stewardship algorithms may improve antibiotic use. However, PCT protocols need to be adapted to clinical settings and patient populations.

Objectives

To review PCT use in different medical settings and patient populations.

Sources

Most recent trials and meta-analyses investigating PCT for antibiotic stewardship were reviewed.

Content

Several trials found PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship to reduce antibiotic exposure and associated side-effects among patients with respiratory infection and sepsis. Decisions regarding antibiotic use in an individual patient are complex and should be based on the pre-test probability for bacterial infection, the severity of presentation and the results of PCT. In the context of a low pre-test probability for bacterial infections and a low-risk patient, a low PCT level helps to rule out bacterial infection and empiric antibiotic therapy can be avoided. In the context of a high pre-test probability for bacterial infections and/or a high-risk patient with sepsis, monitoring of PCT over time helps to track the resolution of infection and decisions regarding early stop of antibiotic treatment. Although these concepts have been successful in several respiratory infection and sepsis trials, some studies failed to show an added benefit of PCT due to factors such as low protocol adherence and relying on single rather than repeat PCT measurements.

Implication

As an adjunct to other clinical and laboratory parameters, PCT provides information about risk for bacterial infection and resolution of infection, and improves antibiotic stewardship decisions, thereby offering more individualized treatment courses with overall reduced antibiotic exposure.

### Using procalcitonin to guide antimicrobial duration in sepsis: asking the same questions will not bring different answers [^111jtV5J]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Severe sepsis is a major healthcare problem and the early initiation of antimicrobials is one of the few measures associated with improved outcomes. However, antibiotic overuse is an increasing problem in critical care. Of several potential biomarkers for antibiotic stewardship, procalcitonin represents the most widely studied and validated. In this commentary we address the current literature on the use of biomarkers to guide antimicrobial therapy in the critically ill and discuss its limitations and future directions.

### Reassessing procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy in critically ill patients with sepsis: lessons from the ADAPT-sepsis trial [^114arBZM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Randomized trials of procalcitonin-guided algorithms to discontinue antibiotics in critically ill patients with sepsis report reduced antibiotic duration and possible mortality benefit. However, open-label trial designs, inconsistent algorithm adherence, and unclear stewardship practices have limited confidence in procalcitonin's benefit. The ADAPT-Sepsis trial addressed several of these gaps through a concealed intervention, robust stewardship, and head-to-head comparison with CRP. Procalcitonin-guided care reduced antibiotic use without significantly impacting mortality, while CRP-guided care showed no benefit. However, algorithm adherence was suboptimal and the absolute reduction in antibiotic duration with procalcitonin was only one day. As shorter fixed-duration therapy becomes standard, procalcitonin's utility in the ICU may decline. Embedding procalcitonin and other biomarkers into multifaceted stewardship strategies, and addressing barriers to clinician trust and implementation, is essential. Future research should also evaluate whether biomarker use earlier in the sepsis care pathway, particularly in Emergency Departments, can improve early diagnostic accuracy and enhance patient outcomes.

### Prevalence of discordant procalcitonin use at an academic medical center [^115nuUMX]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Despite multiple trials demonstrating that procalcitonin (PCT) is an effective tool for antibiotic stewardship, inconsistent application in real-world settings continues to fuel controversy regarding its clinical utility. We sought to determine rates of concordance between PCT results and antibiotic prescribing in hospitalized patients.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of all inpatient encounters at an academic tertiary care health system with a PCT result between February 2017 and October 2019. Concordant prescribing was defined as starting or continuing antibiotics following an elevated PCT (> 0.5 ng/mL) finding and withholding or stopping antibiotics following a low PCT (< 0.1 ng/mL) finding.

Results

Antibiotic prescribing decisions were discordant from the PCT level in 32.5% of our sample. Among patients not receiving antibiotics at the time of testing, 25.9% (430 of 1,662) were prescribed antibiotics despite a low PCT result. Among patients already receiving antibiotics, treatment was continued despite a low PCT level in 80.4% (728 of 906) of cases. Enhanced decision support tools introduced during the study period had no impact on PCT use for antibiotic decisions.

Conclusions

Overall concordance between PCT results and antibiotic use is relatively low in a real-world setting. The potential value of PCT for antibiotic stewardship may not be fully realized.

### Clinical outcomes associated with procalcitonin algorithms to guide antibiotic therapy in respiratory tract infections [^116xZDtu]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

In patients with respiratory tract infection, is measurement of procalcitonin to guide antibiotic prescriptions associated with reduced antibiotic exposure without increases in all-cause mortality or treatment failure?

Bottom Line

The measurement of procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with respiratory tract infections of varying severity is associated with lower antibiotic exposure without increasing all-cause mortality or treatment failure.

### Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic discontinuation and mortality in critically ill adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116n6Lq2]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Procalcitonin (PCT)-guided antibiotic discontinuation appears to decrease antibiotic use in critically ill patients, but its impact on survival remains less certain.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and CENTRAL for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PCT-guided antibiotic discontinuation in critically ill adults reporting survival or antibiotic duration. Searches were conducted without language restrictions from inception to July 23, 2018. Two reviewers independently conducted all review stages; another adjudicated differences. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and evidence was graded using GRADEpro.

Results

Among critically ill adults (5,158 randomized; 5,000 analyzed), PCT-guided antibiotic discontinuation was associated with decreased mortality (16 RCTs; risk ratio [RR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83–0.97; I² = 0%; low certainty). Death was the primary outcome in only one study and a survival benefit was not observed in the subset specified as sepsis (10 RCTs; RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.85–1.03; I² = 0%), those without industry sponsorship (nine RCTs; RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.87–1.10; I² = 0%), high PCT-guided algorithm adherence (five RCTs; RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.71–1.22; I² = 0%), and PCT-guided algorithms without C-reactive protein (eight RCTs; RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.87–1.06; I² = 0%). PCT-guided antibiotic discontinuation decreased antibiotic duration (mean difference, 1.31 days; 95% CI, -2.27 to -0.35; I² = 93%) (low certainty).

Conclusions

Our findings of increased survival and decreased antibiotic utilization associated with PCT-guided antibiotic discontinuation represent low-certainty evidence with a high risk of bias. This relationship was primarily observed in studies without high protocol adherence and in studies with algorithms combining PCT and C-reactive protein. Properly designed studies with mortality as the primary outcome are needed to address this question.

### Procalcitonin to guide antibiotic decision making [^111HXjSD]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is convincing evidence linking antibiotic-stewardship efforts which include the infection marker procalcitonin (PCT) to more rational use of antibiotics with improvements in side-effects and clinical outcomes. This is particularly true in the setting of respiratory infection and sepsis. Yet, some recent trials have shown no benefit of PCT-guided care. Our aim was to discuss the benefits and limitations of using PCT for early infection recognition, severity assessment and therapeutic decisions in individual patients based on most the recent study data.

Recent Findings

Current evidence from randomized trials, and meta-analyses of these trials, indicates that PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship results in a reduction in antibiotic use and antibiotic side-effects, which translates into improved survival of patients with respiratory infections and sepsis. Notably, initial PCT levels have been found to be helpful in defining the risk for bacterial infection in the context of a low pretest probability for bacterial infections (i.e., patients with bronchitis or chronic bastructive pulmonary disease exacerbation). Monitoring of repeated PCT measurements over time has also been found helpful for estimating recovery from bacterial infection and prognosis in higher risk situations (i.e., pneumonia or sepsis) and results in early and safe discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. Some trials, however, did not find a strong effect of PCT guidance which may be explained by low protocol adherence, assessment using only a single rather than repeat PCT levels and lower antibiotic exposure in control group patients. Using PCT in the right patient population, with high-sensitivity assays and with adequate training of physicians is important to increase protocol adherence and reduce antibiotic exposure.

Summary

Inclusion of PCT into antibiotic stewardship algorithms has the potential to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients presenting with respiratory illnesses and sepsis, and holds great promise to mitigate the global bacterial resistance crisis and move from a default position of standardized care to more personalized treatment decisions.

### Procalcitonin for diagnosis of infection and guide to antibiotic decisions: past, present and future [^11445QL6]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

There are a number of limitations to using conventional diagnostic markers for patients with clinical suspicion of infection. As a consequence, unnecessary and prolonged exposure to antimicrobial agents adversely affect patient outcomes, while inappropriate antibiotic therapy increases antibiotic resistance. A growing body of evidence supports the use of procalcitonin (PCT) to improve diagnosis of bacterial infections and to guide antibiotic therapy. For patients with upper and lower respiratory tract infection, post-operative infections and for severe sepsis patients in the intensive care unit, randomized-controlled trials have shown a benefit of using PCT algorithms to guide decisions about initiation and/or discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. For some other types of infections, observational studies have shown promising first results, but further intervention studies are needed before use of PCT in clinical routine can be recommended. The aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence for PCT in different infections and clinical settings, and discuss the reliability of this marker when used with validated diagnostic algorithms.

### Efficacy and safety of procalcitonin guidance in reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment in critically ill patients: a randomised, controlled, open-label trial [^111czqSQ]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

In critically ill patients, antibiotic therapy is of great importance but long duration of treatment is associated with the development of antimicrobial resistance. Procalcitonin is a marker used to guide antibacterial therapy and reduce its duration, but data about safety of this reduction are scarce. We assessed the efficacy and safety of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment in patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in a health-care system with a comparatively low use of antibiotics.

Methods

We did a prospective, multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label intervention trial in 15 hospitals in the Netherlands. Critically ill patients aged at least 18 years, admitted to the ICU, and who received their first dose of antibiotics no longer than 24 h before inclusion in the study for an assumed or proven infection were eligible to participate. Patients who received antibiotics for presumed infection were randomly assigned (1:1), using a computer-generated list, and stratified (according to treatment centre, whether infection was acquired before or during ICU stay, and dependent on severity of infection [ie, sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock]) to receive either procalcitonin-guided or standard-of-care antibiotic discontinuation. Both patients and investigators were aware of group assignment. In the procalcitonin-guided group, a non-binding advice to discontinue antibiotics was provided if procalcitonin concentration had decreased by 80% or more of its peak value or to 0.5 μg/L or lower. In the standard-of-care group, patients were treated according to local antibiotic protocols. Primary endpoints were antibiotic daily defined doses and duration of antibiotic treatment. All analyses were done by intention to treat. Mortality analyses were completed for all patients (intention to treat) and for patients in whom antibiotics were stopped while being on the ICU (per-protocol analysis). Safety endpoints were reinstitution of antibiotics and recurrent inflammation measured by C-reactive protein concentrations and they were measured in the population adhering to the stopping rules (per-protocol analysis). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01139489, and was completed in August, 2014.

Findings

Between Sept 18, 2009, and July 1, 2013, 1575 of the 4507 patients assessed for eligibility were randomly assigned to the procalcitonin-guided group (761) or to standard-of-care (785). In 538 patients (71%) in the procalcitonin-guided group antibiotics were discontinued in the ICU. Median consumption of antibiotics was 7.5 daily defined doses (IQR 4.0–12.7) in the procalcitonin-guided group versus 9.3 daily defined doses (5.0–16.6) in the standard-of-care group (between-group absolute difference 2.69, 95% CI 1.26–4.12, p < 0.0001). Median duration of treatment was 5 days (3–9) in the procalcitonin-guided group and 7 days (4–11) in the standard-of-care group (between-group absolute difference 1.22, 0.65–1.78, p < 0.0001). Mortality at 28 days was 149 (20%) of 761 patients in the procalcitonin-guided group and 196 (25%) of 785 patients in the standard-of-care group (between-group absolute difference 5.4%, 95% CI 1.2–9.5, p = 0.0122) according to the intention-to-treat analysis, and 107 (20%) of 538 patients in the procalcitonin-guided group versus 121 (27%) of 457 patients in the standard-of-care group (between-group absolute difference 6.6%, 1.3–11.9, p = 0.0154) in the per-protocol analysis. 1-year mortality in the per-protocol analysis was 191 (36%) of 538 patients in the procalcitonin-guided and 196 (43%) of 457 patients in the standard-of-care groups (between-group absolute difference 7.4, 1.3–13.8, p = 0.0188).

Interpretation

Procalcitonin guidance stimulates reduction of duration of treatment and daily defined doses in critically ill patients with a presumed bacterial infection. This reduction was associated with a significant decrease in mortality. Procalcitonin concentrations might help physicians in deciding whether or not the presumed infection is truly bacterial, leading to more adequate diagnosis and treatment, the cornerstones of antibiotic stewardship.

### Do we need new trials of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy? [^1166z31Z]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Using biomarkers as a guide to tailor the duration of antibiotic treatment in respiratory infections is an attractive hypothesis assessed in several studies. Recent work aiming to summarize the evidence assessed the effect of a procalcitonin (PCT)-guided antibiotic treatment on outcomes in acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), suggesting that significant reductions in antibiotic duration occur when using a PCT-guided algorithm. However, controversial evidence also suggested PCT-guided algorithms were associated with increased antibiotic duration and increased incidence of Clostridium difficile, without any impact on mortality, in real-world settings. So, although using PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship is promising, after more than a decade of randomized controlled trials on this topic the evidence in its favor is still less than compelling due to limitations in trial design, not taking into consideration fundamental aspects of PCT biology, and the absence of evidence-based antimicrobial duration in intervention and control groups. In this commentary we highlight some questions and limitations of primary PCT study data that might impact interpretation and clinical use of PCT at the bedside.

### Practice patterns and outcomes associated with procalcitonin use in critically ill patients with sepsis [^114f9tQH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background.

Randomized trials support use of procalcitonin (PCT)-based algorithms to decrease duration of antibiotics for critically ill patients with sepsis. However, current use of PCT and associated outcomes in real-world clinical settings is unclear. We sought to determine PCT use in critically ill patients with sepsis in the United States and to examine associations between PCT use and clinical outcomes.

Methods.

This was a retrospective cohort study of approximately 20% of patients with sepsis hospitalized in US intensive care units. Hierarchical regression models were used to determine associations of PCT use with outcomes (antibiotic-days, incidence of Clostridium difficile infection, and in-hospital mortality). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess robustness of findings to different methods used to address unmeasured confounding (eg, instrumental variable, difference-in-differences analyses).

Results.

Among 20750 critically ill patients with sepsis in 107 hospitals with PCT available, 3769 (18%) patients had PCT levels checked; 1119 (29.7%) had serial PCT measurements. PCT use was associated with increased antibiotic-days (adjusted relative risk, 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15–1.18) and incidence of C. difficile (adjusted odds ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.09–1.85) without a change in mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.93–1.19). Analysis of PCT use by instrumental variable and difference-in-difference analyses showed similar lack of antibiotic or outcome improvements associated with PCT use.

Conclusions.

PCT use was not associated with improved antibiotic use or other clinical outcomes in real-world settings. Programs to improve implementation of PCT-based strategies are warranted prior to widespread adoption.

### Procalcitonin to initiate or discontinue antibiotics in acute respiratory tract infections [^113UfcNV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) comprise a large and heterogeneous group of infections including bacterial, viral and other aetiologies. In recent years, procalcitonin - the prohormone of calcitonin - has emerged as a promising marker for the diagnosis of bacterial infections and for improving decisions about antibiotic therapy. Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the feasibility of using procalcitonin for starting and stopping antibiotics in different patient populations with acute respiratory infections and different settings ranging from primary care to emergency departments (EDs), hospital wards and intensive care units (ICUs).

Objectives

The aim of this systematic review based on individual patient data was to assess the safety and efficacy of using procalcitonin for starting or stopping antibiotics over a large range of patients with varying severity of ARIs and from different clinical settings.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2011, Issue 2) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to May 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to May 2011) to identify suitable trials.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs of adult participants with ARIs who received an antibiotic treatment either based on a procalcitonin algorithm or usual care/guidelines. Trials were excluded if they exclusively focused on paediatric patients or if they used procalcitonin for another purpose than to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two teams of review authors independently evaluated the methodology and extracted data from primary studies. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and treatment failure at 30 days. For the primary care setting, treatment failure was defined as death, hospitalisation, ARI-specific complications, recurrent or worsening infection, and patients reporting any symptoms of an ongoing respiratory infection at follow-up. For the ED setting, treatment failure was defined as death, ICU admission, re-hospitalisation after index hospital discharge, ARI-associated complications, and recurrent or worsening infection within 30 days of follow-up. For the ICU setting, treatment failure was defined as death within 30 days of follow-up. Secondary endpoints were antibiotic use (initiation of antibiotics, duration of antibiotics and total exposure to antibiotics (total amount of antibiotic days divided by total number of patients)), length of hospital stay for hospitalised patients, length of ICU stay for critically ill patients, and number of days with restricted activities within 14 days after randomisation for primary care patients. For the two co-primary endpoints of all-cause mortality and treatment failure, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable hierarchical logistic regression. The hierarchical regression model was adjusted for age and clinical diagnosis as fixed-effect. The different trials were added as random-effects into the model. We fitted corresponding linear regression models for antibiotic use. We conducted sensitivity analyses stratified by clinical setting and ARI diagnosis to assess the consistency of our results.

Main Results

We included 14 trials with 4221 participants. There were 118 deaths in 2085 patients (5.7%) assigned to procalcitonin groups compared to 134 deaths in 2126 control patients (6.3%) (adjusted OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.23). Treatment failure occurred in 398 procalcitonin group patients (19.1%) and in 466 control patients (21.9%). Procalcitonin guidance was not associated with increased mortality or treatment failure in any clinical setting, or ARI diagnosis. These results proved robust in various sensitivity analyses. Total antibiotic exposure was significantly reduced overall (median (interquartile range) from 8 (5 to 12) to 4 (0 to 8) days; adjusted difference in days, -3.47, 95% CI -3.78 to -3.17, and across all the different clinical settings and diagnoses.

Authors' Conclusions

Use of procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with ARI was not associated with higher mortality rates or treatment failure. Antibiotic consumption was significantly reduced across different clinical settings and ARI diagnoses. Further high-quality research is needed to confirm the safety of this approach for non-European countries and patients in intensive care. Moreover, future studies should also establish cost-effectiveness by considering country-specific costs of procalcitonin measurement and potential savings in consumption of antibiotics and other healthcare resources, as well as secondary cost savings due to lower risk of side effects and reduced antimicrobial resistance.

### Procalcitonin to initiate or discontinue antibiotics in acute respiratory tract infections [^114pd9oe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) comprise of a large and heterogeneous group of infections including bacterial, viral, and other aetiologies. In recent years, procalcitonin (PCT), a blood marker for bacterial infections, has emerged as a promising tool to improve decisions about antibiotic therapy (PCT-guided antibiotic therapy). Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the feasibility of using procalcitonin for starting and stopping antibiotics in different patient populations with ARIs and different settings ranging from primary care settings to emergency departments, hospital wards, and intensive care units. However, the effect of using procalcitonin on clinical outcomes is unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane review and individual participant data meta-analysis first published in 2012 designed to look at the safety of PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship.

Objectives

The aim of this systematic review based on individual participant data was to assess the safety and efficacy of using procalcitonin for starting or stopping antibiotics over a large range of patients with varying severity of ARIs and from different clinical settings.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, and Embase, in February 2017, to identify suitable trials. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov to identify ongoing trials in April 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs of adult participants with ARIs who received an antibiotic treatment either based on a procalcitonin algorithm (PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship algorithm) or usual care. We excluded trials if they focused exclusively on children or used procalcitonin for a purpose other than to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two teams of review authors independently evaluated the methodology and extracted data from primary studies. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and treatment failure at 30 days, for which definitions were harmonised among trials. Secondary endpoints were antibiotic use, antibiotic-related side effects, and length of hospital stay. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable hierarchical logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, and clinical diagnosis using a fixed-effect model. The different trials were added as random-effects into the model. We conducted sensitivity analyses stratified by clinical setting and type of ARI. We also performed an aggregate data meta-analysis.

Main Results

From 32 eligible RCTs including 18 new trials for this 2017 update, we obtained individual participant data from 26 trials including 6708 participants, which we included in the main individual participant data meta-analysis. We did not obtain individual participant data for four trials, and two trials did not include people with confirmed ARIs. According to GRADE, the quality of the evidence was high for the outcomes mortality and antibiotic exposure, and quality was moderate for the outcomes treatment failure and antibiotic-related side effects. Primary endpoints: there were 286 deaths in 3336 procalcitonin-guided participants (8.6%) compared to 336 in 3372 controls (10.0%), resulting in a significantly lower mortality associated with procalcitonin-guided therapy (adjusted OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99, P = 0.037). We could not estimate mortality in primary care trials because only one death was reported in a control group participant. Treatment failure was not significantly lower in procalcitonin-guided participants (23.0% versus 24.9% in the control group, adjusted OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01, P = 0.068). Results were similar among subgroups by clinical setting and type of respiratory infection, with no evidence for effect modification (P for interaction > 0.05). Secondary endpoints: procalcitonin guidance was associated with a 2.4-day reduction in antibiotic exposure (5.7 versus 8.1 days, 95% CI -2.71 to -2.15, P < 0.001) and lower risk of antibiotic-related side effects (16.3% versus 22.1%, adjusted OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.82, P < 0.001). Length of hospital stay and intensive care unit stay were similar in both groups. A sensitivity aggregate-data analysis based on all 32 eligible trials showed similar results.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated meta-analysis of individual participant data from 12 countries shows that the use of procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment results in lower risks of mortality, lower antibiotic consumption, and lower risk for antibiotic-related side effects. Results were similar for different clinical settings and types of ARIs, thus supporting the use of procalcitonin in the context of antibiotic stewardship in people with ARIs. Future high-quality research is needed to confirm the results in immunosuppressed patients and patients with non-respiratory infections.

### Use of procalcitonin to reduce patients' exposure to antibiotics in intensive care units (PRORATA trial): a multicentre randomised controlled trial [^113sHhNG]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Reduced duration of antibiotic treatment might contain the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in intensive care units. We aimed to establish the effectiveness of an algorithm based on the biomarker procalcitonin to reduce antibiotic exposure in this setting.

Methods

In this multicentre, prospective, parallel-group, open-label trial, we used an independent, computer-generated randomisation sequence to randomly assign patients in a 1:1 ratio to procalcitonin (n = 311 patients) or control (n = 319) groups; investigators were masked to assignment before, but not after, randomisation. For the procalcitonin group, antibiotics were started or stopped based on predefined cut-off ranges of procalcitonin concentrations; the control group received antibiotics according to present guidelines. Drug selection and the final decision to start or stop antibiotics were at the discretion of the physician. Patients were expected to stay in the intensive care unit for more than 3 days, had suspected bacterial infections, and were aged 18 years or older. Primary endpoints were mortality at days 28 and 60 (non-inferiority analysis), and number of days without antibiotics by day 28 (superiority analysis). Analyses were by intention to treat. The margin of non-inferiority was 10%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00472667.

Findings

Nine patients were excluded from the study; 307 patients in the procalcitonin group and 314 in the control group were included in analyses. Mortality of patients in the procalcitonin group seemed to be non-inferior to those in the control group at day 28 (21.2% [65/307] vs 20.4% [64/314]; absolute difference 0.8%, 90% CI -4.6 to 6.2) and day 60 (30.0% [92/307] vs 26.1% [82/314]; 3.8%, -2.1 to 9.7). Patients in the procalcitonin group had significantly more days without antibiotics than did those in the control group (14.3 days [SD 9.1] vs 11.6 days [SD 8.2]; absolute difference 2.7 days, 95% CI 1.4 to 4.1, p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

A procalcitonin-guided strategy to treat suspected bacterial infections in non-surgical patients in intensive care units could reduce antibiotic exposure and selective pressure with no apparent adverse outcomes.

### Use of plasma procalcitonin levels as an adjunct to clinical microbiology [^115am5HV]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

Procalcitonin (PCT) is synthesized by a large number of tissues and organs in response to invasion by pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and some parasites. Current PCT assays are rapid, specific, and of sufficient sensitivity to detect increases in PCT serum levels within 4 to 6 h of initiation of infection. Clinically, PCT levels may help in decisions regarding the need for empirical antibiotic therapy, "source control" of infection, and duration of antibiotic therapy. The addition of PCT levels to bacterial culture and viral detection results can assist with the separation of colonization and invasion by pathogenic bacteria.

### Role of procalcitonin in managing adult patients with respiratory tract infections [^115bEqpA]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Respiratory infections remain the most common reason why patients seek medical care in ambulatory and hospital settings, and they are the most frequent precursor of sepsis. In light of the limitations of clinical signs and symptoms and traditional microbiologic diagnostics for respiratory infections, blood biomarkers that correlate with the presence and extent of bacterial infections may provide additional useful information to improve diagnostic and prognostic efforts and help with therapeutic decisions in individual patients. A growing body of evidence supports the use of procalcitonin (PCT) to differentiate bacterial from viral respiratory diagnoses, to help risk stratify patients, and to guide antibiotic therapy decisions about initial need for, and optimal duration of, therapy. Although still relatively new on the clinical frontier, a series of randomized controlled trials have evaluated PCT protocols for antibiotic-related decision making and have included patients from different clinical settings and with different severities of respiratory infection. In these trials, initial PCT levels were effective in guiding decisions about the initiation of antibiotic therapy in lower-acuity patients, and subsequent measurements were effective for guiding duration of therapy in higher-acuity patients, without apparent harmful effects. Recent European respiratory infection guidelines now also recognize this concept. As with any other laboratory test, PCT should not be used on a stand-alone basis. Rather, it must be integrated into clinical protocols, together with clinical, microbiologic data and with results from clinical risk scores. The aim of this review is to summarize recent evidence about the usefulness of PCT in patients with lower respiratory tract infections and to discuss the potential benefits and limitations of this marker when used for clinical decision making.

### Uses of procalcitonin as a biomarker in critical care medicine [^115LFTpE]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Procalcitonin is a commonly used biomarker for infection and severity in the intensive care unit. Although relatively specific for bacterial, as opposed to viral, infections, serum procalcitonin levels also correlate with disease severity and thus cannot reliably distinguish between bacterial and nonbacterial infections in the setting of critical illness, particularly in cases of severe influenza and coronavirus disease-2019. Baseline procalcitonin levels are insufficiently discriminative to permit the withholding of antibiotics in patients with critical illness and suspected sepsis. Trends in procalcitonin levels over time, however, give us the opportunity to individualize the duration of antibiotics without negative impacts on mortality.

### Procalcitonin-guided use of antibiotics for lower respiratory tract infection [^113gtUrD]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

The effect of procalcitonin-guided use of antibiotics on treatment for suspected lower respiratory tract infection is unclear.

Methods

In 14 U.S. hospitals with high adherence to quality measures for the treatment of pneumonia, we provided guidance for clinicians about national clinical practice recommendations for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and the interpretation of procalcitonin assays. We then randomly assigned patients who presented to the emergency department with a suspected lower respiratory tract infection and for whom the treating physician was uncertain whether antibiotic therapy was indicated to one of two groups: the procalcitonin group, in which the treating clinicians were provided with real-time initial (and serial, if the patient was hospitalized) procalcitonin assay results and an antibiotic use guideline with graded recommendations based on four tiers of procalcitonin levels, or the usual-care group. We hypothesized that within 30 days after enrollment the total antibiotic-days would be lower - and the percentage of patients with adverse outcomes would not be more than 4.5 percentage points higher - in the procalcitonin group than in the usual-care group.

Results

A total of 1656 patients were included in the final analysis cohort (826 randomly assigned to the procalcitonin group and 830 to the usual-care group), of whom 782 (47.2%) were hospitalized and 984 (59.4%) received antibiotics within 30 days. The treating clinician received procalcitonin assay results for 792 of 826 patients (95.9%) in the procalcitonin group (median time from sample collection to assay result, 77 minutes) and for 18 of 830 patients (2.2%) in the usual-care group. In both groups, the procalcitonin-level tier was associated with the decision to prescribe antibiotics in the emergency department. There was no significant difference between the procalcitonin group and the usual-care group in antibiotic-days (mean, 4.2 and 4.3 days, respectively; difference, -0.05 day; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.6 to 0.5; P = 0.87) or the proportion of patients with adverse outcomes (11.7% [96 patients] and 13.1% [109 patients]; difference, -1.5 percentage points; 95% CI, -4.6 to 1.7; P < 0.001 for noninferiority) within 30 days.

Conclusions

The provision of procalcitonin assay results, along with instructions on their interpretation, to emergency department and hospital-based clinicians did not result in less use of antibiotics than did usual care among patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection.

### GRADE-based procalcitonin guideline for emergency departments [^112STYbU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Procalcitonin is a useful biomarker for infection. Over the past two decades, there has been much research on the clinical applications of procalcitonin, yet the majority of these studies have been conducted in the intensive care setting. Despite the extensive use of procalcitonin in emergency departments, there have been no guidelines focusing specifically on these clinical settings. Additionally, previous guidelines were predominantly shaped by expert consensus and rarely incorporate evidence-based medicine concepts. To address these shortcomings, the current guideline adopts a novel approach. Initially, we identified the most critical questions regarding the use of procalcitonin in emergency settings through expert voting. This was followed by a systematic literature review and the evaluation of evidence levels using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology. Key characteristics of individual studies will be summarized and evaluated by the guideline development group to determine the overall quality of evidence. The GRADE working group's categorization system will be employed to rate evidence quality into four levels. Recommendations will be formulated based on explicit consideration of established criteria. This structured approach ensures that guideline recommendations are founded on robust evidence and transparently assessed for strength and potential caveats. This is the first guideline on the use of procalcitonin to be applied in emergency departments that adopts the principles of evidence-based medicine and encompasses the up-to-date literatures, and it marks an advancement in providing guidance on the utilization of procalcitonin in emergency departments.

### Effectiveness and safety of procalcitonin evaluation for reducing mortality in adults with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock [^113YErQB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Serum procalcitonin (PCT) evaluation has been proposed for early diagnosis and accurate staging and to guide decisions regarding patients with sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock, with possible reduction in mortality.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of serum PCT evaluation for reducing mortality and duration of antimicrobial therapy in adults with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock.

Search Methods

We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 7); MEDLINE (1950 to July 2015); Embase (Ovid SP, 1980 to July 2015); Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS via BIREME, 1982 to July 2015); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; EBSCO host, 1982 to July 2015), and trial registers (ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov and CenterWatch, to July 2015). We reran the search in October 2016. We added three studies of interest to a list of 'Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate these into formal review findings during the review update.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing PCT-guided decisions in at least one of the comparison arms for adults (≥ 18 years old) with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock, according to international definitions and irrespective of the setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted study data and assessed the methodological quality of included studies. We conducted meta-analysis with random-effects models for the following primary outcomes: mortality and time spent receiving antimicrobial therapy in hospital and in the intensive care unit (ICU), as well as time spent on mechanical ventilation and change in antimicrobial regimen from a broad to a narrower spectrum.

Main Results

We included 10 trials with 1215 participants. Low-quality evidence showed no significant differences in mortality at longest follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.01; I² = 10%; 10 trials; N = 1156), at 28 days (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.31; I² = 0%; four trials; N = 316), at ICU discharge (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.11; I² = 49%; three trials; N = 506) and at hospital discharge (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.27; I² = 0%; seven trials; N = 805; moderate-quality evidence). However, mean time receiving antimicrobial therapy in the intervention groups was -1.28 days (95% CI to -1.95 to -0.61; I² = 86%; four trials; N = 313; very low-quality evidence). No primary study has analysed the change in antimicrobial regimen from a broad to a narrower spectrum.

Authors' Conclusions

Up-to-date evidence of very low to moderate quality, with insufficient sample power per outcome, does not clearly support the use of procalcitonin-guided antimicrobial therapy to minimize mortality, mechanical ventilation, clinical severity, reinfection or duration of antimicrobial therapy of patients with septic conditions.

### Procalcitonin and other markers of infection. what should be their role in clinical practice? [^1143cL2Y]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Clinicians are always faced with a decision when confronted with a febrile patient; they must decide between what is an infectious condition and what is not, and between what merits hospital observation, what requires empirical antibiotic treatment and what needs outpatient follow-up. In this respect, judgement based on medical history and physical examination outweigh the predictive value of various laboratory markers of infection, as the latter generally reflect a nonspecific reaction of the host to widely different infectious and inflammatory stimuli. In the evaluation of specific subgroups of patients, e.g. those in the intensive care unit, laboratory tests should also preferably form a continuum with medical history and physical examination, aimed at clarifying host condition, the setting and the source of a possible infection.

### Procalcitonin: seeking a niche [^117WqQZt]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

For over a decade there has been intense interest given to the role of procalcitonin in the diagnosis and management of sepsis in critically ill patients. Early opinions strongly supported the diagnostic role but data accumulating from numerous subsequent studies are less supportive, even when used in very selective settings. Although there remains sufficient reason to support the use of procalcitonin in guiding antibiotic therapy or perhaps providing prognostic information, it may be time to focus our efforts on the early diagnosis of sepsis in the critically care setting on alternative, more promising methods.

### Utility of procalcitonin as a biomarker for sepsis in children [^111mRnnf]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is a complex process defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates in both adults and children, and emphasis has been placed on its early recognition and prompt provision of antimicrobials. Owing to limitations of current diagnostic tests (i.e., poor sensitivity and delayed results), significant research has been conducted to identify sepsis biomarkers. Ideally, a biomarker could reliably and rapidly distinguish bacterial infection from other, noninfectious causes of systemic inflammatory illness. In doing so, a sepsis biomarker could be used for earlier identification of sepsis, risk stratification/prognostication, and/or guidance of antibiotic decision-making. In this minireview, we review one of the most common clinically used sepsis biomarkers, procalcitonin, and its roles in sepsis management in these three areas. We highlight key findings in the adult literature but focus the bulk of this review on pediatric sepsis. The challenges and limitations of procalcitonin measurement in sepsis are also discussed.

### Procalcitonin as a diagnostic marker for sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111XoEkZ]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Procalcitonin is a promising marker for identification of bacterial infections. We assessed the accuracy and clinical value of procalcitonin for diagnosis of sepsis in critically ill patients.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, ISI Web of Knowledge, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, BioMed Central, and Science Direct, from inception to Feb 21, 2012, and reference lists of identified primary studies. We included articles written in English, German, or French that investigated procalcitonin for differentiation of septic patients — those with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock — from those with a systemic inflammatory response syndrome of non-infectious origin. Studies of healthy people, patients without probable infection, and children younger than 28 days were excluded. Two independent investigators extracted patient and study characteristics; discrepancies were resolved by consensus. We calculated individual and pooled sensitivities and specificities. We used I(2) to test heterogeneity and investigated the source of heterogeneity by metaregression.

Findings

Our search returned 3487 reports, of which 30 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, accounting for 3244 patients. Bivariate analysis yielded a mean sensitivity of 0 · 77 (95% CI 0 · 72–0 · 81) and specificity of 0 · 79 (95% CI 0 · 74–0 · 84). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0 · 85 (95% CI 0 · 81–0 · 88). The studies had substantial heterogeneity (I(2) = 96%, 95% CI 94–99). None of the subgroups investigated — population, admission category, assay used, severity of disease, and description and masking of the reference standard — could account for the heterogeneity.

Interpretation

Procalcitonin is a helpful biomarker for early diagnosis of sepsis in critically ill patients. Nevertheless, the results of the test must be interpreted carefully in the context of medical history, physical examination, and microbiological assessment.

### How to use biomarkers of infection or sepsis at the bedside: guide to clinicians [^111bw38N]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. In this context, biomarkers could be considered as indicators of either infection or dysregulated host response or response to treatment and/or aid clinicians to prognosticate patient risk. More than 250 biomarkers have been identified and evaluated over the last few decades, but no biomarker accurately differentiates between sepsis and sepsis-like syndrome. Published data support the use of biomarkers for pathogen identification, clinical diagnosis, and optimization of antibiotic treatment. In this narrative review, we highlight how clinicians could improve the use of pathogen-specific and of the most used host-response biomarkers, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, to improve the clinical care of patients with sepsis. Biomarker kinetics are more useful than single values in predicting sepsis, when making the diagnosis and assessing the response to antibiotic therapy. Finally, integrated biomarker-guided algorithms may hold promise to improve both the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis. Herein, we provide current data on the clinical utility of pathogen-specific and host-response biomarkers, offer guidance on how to optimize their use, and propose the needs for future research.

### Biomarkers in sepsis: can they help improve patient outcome? [^116wyrSR]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Biomarkers, mainly procalcitonin, are commonly used in sepsis diagnosis, prognosis and treatment follow-up. This review summarizes the potential benefit of their use for the critically ill.

Recent Findings

Increased clinical evidence from randomized clinical trials of biomarker-guided treatment suggests a trend for appropriate but short antimicrobial treatment for the critically ill. Procalcitonin (PCT) is the most studied biomarker; in the majority of randomized clinical trials, the use of a stopping rule of antibiotics on the day when PCT is below 80% from baseline or less than 0.5ng/ml was proven effective to reduce length of antimicrobial treatment, antibiotic-associated adverse events and infectious complications like infections by multidrug-resistant organisms and Clostridium difficile. Survival benefit was also noted.

Summary

Biomarkers, mainly PCT, may help improve sepsis outcome by restriction of injudicious antimicrobial use.

### Procalcitonin for diagnosis of infection and guide to antibiotic decisions: past, present and future [^115EqW77]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Based on this evidence, PCT has been put forward as a promising candidate marker for diagnosis and for antibiotic stewardship in patients with systemic infections. Importantly, as with any diagnostic tool, PCT should be used embedded in clinical algorithms adapted to the type of infection and the clinical context and setting. While for some types of infections and clinical settings optimal PCT cut-offs have been established and their safety and efficacy shown in randomized-controlled intervention trials, for other types of infection only observational studies are available today (Figure 1), and thus the clinical benefit and safety of using PCT remains undefined.

Figure 1
Available evidence concerning PCT in different infections derived from observational and randomized-controlled intervention studies. While for some infections, intervention studies have investigated benefit and harm of using PCT for antibiotic decisions (right side), for other infections only results from diagnostic (observation) studies are available with mixed results (left side). Abbreviations: PCT, procalcitonin. + moderate evidence in favor of PCT; ++ good evidence in favor of PCT; +++ strong evidence in favor of PCT;? evidence in favor or against the use of PCT still undefined

The aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence for PCT in different infections and clinical settings, and discuss the strengths and limitations of PCT, and the reliability of this marker when used with validated diagnostic algorithms.

### Do we need new trials of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy? [^115nScwT]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Clinical use of biomarker-guided antibiotic stewardship such as PCT is promising, but after more than a decade of RCTs on the topic the evidence in its favor is still less than compelling due to limitations in trial design. These limitations include not taking into consideration fundamental aspects of PCT biology and the absence of evidence-based antimicrobial duration in intervention and control groups, namely in VAP. A double-trigger criteria, in which antibiotics are stopped according to the clinical course and either decreases in biomarker levels, according to an algorithm, or the completion of 5–7 days of treatment, whichever comes first, might be a safe and efficient strategy to decrease antimicrobial therapy duration in critically ill patients.

### Procalcitonin-guided diagnosis and antibiotic stewardship revisited [^114MaMYq]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Summary, future directions, and conclusions

This update of a previous narrative review found several interesting new clinical settings in which PCT-guided therapy could help to reduce antibiotic exposure by decreasing either initiation or duration of treatment. Particularly, controlled clinical studies have found that PCT improves the management of patients with lower respiratory tract infections and critically ill sepsis patients, as well as patients with UTIs, postoperative infections, meningitis, and acute heart failure with possible superinfection (i.e. pneumonia). Recording PCT levels on hospital admission was found to substantially reduce the initiation of antibiotic treatment in low-risk situations (i.e. bronchitis, AECOPD). For more severe infections (i.e. pneumonia, sepsis), antibiotic stewardship by monitoring PCT kinetics resulted in shorter antibiotic treatment duration by early cessation of therapy. These strategies appear to be safe without increasing the risk for mortality, recurrent infections, or treatment failure. PCT kinetics have also proved to have prognostic value, correlating with disease severity (i.e. pancreatitis, abdominal infection) and resolution of illness (i.e. sepsis). While there is strong evidence regarding antibiotic stewardship in respiratory infection and sepsis, PCT has not been as well studied for other types of infections. Thus, future research should focus on non-respiratory infections and investigate whether PCT improves antibiotic decisions in these patients. PCT should also be compared to other markers, such as CRP, in regard to diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness.

Emerging bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents calls for more effective efforts to reduce the unnecessary and prolonged use of antibiotics in self-limiting non-bacterial and resolving diseases. Healthcare professionals share a common goal of achieving symptom relief from infection as fast as possible and often see antibiotics as the best means to achieve this goal. This "one size fits all" approach, however, does not answer the basic questions of who truly benefits from antibiotic therapy and what would be the optimal duration of treatment. There is a growing body of literature supporting the use of PCT as a persuasive, evidence-based approach to a more rational use of antibiotics.

### Procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in acute respiratory infections: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^117FjTj4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

We limited our analysis to adult patients with ARIs that were mostly immunocompetent, thus limiting the generalizability to other populations. Previous RCTs have shown that PCT guidance also reduces antibiotic exposure in a neonatal sepsis population and in children with pneumonia, but not in children with fever without a source. We found 7 ongoing pediatric RCTs evaluating PCT algorithms that should shed further light on the benefits and harms of PCT use in pediatric populations.

Finally, included trials were mostly conducted in the European setting, with 2 trials coming from China and 1 multinational trial including US sites. Thus, further validation and adaptation of PCT algorithms to other countries may be needed.

In conclusion, the use of PCT to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with ARI was not associated with higher mortality rates or treatment failure, but PCT use did significantly reduce antibiotic consumption across different clinical settings and ARI diagnoses. The remaining uncertainty with respect to mortality and the partially low adherence rates to protocols in ICU patients calls for further trials, particularly in the critical-care setting, before PCT-based algorithms can be considered safe. The use of PCT embedded in clinical algorithms has the potential to improve the antibiotic management of ARI patients and has substantial clinical and public health implications to reduce antibiotic exposure and the associated risk of antibiotic resistance.

### Procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in acute respiratory infections: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^113GHbmw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Previous meta-analyses of RCTs investigating the effect of PCT algorithms on antibiotic use focused on the critical-care setting, patients with suspicion of bacterial infections, and patients with sepsis and respiratory infections. However, these meta-analyses used aggregated data and were not able to investigate the effects of PCT on different ARI diagnoses and on outcomes other than mortality. The strengths of this meta-analysis based on individual patient data from 14 eligible trials include an explicit study protocol, a comprehensive search to retrieve all relevant trials, a network that allowed inclusion of individual patient data from eligible trials, standardized outcome definitions across trials, the possibility to conduct appropriate subgroup and sensitivity analyses, and analyses based on the intention-to-treat principle, thereby overcoming limitations of previous meta-analyses with aggregated data.

Despite these merits, our study has several limitations. Although we included all available evidence in our pooled analysis, we cannot rule out a clinically relevant absolute risk increase of 4% for ICU patients with PCT guidance. In addition, the adherence to the PCT algorithm in the largest ICU trial was relatively low (47%), leaving an even greater uncertainty about the safety of PCT use in ICU patients. There are currently several ongoing trials registered in the Clinical Trials database. Five ongoing trials focus on PCT as a guide to stop antibiotics in ICU patients with sepsis, and 2 of those are enrolling large numbers of patients (> 1000 patients each). Hence, these trials may help to further establish the safety of PCT in this vulnerable patient population. However, if one wanted to rule out, for instance, a 10% relative (or 2.3% absolute) mortality increase in ICU patients, a total of 5735 randomized patients would be needed in each group (assuming a mortality rate in control ICU patients with ARI of 23%, an alpha error of 5%, and a power of 80%).

### Procalcitonin to guide duration of antibiotic therapy in intensive care patients: a randomized prospective controlled trial [^113we3WY]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Key messages

- PCT is the first laboratory marker among a large array of inflammatory variables that offers the possibility to differentiate bacterial infection from viral or non-infectious inflammatory reaction.

- PCT assessment provides a helpful tool to decide on the duration of antibiotic treatment, if interpreted in the clinical context including the underlying disease.

- PCT-based algorithm supports the cautious use of antibiotics and has a favourable effect on the clinical outcome.

- PCT-based algorithm is certainly practicable and simple.

- PCT-controlled antibiotic therapy must still be tested in heterogenous groups of patients, particularly for safety.

### Procalcitonin is useful for evaluating patients with ambiguous presentation and for early discontinuation of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia [^116nv7at]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Thus, there is strong clinical evidence that PCT is useful for evaluating patients with lower respiratory infection and ambiguous presentation and for stopping antibiotics early in patients with confirmed CAP. It is unfortunate that the updated guideline focused on a clinical situation in which no biomarker would be expected to have a strong influence on treatment (i.e. patients with clinically suspected and radiographically confirmed CAP) and unfortunate that it did not include recommendations for using PCT in ambiguous clinical situations and for guiding treatment duration, both of which have a strong impact on antibiotic overuse and associated health risks.

### Procalcitonin is useful for evaluating patients with ambiguous presentation and for early discontinuation of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia [^114qL2BK]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The updated American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) conclude that procalcitonin (PCT) is not recommended to determine the need for initial antibacterial therapy in patients with clinically suspected and radiographically confirmed CAP. It seems rational that in a patient with a high pretest probability for pneumonia, any biomarker (including PCT) that is not 100% accurate should not have a strong influence on treatment decisions. The advantage of using PCT for the management of patients with CAP, however, has been demonstrated for patients in whom a CAP diagnosis is unclear (e.g. patients with no infiltrate in chest X-ray) and for monitoring patients with CAP to decide whether to stop treatment early. Most trials that evaluated PCT for the management of CAP did not rely on the initial PCT level and instead focused on the kinetics of this blood marker to indicate that antibiotic treatment should be stopped early. The initial PCT level was found to be helpful in patients with a bronchitis-like illness and possible CAP but an ambiguous clinical presentation. A recent meta-analysis of individual patient data that focused specifically on patients with respiratory infection and CAP who had participated in randomized trials showed that PCT is highly effective in reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment. Specifically, the analysis included 6,708 patients from 26 eligible trials in 12 countries and found a 2.4-day reduction in antibiotic exposure (5.7 vs. 8.1 d [95% confidence interval (CI), –2.71 to –2.15]; P < 0.0001) and a reduction in antibiotic-related side effects (16% vs. 22%, adjusted odds ratio, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.57 to 0.82]; P < 0.0001). Importantly, when PCT was used to guide discontinuation of treatment, patients had significantly improved clinical outcomes (odds ratio for mortality, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.70–0.99]; P = 0.037).

### Procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in acute respiratory infections: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^116iBxNm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Similar to other tests, the use of PCT cut-offs and test result interpretation need to be reflected in the context of the pretest probability and to be adapted to clinical settings and the risk of patients. In included trials with patients at low risk for severe bacterial infections (eg, primary-care patients), a PCT algorithm was used to determine whether antibiotics should be initiated at all; in trials with higher-risk patients (ICU or ED patients), PCT was mainly used to determine when treatment could be safely discontinued. Importantly, all trials included PCT in clinical algorithms, and physicians could deviate from the PCT algorithm if needed. As a consequence, some trials had low protocol adherence, particularly ICU trials. Although reductions in antibiotic exposure despite this low adherence were impressive, concerns about safety may arise. Clinicians commonly agree that important clinical decisions, such as initiation and continuation of antibiotic therapy, should not be based on a single diagnostic criterion only; PCT should complement but not replace clinical decision making. Accordingly, PCT protocols specified "overruling criteria" whereby the PCT algorithm could be bypassed (eg, if clinical criteria suggest a high-risk situation). Of note, sensitivity analyses showed no evidence of heterogeneity, and results were similar when only trials with high adherence rates were considered. Poststudy surveys have been published in order to better understand the effects and challenges of PCT protocols in clinical practice, where adherence and confidence will be a crucial factor for the success of this strategy.

### Do we need new trials of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy? [^112vqFNN]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Are control groups receiving the best care?

A major concern in PCT-guided trials is antibiotic use in the control group. According to the World Medical Association's Helsinki declaration, "the benefits, risks, burdens, and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the best current proven intervention", but defining "best current proven intervention" is difficult. Heterogeneity of current practices has been a major argument against using routine care without any constraints as the comparator. When we consider duration of antibiotic treatment and/or antibiotic exposure, the duration of therapy in control groups is systematically above those recommended by guidelines and the best available evidence base (e.g. standard of care for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) patients in the control group should be 6–8 days, not 13 days). Should any intervention compared to a "suboptimal" standard of care (even when it is usual care) be recommended/adopted in clinical practice?

For instance, usual care is sometimes far from the best available care or what should be standard of care. Trials using a protocolized rather than an unrestricted standard care control group will likely have enhanced validity as long as the protocolized care control group is representative of standard care practices. In PCT studies, a protocolized group with clear stop rules for antibiotic duration, making it more compatible with best available evidence and recommendations, would be important and could lead to better evaluation of biomarker-based antimicrobial treatment.

### Prognostic value of procalcitonin in respiratory tract infections across clinical settings [^116LCJ2Y]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This is the first large-scale study in which the prognostic value of admission PCT levels has been investigated throughout all clinical settings in the field of ARIs. PCT levels mainly provide prognostic information for risk stratification of patients in the ED setting and in patients with low to moderate ARIs. Future randomised controlled studies must address whether adding PCT to initial risk assessment can improve patient management and prognostication.

### The prognostic value of serum procalcitonin measurements in critically injured patients: a systematic review [^111d6Q9f]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Despite the limitations identified during this review, PCT seems to hold promise as a surrogate biomarker for trauma. Initial peak PCT level may be used as an early predictor of severity of injury, development of sepsis and MOD, and mortality in trauma population. Serum PCT levels may contribute to the identification of patients who may benefit most from more aggressive management. However, further studies, preferably prospective randomized controlled multicenter open-label intervention trials, are necessary to investigate the impact of procalcitonin-guided decision-making on the clinical outcomes in the trauma setting.

### Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11178z3B]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The utility of procalcitonin to manage patients with infections is unclear. A systematic review of comparative studies using procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy in patients with infections was performed.

Methods

Randomized, controlled trials comparing procalcitonin-guided initiation, intensification, or discontinuation of antibiotic therapy to clinically guided therapy were included. Outcomes were antibiotic usage, morbidity, and mortality. MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database, National Institute for Clinical Excellence, the National Guideline Clearinghouse, and the Health Technology Assessment Programme were searched from January 1, 1990 to December 16, 2011.

Results

Eighteen randomized, controlled trials were included. Data were pooled into clinically similar patient populations. In adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients, procalcitonin-guided discontinuation of antibiotics reduced antibiotic duration by 2.05 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.59 to -1.52) without increasing morbidity or mortality. In contrast, procalcitonin-guided intensification of antibiotics in adult ICU patients increased antibiotic usage and morbidity. In adult patients with respiratory tract infections, procalcitonin guidance significantly reduced antibiotic duration by 2.35 days (95% CI: -4.38 to -0.33), antibiotic prescription rate by 22% (95% CI: -41% to -4%), and total antibiotic exposure without affecting morbidity or mortality. A single, good quality study of neonates with suspected sepsis demonstrated reduced antibiotic duration by 22.4 hours (P = 0.012) and reduced the proportion of neonates on antibiotics for ≥ 72 hours by 27% (P = 0.002) with procalcitonin guidance.

Conclusion

Procalcitonin guidance can safely reduce antibiotic usage when used to discontinue antibiotic therapy in adult ICU patients and when used to initiate or discontinue antibiotics in adult patients with respiratory tract infections.

### A procalcitonin-based algorithm to guide antibiotic use in patients with acute pancreatitis (PROCAP): a single-centre, patient-blinded, randomised controlled trial [^113VK29Z]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Background

Differentiating inflammation from bacterial infection in patients with acute pancreatitis can be difficult. Procalcitonin can distinguish infection from inflammation, and algorithms based on procalcitonin measurement can differentiate bacterial sepsis from a systemic inflammatory response. We aimed to test the hypothesis that a procalcitonin-based algorithm to guide initiation, continuation, and discontinuation of antibiotics could lead to reduced antibiotic use without an adverse effect on outcome in acute pancreatitis.

Methods

PROCAP was a single-centre, patient-blinded, randomised controlled trial done at the Manchester Royal Infirmary (Manchester, UK). Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older and had a clinical diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to procalcitonin-guided care or usual care using web-based randomisation software. The randomisation sequence was stratified by disease severity and admission pathway, using variable block sizes of 4, 6, or 8. Patients, but not clinicians, were masked to group assignment. In the procalcitonin-guided care group, procalcitonin testing was conducted on days 0, 4, 7, and weekly thereafter. Guidance was to stop or not start antibiotics following a test value of less than 1.0 ng/mL and to start or continue antibiotics following a test value of 1.0 ng/mL or more. In the intervention group, any empirical clinical decision to use antibiotics was preceded by measurement of procalcitonin. Otherwise, both groups received standard care. The primary outcome was use of antibiotics during the index admission to hospital. All analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This study was registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial registry, ISRCTN 50584992.

Findings

Between July 29, 2018, and Nov 13, 2020, 369 patients were screened, of whom 260 were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (132 to procalcitonin-guided care and 128 to usual care). 59 (45%) of patients in the procalcitonin-guided care group were prescribed antibiotics compared with 79 (63%) in the usual care group (adjusted risk difference -15.6% [95% CI -27.0 to -4.2]; p = 0.0071). The odds ratio for the treatment effect was 0.49 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.83; p = 0.0077). There was no significant difference between groups in terms of the number of clinical infections or hospital-acquired infections per patient. Four (3%) patients in the procalcitonin-guided care group and three (2%) patients in the usual care group died; all deaths were related to underlying severe pancreatitis. There was no difference in adverse events between the groups.

Interpretation

Our findings suggest that procalcitonin-guided care can reduce antibiotic use without increasing infection or harm in patients with acute pancreatitis. Procalcitonin-based algorithms to guide antibiotic use should be considered in the care of this group of patients and be incorporated into future guidelines on the management of acute pancreatitis.

### Guideline-based clinical assessment versus procalcitonin-guided antibiotic use in pneumonia: a pragmatic randomized trial [^1111wbAR]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Efforts to reduce unnecessary and unnecessarily long antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia have been attempted through use of procalcitonin and through guidelines based on serial clinical assessment. Our aim is to compare guideline-based clinical assessment- and procalcitonin algorithm-guided antibiotic use among patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

Methods

We performed a pragmatic, randomized, multicenter trial from November 2012 to April 2015 at 12 French hospitals. We included emergency department (ED) patients older than 18 years with community-acquired pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned to either the procalcitonin-guided or clinical assessment group. In accordance with past studies, we hypothesized that serial clinical assessment would be superior to procalcitonin-guided care. The primary outcome was antibiotic duration, and secondary outcomes included rates of antibiotic duration less than or equal to 5 days, and clinical success and combined serious adverse outcomes at 30 days in the intention-to-treat population.

Results

Of 370 eligible patients, 285 (77%) were randomly assigned to either clinical assessment- (n = 143) or procalcitonin-guided care (n = 142). Median age was 67 years (range 18 to 93 years) and 40% of patients were deemed to have Pneumonia Severity Index class IV or V. Procalcitonin algorithm adherence was 76%. Antibiotic duration was not significantly different between clinical assessment- and procalcitonin-guided groups (median 9 versus 10 days, respectively). Clinical success rate was 92% in each group and serious adverse outcome rates were similar (15% versus 20%, respectively).

Conclusion

Guideline-based serial clinical assessment did not reduce antibiotic exposure compared with procalcitonin-guided care among ED patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The strategies were similar in terms of duration of antibiotic use and clinical outcomes.

### Procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in acute respiratory infections: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^113bBz6r]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Procalcitonin algorithms may reduce antibiotic use for acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs). We undertook an individual patient data meta-analysis to assess safety of this approach in different ARI diagnoses and different clinical settings.

Methods

We identified clinical trials in which patients with ARI were assigned to receive antibiotics based on a procalcitonin algorithm or usual care by searching the Cochrane Register, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. Individual patient data from 4221 adults with ARIs in 14 trials were verified and reanalyzed to assess risk of mortality and treatment failure-overall and within different clinical settings and types of ARIs.

Results

Overall, there were 118 deaths in 2085 patients (5.7%) assigned to procalcitonin groups compared with 134 deaths in 2126 control patients (6.3%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval CI, .71–1.23)]. Treatment failure occurred in 398 procalcitonin group patients (19.1%) and in 466 control patients (21.9%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, .71-.97). Procalcitonin guidance was not associated with increased mortality or treatment failure in any clinical setting or ARI diagnosis. Total antibiotic exposure per patient was significantly reduced overall (median [interquartile range], from 8 [5–12] to 4 [0–8] days; adjusted difference in days, -3.47 [95% CI, -3.78 to -3.17]) and across all clinical settings and ARI diagnoses.

Conclusions

Use of procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with ARIs was effective in reducing antibiotic exposure across settings without an increase in the risk of mortality or treatment failure. Further high-quality trials are needed in critical-care patients.

### Cost-effectiveness of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic use in community acquired pneumonia [^112bkxQz]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Although prior randomized trials have demonstrated that procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy effectively reduces antibiotic use in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), uncertainties remain regarding use of procalcitonin protocols in practice.

Objective

To estimate the cost-effectiveness of procalcitonin protocols in CAP.

Design

Decision analysis using published observational and clinical trial data, with variation of all parameter values in sensitivity analyses.

Patients

Hypothetical patient cohorts who were hospitalized for CAP.

Interventions

Procalcitonin protocols vs. usual care.

Main Measures

Costs and cost per quality adjusted life year gained.

Key Results

When no differences in clinical outcomes were assumed, consistent with clinical trials and observational data, procalcitonin protocols cost $10-$54 more per patient than usual care in CAP patients. Under these assumptions, results were most sensitive to variations in: antibiotic cost, the likelihood that antibiotic therapy was initiated less frequently or over shorter durations, and the likelihood that physicians were nonadherent to procalcitonin protocols. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses, incorporating procalcitonin protocol-related changes in quality of life, found that protocol use was unlikely to be economically reasonable if physician protocol nonadherence was high, as observational study data suggest. However, procalcitonin protocols were favored if they decreased hospital length of stay.

Conclusions

Procalcitonin protocol use in hospitalized CAP patients, although promising, lacks physician nonadherence and resource use data in routine care settings, which are needed to evaluate its potential role in patient care.

### Procalcitonin-guided diagnosis and antibiotic stewardship revisited [^111Lv2uS]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There are important limitations to consider when using conventional diagnostic markers, such as blood cultures and inflammatory markers (i.e. C-reactive protein [CRP]), for patients with a clinical suspicion of infection, particularly in regard to suboptimal sensitivity and specificity. These limitations often leave physicians with ambiguity regarding the necessity of the use of antibiotic treatment. As a consequence, unnecessary and prolonged exposure to antimicrobial agents adversely affect patient outcomes (e.g. risk for Clostridium difficile infection), while inappropriate antibiotic therapy increases antibiotic resistance in patients, resulting in a public health threat. A growing body of evidence supports the use of the infection marker procalcitonin (PCT) to improve the diagnosis of bacterial infections and to indicate resolution of infection, thereby helping to monitor patients and guide antibiotic therapy.

Based on a review published in 2011, this current narrative review aims to update clinicians on (promising) new indications for PCT in patient management by focusing on research studies published from 2012 to the end of 2016. The evidence from observational and interventional research is ordered by different types of infections and study designs. Proposed PCT cut-offs and the main conclusions of relevant studies are summarized in Table 1 and graphically displayed in Fig. 1.

### Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy may shorten length of treatment and may improve survival-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1141ChDb]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inappropriate use of antibiotics (ABs) has serious adverse effects. As a result, antibiotic resistance is emerging, causing approximately 700,000 deaths worldwide in 2014 and is predicted to be the leading cause of death worldwide by 2050 — accounting for 10 million deaths per year. Critically ill patients in ICU are at high risk of becoming infected with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) due to their acquired immune deficiency, resulting in unacceptably high morbidity and mortality.

In general, more than 50% of critically ill patients are considered as infected. Infection and related sepsis can more than double ICU mortality. However, less than 60% of critically ill patients with an initial diagnosis of sepsis are confirmed to be infected. Despite the known challenges in the differential diagnosis of infection and sepsis, there is an urgent constraint to administer ABs shortly after the onset of sepsis and septic shock. This strategy may inevitably result in unnecessary AB therapy, thus increasing the chance of harm and costs associated with AB treatment.

Procalcitonin (PCT) is one of the most studied inflammatory biomarkers and can distinguish bacterial infections from viral infections in critically ill patients. There is growing evidence that PCT-guided AB therapy can safely reduce antimicrobial consumption — by reducing the number of unnecessary or excessively long therapies. The results of a large, individual patient data meta-analysis in 2017 support the use of PCT in the management of AB stewardship in acute respiratory infections in a variety of clinical settings. However, the evidence is less convincing in other types of infection and sepsis.

The PRORATA study was the first big, multicenter RCT to demonstrate the efficacy and non-inferiority of AB management guided by a predefined PCT protocol in septic critically ill patients. Subsequent trials conducted in ICUs used an approach identical with or similar to PRORATA, but PCT levels for starting and stopping thresholds varied, patient populations were also heterogeneous with medical, surgical, or mixed populations treated for different types of infections, and therefore the overall interpretation and implementation of PCT-guided AB therapy in ICU setting remains challenging. Moreover, with the implementation of the new Sepsis-3 definition, study inclusion criteria for sepsis and septic shock have also changed in the most recent clinical trials as compared to the definitions previously used for decades. An updated comprehensive analysis of PCT stewardship in ICU setting, including Sepsis-3 patients, was lacking.

Therefore, we aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effects of PCT-guided AB therapy compared to standard of care (SOC) in critically ill patients.

### Procalcitonin for diagnosis of infection and guide to antibiotic decisions: past, present and future [^115hU5oS]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Procalcitonin as a guide for antibiotic decisions: results from randomized-controlled studies

The clinical implications of the above mentioned observational studies may be limited by differences in disease definitions and patient groups, use of insensitive (semi-quantitative) PCT assays, and different methodological issues such as observer bias, selection bias and issues of sample availability, co-infection and colonization. To overcome these limitations, several randomized-controlled studies have investigated the use of PCT to assist in decisions about initiation and/or duration of antibiotic therapy (antibiotic stewardship). Thereby the benefit of PCT was measured by clinical outcomes, assuming that if the patient recovers without antibiotics, there was no relevant bacterial illness in need of antibiotic therapy. Importantly, all intervention studies used fully automated highly sensitive PCT assays, the results of which can be obtained in the clinical routine of an emergency department within one hour thus permitting bed-side decision making. Recently, different options for PCT testing have become available, including the KRYPTOR, the VIDAS system (Biomerieux), the Liaison BRAHMS PCT (DiaSorin) and the Elecsys BRAHMS PCT (Roche Diagnostics).

All published studies on antibiotic stewardship used similar clinical algorithms with recommendations for or against antibiotic treatment based on PCT cut-off ranges. For moderate risk patients with respiratory tract infections in the emergency department (Figure 2), algorithms recommended initiation and discontinuation of antibiotic therapy based on four different cut-off ranges. Initial antibiotics were withheld mostly in patients with low risk for systemic infection with acute bronchitis or exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ECOPD]). Clinical re-evaluation and a repeated measurement of PCT were recommended after 6 to 24 hours if the clinical condition did not improve spontaneously. If PCT values were increased and antibiotic therapy was initiated, repeated PCT measurements were recommended every one to two days, depending on the clinical severity of disease, and antibiotics were discontinued using the same cut off ranges or a marked drop by 80% to 90% if initial levels were high (for example > 5 μg/l). To assure safety, specific criteria were predefined where this algorithm could be overruled, such as life-threatening disease or immediate need for ICU admission. For high risk patients in the ICU setting (Figure 3), algorithms focused on discontinuation of antibiotic therapy if a patient showed a clinical recovery and PCT levels decreased to 'normal' levels, or by at least 80% to 90%.

### Use of a procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment algorithm in the pediatric intensive care unit [^11291bho]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The utility of procalcitonin testing in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is not known. We sought to determine the impact of a procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment algorithm implemented with antibiotic stewardship (AS) guidance vs. usual care on antibiotic use in critically ill children.

Methods

Single center, pragmatic, randomized prospective clinical trial of critically ill children admitted to an ICU setting and started on intravenous antibiotics from February 15, 2018, to April 11, 2019. Patients were assigned on a monthly basis to either the procalcitonin or usual care arm. The procalcitonin arm had procalcitonin testing on hospital days 0, 1, 2, and 4 and stewardship assistance with algorithm result interpretation. Both arms had routine AS audit and feedback. The primary outcome was median antibiotic days of therapy per patient in the first 14-days after enrollment.

Results

Among 270 patients, 137 were in the procalcitonin arm and 133 in the usual care arm. Antibiotic days of therapy (DOT) were not significantly different between the procalcitonin arm (6.6, IQR: 3.1–10.9) and the usual care arm (7.6, IQR: 3–11.8; P = 0.37). More AS recommendations were made in the procalcitonin vs. control arm (54 vs. 37; P = 0.03). Adherence with algorithm-based antibiotic recommendations was high in the procalcitonin arm (70%).

Conclusions

We found no difference in antibiotic DOT between study arms. This trial was underpowered but demonstrates feasibility of using a procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment algorithm with AS audit and feedback in the PICU.

### Procalcitonin algorithm in critically ill adults with undifferentiated infection or suspected sepsis. A randomized controlled trial [^113WUC32]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Rationale

The role of procalcitonin (PCT), a widely used sepsis biomarker, in critically ill patients with sepsis is undetermined.

Objectives

To investigate the effect of a low PCT cut-off on antibiotic prescription and to describe the relationships between PCT plasma concentration and sepsis severity and mortality.

Methods

This was a multicenter (11 Australian intensive care units [ICUs]), prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial involving 400 patients with suspected bacterial infection/sepsis and expected to receive antibiotics and stay in ICU longer than 24 hours. The primary outcome was the cumulative number of antibiotics treatment days at Day 28.

Measurements and Main Results

PCT was measured daily while in the ICU. A PCT algorithm, including 0.1 ng/ml cut-off, determined antibiotic cessation. Published guidelines and antimicrobial stewardship were used in all patients. Primary analysis included 196 (PCT) versus 198 standard care patients. Ninety-three patients in each group had septic shock. The overall median (interquartile range) number of antibiotic treatment days were 9 (6–21) versus 11 (6–22), P = 0.58; in patients with positive pulmonary culture, 11 (7–27) versus 15 (8–27), P = 0.33; and in patients with septic shock, 9 (6–22) versus 11 (6–24), P = 0.64; with an overall 90-day all-cause mortality of 35 (18%) versus 31 (16%), P = 0.54 in the PCT versus standard care, respectively. Using logistic regression, adjusted for age, ventilation status, and positive culture, the decline rate in log(PCT) over the first 72 hours independently predicted hospital and 90-day mortality (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 2.76 [1.10–6.96], P = 0.03; 3.20 [1.30–7.89], P = 0.01, respectively).

Conclusions

In critically ill adults with undifferentiated infections, a PCT algorithm including 0.1 ng/ml cut-off did not achieve 25% reduction in duration of antibiotic treatment. Clinical trial registered with http://www.anzctr.org.au (ACTRN12610000809033).

### What procalcitonin brings to management of sepsis in the ICU [^117Vqiz8]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

In inflammatory states, particularly in response to infectious stimuli, local procalcitonin (PCT) production rises, and because these tissues cannot further process PCT into calcitonin, serum levels increase. In the critical care setting, PCT should be considered a useful tool to help physicians in some specific, although frequent, situations. Serial measurements of PCT levels may indicate the effectiveness of medical decisions such as the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy, the detection of new infections, and the exclusion of a diagnosis of sepsis. PCT-guided algorithms may also help to decrease the duration of antimicrobial therapy. However, the role of PCT as a prognostic marker in critically ill patients is controversial. In a study by Karlsson and colleagues, PCT concentrations did not differ between hospital survivors and nonsurvivors, but the outcome was better in patients whose PCT concentrations decreased more than 50%. The study of PCT kinetics thus could offer an individual risk assessment in patients with severe sepsis.

### Role of procalcitonin in the management of infected patients in the intensive care unit [^113jmKgo]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The combination of molecular pathogen diagnostics and the biomarker procalcitonin (PCT) are changing the use of antimicrobials in patients admitted to critical care units with severe community-acquired pneumonia, possible septic shock, or other clinical syndromes. An elevated serum PCT level is good supportive evidence of a bacterial pneumonia, whereas a low serum PCT level virtually eliminates an etiologic role for bacteria even if the culture for a potential bacterial pathogen is positive. Serum PCT levels can be increased in any shocklike state; a low PCT level eliminates invasive bacterial infection as an etiology in more than 90% of patients.

### Procalcitonin guidance of antibiotic therapy in community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized trial [^11585mQF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Rationale

In patients with community-acquired pneumonia, guidelines recommend antibiotic treatment for 7 to 21 d. Procalcitonin is elevated in bacterial infections, and its dynamics have prognostic implications.

Objective

To assess procalcitonin guidance for the initiation and duration of antibiotic therapy in community-acquired pneumonia.

Methods

In a randomized intervention trial, 302 consecutive patients with suspected community-acquired pneumonia were included. Data were assessed at baseline, after 4, 6, and 8 d, and after 6 wk. The control group (n = 151) received antibiotics according to usual practice. In the procalcitonin group (n = 151), antibiotic treatment was based on serum procalcitonin concentrations as follows: strongly discouraged, less than 0.1 microg/L; discouraged, less than 0.25 microg/L; encouraged, greater than 0.25 microg/L; strongly encouraged, greater than 0.5 microg/L. The primary endpoint was antibiotic use; secondary endpoints were measures of clinical, laboratory, and radiographic outcome.

Results

At baseline, both groups were similar regarding clinical, laboratory, and microbiology characteristics, and Pneumonia Severity Index. Procalcitonin guidance reduced total antibiotic exposure (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.55; p < 0.001), antibiotic prescriptions on admission (85 vs. 99%; p < 0.001), and antibiotic treatment duration (median, 5 vs. 12 d; p < 0.001) compared with patients treated according to guidelines. After adjustment for Pneumonia Severity Index, the hazard ratio of antibiotic discontinuation was higher in the procalcitonin group than in the control group (3.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.5 to 4.2). Outcome was similar in both groups, with an overall success rate of 83%.

Conclusions

Procalcitonin guidance substantially reduces antibiotic use in community-acquired pneumonia. These findings may have important clinical and public health implications.

### Procalcitonin as a biomarker in respiratory tract infection [^1142DjwD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels rapidly increase in patients with invasive bacterial disease. PCT levels increase faster than do C-reactive protein levels. Furthermore, a rapid decrease in the PCT level is supporting evidence that the source of the bacterial infection is responding to clinical management. In patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, sequential PCT levels are useful as a guide to shorter courses of antimicrobial therapy. With use of emerging multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction platforms for the detection of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens, it should be possible to critically assess whether an elevated serum PCT level is a valid biomarker of invasive bacterial infection.

### How to use… procalcitonin [^112cARrw]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnosing bacterial infection in the unwell or febrile child is a common challenge faced by all paediatricians. Despite the advent of novel molecular techniques, there is ongoing need for diagnostic assays with adequate performance and turnaround time to facilitate safe clinical decision-making when bacterial sepsis is suspected, such as whether to commence empirical treatment with antibiotics. Procalcitonin is an established marker of infection that has a potential role in the diagnosis and exclusion of serious or invasive bacterial infection in neonates and children. Although enthusiastically adopted in many countries and institutions, national guidance in the UK does not yet support its routine use. This article reviews the relevant literature on the use of procalcitonin measurement in common paediatric clinical scenarios.

### Procalcitonin [^114n33b3]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Procalcitonin (PCT) is the 116 amino acid precursor of the hormone calcitonin, produced by the C cells of the thyroid. Its synthesis is upregulated in bacterial infection and downregulated by viral infection. Consequently, with the increasing development of antibiotic resistance, interest has focused on the ability of this marker to not only diagnose infection but to tailor antibiotic treatment and help reduce the development of antibiotic resistance. The value of PCT depends on the specific clinical situation and pretest probability of disease. This article discusses the role of PCT in these different situations, namely primary care, the emergency department and the intensive care unit. The true cost effectiveness of this test remains difficult to prove as evidence for the potential impact of using PCT on slowing the development of bacterial resistance remains largely circumstantial.

### Neglected variables in the interpretation of serum procalcitonin levels in patients with septic shock [^113PR4W4]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The interpretation of serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels in septic patients is facilitated by reviewing the known stimuli that activate the PCT family of genes. Herein we describe 7 pathways that, alone or in combination, can increase serum PCT levels. As a marker of activation of innate immunity, high PCT levels affect clinical diagnosis, can be trended as a measure of "source" control, and can guide duration of antibacterial therapy in septic patients. Low PCT levels reflect little to no activation of an innate immune response, influence the differential diagnosis, and support the discontinuation of empiric antibiotic therapy. Understanding the pathways that result in elevated serum PCT levels is necessary for interpretation and subsequent clinical management.

Conclusion

PCT-guided AB therapy may be associated with reduced AB use, lower 28-day mortality but higher infection recurrence, with similar ICU and hospital length of stay. Our results render the need for better designed studies investigating the role of PCT-guided AB stewardship in critically ill patients.

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in two emergency departments with rapid procalcitonin [^116XSJXh]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread, discussion around the appropriate use of antibiotics in these patients has evolved. Initially, treatment guidelines for COVID-19 recommended empiric antibiotic usage, especially among those with severe disease. However, a systematic review indicated that, on average, 72% of COVID-19 patients received antibiotic therapy yet only 8% of patients had microbiologically confirmed coinfections. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends antibiotics only for patients with moderate COVID-19 and a suspected bacterial infection.

Although the available data indicate overuse of antibiotics in COVID-19 patients, available reports lack sufficient detail (eg, timing of administration and clinical scenario) to properly evaluate appropriateness. In response to this gap in the literature, we conducted a detailed analysis of antibiotic prescribing patterns for a cohort of emergency department (ED) patients confirmed to have symptomatic COVID-19. Our primary objectives were to improve characterization of ED-based antibiotic prescribing and to assess the real-world effectiveness of procalcitonin (PCT) testing as a stewardship intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock

Sepsis, as defined by SIRS criteria and organ dysfunction, and septic shock are common diseases in the ICU and require fast and appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Multiple studies have investigated whether a PCT-guided algorithm can optimize the therapeutic approach in these patients, mainly by monitoring PCT kinetics and stopping antibiotics once PCT has dropped to levels < 0.5 ng/ml or by at least 80–90% of the peak in combination with clinical improvement. A 2013 meta-analysis including 1075 patients with sepsis or septic shock found overall reduced antibiotic treatment courses (6 days versus 8 days) when PCT was used to guide therapy compared to routine care. There was no increase in 28-day or in-hospital mortality or in length of stay in the ICU or the hospital. The authors do stress that there was heterogeneity in PCT protocols across trials with regard to different cut-off values or different algorithms for medical or surgical patients. A large RCT published in 2016 in the Netherlands evaluated the use of PCT to de-escalate and stop antibiotics in 1575 critically ill patients who had received antibiotics < 24 h before inclusion in the study for an assumed or proven infection. The study found that the PCT-guided protocol shortened length of antibiotic treatment (5 days versus 7 days in the first 28 days of admission) and lowered 28-day mortality from 25 to 19.6%. Although the cause of the reduced mortality remained unclear, a lower risk of antibiotic-associated side effects and improved therapeutic monitoring could have been factors. Very similar results in a recently published RCT from Germany also found a lower antibiotic consumption using PCT, but no benefit in mortality.

### Effect of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment on clinical outcomes in intensive care unit patients with infection and sepsis patients: a patient-level meta-analysis of randomized trials [^1119bz3j]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, remains a major healthcare problem worldwide and affects millions of people each year. Early identification and appropriate initial management including the start of antibiotic treatment and fluid resuscitation improves outcomes. In addition, monitoring of patients during treatment both for timely escalation of therapy in case of treatment failure and de-escalation in case of a favorable treatment response has an important impact on patient recovery. This also includes early de-escalation or cessation of antibiotic treatment once a patient's condition has stabilized, with signs indicating progression towards the resolution of infection.

Given that clinical signs for monitoring patients with sepsis can be ambiguous, the use of additional biomarkers mirroring specific physiopathological pathways has been proposed. In this context, serum procalcitonin (PCT) has emerged as a sensitive biomarker that provides prognostic information in patients with infections, and thus may improve sepsis management. Multiple studies have demonstrated that PCT levels increase in response to bacterial infection and decrease during recovery. Reflecting the host response to a bacterial infection, PCT thus provides important adjunctive information in addition to traditional clinical and diagnostic parameters.

Multiple trials have investigated the benefits of using serum PCT levels to guide whether and for how long antibiotic therapy is used — a process referred to as PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship — in patients with infection in the intensive care unit (ICU). While most trials have focused on the effects of PCT guidance on antibiotic usage, a recent large trial from the Netherlands reported lower mortality following PCT-guided therapy. However, conclusive evidence on the safety of this approach across different types of infection and sepsis severities has been limited due to largely insufficient statistical power in most of the individual trials. Moreover, meta-analyses focusing on the impact of PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship in sepsis patients on clinical outcomes overall and within patient subgroups based on infection type and severity have been inconclusive. A noteworthy limitation of these meta-analyses was that they were based on aggregate data, limiting opportunities to harmonize outcome definitions among trials and to investigate the impact of PCT guidance in different patient subgroups.

To address this significant drawback of earlier meta-analyses, we performed a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 11 randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the safety of using PCT to guide antibiotic decisions in ICU patients with infection and different sepsis severities and with the involvement of different organs.

### Using procalcitonin to guide antimicrobial duration in sepsis: asking the same questions will not bring different answers [^112em5az]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

What becomes clearer from current studies in sepsis

Several systematic reviews have addressed the issue of PCT-guided therapy. Prkno and colleagues focused on critically ill patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. By doing so, they cleverly avoided biases related to the heterogeneity of studied patients, specifically the wide variation of severity that may exist between infected individuals (for example, from mild to severe community-acquired pneumonia). Using these inclusion criteria, seven randomized clinical trials were enrolled, totaling 1,075 patients. As their main conclusions, Prkno and colleagues provide a clear message for ICU physicians: we can safely reduce the duration of antimicrobial therapy in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock using PCT-guided protocols (hazard ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.53). Nevertheless, the authors acknowledge the many limitations of their study (for example, heterogeneity of PCT protocols) and emphasize that further information on major outcomes, such as length of stay and mortality, is required from future studies.

### Procalcitonin-guided therapy in intensive care unit patients with severe sepsis and septic shock – a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112F3i1J]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Key messages

- A PCT-guided treatment reduces the duration of antimicrobial therapy in severe sepsis patients, without increasing 28-day and in-hospital mortality rates

- Recommendations for PCT-guided treatment algorithms for treatment of severe sepsis patients differ substantially among published studies

- Future studies have to show which PCT-guided treatment algorithms could be recommended in severe sepsis patients

### Do we need new trials of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy? [^1112Lddr]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Are PCT limitations addressed?

In addition, another important limitation of PCT use is related to the lack of information on specific conditions and populations where its value is inadequate because of intrinsic constraints. In critically ill patients the presence of acute kidney injury or the use of renal replacement therapies has a profound effect on PCT concentrations. Additionally, PCT tends to be less responsive to repeated inflammatory insults (such as VAP or nosocomial bloodstream infections), resulting in lower than expected peak concentrations. Similar findings are described in neutropenic patients, limiting the interpretation and use of PCT in this context.

### Prognostic value of procalcitonin in respiratory tract infections across clinical settings [^114PPoxG]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

According to these studies, our findings are generally congruent. In low-risk patients (primary care) with respiratory infections, low PCT levels < 0.1 μg/L correctly identified patients at lower risk for treatment failure with a high NPV. In higher-risk populations (CAP, ICU), increased levels of PCT had high PPV mainly for mortality prediction. In ED patients and in patients with lower ARIs, PCT was a good predictor of treatment failure and mortality.

Nonetheless, several limitations should be considered when interpreting our results. First, we carried out a secondary analysis of a meta-analysis. It was designed to focus on a different question, that is, whether using PCT to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with ARIs in primary care, ED and ICUs is safe and efficient in a broader patient population. Second, we did not investigate the effect of repeated measurements that might add supplementary prognostic information to admission levels. Third, we focused only on interventional trials as specified in the meta-analysis protocol and did not include any observational data that would potentially allow for larger sample sizes in the different subgroups and increases in the patient spectrum, as in observational studies less rigorous exclusion criteria usually apply. Fourth, we focused on adverse outcomes as specified in the original trials, but we were not able to look into some adverse outcomes, such as septic shock and respiratory failure, among others. Fifth, clinical risk scores such as CURB-65 and PSI for CAP and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation for ICU patients were not routinely available and thus were not included in this analysis. Similarly, we were not able to obtain more detailed baseline data on all patients, including comorbidities and other risk factors, which would have allowed a more rigorous adjustment in the statistical models. Although this study provides new and clinically relevant information about the prognostic value of initial admission PCT values in different clinical setting and for different upper and lower ARIs, it remains unclear whether an improved initial prognostic assessment based on PCT level would translate into better triage decisions and outcomes in patients. Sixth, randomised controlled outcome studies need to be conducted for patients with ARIs in the ED and ICU to investigate whether real-life measurement of PCT adds useful prognostic information and thereby improves the daily clinical management and outcomes of patients.

### Procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in acute respiratory infections: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^112VonRo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis of 14 trials found no increased risk for mortality or treatment failure when PCT was used to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with ARI compared with control patients. The upper boundary of the 95% CI for treatment failure of.97 makes more frequent treatment failures with PCT unlikely. For mortality, however, the relatively wide CI does not exclude a 23% relative increase in odds with the PCT approach. This may correspond to an absolute risk increase for mortality of 1% in the ED setting, assuming an event rate of 4.5%, and an absolute risk increase of 4% in the ICU setting, assuming an event rate of 23.8%. The remaining uncertainty associated with the mortality estimate for ICU patients calls for further research in this high-risk patient population. Due to the low adherence to PCT protocols in the ICU setting, we performed a number of sensitivity analyses to investigate whether excluding ICU data would affect our overall findings and found similar results in all such analyses. In terms of efficacy, we found a consistent reduction of antibiotic use in PCT groups, mainly due to lower prescription rates in primary care (predominantly among patients with upper ARI and bronchitis), and lower duration of antibiotic courses in ED and ICU patients (with CAP and VAP).

Because we included a patient population ranging from primary care to ICU, we adapted the definition of treatment failure to clinical settings by including setting-specific and clinically relevant components in this composite outcome. This may challenge the clinical interpretation in the overall analysis but lead to a better interpretation of patient risk in respective prespecified subgroups. We found lower rates of treatment failure for patients allocated to the PCT group overall, in the ED setting, and in CAP patients. Different sensitivity analyses confirmed this finding. There are 3 potential explanations:

1. PCT appears to provide additional useful information which can influence decision making in areas such as consideration of safe and early discharge.

2. In control groups, treatment failures may be related to prolonged antibiotic exposure and risk for secondary complications and rehospitalization.

3. The finding turned out to be statistically significant by chance.

Considering the marginally nonsignificant result with the alternate definition, we would like to conservatively interpret this finding (ie, it is unlikely that PCT guidance increases treatment failures).

### Effect of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment on clinical outcomes in intensive care unit patients with infection and sepsis patients: a patient-level meta-analysis of randomized trials [^116u51ZJ]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, PCT-guided antibiotic treatment in ICU patients with infection results in improved survival and shorter antibiotic treatment duration. Effects were similar in sepsis patients and among subgroups based on sepsis severity, sepsis treatment modalities, and type of infection. Whether the reduction in antibiotic exposure fully explains the mortality effects seen in our data needs to be investigated in future trials. These findings have substantial clinical and public health implications.

### Procalcitonin for diagnosis of infection and guide to antibiotic decisions: past, present and future [^1141Dggq]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Arguably, the most important (over-) use of antibiotics occurs in primary care. As many as 75% of patients with upper and lower respiratory infections receive antibiotics, despite the mostly viral origin of the condition. Two multicenter primary care trials, powered for non-inferiority of clinical outcomes, investigated the safety and feasibility of PCT guided algorithms in patients with upper and lower respiratory infections, essentially relying on an initial PCT measurement only. Both trials found substantial reductions in antibiotic exposure (by 75% and 42%), and similar clinical outcomes, particularly a similar time to recovery.

In more high risk patients in the ICU setting, different trials have investigated the use of PCT, mainly for discontinuation of antibiotics. The first small proof of concept study found a four-day reduction in the duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with severe sepsis, but only in the per protocol analysis. A subsequent large multicenter trial in France recently validated this concept in more than 600 patients. PCT guided patients had similar 30-day mortality rates and similar rates of relapses, but markedly more antibiotic-free days alive (14.3 versus 11.6). Another multinational ICU study focused on ventilator-associated pneumonia and found that PCT guidance resulted in a higher number of antibiotic free-days alive (13 versus 9.5 days). Two German studies assessed the effect of PCT guidance in surgical ICU patients with suspected bacterial infections in the post-operative course. PCT guidance resulted in a significant reduction of antibiotic therapy and similar medical outcomes. In addition, the length of intensive care treatment in the PCT-guided group was significantly shorter than that in the control group (15.5 versus 17.7 days), a finding similar to the first ICU study. Importantly, the use of PCT for discontinuation of antibiotics in ICU patients is still limited by a relatively small number of patients included in previous trials and awaits further large-scale validation. There are currently different ongoing trials focusing on this vulnerable patient population that should shed further light on the benefits and harms of PCT use in ICU patients.

### Procalcitonin algorithm to guide initial antibiotic therapy in acute exacerbations of COPD admitted to the ICU: a randomized multicenter study [^116DMidg]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPDs) are a leading cause of admission to medical intensive care units (ICUs). Prompt initiation of antibiotics is recommended in this setting despite the fact that bacteria are found to be the cause of disease in only approximatively 50% of cases. COPD exacerbations can be triggered by other factors, such as viruses, allergens and common pollutants. However, in clinical practice, the signs and symptoms of bacterial and non-bacterial AECOPDs overlap. Therefore, identifying the patients with severe AECOPDs who are most likely to benefit from antibiotics remains a challenge for physicians focused on reducing the frequency and duration of antibiotic treatment to prevent the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in the ICU. Procalcitonin (PCT) is considered useful for determining the likelihood that patients will develop bacterial infections in emergency settings. PCT-based strategies have been shown to substantially and safely reduce antibiotic use in patients without severe lower respiratory tract infections, community-acquired pneumonia or AECOPDs. However, data on the efficacy and safety of PCT-based strategies in critically ill patients are scarce. Previous studies regarding this issue showed that PCT-guided strategies reduced antibiotic exposure without causing adverse outcomes in heterogeneous groups of patients with suspected severe bacterial infections.

We hypothesized that the use of PCT reduces antibiotic exposure while not affecting or even lowering mortality. We compared 3-month mortality and in-ICU and in-hospital antibiotic use between groups of patients with severe AECOPDs who were admitted to the ICU whose antibiotic therapy was guided by a serum PCT protocol or current guidelines. The preliminary results of this study were presented at the Congrès REANIMATION 2017 (Submission reference 000533), Paris, France, January 2017.

### Prognostic value of procalcitonin in respiratory tract infections across clinical settings [^114ZNueS]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Key messages

We found an increase in PCT levels across the clinical settings and ARI diagnoses, supporting the current practice of using specific PCT cutoff levels in different clinical settings.
PCT levels are significantly associated with treatment failure and mortality in the overall population.
The prognostic information of initial PCT levels in primary care and ICU patients is rather low, whereas admission PCT levels provide important prognostic information in the ED setting and in patients with low to moderate ARIs.

### Procalcitonin decrease over 72 hours in US critical care units predicts fatal outcome in sepsis patients [^113Bh8Jt]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This analysis found that PCT kinetics over the first 72 hours of critical care provided prognostic information about ICU mortality and in-hospital mortality in patients with confirmed or likely sepsis independent of state-of-the-art initial clinical severity scores in two US settings, thereby extending observations of previous European studies. Further investigation is needed to validate these findings more definitively and to show whether monitoring PCT will improve patient outcomes and health care resource use.

### Procalcitonin-guided therapy in intensive care unit patients with severe sepsis and septic shock – a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111SQ4d9]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

The systematic review was performed following current guidelines and is reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement.

Literature search and data extraction

Two reviewers (AP, CW) independently performed a systematic search in the databases Medline via PubMed, Excerpta Medica database (Embase), ISI Web of Knowledge including the databases Web of Science, Journal Citation Reports and Science Citation Index (SCI). Furthermore, searches in BioMed Central, ScienceDirect and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were continued. To identify unpublished or ongoing studies and to obtain the study protocols we searched two further websites (and). The following keywords or medical subject headings (MeSH) were used: "procalcitonin" or "PCT" combined with "sepsis" or "SIRS" or "systemic inflammatory response syndrome" or "bacterial infection". All databases had been searched up to 14 June 2013.

All primary intervention studies were included that compared PCT-guided therapy with standard care according to current guidelines that met the following inclusion criteria: 1) studies that assessed the efficacy of a treatment algorithm based on procalcitonin; 2) studies that had a well-defined standard for the target condition (severe sepsis), which included the use of definitions according to the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP)/Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) Consensus Conference and the German Sepsis Society; and 3) studies that provided sufficient information to calculate the relative risk (RR) together with 95% CI or the hazard ratio (HR) together with 95% CI respectively.

Eligible studies had to be randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) or prospective cohort studies. Studies dealing with neonates were excluded, because of considerable differences in diagnosis, course and therapy of sepsis compared to adults. The published language was not restricted. Disagreements of judgment and inclusion of studies were solved by consensus.

Data were extracted using a structured data collection sheet including the following items: authors and year of study, design, setting, diagnosis, procalcitonin test, randomization, number and characteristics of participants, interventions, outcomes, duration, availability of study protocol, and country. Primary outcomes of this meta-analysis were 28-day mortality and hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were duration of antimicrobial therapy, length of stay in the ICU and length of stay in the hospital. If additional information was needed, the authors of the studies were contacted by Email. Eligible studies with insufficient data for calculation or missing replies from the authors were excluded.

### Prognostic value of procalcitonin in respiratory tract infections across clinical settings [^1125BmUi]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The assessment of disease severity and prediction of adverse outcome in patients with acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) is essential to improve patient management, including therapeutic and diagnostic steps and site-of-care decisions [1–3]. For this purpose, different blood biomarkers have been evaluated to predict mortality in smaller patient cohorts and critically ill patients, but results are still somewhat controversial in regard to type of biomarker for specific ARI subpopulation and optimal cutoff levels for clinical routine [4–10].

Procalcitonin (PCT), a precursor protein of calcitonin, is currently one of the most frequently used infectious disease biomarkers in clinical practice. PCT levels mirror severity and evolution of infection and are thought to be associated with poor prognosis in patients with sepsis and ARI. Changes in PCT level in response to therapeutic treatment have also been reported, which suggests prognostic significance in a variety of clinical settings. However, there is a lack of clinical data comparing PCT in different clinical settings (primary care, emergency department (ED), intensive care unit (ICU)) and across ARI diagnoses to aid in better understanding its (prognostic) value in daily clinical practice.

In the present study, we investigated the prognostic value of admission PCT levels to predict treatment failure and mortality alone in a large ARI patient population across different settings, ARI diagnoses and countries by performing an individual patient data meta-analysis.

Conclusion

An approach along a biomarker-guided treatment algorithm using procalcitonin levels may be helpful to guide antimicrobial treatment in severe sepsis patients, treated in ICUs and reduces the duration of antimicrobial therapy without an obvious increase in mortality. However, more research is urgently needed to investigate the safety and effectiveness in subgroups of surgical and medical severe sepsis patients, treated in ICUs. Most importantly, treatment algorithms differ substantially and have to be clarified in future studies.

### Implementing an antibiotic stewardship program: guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [^1116jHVR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Procalcitonin (PCT)–guided discontinuation in critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients is supported by several prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with trials reporting significantly more antibiotic-free days (2–4 days) in the PCT arm without a mortality signal. A meta-analysis in ICU patients with severe sepsis or septic shock (including 7 studies and 1075 patients) found no significant difference in 28-day or hospital mortality and a median reduction of approximately 2 days in antibiotic duration with PCT guidance. In a European multicenter study of 621 septic patients, the PCT group had 2.7 more antibiotic-free days (P < .001), with antibiotic exposure per 1000 inpatient-days of 653 PCT vs 812 control.

Procalcitonin-guided discontinuation of antimicrobials — evidence and recommendation: In patients with sepsis, direct evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials (n = 4,499 patients) assessed procalcitonin to guide treatment duration and a meta-analysis showed improved mortality with procalcitonin versus control (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99) with no effect on length of stay; antibiotic exposure was consistently lower with procalcitonin, although in many trials the total duration was still 7 days or longer, algorithms and thresholds varied, and the overall quality of evidence was judged low; undesirable effects were considered minimal, cost data are limited with one single-center study reporting decreased hospital costs with PCT-guided antibiotic, and testing may not be available in all settings, including LMICs; based on apparent benefit and no obvious undesirable effects, we suggest using procalcitonin along with clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antimicrobials in adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, if the optimal duration of therapy is unclear and if procalcitonin is available.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^117SdwAz]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in adult ICU patients are discussed for diagnostic accuracy and antibiotic stewardship. The diagnostic accuracy and specificity of PCT are higher than those of CRP, although further studies are needed to define the optimal cutoff points for PCT and CRP and the diagnostic indexes in different disease stages. Several RCTs have demonstrated that PCT-based algorithms safely reduce antibiotic use in stable, low-risk patients with respiratory infections, and in ICU patients with suspected sepsis, clinicians should not initially withhold antibiotics, but PCT levels of less than 0.5 μg/L or levels that decrease by greater than or equal to 80% from peak levels may guide antibiotic discontinuation once patients stabilize. The Stop Antibiotics on Procalcitonin Guidance Study demonstrated a reduction in both antibiotic exposure and mortality in critically ill patients, and a meta-analysis of 11 RCTs involving 4,482 patients reported that PCT-guided antibiotic treatment in ICU patients with infection and sepsis patients resulted in improved survival and lower antibiotic treatment duration. The latest and largest systematic review and meta-analysis to date of 16 studies and greater than5000 patients showed that PCT-guided antibiotic discontinuation appeared to decrease antibiotic utilization by 1 day and improve mortality, but support for their findings was tempered by low-certainty evidence and the majority of the PCT trials excluded severely immunocompromised patients. In summary, PCT and CRP provide only supportive and complementary information to clinical assessment, and decisions on initiating, altering, or discontinuing antimicrobial therapy should not be made solely based on changes in PCT or CRP levels.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^114rvATp]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis and septic shock — procalcitonin-guided discontinuation of antimicrobials is supported by evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs; n = 4,499 patients) assessing use of procalcitonin to guide duration, with a meta-analysis reporting improved mortality (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99) and no effect on length of stay in ICU or hospital; antibiotic exposure was consistently lower though in many trials the total duration of therapy was still 7 days or longer, and the overall quality of evidence was judged to be low. Based on apparent benefit and no obvious undesirable effects, we suggest using procalcitonin along with clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antimicrobials in adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, if the optimal duration of therapy is unclear and if procalcitonin is available.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^114z2U45]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Biomarkers to start antibiotics — procalcitonin: For adults with suspected sepsis or septic shock, we suggest against using procalcitonin plus clinical evaluation to decide when to start antimicrobials, as compared to clinical evaluation alone (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In a meta-analysis of 30 studies (3,244 patients), procalcitonin had a pooled sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 79% for sepsis in critically ill patients, but a meta-analysis of three RCTs (n = 1,769 ICU patients) comparing procalcitonin-guided initiation vs usual care found no difference in short-term mortality (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.15), length of ICU stays (MD, 0.19 days; 95% CI, -0.98 to 1.36), or length of hospitalization (MD, 7.00 days; 95% CI, -26.24 to 12.24), and long-term mortality, readmission rates, and hospital-free days were not reported in any of the trials.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115gxt2B]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) — procalcitonin as a decision aid is limited; a recent study in hospitalized patients with CAP failed to identify a procalcitonin threshold that discriminated between viral and bacterial pathogens, and the reported sensitivity of procalcitonin to detect bacterial infection ranges from 38% to 91%, underscoring that this test alone cannot be used to justify withholding antibiotics from patients with CAP; although some patients with low procalcitonin levels have CAP and have been safely treated without antibiotics, these represent small subgroups, raising concerns about the safety of widely using such a strategy.

Use of procalcitonin (PCT) to decide whether to initiate antibiotics in suspected HAP/VAP: For patients with suspected HAP/VAP, we recommend using clinical criteria alone, rather than using serum PCT plus clinical criteria, to decide whether or not to initiate antibiotic therapy (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^115915z1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Procalcitonin (PCT) plus clinical criteria — diagnostic accuracy and panel stance for suspected HAP/VAP indicate high misclassification and no survival benefit from a PCT-guided escalation protocol. The false-negative and false-positive rates of serum PCT testing plus clinical criteria are 33% and 17%, respectively; assuming a prevalence of HAP/VAP of 50%, then for every 1000 patients with suspected HAP/VAP who are evaluated with serum PCT plus clinical criteria, 165 patients (16.5%) would be incorrectly diagnosed as not having HAP/VAP and 85 patients (8.5%) will be incorrectly diagnosed as having HAP/VAP. A recent trial randomized ICU patients to a PCT-guided antibiotic escalation protocol vs standard of care showed that the PCT-guided protocol did not result in survival improvement, but resulted in a higher number of ventilator-days and prolonged ICU stay. The panel agreed that the frequency of such undesirable consequences due to misleading PCT results was unacceptable and, therefore, recommended not using PCT to guide antibiotic initiation.

### Strategies for reduction in duration of antibiotic use in hospitalized patients [^117MQV8W]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

There is a global crisis of antibiotic resistance in part because of the collateral damage of antibiotic use. Reduction in antibiotic consumption is clearly important to minimize this problem. Limiting treatment duration may be the most clinically palatable means of reducing antibiotic consumption. Antimicrobial stewardship programs play an important role in this process. Their effectiveness may be increased by drawing on evidence from randomized controlled trials regarding optimal antibiotic duration. However, in most clinical scenarios, the recommended duration of therapy in published guidelines is based on expert opinion. Biological markers, such as procalcitonin, have been shown to reduce antimicrobial consumption with no adverse outcome in 11 randomized controlled trials. Although procalcitonin may not be the perfect biomarker, the concept of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic discontinuation after clinical stabilization, in conjunction with antimicrobial stewardship programs, appears to be ready for introduction into clinical practice.

### Procalcitonin-guided duration of antibiotic treatment in children hospitalised with confirmed or suspected bacterial infection in the UK (BATCH): a pragmatic, multicentre, open-label, two-arm, individually randomised, controlled trial [^117ES47K]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

Procalcitonin is a rapid response biomarker specific for bacterial infection, which is not routinely used in the UK National Health Service. We aimed to assess whether using a procalcitonin-guided algorithm would safely reduce the duration of antibiotic therapy compared with usual care, in which C-reactive protein is the commonly used biomarker.

Methods

The BATCH trial was a pragmatic, multicentre, open-label, parallel, two-arm, individually randomised, controlled trial conducted in 15 hospitals in England and Wales. Children aged 72 h to 18 years who were admitted to hospital and were being treated with intravenous antibiotics for suspected or confirmed bacterial infection and who were expected to remain on intravenous antibiotics for more than 48 h were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either current clinical management alone (usual care group) or clinical management with the addition of a procalcitonin test guided algorithm (procalcitonin group). Participants were randomly assigned by minimisation, with site and age group (0–6 months, 6 months to 2 years, 2–5 years, and older than 5 years) as minimisation factors and a random element to reduce predictability. Participants were randomly assigned remotely using a secure 24 h web-based randomisation programme. The coprimary outcomes were duration of intravenous antibiotic use, assessed for superiority, and a composite safety measure, assessed for non-inferiority (non-inferiority margin 5%). The primary analysis sample for each coprimary endpoint included all randomly assigned participants with available outcome data. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry, ISRCTN11369832.

Findings

Between June 11, 2018, and Oct 12, 2022, 15282 children were screened for eligibility, 1949 of whom were randomly assigned to receive procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy (n = 977) or usual care (n = 972). The median intravenous antibiotic duration was 96.0 h (IQR 59.5–155.5) in the procalcitonin group and 99.7 h (61.2–153.8) in the usual care group (hazard ratio 0.96 [95% CI 0.87–1.05]). 78 (9%) of 917 participants in the procalcitonin group and 85 (9%) of 904 participants in the usual care group had at least one event covered by the composite safety outcome measure (estimated adjusted risk difference -0.81% [95% CI upper bound 1.11]).

Interpretation

In children with suspected or confirmed bacterial infection admitted to hospitals in England and Wales for intravenous antibiotic treatment of at least 48 h, the introduction of a procalcitonin-guided algorithm did not reduce duration of intravenous antibiotics treatment and is non-inferior to usual care for safety outcomes. Therefore, evidence does not support the use of procalcitonin-guided algorithms where robust effective paediatric antibiotic stewardship programmes are established.

### Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy may shorten length of treatment and may improve survival-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112HBHNb]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Appropriate antibiotic (AB) therapy remains a challenge in the intensive care unit (ICU). Procalcitonin (PCT)-guided AB stewardship could help optimize AB treatment and decrease AB-related adverse effects, but firm evidence is still lacking. Our aim was to compare the effects of PCT-guided AB therapy with standard of care (SOC) in critically ill patients.

Methods

We searched databases CENTRAL, Embase and Medline. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PCT-guided AB therapy (PCT group) with SOC reporting on length of AB therapy, mortality, recurrent and secondary infection, ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS or healthcare costs. Due to recent changes in sepsis definitions, subgroup analyses were performed in studies applying the Sepsis-3 definition. In the statistical analysis, a random-effects model was used to pool effect sizes.

Results

We included 26 RCTs (n = 9048 patients) in the quantitative analysis. In comparison with SOC, length of AB therapy was significantly shorter in the PCT group (MD -1.79 days, 95% CI: -2.65, -0.92) and was associated with a significantly lower 28-day mortality (OR 0.84, 95% CI: 0.74, 0.95). In Sepsis-3 patients, mortality benefit was more pronounced (OR 0.46 95% CI: 0.27, 0.79). Odds of recurrent infection were significantly higher in the PCT group (OR 1.36, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.68), but there was no significant difference in the odds of secondary infection (OR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.54, 1.21), ICU and hospital length of stay (MD -0.67 days 95% CI: -1.76, 0.41 and MD -1.23 days, 95% CI: -3.13, 0.67, respectively).

Conclusions

PCT-guided AB therapy may be associated with reduced AB use, lower 28-day mortality but higher infection recurrence, with similar ICU and hospital length of stay. Our results render the need for better designed studies investigating the role of PCT-guided AB stewardship in critically ill patients.

### Benefits and harms of procalcitonin-or C-reactive protein-guided antimicrobial discontinuation in critically ill adults with sepsis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114HW2MX]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

In sepsis treatment, antibiotics are crucial, but overuse risks development of antibiotic resistance. Recent guidelines recommended the use of procalcitonin to guide antibiotic cessation, but solid evidence is insufficient. Recently, concerns were raised that this strategy would increase recurrence. Additionally, optimal protocol or difference from the commonly used C-reactive protein (CRP) are uncertain. We aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of procalcitonin- or CRP-guided antibiotic cessation strategies with standard of care in sepsis.

Data Sources

A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, Igaku Chuo Zasshi, ClinicalTrials.gov, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Platform.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials involving adults with sepsis in intensive care.

Data Extraction

A systematic review with network meta-analyses was performed. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Developments, and Evaluation method was used to assess certainty.

Data Synthesis

Eighteen studies involving 5023 participants were included. Procalcitonin-guided and CRP-guided strategies shortened antibiotic treatment (-1.89 days [95% CI, -2.30 to -1.47], -2.56 days [95% CI, -4.21 to -0.91]) with low- to moderate-certainty evidence. In procalcitonin-guided strategies, this benefit was consistent even in subsets with shorter baseline antimicrobial duration (7–10 d) or in Sepsis-3, and more pronounced in procalcitonin cutoff of "0.5 μg/L and 80% reduction". No benefit was observed when monitoring frequency was less than half of the initial 10 days. Procalcitonin-guided strategies lowered mortality (-27 per 1000 participants [95% CI, -45 to -7]) and this was pronounced in Sepsis-3, but CRP-guided strategies led to no difference in mortality. Recurrence did not increase significantly with either strategy (very low to low certainty).

Conclusions

In sepsis, procalcitonin- or CRP-guided antibiotic discontinuation strategies may be beneficial and safe. In particular, the usefulness of procalcitonin guidance for current Sepsis-3, where antimicrobials are used for more than 7 days, was supported. Well-designed studies are needed focusing on monitoring protocol and recurrence.

### Procalcitonin for triage of patients with respiratory tract symptoms: a case study in the trial design process for approval of a new diagnostic test for lower respiratory tract infections [^1136cLjM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Symptoms of cough, fever, chest pain, and shortness of breath are common reasons that patients seek medical care, and they can be due to a variety of medical conditions, including lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Only a small proportion of these patients will actually have a bacterial etiology, but many will receive antibiotic treatment because physicians cannot readily determine the etiology at the time of presentation. Current diagnostic methodologies are not sensitive or specific enough to reliably distinguish bacterial from viral or noninfectious etiologies. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a marker of host response. PCT serum levels are elevated in patients with bacterial infection, compared with levels in those with viral infections or other inflammatory pulmonary conditions. Studies have suggested that the determination of PCT levels can identify a subset of patients with LRTI symptoms who can safely avoid antibiotic treatment. As with any new test, clinical trials are necessary to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the test to obtain U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance. However, in the absence of standard reference methods for comparison that are reliably sensitive and specific, meeting the regulatory requirements for proof of safety and efficacy is a major challenge. Additional challenges include the choice of study design, the definition and determination of end points, and the justification of statistical analysis.

### Procalcitonin as a marker of severe bacterial infection in children in the emergency department [^116q4wBg]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Procalcitonin, the prohormone of calcitonin, is a relatively new and innovative marker of bacterial infection that has multiple potential applications in the pediatric emergency department. In healthy individuals, circulating levels of procalcitonin are generally very low (< 0.05 ng/mL), but in the setting of severe bacterial infection and sepsis, levels can increase by hundreds to thousands of fold within 4 to 6 hours. Although the exact physiologic function of procalcitonin has not been determined, the consistent response and rapid rise of this protein in the setting of severe bacterial infection make procalcitonin a very useful biomarker for invasive bacterial disease. In Europe, serum procalcitonin measurements are frequently used in the diagnosis and the management of patients in a variety of clinical settings. To date, the use of procalcitonin has been limited in the United States, but this valuable biomarker has many potential applications in both the pediatric emergency department and the intensive care unit. The intent of this article is to review the history of procalcitonin, describe the kinetics of the molecule in response to bacterial infection, describe the laboratory methods available for measuring procalcitonin, examine the main causes of procalcitonin elevation, and evaluate the potential applications of procalcitonin measurements in pediatric patients.

### Effect of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment on clinical outcomes in intensive care unit patients with infection and sepsis patients: a patient-level meta-analysis of randomized trials [^114LH1dT]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This meta-analysis of individual patient data from 11 randomized trials that included 4482 patients with infection treated in ICUs revealed lower mortality associated with PCT-guided therapy, confirming the results of a large Dutch trial. This effect was consistent in sepsis patients based on the sepsis 3 definition, and across different severities and types of sepsis based on whether PCT-guided treatment was employed, and also across different types of infection. Moreover, PCT guidance was also associated with a modest reduction in exposure to antibiotics through shorter treatment durations and earlier discontinuation. However, PCT guidance did not have an effect on length of ICU or hospital stay.

Early diagnosis combined with initiation of appropriate antibiotic treatment remains the cornerstone of sepsis care. Once treatment is initiated, close monitoring of patients is of the utmost importance to identify patients with a favorable disease course who are at low risk for complications so that one may consider early cessation of antibiotic therapy. Daily assessment of patient risk using objective prognostic parameters is therefore important. In addition to clinical parameters, blood markers may aid in patient monitoring. While serum lactate is a commonly used biomarker that may help guide resuscitation measures, PCT has been previously demonstrated to be helpful in assessing the response to antimicrobial treatment and in aiding antibiotic stewardship decisions. Based on multiple randomized trials integrated in an aggregate patient data meta-analysis, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved the PCT assay for the purpose of guiding antibiotic therapy in the context of sepsis. However, since sepsis is not a well-defined disease but a heterogenous syndrome arising from different possible organs being infected and with different clinical presentations based on severity, the question of safety and efficacy of PCT guidance in patients with sepsis overall, and in subgroups based on severity and organs involved, is relevant. In this context, our finding that lower mortality and shorter antibiotic courses are associated with PCT-guided care is reassuring.

### Procalcitonin algorithm to guide initial antibiotic therapy in acute exacerbations of COPD admitted to the ICU: a randomized multicenter study [^1122gwjg]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the efficacy of an antibiotic protocol guided by serum procalcitonin (PCT) with that of standard antibiotic therapy in severe acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPDs) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial in France. Patients experiencing severe AECOPDs were assigned to groups whose antibiotic therapy was guided by (1) a 5-day PCT algorithm with predefined cutoff values for the initiation or stoppage of antibiotics (PCT group) or (2) standard guidelines (control group). The primary endpoint was 3-month mortality. The predefined noninferiority margin was 12%.

Results

A total of 302 patients were randomized into the PCT (n = 151) and control (n = 151) groups. Thirty patients (20%) in the PCT group and 21 patients (14%) in the control group died within 3 months of admission (adjusted difference, 6.6%; 90% CI − 0.3 to 13.5%). Among patients without antibiotic therapy at baseline (n = 119), the use of PCT significantly increased 3-month mortality [19/61 (31%) vs. 7/58 (12%), p = 0.015]. The in-ICU and in-hospital antibiotic exposure durations, were similar between the PCT and control group (5.2 ± 6.5 days in the PCT group vs. 5.4 ± 4.4 days in the control group, p = 0.85 and 7.9 ± 8 days in the PCT group vs. 7.7 ± 5.7 days in the control group, p = 0.75, respectively).

Conclusion

The PCT group failed to demonstrate non-inferiority with respect to 3-month mortality and failed to reduce in-ICU and in-hospital antibiotic exposure in AECOPDs admitted to the ICU.

Procalcitonin

Procalcitonin is the peptide precursor molecule of calcitonin, produced in response to inflammation, and is used in clinical practice to diagnose sepsis. However, procalcitonin is a more stable protein with a more predictable half-life and less inter-assay variability than calcitonin, promoting study of its potential as a marker in the initial diagnosis of MTC and as a tumor marker for follow-up of disease course. Despite heterogeneity in the primary research, two recent systematic reviews found procalcitonin to have good correlation to calcitonin levels and burden of disease in patients diagnosed with MTC. A 2016 systematic review of 15 studies observed strong correlation between procalcitonin and calcitonin levels (r = 0.60–0.95), primary tumor diameter, lymph node metastases, and distant metastases. For a procalcitonin > 0.1 ng/mL, the specificity of detecting MTC was 98–100% while sensitivity was 91–100%. A 2019 meta-analysis evaluating the use of procalcitonin in detecting MTC recurrence found a pooled sensitivity of 96% (95% CI: 92–99%) and pooled specificity of 96% (95% CI: 87–100%). Procalcitonin may also be a useful marker in the small population of calcitonin-negative MTC patients. While most prior studies have been confined to outpatient settings and excluded patients with signs or symptoms of systemic infection, potential exists for the use of procalcitonin as a more accessible tumor marker for MTC.
