## Question

Incisional infection treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of incisional surgical site infection (SSI). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the SSI by depth and timing. Then, I should verify the universal need for source control with incision and drainage. Next, I will examine when antibiotics are indicated versus unnecessary. After that, I need to check empiric antibiotic choices by surgical site and MRSA risk. I will then consider special scenarios like mesh infection, prosthetic devices, and immunocompromised hosts. Finally, I should review wound care, duration, monitoring, and prevention strategies, and close with a concise algorithm summary anchored to guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework because treatment hinges on it. Incisional SSIs are categorized as superficial, deep, or organ/space, with timing windows of 30 days for superficial and deep without implants and 90 days to 1 year for deep with implants, and I should double-check that I'm aligning with CDC/NHSN definitions and contemporary summaries to avoid misclassification that could misdirect therapy [^112XpKn6] [^114AicvL] [^115xseP7].

> Wait, let me verify the universal principle before discussing antibiotics. Across guidelines, the cornerstone of incisional SSI management is prompt source control by opening the incision, removing sutures or staples, draining purulent material, and debriding necrotic tissue, because antibiotics alone without drainage are ineffective and delay healing, so I need to ensure I'm not implying otherwise [^113Etuia] [^111jEtWA] [^1134cfnd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics. I should confirm when they are actually indicated, and the consistent signal is that superficial incisional SSIs with limited cellulitis and no systemic features do not require antibiotics after adequate drainage, whereas antibiotics are indicated for deep infections, immunocompromised hosts, significant systemic inflammatory response, or when cellulitis extends beyond 5 cm with fever, tachycardia, or leukocytosis, typically for a short course of 24–48 hours if improving [^111Lq8tE] [^115R1LHt] [^111y7BdP].

> I need to check empiric antibiotic selection by surgical source. For clean procedures on trunk or extremity away from axilla/perineum, narrow gram-positive coverage such as cefazolin, nafcillin, or oxacillin is appropriate, with vancomycin reserved for MRSA risk, whereas for clean-contaminated or contaminated procedures involving GI/GU, axilla, or perineum, broad-spectrum therapy with gram-negative and anaerobic coverage is warranted, for example piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem, or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole, and I should tailor to local antibiograms and de-escalate when cultures return [^112x86ZG] [^114YuKjc] [^111jEtWA].

> But wait, what if there is prosthetic mesh involved? I should confirm that early source control and antibiotics are critical to prevent mesh contamination, and if infection persists or the patient is septic, complete mesh removal is often required, with salvage strategies (antibiotics, drainage, NPWT) sometimes attempted in selected cases, noting that polypropylene meshes may be more salvageable than ePTFE, though evidence is largely observational and expert-opinion based [^117EV1cD] [^115wYf4J] [^1159ooyN].

> Let me consider immunocompromised patients carefully. I should verify that lower thresholds for antibiotics and closer monitoring are advised, and that wound care strategies such as NPWT may be reasonable adjuncts in high-risk hosts, balancing potential benefits against costs and the need for robust evidence in this subgroup [^114Kfq7K].

> Next, I should review wound care after drainage. Keeping the wound open with packing and allowing healing by secondary intention is standard, and I need to ensure dressings are appropriate for exudate management while acknowledging that high-quality evidence does not show superiority of advanced dressings over standard dressings for preventing SSI in primarily closed wounds, so dressing choice can be guided by cost and patient preference [^112Y3mJQ] [^114cbvjb].

> I will now examine adjunctive therapies. Incisional negative pressure wound therapy can reduce SSI in some high-risk settings, but evidence is heterogeneous and procedure-specific, with orthopedic trauma showing more consistent signals than vascular bypass, so I should individualize use and avoid overgeneralization beyond the populations studied [^112EG5iN] [^1154ipKv] [^115JHhfX].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought routine cultures are always necessary, but I should double-check. For uncomplicated superficial SSIs, routine cultures have low yield and are not mandated, whereas in deep infections, immunocompromised hosts, treatment failure, or unusual presentations, obtaining tissue or aspirate for culture and susceptibility is important to guide de-escalation and detect resistant organisms, and I should avoid swabs of superficial edges when possible [^112XyaKQ].

> I need to ensure duration is aligned with clinical response. When antibiotics are indicated, a short course of 24–48 hours with reassessment is reasonable for superficial SSIs with systemic features, while deep infections generally require 7–14 days, with longer durations if source control is delayed or incomplete, and I should stop early if the patient is clearly improving to minimize resistance and adverse events [^111y7BdP] [^113Etuia].

> Next, I should review monitoring and escalation triggers. Persistent erythema, drainage, fever, or leukocytosis beyond 48–72 hours should prompt reassessment for inadequate source control, resistant organisms including MRSA, or an occult deep/organ space infection, and I should confirm that imaging or surgical exploration is considered when the clinical trajectory is not improving as expected [^111y7BdP] [^117MdSXz].

> Let me reconsider prevention, because avoiding SSI is preferable to treating it. Evidence-based bundles include timely preincision prophylaxis, alcohol-based skin prep, maintaining normothermia, minimizing OR traffic, and procedure-specific measures such as combined parenteral and oral antibiotics for colorectal surgery and S. aureus decolonization for high-risk clean procedures with prosthetic material, and I should align practice with these standards to reduce baseline risk [^112nBrJF] [^112H76Za].

> To synthesize, I should confirm the algorithm: classify the SSI by depth and timing. Universally open, drain, and debride. Withhold antibiotics for limited superficial infections without systemic features. Start antibiotics for deep infections, immunocompromised hosts, or significant systemic response with empiric therapy tailored to surgical source and MRSA risk. Obtain cultures when deep or atypical. Manage wounds open with appropriate dressings. Consider NPWT selectively in high-risk scenarios. Reassess at 48–72 hours and escalate if failing. And embed prevention bundles into routine care to reduce recurrence [^113Etuia] [^111jEtWA] [^112nBrJF].

Incisional infection treatment centers on **prompt source control** [^113Etuia] by opening the wound, draining purulent material, and debriding necrotic tissue [^111jEtWA]. Antibiotics are **not routinely required** for superficial infections without systemic signs [^111Lq8tE]; use them only when there is a significant systemic response, immunocompromise, or deep/organ-space involvement [^111jEtWA]. When indicated, select empiric therapy based on surgical site and local resistance patterns [^112x86ZG], then tailor to culture results [^11765mxi]. Support with wound care, NPWT for large defects [^111jEtWA], and close follow-up; most superficial infections resolve with local care alone, while deep infections may need prolonged antibiotics and possible reoperation [^111jEtWA].

---

## Clinical assessment and diagnosis

- **Clinical signs**: erythema, warmth, swelling, tenderness, purulent drainage, and wound dehiscence [^112XpKn6].

- **Systemic signs**: fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, and malaise [^115R1LHt].

- **Classification**: superficial, deep, or organ/space infection per CDC criteria [^115xseP7].

- **Microbiology**: obtain cultures from deep tissue or purulent material to guide therapy [^112XyaKQ].

---

## Surgical management (source control)

- **Opening the wound**: remove sutures/staples and open the incision to allow drainage [^113Etuia].

- **Drainage and debridement**: evacuate purulent material and remove necrotic tissue [^111jEtWA].

- **Wound care**: use saline or antiseptic irrigation and dress appropriately [^111jEtWA].

- **Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT)**: consider for large defects or high-risk wounds [^112kaEvL].

---

## Antibiotic therapy

### Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are indicated for **deep or organ-space infections** [^11765mxi] [^111y7BdP], for **superficial infections with systemic signs** (fever > 38.5°C, tachycardia > 110 bpm, leukocytosis > 12,000/µL, or erythema > 5 cm) [^112wHZ8g], and for **immunocompromised patients** [^111jEtWA].

---

### Empiric antibiotic selection

| **Surgical site** | **Recommended empiric antibiotics** |
|-|-|
| Clean procedures (skin, soft tissue) | - Cefazolin <br/> - Nafcillin <br/> - Vancomycin (if MRSA risk) [^112x86ZG] |
| Clean-contaminated procedures (GI, GU) | - Piperacillin-tazobactam <br/> - Ceftriaxone + metronidazole <br/> - Levofloxacin + metronidazole [^112x86ZG] |
| Dirty procedures (fecal contamination) | - Piperacillin-tazobactam <br/> - Carbapenems (ertapenem, meropenem) <br/> - Combination therapy (e.g. ceftriaxone + metronidazole) [^112x86ZG] |

---

### Duration of antibiotic therapy

Superficial infections typically require **no routine antibiotics** unless systemic signs are present [^111Lq8tE]; when indicated, a short course of 24–48 hours is reasonable [^111y7BdP]. Deep or organ-space infections generally require **7–14 days**, with adjustments based on clinical response and culture results [^notfound].

---

## Adjunctive therapies and wound care

- **Wound dressings**: silver-containing or hydrocolloid dressings may reduce bacterial load and promote healing [^notfound].

- **Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)**: consider for refractory infections, particularly in diabetic patients [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: teach wound care, hygiene, and signs of recurrence [^112nBrJF].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include regular assessment for clinical improvement or complications. Imaging (**ultrasound or CT**) is warranted if deep or organ-space infection is suspected [^notfound]. Coordinate care with surgery, infectious diseases, and wound care specialists [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications

Potential complications include **wound dehiscence** with delayed healing and increased risk of hernia [^115uvxza], chronic infection or abscess formation, and progression to sepsis — particularly in immunocompromised patients [^111jEtWA].

---

## Prevention strategies

- **Preoperative antibiotics**: administer within 60 minutes before incision [^112nBrJF].

- **Intraoperative antiseptic irrigation**: use povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine solutions [^112nBrJF] [^116VXBd3].

- **Postoperative wound care**: keep dressings intact for 48 hours; use NPWT for high-risk wounds [^114cbvjb] [^1132udRb].

- **Patient factors**: optimize nutrition, glycemic control, and smoking cessation [^112nBrJF].

---

Incisional infection treatment requires **source control** with selective antibiotics, plus supportive wound care and close follow-up. Most superficial infections resolve with local care, whereas deep infections may need prolonged antibiotics and possible reoperation [^113Etuia].

An incisional SSI should be sampled if there is a clinical suspicion of infection. Lack of standardized criteria for diagnostic microbiology of SSIs present a challenge to monitor the global epidemiology of surgical site infection. Emergence of antibiotic resistance has made the management of SSIs difficult. Moreover, rapidly emerging nosocomial pathogens and the problem of multidrug resistance necessitates periodic review of isolation patterns and their sensitivity.

Adequate treatment of incisional SSIs should always include:
Surgical incision and drainage of abscess.
Debridement of necrotic tissue, if present.
Appropriate wound care.
Resuscitation to improve perfusion when sepsis is present.
Adequate empiric antibiotic therapy when indicated.
De-escalation when antibiogram is available.

Incisional SSIs should always be drained, irrigated, and if needed, opened and debrided. If fascial disruption is suspected, drainage should always be performed. Percutaneous drainage, wound irrigation, and negative pressure-assisted wound management are new and effective options that reduce the need for open management of wound infections. In cases where open management is needed, once the infection has cleared, the wound can be closed.

Superficial incisional SSIs that have been opened can usually be managed without antibiotics.

In patients with incisional SSIs with the presence of any systemic inflammatory response criteria or signs of organ failure such as hypotension, oliguria, decreased mental alertness, or in immunocompromised patients, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment should be started with coverage for Gram-positive cocci and/or the expected flora at the site of operation. Definitive antibiotic treatment is guided by the clinical response of the patient and, when available, results of gram stain, wound culture, and antibiogram.

### Incidence of surgical site infection after spine surgery: what is the impact of the definition of infection? [^111muHUb]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Orthopaedic surgical site infections (SSIs) can delay recovery, add impairments, and decrease quality of life, particularly in patients undergoing spine surgery, in whom SSIs may also be more common. Efforts to prevent and treat SSIs of the spine rely on the identification and registration of these adverse events in large databases. The effective use of these databases to answer clinical questions depends on how the conditions in question, such as infection, are defined in the databases queried, but the degree to which different definitions of infection might cause different risk factors to be identified by those databases has not been evaluated.

Questions/Purposes

The purpose of this study was to determine whether different definitions of SSI identify different risk factors for SSI. Specifically, we compared the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) coding, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for deep infection, and incision and débridement for infection to determine if each is associated with distinct risk factors for SSI.

Methods

In this single-center retrospective study, a sample of 5761 adult patients who had an orthopaedic spine surgery between January 2003 and August 2013 were identified from our institutional database. The mean age of the patients was 56 years (± 16 SD), and slightly more than half were men. We applied three different definitions of infection: ICD-9 code for SSI, the CDC criteria for deep infection, and incision and débridement for infection. Three hundred sixty-one (6%) of the 5761 surgeries received an ICD-9 code for SSI within 90 days of surgery. After review of the medical records of these 361 patients, 216 (4%) met the CDC criteria for deep SSI, and 189 (3%) were taken to the operating room for irrigation and débridement within 180 days of the day of surgery.

Results

We found the Charlson Comorbidity Index, the duration of the operation, obesity, and posterior surgical approach were independently associated with a higher risk of infection for each of the three definitions of SSI. The influence of malnutrition, smoking, specific procedures, and specific surgeons varied by definition of infection. These elements accounted for approximately 6% of the variability in the risk of developing an infection.

Conclusions

The frequency of SSI after spine surgery varied according to the definition of an infection, but the most important risk factors did not. We conclude that large database studies may be better suited for identifying risk factors than for determining absolute numbers of infections.

Level Of Evidence

Level III, prognostic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

### ASRA pain medicine consensus practice infection control guidelines for regional anesthesia and pain medicine [^114AicvL]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

CDC National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) surgical site infection (SSI) checklist — superficial incisional SSI criteria specify that the date of event occurs within 30 days following the NHSN operative procedure (where day 1 = the procedure date) and involves only skin and subcutaneous tissue, and at least one of: purulent drainage; organism(s) identified from an aseptically obtained specimen; a superficial incision deliberately opened by a surgeon, physician, or physician designee with localized pain or tenderness, localized swelling, erythema, or heat; or diagnosis of a superficial incisional SSI by a physician or physician designee. Two types are defined (superficial incisional primary and superficial incisional secondary). The checklist clarifies that diagnosis/treatment of cellulitis, stitch abscess, and a localized stab wound or pin site infection do not qualify, and notes that for NHSN surveillance an "incision" refers to the surgical incision (not a drain "stab wound") and that a laparoscopic trocar site is considered a surgical incision, not a stab wound.

### Triclosan-containing sutures for the prevention of surgical site infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112cGW9x]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

International guidelines recommend the use of triclosan-containing sutures for the prevention of surgical site infections. However, controversy still remains about triclosan-containing suture use in clinical practice since several new randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have shown contradicting results.

Objective

To update a previous systematic review and meta-analysis of the association of triclosan-containing sutures with surgical site infections and explore the potential added value of new RCTs.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases were searched from January 1, 2015, to March 14, 2023. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was followed.

Study Selection

Published RCTs comparing triclosan-containing sutures with similar sutures without triclosan for the prevention of surgical site infections in any type of surgery were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two authors (H.J. and A.S.T.) independently extracted and pooled data in a random-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) model. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach, and trial sequential analysis was used to estimate whether further studies would reveal different outcomes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the incidence of surgical site infections, expressed as relative risk (RRs) and corresponding 95% CIs. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of surgical site infections according to depth (superficial incisional, deep incisional, and organ/space) and adverse events related to triclosan-containing sutures.

Results

The systematic review yielded 15 additional RCTs compared with a previous published review in 2017. A meta-analysis of 31 studies including 17 968 participants (62% male) undergoing various types of surgery was performed. Use of triclosan-containing sutures was associated with fewer surgical site infections compared with sutures without triclosan (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65–0.86). The certainty of evidence was moderate after downgrading for heterogeneity (τ2 = 0.04; I2 = 43%). In the trial sequential analysis of all trials and a sensitivity analysis excluding studies with a high risk of bias, the cumulative z curve crossed the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit, confirming the robustness of the summary effect estimate.

Conclusions and Relevance

This updated meta-analysis found moderate-certainty evidence that wound closure with triclosan-containing sutures was associated with a lower risk of surgical site infections. The trial sequential analysis suggests that future trials that would change these findings are improbable.

### Incisional wound irrigation for the prevention of surgical site infection: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116A6xU5]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Surgical site infections (SSIs) are common postoperative complications and associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and costs. Prophylactic intraoperative incisional wound irrigation is used to reduce the risk of SSIs, and there is great variation in the type of irrigation solutions and their use.

Objective

To compare the outcomes of different types of incisional prophylactic intraoperative incisional wound irrigation for the prevention of SSIs in all types of surgery.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and CINAHL databases were searched up to June 12, 2023.

Study Selection

Included in this study were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing incisional prophylactic intraoperative incisional wound irrigation with no irrigation or comparing irrigation using different types of solutions, with SSI as a reported outcome. Studies investigating intracavity lavage were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

This systematic review and network meta-analysis is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement. Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias within individual RCTs using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool and the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. A frequentist network meta-analysis was conducted, and relative risks (RRs) with corresponding 95% CIs were reported.

Main Outcome and Measure

The primary study outcome was SSI.

Results

A total of 1587 articles were identified, of which 41 RCTs were included in the systematic review, with 17 188 patients reporting 1328 SSIs, resulting in an overall incidence of 7.7%. Compared with no irrigation, antiseptic solutions (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.44–0.81; high level of certainty) and antibiotic solutions (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29–0.73; low level of certainty) were associated with a beneficial reduction in SSIs. Saline irrigation showed no statistically significant difference compared with no irrigation (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.63–1.09; moderate level of certainty).

Conclusions and Relevance

This systematic review and network meta-analysis found high-certainty evidence that prophylactic intraoperative incisional wound irrigation with antiseptic solutions was associated with a reduction in SSIs. It is suggested that the use of antibiotic wound irrigation be avoided due to the inferior certainty of evidence for its outcome and global antimicrobial resistance concerns.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^112ntfWe]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair — recommendation and frequency: Postoperative cellulitis following laparoscopic ventral hernia repair may be treated with a short course of antibiotics (Low quality, Weak recommendation). Cellulitis following laparoscopic ventral hernia repair occurs infrequently, in 2–4% of patients, and the etiology overlying the surgical mesh has been postulated to occur as a result of either infection or an inflammatory response related to the prosthetic mesh.

### Incisional negative pressure wound therapy for the prevention of surgical site infection: an up-to-date meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^116KEQed]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In this study, we have multiple aims. First, we provide an overview of all available meta-analyses and their characteristics and explore clinical and methodological discrepancies of current meta-analyses on the prophylactic use of iNPWT. Secondly, we conduct a new and up-to-date systematic review, meta-analysis and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment. Thirdly, we explore additive value of new future RCTs with a trial sequential analysis (TSA).

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113UkXua]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — cutaneous abscess and inflamed epidermoid cyst management emphasizes that aspiration was successful in only 25% of cases overall and < 10% with MRSA infections, and accordingly, this form of treatment is not recommended. Simply covering the surgical site with a dry dressing is usually the easiest and most effective treatment of the wound, and one small study found that packing caused more pain and did not improve healing when compared to just covering the incision site with sterile gauze. The addition of systemic antibiotics to incision and drainage of cutaneous abscesses does not improve cure rates, even in those due to MRSA, but systemic antibiotics should be given to patients with severely impaired host defenses or signs or symptoms of systemic infection; multiple abscesses, extremes of age, and lack of response to incision and drainage alone are additional settings in which systemic antimicrobial therapy should be considered.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^111pS5Gp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be added for patients at risk for CA-MRSA and subsequently for patients who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours or who have chills, fever, a new abscess, increasing erythema, or uncontrolled pain.

Although in cellulitis, swabs and aspirates of the leading edge of the site of infection have a low yield of around 10%, when it is possible, antibiotic treatment should be modified, on the basis of antimicrobial susceptibilities of organisms obtained.

Simple abscesses

7) Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for a simple abscesses or boils. Antibiotics are not needed (Recommendation 1 C).

For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. Simple abscesses should not have extension into deeper tissues or multiloculated extension.

Complex abscesses

8) Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

9) Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA (Recommendation 1 C).

10) Inadequate resolution should prompt consideration of further drainage, resistant pathogens, or host immune failure (Recommendation 1 C).

The cornerstone of treatment is early surgical drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis.

Complicated abscesses may involve a variety of pathogens. Aerobic gram-positive pathogens are isolated in most complicated abscesses. They may involve only a single pathogen but are frequently poly-microbial in origin and may involve a number of organisms.

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved. Broad-spectrum agents with coverage of gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic pathogens may be required depending on the clinical setting. Given the high frequency of MRSA, this pathogen should be empirically covered if it is suspected, but no randomized studies are available for the treatment of SSTI specifically caused by CA-MRSA.

### Incisional negative pressure wound therapy for the prevention of surgical site infection: an up-to-date meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^112EG5iN]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review presents an overview and comparison of all available evidence [both previous meta-analyses and a new up-to-date meta-analysis of all RCTs] regarding the effect of incisional negative pressure wound therapy on the incidence of surgical site infections. This is necessary because current guidelines on the prevention of SSI do not provide updated or unbiased recommendations on iNPWT for the prevention of SSI. We included 23 additional RCTs to this up-to-date meta-analysis compared with the most recent Cochrane Reviewand made methodological choices that considered the current high standard of clinical care. Present meta-analysis shows high GRADE evidence that iNPWT is effective in reducing SSI.

Over time, with increasing numbers of studies included in consecutive meta-analyses, the RR has stabilised, and the confidence interval has narrowed, indicating incremental certainty of the evidence (Fig. 2).

### Midline incisional hernia guidelines: the European hernia society [^116124Kc]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Component separation index

The CSI was first defined by Christy et al. as a hernia's widest angle of diastasis (calculated from the abdominal aorta) divided by 360. One cross-sectional study analysed the relationship between the CSI and the likelihood of fascial closure. Love et al. found that patients requiring myofascial release (n = 134) had a mean(s.d.) CSI of 0.178(s.d. 0.075), whereas those that did not (n = 208) had a mean(s.d.) CSI of 0.104(s.d. 0.05).

Love et al. also produced an AUC analysis concluding that a CSI of greater than 0.146 was most accurately predictive of the need for myofascial release.

Key Question 4: (a) Do all incisional hernias need surgical treatment? and (b) What are the important outcome measures in treatment of incisional hernias?

Good Practice Statement A: For patients with a reducible midline incisional hernia, the risk of an acute hernia accident (strangulation or bowel obstruction) is low (1 per cent in the first year and 2.5 per cent by 5 years).

Good Practice Statement B: For patients with symptoms that adversely affect their quality of life (and are medically fit enough for surgery), the guidelines panel suggests surgical repair; after detailed discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of surgery or watchful waiting.

Good Practice Statement C: For patients undergoing treatment for an incisional hernia, the guidelines panel suggests that the most important outcome measure is quality of life. The most important components of quality of life may vary between patients.

Good Practice Statement D: For patients undergoing treatment for an incisional hernia, the guidelines panel suggests that other important outcome measures are recurrence, surgical site occurrences, mesh infection, mortality, chronic pain, and cost-effectiveness.

Incisional hernia surgery is not without risk, and it is possible that not everyone's quality of life will be improved by surgery. Therefore, for some patients, watchful waiting can be a better choice than surgery. Research on outcome measures after incisional hernia repair has tended to focus on results that are important to healthcare systems such as recurrence or surgical site occurrences. Data collection on quality of life before and after incisional hernia repair is lacking in the incisional hernia literature.

### Strategies to prevent surgical site infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^112nBrJF]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Essential practices for preventing SSI recommended for all acute-care hospitals

Administer antimicrobial prophylaxis according to evidence-based standards and guidelines. (Quality of evidence: HIGH) Begin administration within 1 hour prior to incision to maximize tissue concentration. Administering an antimicrobial agent < 1 hour prior to incision is effective; some studies show superior efficacy for administration between 0 and 30 minutes prior to incision compared with administration between 30 and 60 minutes prior to incision. Two hours are allowed for the administration of vancomycin and fluoroquinolones due to longer infusion times. For cesarean delivery, administer antimicrobial prophylaxis prior to skin incision rather than after cord clamping. In procedures using "bloodless" techniques, many experts believe that antimicrobial agents should be infused prior to tourniquet inflation, though data are lacking to inform this recommendation. Select appropriate antimicrobial agents based on the surgical procedure, the most common pathogens known to cause SSI for the specific procedure, and published recommendations. Although it is not recommended to routinely use vancomycin, this agent should be considered in patients who are known to be MRSA colonized (including those identified on preoperative screening), particularly if the surgery involves prosthetic material. Obtain a thorough allergy history. Self-reported β-lactam allergy has been linked to a higher risk of SSI due to use of alternative, non–β-lactam and often inferior antibiotics, and many patients with a self-reported β-lactam allergy can safely receive a β-lactam antibiotic as prophylaxis. - Discontinue antimicrobial agents after incisional closure in the operating room. Although some guidelines suggest stopping the antimicrobial agents within 24 hours of surgery, there is no evidence that antimicrobial agents given after incisional closure contribute to reduced SSIseven when drains are inserted during the procedure. In contrast, antibiotics given after closure contribute to increased antimicrobial resistance, and increased risk of Clostridioides difficile infectionand acute kidney injury. In a single-center, retrospective, cohort study comparing joint arthroplasty, patients who received a single dose of antibiotic prophylaxis (no additional doses after skin closure) versus 24-hour antibiotic administration, there were no differences in the following outcomes between these 2 groups: prosthetic joint infection, superficial infection, 90-day reoperation, and 90-day complications. Adjust dosing based on patient weight, according to the following examples: For cefazolin, use 30–40 mg/kg for pediatric patients, use 2 grams for patients weighing ≤ 120 kg, and 3 grams for patients weighing > 120 kg. Although data are conflicting regarding the role of 3 grams of cefazolin dosing in reducing SSI in obese patients, multiple studies have shown a benefit compared to 2-gram dosing in this patient population, - with few adverse events from a single dose of 3 grams versus 2 grams of cefazolin. Although some hospitals use 1 gram for adult patients weighing ≤ 80 kg, there is no harm associated with giving a 2-gram dose. Dose vancomycin at 15 mg/kg. Dose gentamicin at 5 mg/kg for adult patients and 2.5 mg/kg for pediatric patients. For morbidly obese patients receiving gentamicin, use the ideal weight plus 40% of the excess weight for dose calculation. Re-dose prophylactic antimicrobial agents for lengthy procedures and in cases with excessive blood loss during the procedure (ie, > 1,500 mL). Re-dose prophylactic antimicrobial agents at intervals of 2 half-lives (measured from the time the preoperative dose was administered) in cases that exceed this period. For example, re-dose cefazolin after 4 hours in procedures > 4 hours long.
Use a combination of parenteral and oral antimicrobial prophylaxis prior to elective colorectal surgery to reduce the risk of SSI. (Quality of evidence: HIGH) A 2019 meta-analysis of 40 studies (28 randomized clinical trials [RCTs] and 12 observational studies) found that the combination of parenteral and oral antimicrobial prophylaxis and mechanical bowel preparation prior to elective colorectal surgery significantly reduces SSI, postoperative ileus, anastomotic leak, and 30-day mortality, without an increase in C. difficile infection. In 2021, the meta-analysis was updated to include the results from the MOBILE and ORALEV trials, which further demonstrated the decreases shown in 2019, along with data showing that oral antimicrobial prophylaxis alone without mechanical bowel preparation significantly reduces SSI, anastomotic leak, and 30-day mortality. We continue to recommend the combination of parenteral and oral antimicrobial prophylaxis and mechanical bowel preparation prior to elective colorectal surgery, unless there is a contraindication to mechanical bowel preparation, in which case, only parenteral and oral antimicrobial prophylaxis should be administered. Use of combination parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents to reduce the risk of SSI should be considered in any surgical procedure where entry into the colon is possible or likely, as in gynecologic oncology surgery. Mechanical bowel preparation without use of oral antimicrobial agents does not decrease the risk of SSI. A recent prospective randomized multicenter trial confirmed earlier meta-analysis findings, with significantly higher SSI and anastomotic leakage in patients who received mechanical bowel preparation without oral antimicrobial agents.
Decolonize surgical patients with an antistaphylococcal agent in the preoperative setting for orthopedic and cardiothoracic procedures. (Quality of evidence: HIGH). Decolonize surgical patients for other procedures at high risk of staphylococcal SSI, such as those involving prosthetic material. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Decolonization refers to the practice of treating patients with an antimicrobial and/or antiseptic agent to suppress S. aureus colonization inclusive of both methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Published data are most supportive of using intranasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine bathing. There are some preliminary data on intranasal povidone-iodine administered immediately before surgery. This approach may have practical advantages, but more data are needed. Fewer data exist for other alternative strategies such as intranasal alcohol-based antisepsis and phototherapy. The strongest data recommend up to 5 days of intranasal mupirocin (twice daily) and bathing with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) (daily). A meta-analysis of 17 studies of patients undergoing cardiac or orthopedic procedures concluded that decolonization strategies prevent S. aureus SSIs. Some trials demonstrated that preoperative screening for S. aureus, combined with intranasal mupirocin and CHG bathing, was effective in reducing SSI. For example, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial showed that rapid identification of S. aureus nasal carriers, followed by decolonization with intranasal mupirocin and CHG bathing was associated with a > 2-fold reduction in the risk for postoperative infection due to S. aureus and an almost five-fold reduction in incidence of deep-incisional SSI due to S. aureus. Patients undergoing clean procedures (eg, cardiothoracic, orthopedic, vascular) who were randomized to decolonization also had reduced 1-year mortality compared with those patients who were randomized to the placebo. A 20-hospital, nonrandomized, quasi-experimental study of patients undergoing cardiac surgery or total joint arthroplasty found a significant decrease in deep-incisional or organ-space S. aureus SSI after implementing a bundle of interventions, including S. aureus nasal screening, decolonization of nasal carriers with mupirocin, CHG bathing for all patients, and perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis adjustment based on MRSA carriage status. Notably, universal decolonization for targeted procedures is likely more cost effective than screen-and-treat strategies. Universal decolonization may also be easier to implement. Some hospitals continue to use screen-and-treat strategies because the results from screening for MRSA colonization can guide antibiotic prophylaxis. In contrast, other trials that assessed a wide range of surgical specialties did not observe a protective effect against SSIs. A prospective, interventional, cohort study with crossover design involving 21,000 patients concluded that universal, rapid screening for MRSA at admission combined with decolonization of carriers did not reduce the SSI rate due to MRSA. This study included 8 surgical specialties: abdominal surgery, orthopedics, urology, neurosurgery, cardiovascular surgery, thoracic surgery, plastic surgery, and solid-organ transplantation. Similarly, a prospective interventional cohort study of 10 hospitals did not find a decrease in MRSA clinical cultures when MRSA screening and decolonization were performed among 9 surgical specialties. However, when the analysis was limited to patients undergoing clean surgery, MRSA screening and decolonization was significantly associated with reductions in MRSA SSI rates. Clean surgery included cardiothoracic, neuro, orthopedic, plastic, and vascular surgery. A double-blinded, randomized-controlled trial involving > 4,000 patients undergoing general, gynecologic, neurologic, or cardiothoracic surgery showed that universal intranasal mupirocin application, when not combined with CHG bathing, did not significantly reduce the S. aureus SSI rate. In a secondary analysis of this data, the use of intranasal mupirocin was associated with an overall decreased rate of nosocomial S. aureus infections among the S. aureus carriers. A Cochrane review concluded that mupirocin decolonization of the nares alone may be effective, particularly in certain groups, including patients undergoing orthopedic and cardiothoracic procedures. However, routine preoperative decolonization with mupirocin without screening may lead to mupirocin resistance. Routine decolonization with antiseptic agents such as intranasal povidone-iodine without screening can be performed because povidone-iodine resistance has not been observed. One single-center RCT comparing intranasal povidone-iodine with mupirocin in total joint arthroplasty and spinal surgery patients found that povidone-iodine and mupirocin were similarly effective. In that RCT, topical CHG wipes in combination with povidone-iodine was given within 2 hours of surgery versus with mupirocin during the 5 days before surgery. There was no significant difference between deep SSI rates when comparing those who received povidone-iodine with those who received mupirocin. Two quasi-experimental, single-center studies of intranasal povidone-iodine decolonization reported a significant reduction in SSIs when compared with standard care among preintervention groups. One study paired intranasal povidone-iodine decolonization with CHG wipes and oral povidone-iodine rinse for elective orthopedic surgery; the other study paired it with CHG wipes or baths and povidone-iodine skin antisepsis for urgent lower extremity repairs of fractures that required hardware. Data are mixed on at-home preoperative bathing with CHG-containing products alone for patients not known to be colonized with Staphylococcus aureus. Preoperative bathing with agents such as CHG has been shown to reduce bacterial colonization of the skin. Several studies have examined the utility of preoperative showers, but none has definitively proven that they decrease SSI risk. A Cochrane review evaluated the evidence for preoperative bathing or showering with antiseptics for SSI prevention. Six RCTs evaluating 4% CHG use were included in the analysis, with no clear evidence of benefit noted. Several of these studies had methodologic limitations and were conducted several years ago. Thus, the role of preoperative bathing in SSI prevention remains uncertain. To achieve the maximum antiseptic effect of CHG, adequate levels of CHG must be achieved and maintained on the skin. Typically, adequate levels are achieved by allowing CHG to dry completely. Additional strategies for preoperative bathing with CHG, such as preimpregnated cloths, have shown promise, - but data are currently insufficient to support this approach.
Use antiseptic-containing preoperative vaginal preparation agents for patients undergoing cesarean delivery or hysterectomy. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Use of povidone-iodine or CHG-based vaginal preparation agents immediately before cesarean delivery reduces endometritis by 59%, with possibly even greater benefit among women in labor. Products should be chosen and used in accordance with manufacturer's instructions for use. Vaginal preparation with antiseptic solution is also recommended for elective hysterectomy.
Do not remove hair at the operative site unless the presence of hair will interfere with the surgical procedure. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) If hair removal is necessary in elective procedures, remove hair outside the operating room using clippers or a depilatory agent. Razors may be acceptable for hair removal in a subset of procedures (eg, procedures involving male genitalia). One small, single-center, RCT demonstrated that clipping hair on the scrotum can cause more skin trauma than razors; clipping hair did not decrease the rate of SSI.
Use alcohol-containing preoperative skin preparatory agents in combination with an antiseptic. (Quality of evidence: HIGH) Alcohol is highly bactericidal and effective for preoperative skin antisepsis, but it does not have persistent activity when used alone. Rapid, persistent, and cumulative antisepsis can be achieved by combining alcohol with CHG or an iodophor. Alcohol is contraindicated for certain procedures due to fire risk, including procedures in which the preparatory agent may pool or not dry (eg, involving hair). Alcohol may also be contraindicated for procedures involving mucosa, cornea, or ear. The most effective antiseptic to combine with alcohol remains unclear; however, data from recent trials favor the use of CHG–alcohol over povidone-iodine–alcohol. A Cochrane review of 13 studies, published in 2015, was inconclusive regarding the best strategy for preoperative skin antisepsis. Only 1 of these studies compared 0.5% CHG–alcohol to povidone-iodine–alcohol. Four RCTs (3 single center and 1 multicenter) have compared CHG–alcohol to povidone-iodine–alcohol. Tuuli et alconducted a single-center RCT of 1,147 women undergoing cesarean delivery. Women randomized to receive CHG–alcohol had a 45% reduction in SSI compared to women randomized to receive povidone-iodine–alcohol (relative risk, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.34–0.90; p = 0.02). Ritter et alconducted a single-center RCT of 279 patients undergoing lower-limb procedures. Patients randomized to receive povidone-iodine–alcohol had a 3.5-fold higher rate of wound healing complications, including SSI, compared with patients randomized to receive CHG-alcohol. Broach et alconducted a single-center, noninferiority RCT of 802 patients undergoing elective, clean-contaminated colorectal procedures. The SSI rate was higher among patients randomized to receive povidone-iodine–alcohol (18.7% vs 15.9%), which failed to meet criterion for noninferiority compared to CHG–alcohol. Charehbili et alconducted a multicenter, cluster-randomized trial with crossover among 3,665 patients undergoing breast, vascular, colorectal, gallbladder, or orthopedic procedures. No difference in SSI rates was observed between the 2 groups, but some concerns were raised about the methods, including cluster sample size, number of clusters, and how the treatment period was analyzed. CHG–alcohol is the antiseptic of choice for patients with S. aureus colonization. In the absence of alcohol, CHG may have advantages over povidone-iodine, including longer residual activity and activity in the presence of blood or serum. Antiseptics are not interchangeable. Follow manufacturer's instructions to ensure correct application. Topical CHG preparations may be contraindicated for use in mouth, eyes and ears, patients with skin disease involving more than the superficial layers of skin, and procedures involving the meninges. Use of topical CHG preparations for preterm infants is controversial due to concerns for skin toxicity, absorption, and resultant toxicity including neurotoxicity. However, apart from these specific contraindications, topical CHG for skin antisepsis and SSI prevention has been shown to be safe. -
For procedures not requiring hypothermia, maintain normothermia (temperature > 35.5°C) during the perioperative period. (Quality of evidence: HIGH) Even mild hypothermia can increase SSI rates. Hypothermia may directly impair neutrophil function or impair it indirectly by triggering subcutaneous vasoconstriction and subsequent tissue hypoxia. Hypothermia may increase blood loss, leading to wound hematomas or the need for transfusion — both of which can increase SSI rates. RCTs have shown the benefits of both preoperative and intraoperative warming in reducing SSI rates and intraoperative blood loss. - Preoperative normothermia may be most beneficial; patients who received 30 minutes of preoperative warming had lower intraoperative hypothermia rates. One study used 2 hours of preoperative warming, but a meta-analysis suggested that 30 minutes should be sufficient. Patients who are hypothermic at the end of surgery may remain hypothermic for up to 5 hours. Although there is not a standardized duration of postoperative warming, one study used 2 hours of postoperative warming and showed reduced rates of SSI.
Use impervious plastic wound protectors for gastrointestinal and biliary tract surgery. (Quality of evidence: HIGH) A wound protector, a plastic sheath that lines a wound, facilitates retraction of an incision during surgery without the need for additional mechanical retractors. A recent meta-analysis of 14 randomized clinical trials in 2,689 patients reported that the use of a plastic wound protector was associated with a 30% decrease in risk of SSI. There was a significant trend toward greater protective effect using a dual ring protector as compared to a single ring protector: 29% decrease in risk of SSI for dual ring and 16% decrease in risk of SSI for single ring. Another prospective randomized study of dual ring protectors in pancreatectomy showed a reduction in SSI rate from 44% to 21% (P = 0.011) with the use of a dual ring protector.
Perform intraoperative antiseptic wound lavage. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Wound lavage is a common practice, although the solution and volume used for lavage differs among surgeons. Evidence does not support saline lavage (nonantiseptic lavage) to reduce SSIs. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses support the use of prophylactic intraoperative wound irrigation with sterile dilute povidone-iodine lavage to decrease the risk of SSIs. One systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2017 evaluated 21 RCTs and concluded that lavage with sterile dilute povidone-iodine decreased the risk of SSI compared to nonantiseptic lavage (odds ratio [OR], 0.31; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.13–0.73). This study reported no benefit from antibiotic irrigation and discouraged this practice. A systematic review and network meta-analysis published in 2021 reported that relative to saline lavage, both antibiotic irrigation (OR, 0.439; 95% CI, 0.282–0.667) and sterile dilute povidone-iodine (OR, 0.573; 95% CI, 0.321–0.953) decreased the risk of SSI. A third systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2015 reported a similar benefit of antibiotic irrigation and sterile dilute povidone-iodine in the subgroup analysis focused on colorectal surgery. Data were mixed in a different meta-analysis published in 2019, potentially due to whether the antibiotic lavage (typically a β-lactam or aminoglycoside agent) was used in clean–clean-contaminated or contaminated–dirty wounds. We recommend the use of dilute povidone-iodine lavage over saline lavage, making sure that sterility is maintained during preparation and administration to enhance patient safety. We recommend studying antibiotic irrigation versus dilute povidone-iodine irrigation in an RCT focused on intra-abdominal surgery that is contaminated–dirty. Given the dearth of povidone-iodine solutions formally labeled "sterile", we advise surgeons to educate themselves as to their options and to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of using povidone-iodine solutions available at their facility. Bacitracin is contraindicated. The FDA withdrew injectable bacitracin from the market because safety concerns outweighed the benefits. This was based on case reports of intraoperative anaphylactic shock associated with bacitracin irrigation. Other agents worth additional study include polyhexanide and rifampicin in certain patient populations.
Control blood-glucose level during the immediate postoperative period for all patients. (Quality of evidence: HIGH) Monitor and maintain postoperative blood-glucose level regardless of diabetes status. Maintain postoperative blood-glucose level between 110 and 150 mg/dL. Increased glucose levels during the operational procedure are associated with higher levels in the postoperative setting. Studies on postoperative blood glucose have focused on monitoring through postoperative day 1–2; however, heterogeneity between studies makes it impossible to recommend a definitive window for postoperative blood-glucose control other than 24–48 hours.- The ideal method for maintaining target postoperative blood-glucose level remains unknown. Generally, continuous insulin-infusion protocols lead to better control than subcutaneous insulin (sliding scale) strategies. Continuous insulin infusion commonly requires intensive monitoring; thus, its use in the ambulatory surgery is often not feasible. Intensive postoperative blood-glucose control (targeting levels < 110 mg/dL) has not consistently shown reduced risk of SSI. Although some studies have demonstrated decreased SSI rates, others have demonstrated higher rates of hypoglycemia and adverse outcomes including stroke and death.
Use a checklist and/or bundle to ensure compliance with best practices to improve surgical patient safety. (Quality of evidence: HIGH) The World Health Organization (WHO) checklist is a 19-item surgical safety checklist to improve adherence with best practices. A multicenter, quasi-experimental study conducted across 8 countries demonstrated that use of the WHO checklist led to lower surgical complication rates, including SSI and death. These findings have been confirmed in subsequent single- and multicenter quasi-experimental studies. Overall, the use of bundles can reduce SSI, but the exact elements needed in a bundle are unknown. This issue is important because some elements have considerable cost and logistical implications, so it is important to understand the impact of individual elements outside a bundle.
Perform surveillance for SSI. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Identify high-risk, high-volume operative procedures to be targeted for SSI surveillance based on a risk assessment of patient populations, operative procedures performed, and available SSI surveillance data. Some surveillance is also mandated by federal and state regulations. Identify, collect, store, and analyze data needed for the surveillance program.4 Develop a database for storing, managing, and accessing data collected on SSIs. Implement a system for collecting data needed to identify and report SSIs. This is discussed in Section 2. Consider collecting data on patient comorbidities (including American Society of Anesthesiology [ASA] score and specific risk factors such as body mass index and diabetes), surgical factors (including wound class, operative duration), process measures (including completion of essential practices discussed in this section), and specifics of SSI (including depth, infecting organism, and antimicrobial susceptibilities). Develop a system for routine review and interpretation of SSI rates and/or SIRs to detect significant increases or outbreaks and to identify areas where additional resources might be needed to improve SSI rates. If increased rates are identified, determine the number of infections that were potentially preventable. Convene key national agencies, organizations, and societies to evaluate. Where possible, align definitions and reporting requirements.
Increase the efficiency of surveillance by utilizing automated data. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Implement a method to electronically transmit data to infection prevention and control personnel needed to determine denominator data and calculate SSI rates for various procedures. This might include procedure data, process measure data, readmission and rehospitalization data, postoperative antimicrobial data, microbiology data, and diagnosis and procedure codes.-
Provide ongoing SSI rate feedback to surgical and perioperative personnel and leadership. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Routinely audit and provide confidential feedback on SSI rates or SIRs and adherence to process measures to individual surgeons, the surgical division and/or department chiefs, and hospital leadership. Provide risk-adjusted SSI SIRs for each type of procedure under surveillance and reported to the NHSN. For procedures not reported to the NHSN, there may be alternative data to review through surveillance programs such as National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). Anonymously benchmark procedure-specific, risk-adjusted SSI SIRs among peer surgeons.
Measure and provide feedback to HCP regarding rates of compliance with process measures. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Routinely provide feedback to surgical staff, perioperative personnel, and leadership regarding compliance with targeted process measures.
Educate surgeons and perioperative personnel about SSI prevention measures. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Include risk factors, outcomes associated with SSI, local epidemiology (eg, SSI rates by procedure, rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] infection in a facility), and essential prevention measures.
Educate patients and their families about SSI prevention as appropriate. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Provide instructions and information to patients prior to surgery describing strategies for reducing SSI risk. Specifically provide preprinted materials to patients. Examples of printed materials for patients are available from the following web pages: JAMA patient page: Wound Infections Surgical Care Improvement Project Tips for Safer Surgery CDC Frequently Asked Questions About Surgical-Site Infections SHEA Infection Prevention Handout for Patients and Visitors
Implement policies and practices to reduce the risk of SSI for patients that align with applicable evidence-based standards, rules and regulations, and medical device manufacturer instructions for use. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Implement policies and practices to reduce modifiable risk factors (Table 1), including the following: Optimally disinfect the hands of the surgical team members. Adhere to hand hygiene practices, including nonsurgeon members of the operating team. Reduce unnecessary traffic in operating rooms. Avoid use of nonsterile water sources in the operating room. Properly care for and maintain the operating rooms, including appropriate air handling, pressure relative to hallway, temperature, humidity, and optimal cleaning and disinfection of equipment and the environment. Maintain asepsis from the start of preparation of surgical instruments on the sterile field through wound closure and dressing. Establish a robust infection control risk assessment program focused on mitigating risk during construction projects. Proactively address potential risks from supply-chain shortages and communicate to frontline teams. Discuss any staffing shortages and potential impact on outcomes as they relate to compliance with SSI prevention measures.
Observe and review operating-room personnel and the environment of care in the operating room and in central sterile reprocessing. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Perform direct observation audits of operating-room personnel to assess operating-room processes and practices to identify infection control lapses, including but not limited to adherence to process measures (antimicrobial prophylaxis choice, timing and duration protocols, hair removal, etc), surgical hand antisepsis, patient skin preparation, operative technique, surgical attire (wearing and/or laundering outside the operating room), and level of operating-room traffic. - Perform remediation when breaches of standards are identified. Operating-room personnel should include surgeons, surgical technologists, anesthesiologists, circulating nurses, residents, medical students, trainees, and device manufacturer representatives. Perform direct observation audits of environmental cleaning practices in the operating room, instrument reprocessing (sterilization) area, and storage facilities. Review instrument reprocessing and flash sterilization or immediate-use steam sterilization (IUSS) logs. Review maintenance records for operating room heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system including, results of temperature, relative humidify, and positive air pressure maintenance testing in the operating rooms(s). Provide feedback and review infection control measures with operating-room and environmental personnel.

### Incisional negative pressure wound therapy for the prevention of surgical site infection: an up-to-date meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^1132udRb]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common postoperative complication and causes increased morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Furthermore, other wound complications such as wound dehiscence, hematoma, seroma, and skin necrosis occur frequently. The evidence on prophylactic use of negative pressure wound therapy on primary closed incisional wounds (iNPWT) for the prevention of postoperative wound complications, including SSI, is confusing and ambiguous. It is hypothesised that iNPWT reduces bacterial contamination, exudate and oedema, promotes lymphatic and local blood flow, and stimulates tissue granulation.

iNPWT has been the subject of multiple randomised controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The current international guidelines, for the prevention of SSI and meta-analyses make inconsistent recommendations. Unfortunately, there is great clinical and methodological heterogeneity between these guidelines and articles, which creates confusion and ambiguity, potentially impairing implementation. The World Health Organization (WHO) guideline [published 2018] suggests the use of iNPWT in high-risk wounds with an overall low quality evidence, based on six RCTs and 15 observational studies. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) only published a medical technologies guidance in 2019, recommending the PICO device in high-risk patients, whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) do not mention iNPWT in their current guideline. Several previous meta-analyses show moderate and high certainty evidence that iNPWT reduces the risk of SSI compared with standard dressings. The most recent Cochrane Review on this topic found moderate certainty evidence in favour of iNPWT. Despite this evidence, the use of iNPWT is still not standard practice. This is possibly due to the ambiguity of recommendations from trials and guidelines, and the focus of surgeons on their own subspecialty which causes them to disregard results in general populations. However, there is no biological reason to expect a difference in effect between different types of surgery. Recently, new RCTs have been published. Available meta-analyses have not incorporated these RCTs in quantitative analyses and therefore lag behind.

### Multicenter parallel randomized trial evaluating incisional negative pressure wound therapy for the prevention of surgical site infection after lower extremity bypass [^1154ipKv]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Incisional negative pressure wound therapy (iNPWT) applied over all incisions after lower extremity bypass in the prevention of surgical site infections (SSIs) is unclear. The primary and secondary aims of this study were to investigate if prophylactic iNPWT after the elective lower extremity bypass prevents SSI and other surgical wound complications.

Methods

This was a multicenter, parallel, randomized controlled trial. Patients undergoing elective lower extremity bypass in 3 hospitals were randomized to either iNPWT or standard dressings. SSIs or other wound complications were assessed within the first 90 days by wound care professionals blinded to the randomized result. The validated Additional treatment, Serous discharge, Erythema, Purulent exudate, Separation of deep tissues, Isolation of bacteria, and Stay (ASEPSIS) score was used to objectively assess the wounds. ASEPSIS score ≥ 21 is defined as an SSI. Unilateral and bilateral groups were analyzed with the Fisher exact test and the McNemar test, respectively.

Results

In the unilateral group (n = 100), the incidence of SSI in the iNPWT group was 34.9% (15/43), compared with 40.3% (23/57) in the control group, according to the ASEPSIS score (P = 0.678). In the bilateral group (n = 7), the SSI rate was 14.3% (1/7) in the iNPWT group compared with 14.3% (1/7) in the control group (P = 1.00). In the unilateral group, there was a higher wound dehiscence rate in the control group (43.9%) compared with the iNPWT group (23.3%) (P = 0.0366). No serious iNPWT-related adverse events were recorded.

Conclusions

There was no reduction of SSI rates in leg incisions with iNPWT compared with standard dressings in patients undergoing elective lower extremity bypass, whereas iNPWT reduced the incidence of wound dehiscence.

Table 2.
Summary of Recently Approved Antibiotics for the Treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Structure Infection

The emergence of community-associated MRSA strains has greatly influenced the selection of empirical antibiotic therapy for ABSSSIs. To provide adequate empirical coverage for MRSA, an understanding of local microbial epidemiologic patterns and susceptibility patterns is essential. For the treatment of an abscess, the IDSA guidelines recommend, in addition to incision and drainage, administration of an antibiotic active against MRSA when the initial antibiotic treatment has failed or when the patient has immunosuppression, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), or hypotension. For cellulitis and erysipelas, including an antibiotic with activity against MRSA and group A streptococcus is recommended when the infection is associated with penetrating trauma or when there is evidence of MRSA infection, MRSA colonization, injecting drug use, or SIRS. Further, including an antimicrobial agent active against MRSA in the treatment of surgical wound infections is recommended in patients with risk factors for infection by this microorganism (nasal colonization or prior infection, hospitalization, or recent antibiotic administration). Anti-MRSA agents for ABSSSIs include vancomycin, which is considered the first-line parenteral treatment of serious MRSA infections in hospitalized patients, as well as linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline (Table 3). Other agents with reliable MRSA activity that have been approved for ABSSSIs include ceftaroline, tedizolid, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin. Additional factors for administering these medications include tolerability, formulation, cost, and dosing limitations associated with these agents, such as vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity and linezolid-associated myelosuppression.

### Negative pressure wound therapy for skin grafts and surgical wounds healing by primary intention [^115s7o2L]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Indications for the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) are broadening with a range of systems now available on the market, including those designed for use on clean, closed incisions and skin grafts. Reviews have concluded that the evidence for the effectiveness of NPWT remains uncertain, however, it is a rapidly evolving therapy. Consequently, an updated systematic review of the evidence for the effects of NPWT on postoperative wounds expected to heal by primary intention is required.

Objectives

To assess the effects of NPWT on surgical wounds (primary closure, skin grafting or flap closure) that are expected to heal by primary intention.

We searched the following electronic databases to identify reports of relevant randomised clinical trials: the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 28 January 2014); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2013, issue 12); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (2013, issue 12); Ovid MEDLINE (2011 to January 2014); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations 24 January 2014); Ovid EMBASE (2011 to January 2014 Week 44); and EBSCO CINAHL (2011 to January 2014). We conducted a separate search to identify economic evaluations.

Selection Criteria

We included trials if they allocated patients to treatment randomly and compared NPWT with any other type of wound dressing, or compared one type of NPWT with a different type of NPWT.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed trials for their appropriateness for inclusion and for their quality. This was done by three review authors working independently, using pre-determined inclusion and quality criteria.

Main Results

In this first update, we included an additional four trials, taking the total number of trials included to nine (785 participants). Three trials involved skin grafts, four included orthopaedic patients and two included general surgery and trauma surgery patients; all the included trials had unclear or high risk of bias for one or more of the quality indicators we assessed. Seven trials compared NPWT with a standard dressing (two of these were 'home-made' NPWT devices), one trial compared one 'home-made' NPWT with a commercially available device. In trials where the individual was the unit of randomisation, there were no differences in the incidence of surgical site infections (SSI); wound dehiscence, re-operation (in incisional wounds); seroma/haematoma; or failed skin grafts. Lower re-operation rates were observed among skin graft patients in the 'home-made' NPWT group (7/65; 10.8%) compared to the standard dressing group (17/66; 25.8%) (risk ratio (RR) 0.42; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.92). The mean cost to supply equipment for VAC® therapy was USD 96.51/day compared to USD 4.22/day for one of the 'home-made' devices (P value 0.01); labour costs for dressing changes were similar for both treatments. Pain intensity score was also reported to be lower in the 'home-made' group when compared with the VAC® group (P value 0.02). One of the trials in orthopaedic patients was stopped early because of a high incidence of fracture blisters in the NPWT group (15/24; 62.5%) compared with the standard dressing group (3/36; 8.3%) (RR 7.50; 95% CI 2.43 to 23.14).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence for the effects of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) for reducing SSI and wound dehiscence remains unclear, as does the effect of NPWT on time to complete healing. Rates of graft loss may be lower when NPWT is used, but hospital-designed and built products are as effective in this area as commercial applications. There are clear cost benefits when non-commercial systems are used to create the negative pressure required for wound therapy, with no evidence of a negative effect on clinical outcome. In one study, pain levels were also rated lower when a 'home-made' system was compared with a commercial counterpart. The high incidence of blisters occurring when NPWT is used following orthopaedic surgery suggests that the therapy should be limited until safety in this population is established. Given the cost and widespread use of NPWT, there is an urgent need for suitably powered, high-quality trials to evaluate the effects of the newer NPWT products that are designed for use on clean, closed surgical incisions. Such trials should focus initially on wounds that may be difficult to heal, such as sternal wounds or incisions on obese patients.

### Predictors for surgical site infection in patients undergoing therapeutic or prophylactic intra-abdominal onlay mesh (IPOM) implantation in clean and contaminated surgical fields [^117SX9fA]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Intra-abdominal onlay mesh (IPOM) implantation for the repair of abdominal wall hernias has been shown to reduce the rate of recurrences compared to suture repair. Similarly, recent evidence suggests that prophylactic mesh implantation is superior compared to suture closure of the abdominal wall in patients with a high risk for incisional hernias. As previously reported by our study group, prophylactic placement of synthetic IPOM is also feasible in patients with intraperitoneal contamination and leads to a decreased rate of incisional hernias in the long term. Furthermore, we have shown that implantation of an IPOM in patients with fascial dehiscence and in open abdomen treatment leads to a decreased rate of revisional surgery, duration of hospital and intensive care unit stay, as well as a reduction of incisional hernias.

On the other hand, mesh infections are a severe complication after mesh implantation and associated with hospital re-admission, re-operations, and hernia recurrences, resulting in high healthcare resource utilization. Although mesh infections became less frequent over time, an incidence of mesh infections of one to eight percent has been reported after incisional or ventral hernia repair. There is currently no uniformly used definition of mesh infections available. The definition of mesh infection varied in previous studies and included the centers of disease control and prevention (CDC) criteria for SSI, identification of pathogens after aspiration of a periprosthetic fluid collections, infections necessitating mesh removal, individualized criteria, or no specific definition. Even though the majority of SSI in presence of an IPOM can be treated locally without the need for revision surgery, SSI may require explantation of the foreign material. In these cases, source control can be difficult and the therapeutic regimen for such scenarios incompletely defined.

Surgical site infection — procedural management and systemic therapy indicate that suture removal plus incision and drainage should be performed for surgical site infections (strong, low). Adjunctive systemic antimicrobial therapy is not routinely indicated, but in conjunction with incision and drainage may be beneficial for surgical site infections associated with a significant systemic response, such as erythema and induration extending > 5 cm from the wound edge, temperature > 38.5°C, heart rate > 110 beats/minute, or white blood cell (WBC) count > 12 000/mL (weak, low). A brief course of systemic antimicrobial therapy is indicated in patients with surgical site infections following operations on the trunk, head and neck, or extremities that also have systemic signs of infection (strong, low).

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^116Kfkwx]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) — perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis: A single dose first-generation cephalosporin (cefazolin) should be given preoperatively for LVHR. Vancomycin should be added in patients colonized with MRSA. Vancomycin or Clindamycin should be given to patients allergic to cephalosporins. (Moderate quality, Strong recommendation). The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Surgical Infection Society, and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America recommend that a single dose of a first-generation cephalosporin (cefazolin) be administered within 60 minutes prior to incisional hernia repair with a prosthetic, and for patients known to be colonized with MRSA, a single preoperative dose of vancomycin should be added and administered within 120 minutes prior to surgery. Even though these guidelines were developed from the evidence included in the inguinal hernia literature, they also apply to incisional hernias, where the risk for infection seems to be higher than in inguinal hernias. The most common microorganisms isolated from surgical-site infections after hernia repair are aerobic gram-positive organisms and include aerobic streptococcus, Staphylococcus species, and Enterococcus species, and MRSA is commonly found in prosthetic mesh infections.

### Incisional negative pressure wound therapy decreases the frequency of postoperative perineal surgical site infections: a cohort study [^112Gybae]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominoperineal resection is a procedure associated with high rates of perineal surgical site infections, causing distress to the patient, costs to the hospital system, and delays in further treatment.

Objective

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of incisional negative pressure wound therapy in decreasing the rates of perineal surgical site infection.

Design

This retrospective cohort study had a historical, consecutively sampled control group.

Settings

This study was conducted at a single-institution tertiary care academic institution.

Patients

All patients undergoing an abdominoperineal resection between 2008 and 2012 were assessed.

Interventions

Perineal incisional negative pressure wound therapy was applied to all patients following an abdominoperineal resection between 2010 and 2012 at 125 mmHg continuous suction for 5 days postoperatively.

Main Outcome Measures

The development of a perineal surgical site infection within the first 30 days postoperatively was the primary outcome measured.

Results

Fifty-nine patients were included: 27 in the incisional negative pressure wound therapy group and 32 in the control group. A statistically lower proportion of perineal surgical site infections were detected in the incisional negative pressure wound therapy group than in the standard dressing group (15% vs 41%; p = 0.02). Both populations were similar in perioperative risk factors, with the exception of increased levels of blood urea nitrogen, a higher proportion of hypertensive patients, and a longer mean operative time in the incisional negative pressure wound therapy group. Additionally, an increased length of stay was observed in the incisional negative pressure wound therapy group (11 vs 8 days; p = 0.03). After adjusting for confounders, including the type of perineal dissection, incisional negative pressure wound therapy was found to be an independent predictor of not developing an surgical site infection (adjusted OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.04–0.66; p = 0.01).

Limitations

The study's retrospective nature limits the results because of the risk of interpreter bias, although this was addressed in part by reviewing data in duplicate. We controlled for the potential for selection bias with our consecutive sampling model.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates a role for incisional negative pressure wound therapy in decreasing rates of perineal surgical site infection following abdominoperineal resection. Prospective randomized trials will be required to further investigate this intervention.

### Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention [^115p3yyb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Following surgery, incisions are usually closed by fixing the edges together with sutures (stitches), staples, adhesives (glue) or clips. This process helps the cut edges heal together and is called 'healing by primary intention'. However, a minority of surgical wounds are not closed in this way. Where the risk of infection is high or there has been significant loss of tissue, wounds may be left open to heal by the growth of new tissue rather than by primary closure; this is known as 'healing by secondary intention'. There is a risk of infection in open wounds, which may impact on wound healing, and antiseptic or antibiotic treatments may be used with the aim of preventing or treating such infections. This review is one of a suite of Cochrane reviews investigating the evidence on antiseptics and antibiotics in different types of wounds. It aims to present current evidence related to the use of antiseptics and antibiotics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (SWHSI).

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic and topical antibiotics, and topical antiseptics for the treatment of surgical wounds healing by secondary intention.

Search Methods

In November 2015 we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL. We also searched three clinical trials registries and the references of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials which enrolled adults with a surgical wound healing by secondary intention and assessed treatment with an antiseptic or antibiotic treatment. Studies enrolling people with skin graft donor sites were not included, neither were studies of wounds with a non-surgical origin which had subsequently undergone sharp or surgical debridement or other surgical treatments or wounds within the oral or aural cavities.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction.

Main Results

Eleven studies with a total of 886 participants were included in the review. These evaluated a range of comparisons in a range of surgical wounds healing by secondary intention. In general studies were small and some did not present data or analyses that could be easily interpreted or related to clinical outcomes. These factors reduced the quality of the evidence. Two comparisons compared different iodine preparations with no antiseptic treatment and found no clear evidence of effects for these treatments. The outcome data available were limited and what evidence there was low quality. One study compared a zinc oxide mesh dressing with a plain mesh dressing. There was no clear evidence of a difference in time to wound healing between groups. There was some evidence of a difference in measures used to assess wound infection (wound with foul smell and number of participants prescribed antibiotics) which favoured the zinc oxide group. This was low quality evidence. One study reported that sucralfate cream increased the likelihood of healing open wounds following haemorrhoidectomy compared to a petrolatum cream (RR: 1.50, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.99) over a three week period. This evidence was graded as being of moderate quality. The study also reported lower wound pain scores in the sucralfate group. There was a reduction in time to healing of open wounds following haemorrhoidectomy when treated with Triclosan post-operatively compared with a standard sodium hypochlorite solution (mean difference -1.70 days, 95% CI -3.41 to 0.01). This was classed as low quality evidence. There was moderate quality evidence that more open wounds resulting from excision of pyomyositis abscesses healed when treated with a honey-soaked gauze compared with a EUSOL-soaked gauze over three weeks' follow-up (RR: 1.58, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.42). There was also some evidence of a reduction in the mean length of hospital stay in the honey group. Evidence was taken from one small study that only had 43 participants. There was moderate quality evidence that more Dermacym®-treated post-operative foot wounds in people with diabetes healed compared to those treated with iodine (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.93). Again estimates came from one small study with 40 participants.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no robust evidence on the relative effectiveness of any antiseptic/antibiotic/anti-bacterial preparation evaluated to date for use on SWHSI. Where some evidence for possible treatment effects was reported, it stemmed from single studies with small participant numbers and was classed as moderate or low quality evidence. This means it is likely or very likely that further research will have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect, and may change this estimate.

### Acute hand infections… [^115fHGEs]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Mild infections without obvious abscess should be treated with warm soaks and topical antibiotics. 10 If an abscess is present, conservative measures to provoke spontaneous drainage may be tried for two to three days; however, mechanical drainage is often needed. 8 Procedures for draining paronychia have been described in a previous American Family Physician article. 10 Routine cultures for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections are not recommended. 26, 43 Oral antibiotics typically are not needed after successful drainage, but if used, they should be limited to treatment of immunocompromised or severely ill patients, based on local community resistance patterns and established guidelines. 10, 12, 14, 26. 16 Treatment of an early felon in which no abscess is present should include warm soaks, elevation, and empiric oral antibiotics directed at staphylococcal and streptococcal infections.

12, 15 Surgical drainage is required if an abscess is present; a high lateral incision should be made for a deep abscess, and a volar longitudinal incision should be made for a superficial abscess. 1, 16 Methods of performing these incisions, risks of the incisions, and postoperative care recommendations have been described in a previous American Family Physician article. 1 Surgical drainage of a felon with abscess is the mainstay of treatment; antibiotics do not provide additional benefit once appropriate drainage has been performed.
41. Mainstays of therapy for herpetic whitlow include reducing the risk of transmission, pain control, and consideration of antiviral medications. Primary herpetic whitlow is typically self-limited, with complete resolution within 21 days.

However, off-label use of oral antivirals should be considered for patients with recurrent lesions or symptoms present for less than 48 hours, or for immunocompromised patients, who may develop disseminated disease requiring intravenous antiviral treatment and critical care. Initial wound management should include hemostasis, copious irrigation, removal of any foreign bodies, and debridement of necrotic tissue. 1, 12 A single prospective randomized controlled trial supports empiric antibiotic use in all patients. 21 This trial compared mechanical wound care alone with wound care plus oral cefaclor, or intravenous cefazolin plus penicillin G. Patients with joint capsule penetration, tendon injury, or bites older than 24 hours were excluded.

### Intraoperative interventions for preventing surgical site infection: an overview of cochrane reviews [^111XhQem]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical site infection (SSI) rates vary from 1% to 5% in the month following surgery. Due to the large number of surgical procedures conducted annually, the costs of these SSIs can be considerable in financial and social terms. Many interventions are used with the aim of reducing the risk of SSI in people undergoing surgery. These interventions can be broadly delivered at three stages: preoperatively, intraoperatively and postoperatively. The intraoperative interventions are largely focused on decontamination of skin using soap and antiseptics; the use of barriers to prevent movement of micro-organisms into incisions; and optimising the patient's own bodily functions to promote best recovery. Both decontamination and barrier methods can be aimed at people undergoing surgery and operating staff. Other interventions focused on SSI prevention may be aimed at the surgical environment and include methods of theatre cleansing and approaches to managing theatre traffic.

Objectives

To present an overview of Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness and safety of interventions, delivered during the intraoperative period, aimed at preventing SSIs in all populations undergoing surgery in an operating theatre.

Methods

Published Cochrane systematic reviews reporting the effectiveness of interventions delivered during the intraoperative period in terms of SSI prevention were eligible for inclusion in this overview. We also identified Cochrane protocols and title registrations for future inclusion into the overview. We searched the Cochrane Library on 01 July 2017. Two review authors independently screened search results and undertook data extraction and 'Risk of bias' and certainty assessment. We used the ROBIS (risk of bias in systematic reviews) tool to assess the quality of included reviews, and we used GRADE methods to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. We summarised the characteristics of included reviews in the text and in additional tables.

Main Results

We included 32 Cochrane Reviews in this overview: we judged 30 reviews as being at low risk of bias and two at unclear risk of bias. Thirteen reviews had not been updated in the past three years. Two reviews had no relevant data to extract. We extracted data from 30 reviews with 349 included trials, totaling 73,053 participants. Interventions assessed included gloving, use of disposable face masks, patient oxygenation protocols, use of skin antiseptics for hand washing and patient skin preparation, vaginal preparation, microbial sealants, methods of surgical incision, antibiotic prophylaxis and methods of skin closure. Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence for outcomes was low or very low. Of the 77 comparisons providing evidence for the outcome of SSI, seven provided high- or moderate-certainty evidence, 39 provided low-certainty evidence and 31 very low-certainty evidence. Of the nine comparisons that provided evidence for the outcome of mortality, five provided low-certainty evidence and four very low-certainty evidence. There is high- or moderate-certainty evidence for the following outcomes for these intraoperative interventions. (1) Prophylactic intravenous antibiotics administered before caesarean incision reduce SSI risk compared with administration after cord clamping (10 trials, 5041 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.81; high-certainty evidence - assessed by review authors). (2) Preoperative antibiotics reduce SSI risk compared with placebo after breast cancer surgery (6 trials, 1708 participants; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.98; high-certainty evidence - assessed by overview authors). (3) Antibiotic prophylaxis probably reduce SSI risk in caesarean sections compared with no antibiotics (82 relevant trials, 14,407 participants; RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.46; moderate-certainty evidence; downgraded once for risk of bias - assessed by review authors). (4) Antibiotic prophylaxis probably reduces SSI risk for hernia repair compared with placebo or no treatment (17 trials, 7843 participants; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.84; moderate-certainty evidence; downgraded once for risk of bias - assessed by overview authors); (5) There is currently no clear difference in the risk of SSI between iodine-impregnated adhesive drapes compared with no adhesive drapes (2 trials, 1113 participants; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.60; moderate-certainty evidence; downgraded once for imprecision - assessed by review authors); (6) There is currently no clear difference in SSI risk between short-term compared with long-term duration antibiotics in colorectal surgery (7 trials; 1484 participants; RR 1.05 95% CI 0.78 to 1.40; moderate-certainty evidence; downgraded once for imprecision - assessed by overview authors). There was only one comparison showing negative effects associated with the intervention: adhesive drapes increase the risk of SSI compared with no drapes (5 trials; 3082 participants; RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.48; high-certainty evidence - rated by review authors).

Authors' Conclusions

This overview provides the most up-to-date evidence on use of intraoperative treatments for the prevention of SSIs from all currently published Cochrane Reviews. There is evidence that some interventions are useful in reducing SSI risk for people undergoing surgery, such as antibiotic prophylaxis for caesarean section and hernia repair, and also the timing of prophylactic intravenous antibiotics administered before caesarean incision. Also, there is evidence that adhesive drapes increase SSI risk. Evidence for the many other treatment choices is largely of low or very low certainty and no quality-of-life or cost-effectiveness data were reported. Future trials should elucidate the relative effects of some treatments. These studies should focus on increasing participant numbers, using robust methodology and being of sufficient duration to adequately assess SSI. Assessment of other outcomes such as mortality might also be investigated as part of non-experimental prospective follow-up of people with SSI of different severity, so the risk of death for different subgroups can be better understood.

### Meta-analysis of negative-pressure wound therapy for closed surgical incisions [^115wEGNn]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Postoperative wound complications are common following surgical procedures. Negative‐pressure wound therapy is well recognized for the management of open wounds and has been applied recently to closed surgical incisions. The evidence base to support this intervention is limited. The aim of this study was to assess whetherreduces postoperative wound complications when applied to closed surgical incisions.

Methods

This was a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized clinical trials ofcompared with standard postoperative dressings on closed surgical incisions.

Results

Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, reporting on 1311 incisions in 1089 patients.was associated with a significant reduction in wound infection (relative risk 0.54, 95 per cent c.i. 0.33 to 0.89) and seroma formation (0.48, 0.27 to 0.84) compared with standard care. The reduction in wound dehiscence was not significant. The numbers needed to treat were three (seroma), 17 (dehiscence) and 25 (infection). Methodological heterogeneity across studies led to downgrading of the quality of evidence to moderate for infection and seroma, and low for dehiscence.

Conclusion

Compared with standard postoperative dressings, significantly reduced the rate of wound infection and seroma when applied to closed surgical wounds. Heterogeneity between the included studies means that no general recommendations can be made yet.

### The surgical infection society guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection: 2024 update [^113bZaiV]. Surgical Infections (2024). High credibility.

Surgical Infection Society (SIS) intra-abdominal infection guideline — 2024 update methods and scope state that SIS previously issued evidence-based guidelines in 1992, 2002, 2010, and 2017. The update was based on a systematic review using PubMed/Medline, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science from 2016 until February 2024; Keywords/descriptors combined "surgical site infections" or "intra-abdominal infections" in adults limited to randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, and additional relevant publications identified during literature review were included. Recommendations were graded with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system, with strength rated strong (1) or weak (2) and quality rated high (A), moderate (B), or weak (C). The guideline contains new recommendations and updates to recommendations from previous 14 guideline versions, with final recommendations developed by an iterative process and all writing group members voting to accept or reject each recommendation. The updated evidence-based guideline provides recommendations for the treatment of adult patients with IAI, including antimicrobial agent selection, timing, route of administration, duration, and de-escalation; timing of source control; and treatment of specific pathogens.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society [IEHS])-part 2 [^114WNcdA]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Baccari et al. [20] are the only authors who perform a laparoscopic examination of the abdomen to ascertain the presence of an iatrogenic enterotomy, and if such an injury is discovered, perform a formal laparotomy and open repair. In the remaining publications, mesh explantation, intestinal resection, and primary repair of the hernia constitute the preferred management of the unrecognized injuries.

Despite the numerous reports on laparoscopic repair of incisional hernias, very few (in fact, only 2) have addressed this problem. As LeBlanc [10] advocated, "a laparotomy will generally be required with bowel resection and explant of the mesh". Serala [26] recommended that "if there is a high index of suspicion of a missed enterotomy, a planned re-laparoscopy after 24–48 h… should be done". However, this report does not provide any specific recommendations for the management of either the intestinal injury or the hernia.

Conclusions

Based on the relative paucity of high-level data on the management of this serious problem, it seems that the safest approach is repair, resection of the injury, mesh explantation, and primary repair of the fascial defect. If this is not possible laparoscopically or if the clinical condition warrants, open surgical treatment is essential.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### Strategies for antibiotic administration for bowel preparation among patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery: a network meta-analysis [^112H76Za]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Importance

There are discrepancies in guidelines on preparation for colorectal surgery. While intravenous (IV) antibiotics are usually administered, the use of mechanical bowel preparation (MBP), enemas, and/or oral antibiotics (OA) is controversial.

Objective

To summarize all data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that met selection criteria using network meta-analysis (NMA) to determine the ranking of different bowel preparation treatment strategies for their associations with postoperative outcomes.

Data Sources

Data sources included MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Scopus databases with no language constraints, including abstracts and articles published prior to 2021.

Study Selection

Randomized studies of adults undergoing elective colorectal surgery with appropriate aerobic and anaerobic antibiotic cover that reported on incisional surgical site infection (SSI) or anastomotic leak were selected for inclusion in the analysis. These were selected by multiple reviewers and adjudicated by a separate lead investigator. A total of 167 of 6833 screened studies met initial selection criteria.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

NMA was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Data were extracted by multiple independent observers and pooled in a random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were incisional SSI and anastomotic leak. Secondary outcomes included other infections, mortality, ileus, and adverse effects of preparation.

Results

A total of 35 RCTs that included 8377 patients were identified. Treatments compared IV antibiotics (2762 patients [33%]), IV antibiotics with enema (222 patients [3%]), IV antibiotics with OA with or without enema (628 patients [7%]), MBP with IV antibiotics (2712 patients [32%]), MBP with IV antibiotics with OA (with good IV antibiotic cover in 925 patients [11%] and with good overall antibiotic cover in 375 patients [4%]), MBP with OA (267 patients [3%]), and OA (486 patients [6%]). The likelihood of incisional SSI was significantly lower for those receiving IV antibiotics with OA with or without enema (rank 1) and MBP with adequate IV antibiotics with OA (rank 2) compared with all other treatment options. The addition of OA to IV antibiotics, both with and without MBP, was associated with a reduction in incisional SSI by greater than 50%. There were minimal differences between treatments in anastomotic leak and in any of the secondary outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

This NMA demonstrated that the addition of OA to IV antibiotics were associated with a reduction in incisional SSI by greater than 50%. The results support the addition of OA to IV antibiotics to reduce incisional SSI among patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery.

Surgical site infections — management recommendations: Suture removal plus incision and drainage should be performed for surgical site infections (strong, low). Adjunctive systemic antimicrobial therapy is not routinely indicated, but in conjunction with incision and drainage may be beneficial for surgical site infections with a significant systemic response such as erythema and induration extending > 5 cm from the wound edge, temperature > 38.5° C, heart rate > 110 beats/minute, or white blood cell (WBC) count > 12 000/μL (weak, low). A brief course of systemic antimicrobial therapy is indicated in patients with surgical site infections following clean operations on the trunk, head and neck, or extremities that also have systemic signs of infection (strong, low). For infections following operations on the axilla, gastrointestinal tract, perineum, or female genital tract, agents active against gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes, such as a cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone in combination with metronidazole, are recommended (strong, low).

### Negative pressure wound therapy for surgical wounds healing by primary closure [^116aaDxd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

An estimated 4511 operations per 100,000 population are carried out annually worldwide, equating to one operation each year for every 22 people (Lancet Commission on Global Surgery 2015). This figure is higher in high‐income countries. For example, in Australia in 2013/14, there were approximately 2.4 million surgical procedures in a population of 23.4 million, or around one operation each year for every 10 people (ABS 2014). One of the complications of surgery is surgical site infection (SSI), which is an infection that occurs at the site of a surgical incision or in an organ space within 30 days of the surgery. The overall incidence of SSI is 1.9% (Berrios‐Torres 2017), but it may be as high as 40% in some populations (Maehara 2017). The impact on patients of experiencing surgical complications such as an SSI can be considerable (Pinto 2016; Tanner 2012). As well as causing pain and discomfort for the patient, SSI increases the length of hospital stay and the cost of treatment (De Lissovoy 2009).

### Intraoperative surgical site infection control and prevention: a position paper and future addendum to WSES intra-abdominal infections guidelines [^115uvxza]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical site infections (SSI) are a common type of healthcare-associated infections and frequent complication of hospitalization, responsible for prolonged hospital stay, increased intensive care unit admissions, hospital readmissions after surgery, significantly increased costs (1300–5000 USD per SSI), and delays to adjuvant systemic therapy; they occur in 2 to 5% of patients undergoing surgery in the USA.

Approximately 160,000 to 300,000 SSI are diagnosed and treated every year and represent a considerable burden for healthcare systems in terms of re-operation, increased post-surgical pain, poor wound healing, prolonged hospital stay, cosmetic appearance, and decreased quality of life.

SSI has also been shown to be an independent risk factor in the development of incisional hernia.

The incidence of all types of SSI following abdominal surgery can reach 14% of all hospital-acquired infections and the most common form is the incisional superficial SSI, which is often the first to appear and is easy to diagnose.

While more data are available from Western healthcare settings, SSI was the leading cause of hospital-acquired infection in a systematic review of studies in low- and middle-income countries.

They also a result in deleterious softer endpoints such as patient psychosocial distress, loss of income, and decreased productivity.

Multiple interventions have been proposed and employed over the past decades in an attempt to prevent SSI. These include skin cleansing protocols, hair removal, the maintenance of intraoperative normothermia, the preoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis administration, the use of plastic adhesive skin barriers, the high flow oxygen supplementation, the wound protection, the sterility of instruments, the bowel preparation, the length of the incision, and the delayed primary incision closure.

The development of SSI is multifactorial, and it may be related to patient's risk factors such as age, comorbidities, smoking habit, obesity, malnutrition, immunosuppression, malignancies, and the class of contamination of the wound.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^1151PCTJ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Importantly, the guidelines recommend that antibiotic prophylaxis should be used to prevent infections before and during surgery only. Antibiotics should not be used after surgery, as is often done. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered for operative procedures that have a high rate of postoperative surgical site infection, or when foreign materials are implanted. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered within 120 min prior to the incision. However, administration of the first dose of antibiotics is dependent on its pharmacological characteristics. Underlying patient factors may also affect drug disposition (e.g. malnourishment, obesity, cachexia, and renal disease with protein loss may result in suboptimal antibiotic exposure through increased antibiotic clearance in the presence of normal or augmented renal function). Additional antibiotic doses should be administered intraoperatively for procedures > 2–4 h (typically where duration exceeds two half-lives of the antibiotic). There is no evidence to support the use of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The key evidence-based recommendations outlined in these guidelines should be adopted by all healthcare staff that care for surgical patients throughout all stages of that patient's surgical care.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) after operations — initial management and when to use antibiotics — are outlined as follows: surveillance standards mandate 30 days of follow-up for operations without placement of prosthetic material and for 1 year for operations where a prosthesis was inserted; the most important therapy for an SSI is to open the incision, evacuate the infected material, and continue dressing changes until the wound heals by secondary intention; if there is < 5 cm of erythema and induration with minimal systemic signs (temperature < 38.5°C, white blood cell (WBC) count < 12 000 cells/μL, and pulse < 100 beats/minute), antibiotics are unnecessary; patients with temperature > 38.5°C or heart rate > 110 beats/minute or erythema extending beyond the wound margins for > 5 cm may require a short course (eg, 24–48 hours) of antibiotics and opening of the suture line; for intestinal or female genital tract operations with mixed flora, antibiotics considered suitable for treatment of intra-abdominal infection are appropriate, and when MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) risk is present the initial antibiotic should include vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, telavancin, or ceftaroline plus piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem, or ceftriaxone and metronidazole for gram-negative and anaerobic coverage; for incision and drainage of superficial abscesses, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended.

Out of these 2.3% wound infection did not lead to mesh removal in two third of cases, but one third of wound infections did result in mesh removal [16]. In a pooled data analysis (level 2A) by Pierce et al. [52], wound infections were found in 1.3% of cases after laparoscopic repair and mesh infections in 0.9% of the cases, whereas after open operation, the wound infection rate was 10.9%, and the mesh infection rate was 3.2% (p < 0.0001). In a large clinical case series and case analyses (level 3), mesh infections were detected after laparoscopic IPOM in 0.78% (n = 6,206) [18], 0.90% (n = 4.582) [52], and 0.70% (n = 850) [6] of the patients. In the literature, case reports on the treatment of mesh infections after laparoscopic repair of incisional and ventral hernias discuss both mesh removal [24, 53] and mesh salvage [54, 55].

For interventional and conservative treatment of a mesh infection after laparoscopic repair of incisional and ventral hernias, Aguila et al. [54] and Trunzo et al. [55] advocate percutaneous drainage of accumulated pus around the mesh and insertion of a drain through which irrigation with gentamycin 80 mg in 20 mL saline solution is carried out three times daily together with intravenous antibiotic treatment.

Treatment of mesh infection also depends on the material used. In a comparative study (level 2B), Hawn et al. [56] demonstrated significantly less need to remove a PP mesh than a PTFE mesh because of a mesh infection (p < 0.0001). Petersen et al. [57] also showed that for mesh repair of incisional hernias, with which mesh infection occurring in 8.1% of cases after the use of ePTFE and in 3.9% after the use of PP, in no case was it possible to salvage the infected ePTFE mesh, whereas all the infected PP meshes were preserved. Hence the chances of mesh salvage after infection are greater with PP meshes than with ePTFE meshes, which usually have to be explanted.

Criteria include a deep incision deliberately opened by a surgeon, physician, or physician designee with organism(s) identified from deep soft tissues by culture or non-culture-based testing, or if testing is not performed then patient signs or symptoms such as fever (> 38°C) or localized pain or tenderness; alternatively, an abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision detected on gross anatomical exam, histopathologic exam, or imaging test meets the definition. Two types are listed: deep incisional primary and deep incisional secondary.

### Effect of microdoses of incisional antibiotics on the rate of surgical site infections in skin cancer surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^111YgVoB]. JAMA Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Surgical site infections (SSIs) represent a costly and preventable complication of cutaneous surgery. However, there is a paucity of randomized clinical trials investigating antibiotic prophylaxis for reducing SSIs in skin cancer surgery, and evidence-based guidelines are lacking. Incisional antibiotics have been shown to reduce the rate of SSIs before Mohs micrographic surgery, but this represents a small subset of skin cancer surgery.

Objective

To determine whether microdosed incisional antibiotics reduce the rate of SSIs before skin cancer surgery.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this double-blind, controlled, parallel-design randomized clinical trial, adult patients presenting to a high-volume skin cancer treatment center in Auckland, New Zealand, for any form of skin cancer surgery over 6 months from February to July 2019 were included. Patient presentations were randomized to one of 3 treatment arms. Data were analyzed from October 2021 to February 2022.

Interventions

Patients received an incision site injection of buffered local anesthetic alone (control), buffered local anesthetic with microdosed flucloxacillin (500 µg/mL), or buffered local anesthetic with microdosed clindamycin (500 µg/mL).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the rate of postoperative SSI (calculated as number of lesions with SSI per total number of lesions in the group), defined as a standardized postoperative wound infection score of 5 or more.

Results

A total of 681 patients (721 total presentations; 1133 total lesions) returned for postoperative assessments and were analyzed. Of these, 413 (60.6%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 70.4 (14.8) years. Based on treatment received, the proportion of lesions exhibiting a postoperative wound infection score of 5 or greater was 5.7% (22 of 388) in the control arm, 5.3% (17 of 323) in the flucloxacillin arm, and 2.1% (9 of 422) in the clindamycin arm (P = 0.01 for clindamycin vs control). Findings were similar after adjusting for baseline differences among arms. Compared with lesions in the control arm (31 of 388 [8.0%]), significantly fewer lesions in the clindamycin arm (9 of 422 [2.1%]; P < .001) and flucloxacillin (13 of 323 [4.0%]; p = 0.03) arms required postoperative systemic antibiotics.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study evaluated the use of incisional antibiotics for SSI prophylaxis in general skin cancer surgery and compared the efficacy of flucloxacillin vs clindamycin relative to control in cutaneous surgery. The significant reduction in SSI with locally applied microdosed incisional clindamycin provides robust evidence to inform treatment guidelines in this area, which are currently lacking.

Surgical site infection (SSI) definitions — classification and timing specify that an SSI is defined as an infection of the incision, organ, or space that occurs after surgery; SSIs are classified by depth as superficial (involving the skin and subcutaneous tissues), deep (involving the fascial and muscle layers), and organ space; and an SSI is further defined as occurring within 30 (superficial SSI and deep SSI without an implant in place) to 90 (deep SSI when an implant is in place) days, with the CDC having originally defined deep SSI within 1 year when an implant was left in place but in 2016 reducing this timeframe to within 90 days.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^114YuKjc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The pathogens isolated from infections differ, primarily depending on the type of surgical procedure. In clean-contaminated or contaminated surgical procedures, the aerobic and anaerobic pathogens of the normal endogenous microflora of the surgically resected organ are the most frequently isolated pathogens. In clean surgical procedures, in which the gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and respiratory tracts have not been entered, Staphylococcus aureus from the exogenous environment or the patient's skin flora is the usual cause of infection. Nevertheless, in some specific body areas such as the groin skin could also be colonized by enteric flora. Moreover, it is possible that procedures such as hip prosthesis or vascular bypass, performed on this anatomical region, might eventually be infected by Gram-negative bacteria.

Sganga et al. have recently reported that the risk factors associated with SSIs caused by Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), identified using the Delphi method were patients from long-stay care facilities, a hospitalization within the preceding 30 days, Charlson score > 5 points, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and thoracic surgery, antibiotic therapy with beta-lactams (especially cephalosporins), and carbapenems and/or quinolones in the preceding 30 days, age 75 years or older, current duration of hospitalization > 16 days, and surgery with prosthesis implantation.

An important determinant of SSI is the integrity of host defenses. Important host factors include the following: age, malnutrition status, diabetes, smoking, obesity, colonization with microorganisms, length of hospital stay or previous hospitalization, shock and hypoxemia, and hypothermia.

It is a common practice to cover surgical wounds with a dressing. The dressing acts as a physical barrier to protect the wound from contamination from the external environment until the wound becomes impermeable to microorganisms.

Postoperative care bundles recommend that surgical dressings be kept undisturbed for a minimum of 48 h after surgery unless leakage occurs. However, there are currently no specific recommendations or guidelines regarding the type of surgical dressing.

The diagnosis of incisional surgical site infection is clinical. Symptoms may include localized erythema, induration, warmth, and pain at the incision site. Purulent wound drainage and separation of the wound may occur. Most patients have systemic signs of infection such as fever and leukocytosis. Information on the microbiological species present in the wound is useful for determining antibiotic choice and predicting response to treatment.

### 2017 HRS expert consensus statement on cardiovascular implantable electronic device lead management and extraction [^113d4qMf]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Medium credibility.

Blood culture positivity and superficial incisional infection — device management: Generally, a single positive blood culture with no other clinical evidence of infection should not result in removal of the CIED system. However, Staphylococcus aureus should always be considered a pathogen, and evaluation for a likely source should be undertaken. Superficial or incisional infection without device involvement is not an indication for CIED removal. Superficial incisional infection involves only skin and the subcutaneous tissue of the incision, not penetrating to the deep soft tissues (eg, fascia and/or muscle) of the incision, and does not present late after a CIED intervention. Patients with superficial incisional infection or hematoma can present early after CIED intervention with signs of inflammation, such as pain, tenderness, erythema, and local warmth; the patient should be closely followed for progression to a deeper infection, which would require extraction, and Seven to 10 days of oral antibiotic therapy with activity against staphylococci is reasonable.

Superficial incisional surgical site infections

The infection occurs within 30 days after the operation and involves only the skin or subcutaneous tissue at the incision and at least one of the following:
purulent drainage, with or without laboratory confirmation, from the superficial incision;
organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue from the superficial incision;
at least one of the following signs or symptoms of infection: pain or tenderness, localized swelling, redness, or heat; the site is deliberately opened by the surgeon, unless ithe incision is culture-negative.

Deep incisional surgical site infections

The infection occurs within 30 days after the operation if no implant is left in place or within 1 year if an implant is left in the body and the infection appears to be related to the operation and involves deep soft tissues (e.g. fascial and muscle layers) at the incision site and at least one of the following:
purulent drainage from the deep incision but not from the organ/space component of the surgical site;
a deep incision spontaneously dehisces or is deliberately opened by a surgeon when the patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fever (> 38 °C), localized pain, or tenderness, unless the site is culture-negative.
an abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision is found on direct examination, during reoperation, or by histopathological or radiological examination.

### Negative pressure wound therapy for surgical wounds healing by primary closure [^115ziMqp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

One early systematic review of NPWT included chronic and acute wounds and was published before seven of our included trials were undertaken (Ubbink 2008); it also included an earlier trial that we excluded from our review (Moisidis 2004), so results are not comparable. Our findings also differ from those of two other systematic reviews that evaluated the effectiveness of NPWT for incisional wounds. Important differences in the inclusion criteria account for the differences: the first review included 10 RCTs and five observational studies (Ingargiola 2013), and the second review included 33 publications, seven of which were RCTs, with the remainder consisting of a combination of non‐comparative case series, comparative cohort studies, and comparative laboratory studies (Karlakki 2013). The most recent systematic review of NPWT for closed surgical wounds included 10 trials and found a reduction in the rate of SSI and seroma in the NPWT group (Hyldig 2016). The review included one trial (Grauhan 2013), which we excluded because it was a quasi‐RCT. It also included data that the author obtained from personal correspondence with the investigator of an unpublished trial, to which we had no access. More recent systematic reviews have focused on specific surgical indications (caesarean section, laparotomy) and have included non‐randomised studies as well as RCTs (Sahebally 2018; Yu 2018). Although we have included many more RCTs, our conclusions are consistent with previous general reviews including RCTs; that is, that the quality of the studies may limit any firm conclusions regarding the relative effectiveness of NPWT and standard dressings while the results of further RCTs are likely to affect findings. This conclusion is consistent with evidence‐based recommendations for the use of NPWT, which cover a range of applications, including NPWT for acute wounds (Krug 2011), but differs from the latest World Health Organization (WHO) guideline for the prevention of surgical site infection (WHO 2016). The WHO guideline states: "The panel suggests the use of prophylactic negative pressure wound therapy (pNPWT) in adult patients on primarily closed surgical incisions in high‐risk wounds". However, the recommendation was labelled "conditional" based on a number of issues, including low‐quality evidence and the inclusion of non‐RCT evidence. Finally, Willy 2017 published international multidisciplinary consensus recommendations suggesting the use of NPWT for a number of patient categories, including those at high risk of SSI. The review contained 100 studies (including RCTs, case series, editorials, cohort studies, technical reports, systematic reviews, and expert opinion), so the conclusions are highly uncertain. In addition, two employees of Acelity, NPWT device manufacturers, were involved in preparing the manuscript, and all of the authors of the review are consultants to an Acelity company (Willy 2017).

### Dressings for the prevention of surgical site infection [^115NBEuD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical wounds (incisions) heal by primary intention when the wound edges are brought together and secured - often with sutures, staples, clips or glue. Wound dressings, usually applied after wound closure, provide physical support, protection from bacterial contamination and absorb exudate. Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common complication of surgical wounds that may delay healing.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of wound dressings for preventing SSI in people with surgical wounds healing by primary intention.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 10 May 2011); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011 Issue 2); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to April Week 4 2011); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, May 9, 2011); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 18); EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 6 May 2011). There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing alternative wound dressings or wound dressings with leaving wounds exposed for postoperative management of surgical wounds healing by primary intention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction independently.

Main Results

Sixteen RCTs were included (2578 participants). All trials were at unclear or high risk of bias. Nine trials included people with wounds resulting from surgical procedures with a contamination classification of 'clean', two trials included people with wounds resulting from surgical procedures with a 'clean/contaminated' contamination classification and the remaining trials evaluated people with wounds resulting from various surgical procedures with different contamination classifications. Two trials compared wound dressings with leaving wounds exposed. The remaining 14 trials compared two alternative dressing types. No evidence was identified to suggest that any dressing significantly reduced the risk of developing an SSI compared with leaving wounds exposed or compared with alternative dressings in people who had surgical wounds healing by secondary intention.

Authors' Conclusions

At present, there is no evidence to suggest that covering surgical wounds healing by primary intention with wound dressings reduces the risk of SSI or that any particular wound dressing is more effective than others in reducing the rates of SSI, improving scarring, pain control, patient acceptability or ease of dressing removal. Most trials in this review were small and of poor quality at high or unclear risk of bias. However, based on the current evidence, we conclude that decisions on wound dressing should be based on dressing costs and the symptom management properties offered by each dressing type e.g. exudate management.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^114gNKNn]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the best treatment of incisional SSIs? When are antibiotics needed?

Incisional SSIs require prompt and wide opening of the surgical incision. We recommend antibiotic therapy for incisional SSIs with any Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria or signs of organ failure such as hypotension, oliguria, decreased mental alertness, or in immunocompromised patients (recommendation 1C).

SSIs are generally classified according to CDC criteria. SSIs are classified as superficial incisional infection, deep incisional infection, and organ space infection. Superficial incisional infections are the most common type of SSIs. Deep incisional and organ/space are the types of SSIs that cause the most morbidity. Organ space infections are not genuine soft-tissue infections.

Incisional SSIs are the results of several factors. All surgical wounds are contaminated by bacteria, but only a minority actually develops clinical infection. Colonization occurs when the bacteria begin to replicate and adhere to the wound site. If the host's immune response is not sufficient to eliminate or overcome the effects of the bacteria, infection occurs. In most patients, infection does not develop because host defenses are efficient to eliminate colonizers at the surgical site; however, in some patients, host defenses fail to protect them from SSIs. It is well known that surgical trauma increases inflammatory response and counter-regulatory mechanisms. Such regulatory mechanism can decrease postoperative immune response, promoting SSIs.

### Meta-analysis of negative-pressure wound therapy for closed surgical incisions [^112TJBLa]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

This systematic review and meta‐analysis has demonstrated that iNPWT reduces the rate of a number of wound complications compared with standard postoperative dressings. However, more RCTs should be performed. This is especially important for specific high‐risk surgical patients, such as those with diabetes or obesity. These trials should be suitably powered and follow international guidelines in methodology. The length of follow‐up should be 30 days when wound infection is the outcome of interest, expanded to 1 year if an implant is left in place. An economic evaluation should also be performed as part of the clinical trial.

### Antibiotics for uncomplicated skin abscesses after incision… [^117K9Mud]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- TMP-SMX or clindamycin can be combined with incision and drainage of skin abscesses to decrease the risk of treatment failure and recurrence.
- TMP-SMX is weakly recommended over clindamycin because of its lower risk of diarrhea.
- Cephalosporins are not likely to have reduced rates of treatment failure compared with incision and drainage alone. Staphylococcus aureus). Current clinical guidelines recommend against the use of antibiotics for uncomplicated lesions after incision and drainage. Recently, however, a collaboration between the BMJ and the MAGIC group led an international panel made up of a variety of health care professionals and adults with experience treating and living with skin abscesses to create recommendations regarding antibiotic use based on identified benefits, harms, cost, treatment burden, evidence quality, and patient preferences.

Recommendations Based on high-quality evidence, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or clindamycin combined with incision and drainage has been shown to decrease the risk of treatment failure by approximately 5% at one month and the risk of recurrence by approximately 8% at three months compared with no antibiotic treatment. TMPSMX and clindamycin also are associated with decreases in pain, hospitalizations, and infections in household contacts based on moderate-quality evidence. There is no crucial difference in treatment failure between TMP-SMX and clindamycin, and both have similar risk of recurrence. TMP-SMX is typically taken twice per day, and clindamycin is taken three or four times per day; both are often combined with over-the-counter pain medication. This decision should be made in conjunction with the patient to ensure that the option chosen is in line with what the patient determines is most important with regard to desirable outcomes and undesirable consequences.

Patients who prefer to avoid recurrence may opt to take clindamycin, whereas those who prefer avoiding diarrhea may select TMP-SMX. Although cephalosporins or other antibiotics are often prescribed for skin abscesses, in most circumstances, including settings with high rates of methicillin-resistant. S. aureus, cephalosporins are not likely to have reduced rates of treatment failure compared with incision and drainage alone. For this reason, believing that most patients would want to take an antibiotic that has been demonstrated to be effective, including TMPSMX or clindamycin, the panel strongly recommends against the use of cephalosporins.

### Network meta-analysis of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of surgical-site infection after groin hernia surgery [^115S2Pec]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Interventions and comparators

The interventions were systemic administration of antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery. Antibiotics were then categorized according to class: first‐generation cephalosporins (such as cefazolin, cephaloridine), second‐generation cephalosporins (cefotetan, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, cefoxitin), third‐generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone), β‐lactam combined with β‐lactamase inhibitors (combinations of amoxicillin and clavulanate, ampicillin and sulbactam, or ampicillin and clavulanate) and fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin). The comparators were placebo or no treatment, and active controls if any of the antibiotics described above were used.

Outcome of interest

The outcome of interest was SSI, defined according to the original studies using either the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria 4 or clinical signs and symptoms. Briefly, SSI was an infection involving superficial or deep soft tissues at the incision site that occurred within 30 days or 1 year respectively after the operation. Superficial SSI was defined by the presence of at least one of the following: purulent drainage with, or without laboratory confirmation; positive organisms isolated from fluid or tissue from the superficial incision; having one or more signs or symptoms (pain or tenderness, localized swelling, redness, opened superficial incision by surgeon); and diagnosis of superficial incisional SSI by the surgeon or attending physician. Deep SSI involved deep soft tissues (fascial and muscle layers) of the incision with at least one of the following: purulent drainage from the deep incision; a deep incision deliberately opened by a surgeon; abscess; or diagnosis by surgeon or attending physician.

Risk‐of‐bias assessment

The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated by risk‐of‐bias assessment 36. This included random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinded outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. Disagreement was resolved by consensus and discussion with a third party.

Data extraction

Data extraction was done by two authors independently. Characteristics of studies and patients were extracted. These included: setting, follow‐up interval, mean age, BMI, percentage of men, percentage with diabetes, SSI criteria, percentage with ASA fitness grade higher than II, duration of surgery, and type of intervention and comparator. Cross‐tabulated data between intervention and SSI were also extracted. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion.

### Surgical site infection prevention and management in immunocompromised patients: a systematic review of the literature [^114Kfq7K]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical site infection (SSI) is a global health issue. Both general and emergency surgery are burdened by a high rate of SSI in immunocompetent patients (IP). Immunocompromised state, in fact, and wound healing-impairing drugs assumption additionally increase the risk of infection. Reported SSI rate among transplanted patients is up to 27% and up to a quarter of them may need an interventional (or surgical) procedure. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) released guidelines on SSI prevention. While some interventions aiming to reduce SSI are shared and accepted (i.e. antiseptic surgical prep, perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis) others lack definitive evidence. The use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT vs. standard dressing (SD)) for example, was suggested with a low quality of evidence for high-risk patients. It has been proposed that when NPWT is applied to the surgical incisional wound with closed suture (iNPWT), it would reduce the rate of SSI, especially in a high-risk population, and some series also individuated a benefit in the acute care surgery. iNPWT is usually not considered harmful, but it is expensive compared to SD, therefore accurate evaluation of the cost-benefit balance is needed.

Other wound management and dressing techniques have been evaluated in the literature trying to reduce SSI incidence, but no definitive results have been obtained. Moreover, management of perioperative steroids, immunomodulatory drugs and additional "wound-healing" impacting medication is far from being fully understood. Lastly, transplanted patient carries peculiar challenges given the acquired immunocompromised condition which can be only partially modulated from the treating physician. This review aims to address the best intervention to optimize wound management and minimize complications in general and emergency surgery in immunocompromised and high-risk patients.

Basing on the existing literature, five principal areas of interest were investigated: (1) specific intervention in transplanted patients and in patients under immunomodulatory therapy undergoing surgery, (2) perioperative management of drugs affecting wound healing/SSI, (3) oncological patients operated under chemotherapy, (4) wound dressing in immunocompromised patients, and (5) high-risk patients undergoing general or emergency surgery.

### Controlling the controls: what is negative pressure wound therapy compared to in clinical trials? [^1179giLZ]. Colorectal Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

Surgical site infections (SSIs) are common following colorectal operations. Clinical trials suggest that closed incision negative pressure wound therapy (ciNPWT) may reduce SSIs compared to a 'standard of care' group. However, wound management in the standard of care group may vary. The aim of this review was to assess the control arms in trials of ciNPWT for potential confounding variables that could influence the rates of SSI and therefore the trial outcomes.

Methods

A mapping review of the PubMed database was undertaken in the English language for randomized controlled trials that assessed, in closed surgical wounds, the use of ciNPWT compared to standard of care with SSI as an outcome. Data regarding wound care to assess potential confounding factors that may influence SSI rates were compared between the ciNPWT and standard of care groups. Included were the method of wound closure, control dressing type, frequency of dressing changes and postoperative wound care (washing).

Results

Twenty-seven trials were included in the mapping review. There was heterogeneity in ciNPWT duration. There was little control in the comparator standard of care groups with a variety of wound closure techniques and different control dressings used. Overall standard of care dressings were changed more frequently than the ciNPWT dressing and there was no control over wound care or washing. No standard for 'standard of care' was apparent.

Conclusion

In randomized trials assessing the intervention of ciNPWT compared to standard of care there was considerable heterogeneity in the comparator groups and no standard of care was apparent. Heterogeneity in dressing protocols for standard of care groups could introduce potential confounders impacting SSI rates. There is a need to standardize care in ciNPWT trials to assess potential meaningful differences in SSI prevention.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^117Et4Zb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) — surgical-site infections: Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair leads to fewer surgical-site infections compared to open repair and should therefore be considered in patients with higher risk for infection (High level, strong recommendation). In a recent multicenter randomized trial of laparoscopic versus open ventral incisional hernia repair in 162 patients, surgical-site infections were significantly fewer in the laparoscopic group (2.8% versus 21.9%; OR, 10.5; 95% CI, 2.3–48.2; p = 0.003). A meta-analysis of eight randomized trials comparing laparoscopic and open incisional or ventral hernia repair with mesh revealed decreased SSI rates with laparoscopic repair (relative risk, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.09–0.54) and a trend toward fewer infections requiring mesh removal.

### Focus on the prophylaxis, epidemiology and therapy of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus surgical site infections and a position paper on associated risk factors: the perspective of an Italian group of surgeons [^116ZScCb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical site infections (SSIs) remain a major clinical problem in terms of morbidity, mortality, time spent in hospital and overall direct and indirect costs. Despite progress in their prevention, SSIs remain one of the most common adverse events in hospitals, accounting for 11% to 26% of all healthcare-associated infections. Surgical patients can develop several post-operative infections; wound infections, are common causes of post-operative morbidity and prolonged hospitalization. SSIs increase the total hospital bill by an additional 10–20%, lead to 80,000 deaths and are associated with an annual treatment cost of two billion US dollars. S. aureus SSIs can be life-threatening, being associated with a mortality rate of 5%, more than 2 extra weeks of time spent in hospital and around an extra cost of 50,000 US dollars.

Nearly 60% of SSIs are diagnosed after discharge from the hospital. This percentage is rising as the post-operative stay in hospital is getting shorter and the number of 1-day surgical procedures is increasing over time. The Diagnosis Related-Group (DRG) system underestimates the rate of SSIs because of the very early discharge of surgical patients. The exact incidence of SSIs is, therefore, difficult to determine. According to current literature, active SSI surveillance is useful in reducing the incidence of SSIs by surveillance-induced infection control efforts. When any prosthesis is implanted into the body during general surgery, cardiac surgery, orthopaedics, etc. beside S. aureus, Coagulase-negative Staphylococci, especially S. epidermidis, may be the cause of severe infections that can necessitate removal of the prosthesis.

Classification of surgical site infections

The identification of SSIs involves interpretation of clinical and laboratory findings. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance system has developed standardized surveillance criteria for defining SSIs. According to these criteria, SSIs are classified as being either incisional or organ/space. Incisional SSIs are further divided into those involving only skin and subcutaneous tissue (superficial incisional SSIs) and those involving deeper soft tissues of the incision (deep incisional SSIs).

The need for standardized definitions of SSI

Standardizing the SSI definition is a challenge that requires a multidisciplinary expertise and allocation of time and resources. A systematic review by Bruce et al. identified 41 different definitions for SSI addressed in the literature among which very few were standardized and set by multidisciplinary groups. SSI definitions are based on multiple factors such as site of infection and type of incision, presence of purulent discharge, clinical signs and symptoms, or physician diagnosis in a specific surveillance population, and laboratory results. The Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) refers SSI to "an infection that occurs after surgery in the part of the body where the surgery took place. Surgical site infections can sometimes be superficial infections involving the skin only. Other surgical site infections are more serious and can involve tissues under the skin, organs, or implanted material"; other definition by the ECDC consider SSI as "an infection that occurs within 30 days after the operation and involves the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the incision (superficial incisional) and/or the deep soft tissue (for example, fascia, muscle) of the incision (deep incisional) and/or any part of the anatomy (for example, organs and spaces) other than the incision that was opened or manipulated during an operation (organ/space)". In limited resources settings, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends to define SSI based on clinical signs and symptoms given the lack of quality microbiology laboratory support. The variability of SSI definitions and the methods used for the detection of infection should be accounted for when comparing evidence from different studies. Inconsistent application of definitions across all sites and time periods can generate poor data resulting from SSI surveillance which can potentially lead to underreporting of the disease, and invalid inter-country and inter-network infection rate comparisons and benchmarking.

### Current outcomes and predictors of treatment failure in patients with surgical site infection after elective colorectal surgery. A multicentre prospective cohort study [^111nwNYD]. The Journal of Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine current outcomes and predictors of treatment failure among patients with surgical site infection (SSI) after colorectal surgery.

Methods

A multicentre observational prospective cohort study of adults undergoing elective colorectal surgery in 10 Spanish hospitals (2011–2014). Treatment failure was defined as persistence of signs/symptoms of SSI or death at 30 days post-surgery.

Results

Of 3701 patients, 669 (18.1%) developed SSI; 336 (9.1%) were organ-space infections. Among patients with organ-space SSI, 81.2% required source control: 60.4% reoperation and 20.8% percutaneous/transrectal drainage. Overall treatment failure rate was 21.7%: 9% in incisional SSIs and 34.2% in organ-space SSIs (p < 0.001). Median length of stay was 15 days (IQR 9–22) for incisional SSIs and 24 days (IQR 17–35) for organ-space SSIs (p < 0.001). One hundred and twenty-seven patients (19%) required readmission and 35 patients died (5.2%). Risk factors for treatment failure among patients with organ-space SSI were age ≥ 65 years (OR 1.83, 95% CI: 1.07–1.83), laparoscopy (OR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.06–2.77), and reoperation (OR 2.8, 95% CI: 1.7–4.6).

Conclusions

Rates of SSI and treatment failure in organ-space SSI after elective colorectal surgery are notably high. Careful attention should be paid to older patients with previous laparoscopy requiring reoperation for organ-space SSI, so that treatment failure can be identified early.

### Delphi consensus on intraoperative technical / surgical aspects to prevent surgical site infection after colorectal surgery [^116VXBd3]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Wound irrigation

Statement 4.1: Antibiotic incisional wound irrigation should not be used for reducing SSI risk.

Statement 4.2: Wound irrigation with aqueous iodine is associated with reduced SSI risk when compared with no irrigation in high-risk, contaminated wounds.

Incisional wound irrigation involves the use of a solution in an open wound to remove cellular debris and reduce microbial contamination/bacterial load at the end of a surgical procedure. A variety of solutions may be used, including saline, an aqueous iodophor such as povidone-iodine (PVP-I), or antibiotics. Use of each irrigating solution during surgery is dependent on a number of factors and the patient population.

A large meta-analysis of various types of surgery analyzed a subgroup of RCTs in clean and clean-contaminated surgery and reported that PVP-I significantly reduced SSI compared with saline irrigation (OR = 0.31; 95% CI 0.13–0.73). Conversely, antibiotic wound irrigation did not impact SSI risk when compared with saline (OR = 1.16; 95% CI 0.64–2.12). Another meta-analysis of RCTs in abdominal surgery reported that PVP-I irrigation resulted in significantly lower SSI compared with no irrigation (OR = 0.70; 95% CI 0.51–0.97), whereas no significant difference was observed between saline irrigation compared with no irrigation (OR = 0.64; 95% CI 0.28–1.46). Another observational cohort of 122 patients reported that irrigation with 0.05% chlorohexidine reduces SSI compared with saline irrigation (18% compared with 31.6%; p < 0.001). Guidelines from WHO and CDC have suggested that intraoperative subcutaneous/incisional irrigation with PVP-I should be used. However, CDC, NICE, and WHO have suggested uncertain tradeoffs or recommended against the use of antibiotic solutions for incisional wound irrigation, in particular the risk of promoting antimicrobial resistance. -

Despite the wealth of evidence from meta-analyses on wound irrigation, the information is heterogenous and may have a risk of bias, thereby creating challenges in drawing meaningful conclusions. The most compelling evidence appears to favor wound irrigation with PVP-I to reduce SSI whereas evidence for saline irrigation is weak and antibiotic irrigation unfavorable given risk/benefit tradeoffs.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: prevention of surgical site infection after major extremity trauma [^1125CU83]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

Prevention of Surgical Site Infections After Major Extremity Trauma Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline is based on a systematic review of current scientific and clinical research. This clinical practice guideline (CPG) is designed to assist qualified physicians and clinicians when making treatment decisions for adults (18 years or older) who have sustained major extremity trauma. The CPG workgroup defined major extremity trauma as an open fracture, a major/high-energy closed fracture, a degloving injury, Morel-Lavallée lesions, a low-energy or high-energy gunshot injury, a crush injury, a blast injury, or any other moderate-energy to high-energy injury. This guideline contains 14 recommendations that evaluate preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative interventions to limit the risk of surgical site infections after major extremity trauma while also identifying and evaluating potential patient-specific risk factors to consider. Another six options formulated with either low-quality evidence, no evidence, or conflicting evidence are also presented and discussed in the CPG. These include the use of incisional negative-pressure wound therapy for high-risk surgical incisions, the implementation of an orthoplastic team, the possible role of hyperbaric O2, the value of various preoperative skin preparations, and select modifiable and administrative risk factors.

### Management of surgical site infections [^113Pn2w9]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). Medium credibility.

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons has developed Appropriate Use Criteria for the Management of Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) (website: http://www.orthoguidelines.org/go/auc/default.cfm?auc_id = 225018&actionxm = Terms). Evidence-based information, in conjunction with the clinical expertise of physicians, was used to develop the criteria to improve patient care and obtain best outcomes while considering the subtleties and distinctions necessary in making clinical decisions. The Appropriate Use Criteria for the Management of SSIs were derived by identifying clinical indications typical of patients commonly presenting with a SSI in clinical practice. These indications were most often parameters observable by the clinician, including symptoms and diagnostic tests. The 264 patient scenarios and nine treatments were developed by the writing panel, which consisted of a group of clinicians who are specialists in this Appropriate Use Criteria topic. Next, a separate, multidisciplinary, voting panel (made up of specialists and nonspecialists) rated the appropriateness of treatment of each patient scenario using a nine-point scale to designate a treatment as appropriate (median rating, seven to nine), may be appropriate (median rating, four to six), or rarely appropriate (median rating, one to three).

All patients were assessed for iSSI and AL. Analysis of iSSI demonstrated consistency between direct and indirect measurements (χ² = 1.03, p = 0.59), local consistency with all loops having an inconsistency factor (IF) < 1.0 and no evidence of publication bias (Figure S1). The best ranking (Figure 3) was achieved with IV + OA (71% probability of being the best treatment) followed by MBP + IV + OA (71% probability of being the second‐best treatment). In order of ranking, these were followed by IV, MBP + IV and OA. Patients treated with either IV + OA or MBP + IV + OA had significantly fewer iSSIs when compared with any of the other treatment options (p < 0.001; Table 2; Figure 4). MBP + IV had significantly fewer associated iSSIs than OA (p = 0.045). There was no significant difference between IV + OA (460 patients) and MBP + IV + OA (538 patients).

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^1152eBNE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Executive summary

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions involving the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle and ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing infections that may involve the dermal, subcutaneous, fascia, and muscle layers.

SSTIs may affect any part of the body, although the lower extremities, the perineum, and the abdominal wall are the most common sites of involvement. SSTIs are a relatively infrequent clinical problem; however, surgeons are often called upon for their management.

These guidelines focus mainly on necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs). The mortality resulting from NSTIs appears to have decreased over the past decade, possibly due to improved recognition and earlier delivery of more effective therapy.

Successful management of NSTIs involves prompt recognition, timely surgical debridement or drainage, aggressive resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

A worldwide international panel of experts developed evidenced-based guidelines for management of soft tissue infections. The guidelines outline clinical recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy criteria summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Grading of recommendations from Guyatt and colleagues

Surgical site infections

1) Surgical site infections require prompt and wide opening of the surgical incision. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended for deep incisional surgical site infections if systemic signs of sepsis are present, if source control is incomplete or in immunocompromised patients (Recommendation 1 C).

2) In patients who have had clean operations, antimicrobial therapy should cover gram-positive organisms; in contrast, in patients who have had procedures on the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract antimicrobial therapy should cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (Recommendation 1 C).

Non necrotizing superficial soft tissue infections

3) Erysipelas, and cellulitis are managed by antimicrobial therapy against Gram-positive bacteria (Recommendation 1 C).

4) Lack of clinical response for cellulitis may be due to resistant strains of staphylococcus or streptococcus, or deeper processes, such as necrotizing fasciitis or myonecrosis (Recommendation 1 C).

5) Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours (Recommendation 1 C).

6) If a streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is suspected, an antiribosomal agent such as clindamycin or linezolid can be used to reduce exotoxin and superantigen production (Recommendation 1 C).

Surgical site infections

Question

What are the treatment and antibiotic use recommendation for surgical site infection (SSI)?

Recommendation

The treatment of an SSI involves evacuation of infected material and one to 1–2 days of antibiotics if cellulitis is > 5 cm or if significant systemic symptoms are present.

Discussion

The most important therapy for a patient with an SSI is prompt source control by removing the infected material. In superficial SSIs, removing sutures/staples may accomplish this. If the surrounding erythema is minor and the patient has no significant systemic symptoms, antibiotics are unnecessary. Otherwise, a short course of antibiotics (24–48 hours) may be appropriate, such as cefazolin for clean procedures and ceftriaxone plus metronidazole for intra-abdominal procedures. Persistence or recurrence of superficial signs/symptoms may indicate a deep or organ space SSI.

Intra-abdominal infection

Question

In patients with IAI, what is the treatment and duration?

Recommendation

Initial antibiotic selection for IAI should be based on the source of infection, local antibiogram, and clinical severity. One reasonable empiric regimen is piperacillin-tazobactam for high-risk patients (plus vancomycin or linezolid in healthcare-associated IAI and ceftriaxone plus metronidazole for low-risk patients. Uncomplicated IAI (uIAI) can be managed with a single dose of preoperative antibiotic or a maximum of 24 hours postoperatively. Complicated IAI (cIAI) can be managed with 4 days of antibiotics once source control is achieved. When source control is not possible, we recommend 5–7 days of antibiotics. There is no demonstrated benefit in empiric antifungal therapy.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: prevention of surgical site infection after major extremity trauma [^112kaEvL]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Negative pressure wound therapy – high risk surgical incisions — it is suggested to use an incisional negative pressure wound therapy for high- risk surgical incisions (e.g., pilon, plateau, or calcaneus fractures) to reduce the risk of deep surgical site infection, with Quality of Evidence: Low and Strength of Recommendation: Limited. The rationale notes a moderate quality prospective randomized trial that demonstrated reduced deep surgical site infection using NPWT, and a second earlier study reported reduced drainage using this technique. There are no reported harms. If the rate of infection can be decreased with negative pressure wound therapy, then patients' outcomes will be improved and there is potential for health care cost savings. Although the overall cost-benefit analysis is currently unknown, utilization of negative pressure wound therapy invariably adds cost to the standard treatment, however, surgical site infections are associated with worse patient outcomes, and both high healthcare and associated societal costs. Negative pressure wound therapy is used for many applications, so this practice is likely to be acceptable to many clinicians if it does not delay discharge or is not too expensive to implement. Although NPWT for post-operative wound care following ORIF for high risk closed fractures after major extremity trauma is an attractive option in selected cases, implementation will likely continue to be influenced by cost considerations.

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^114cbvjb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Appropriate surgical wound and incision management in the postoperative time period is imperative to prevent SSIs. The term "surgical wound" used in this document refers to a wound created when an incision is made with a scalpel or other sharp cutting device and then closed in the operating room by suture, staple, adhesive tape, or glue and resulting in a close approximation of the skin edges. It is traditional to cover such wounds with a dressing, which acts as a physical barrier to protect the wound from contamination from the external environment until it becomes impermeable to microorganisms.

To assess the effects of wound dressings compared with no wound dressings, and the effects of alternative wound dressings, in preventing SSIs in surgical wound healing by primary intention, a Cochrane review was published in 2016. The authors concluded that it is uncertain whether covering surgical wound healing by primary intention with wound dressings reduces the risk of SSI, or whether any particular wound dressing is more effective than others in reducing the risk of SSI, improving scarring, reducing pain, improving acceptability to patients, or is easier to remove. Most studies in this review were small and at a high or unclear risk of bias. Based on the current evidence, decision-makers may wish to base decisions about how to dress a wound following surgery on dressing costs as well as patient preference.

The WHO Global Guidelines for the Prevention of SSIs suggest not using any type of advanced dressing over a standard dressing on primarily closed surgical wounds for the purpose of preventing SSI. Low-quality evidence from ten RCTs shows that advanced dressings applied on primarily closed incisional wounds do not significantly reduce SSI rates compared to standard wound dressings. Postoperative care bundles recommend that surgical dressings be kept undisturbed for a minimum of 48 h after surgery unless leakage occurs.

Question 20. How can we engage surgeons in appropriate infection prevention and management?

Statement 20.1. Active education techniques, such as academic detailing, consensus building sessions and educational workshops, should be implemented in each hospital worldwide according to its own resources.

Statement 20.2. Surgeons with satisfactory knowledge in surgical infections should be involved in the infection control team and recognized as "champions" by the hospital's administration.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112XpKn6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Surgical site infections — incidence, classification, and timing: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the most common adverse events affecting hospitalized surgical patients, with an average incidence of SSI of 2.6%, accounting for 38% of nosocomial infections in surgical patients. SSIs are divided into the categories of superficial incisional SSI, deep incisional SSI, and organ/space SSI. Superficial incisional SSIs involve only the subcutaneous space between the skin and underlying muscular fascia, occur within 30 days of the surgery, and are documented with at least 1 of the following: purulent incisional drainage; positive culture of aseptically obtained fluid or tissue from the superficial wound; local signs and symptoms of pain or tenderness, swelling, and erythema after the incision is opened by the surgeon; or diagnosis of SSI by the attending surgeon or physician. A deep incisional infection involves the deeper soft tissue and occurs within 30 days of the operation or within 1 year if a prosthesis was inserted, and an organ/space SSI has the same time constraints and evidence for infection and may involve any part of the anatomy other than the original surgical incision. Flat, erythematous skin changes can occur around or near a surgical incision during the first week without swelling or wound drainage, most resolve without any treatment, and the cause may relate to tape sensitivity or other local tissue insult not involving bacteria. Antibiotics begun immediately postoperatively or continued for long periods after the procedure do not prevent or cure this inflammation or infection; therefore, the suspicion of possible SSI does not justify use of antibiotics without a definitive diagnosis and measures such as opening the wound. SSIs rarely occur during the first 48 hours after surgery and are almost always due to S. pyogenes or Clostridium species when they do; after 48 hours, SSI is a more common source of fever and, by 4 days after surgery, a fever is equally likely to be caused by an SSI or by another infection or other unknown sources.

### Updated recommendations for control of surgical site infections [^116ZraiQ]. Annals of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study is to provide updated guidelines for the prevention of surgical wound infections based upon review and interpretation of the current and past literature.

Background

The development and treatment of surgical wound infections has always been a limiting factor to the success of surgical treatment. Although continuous improvements have been made, surgical site infections continue to occur at an unacceptable rate, annually costing billions of dollars in economic loss caused by associated morbidity and mortality.

Methods

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) provided extensive recommendations for the control of surgical infections in 1999. Review of the current literature with interpretation of the findings has been done to update the recommendations.

Results

New and sometimes conflicting studies indicate that coordination and application of techniques and procedures to decrease wound infections will be highly successful, even in patients with very high risks.

Conclusions

This review suggests that uniform adherence to the proposed guidelines for the prevention of surgical infections could reduce wound infections significantly; namely to a target of less than 0.5% in clean wounds, less than 1% in clean contaminated wounds and less than 2% in highly contaminated wounds and decrease related costs to less than one-half of the current amount.

Surgical site infections

1) Surgical site infections require prompt and wide opening of the surgical incision. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended for deep incisional surgical site infections if systemic signs of sepsis are present, if source control is incomplete or in immunocompromised patients (Recommendation 1 C).

2) In patients who have had clean operations, antimicrobial therapy should cover gram-positive organisms; in contrast, in patients who have had procedures on the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract antimicrobial therapy should cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (Recommendation 1 C).

Surgical site infections are caused by a variety of organisms.

The pathogens isolated from infections differ, primarily depending on the type of surgical procedure. In clean surgical procedures, in which the gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and respiratory tracts have not been entered, Staphylococcus aureus from the exogenous environment or the patient's skin flora is the usual cause of infection. In other categories of surgical procedures, including clean-contaminated, contaminated, and dirty, the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora closely resembling the normal endogenous microflora of the surgically resected organ are the most frequently isolated pathogens.

Treatment involves widely opening the incision. Antimicrobial therapy is required in deep infections if systemic signs of toxicity are present, if source control is incomplete or in immunocompromised patients. Broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy should initially be selected to cover potentially resistant pathogens. Cultures should be always obtained and antimicrobial therapy modified based on the culture and sensitivity results.

Non necrotizing superficial infections

3) Erysipelas, and cellulitis are managed by antimicrobial therapy against Gram-positive bacteria (Recommendation 1 C).

4) Lack of clinical response for cellulitis may be due to resistant strains of staphylococcus or streptococcus, or deeper processes, such as necrotizing fasciitis or myonecrosis (Recommendation 1 C).

5) Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours (Recommendation 1 C).

6) If a streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is suspected, an antiribosomal agent such as clindamycin or linezolid can be used to reduce exotoxin and superantigen production (Recommendation 1 C).

World Society of Emergency Surgery classification

Treatment decisions for SSTI depend on numerous factors including the severity and depth of infection and the clinical setting.

The WSES expert panel classified soft tissue infections using the classification system illustrated below.

Surgical Site infections

Incisional
Superficial
Deep

Non-necrotizing SSTIs
Superficial infections (Impetigo, erysipelas, cellulitis)
Simple abscess, boils and carbuncles
Complex abscesses

Necrotizing SSTIs (NSTIs)
Necrotizing cellulitis
Necrotizing fasciitis
Fournier's gangrene
Necrotizing myositis

The first group includes surgical site infections (SSIs). Soft tissue non-surgical site infections are divided into non-necrotizing and necrotizing soft tissue infections.

Surgical site infections

SSIs represent a separate chapter among the soft tissue infections. They are post-operative infections and because of their multifaceted aspects they are framed into a separate group.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined criteria for classification of surgical site infections. SSIs are classified as: superficial incisional infection, deep incisional infection, and organ space infection. Superficial incisional infections are the most common type of surgical site infections. Organ space infections are not soft tissue infections.

The development of an SSI depends on contamination of the wound site at the end of a surgical procedure and specifically relates to the pathogenicity and inoculum of microorganisms present, balanced against the host's immune response.

Numerous patient-related (endogenous) and process/procedures related (exogenous) risk factors for developing an SSI have been described.

Some factors, such as age and gender, are obviously not amenable to changes or improvements. However, addressing other potential factors, such as the nutritional status, smoking, proper use of antibiotics and accurate intraoperative technique, can reduce the likelihood of SSI.

Prophylactic antibiotic administration is an established approach for reducing the risk of SSIs in various fields of elective surgery.

Non-necrotizing SSTIs

Non-necrotizing soft tissue infections include superficial infections, complex abscesses, and infections developing in damaged skin (animal and human bites). If untreated, these can evolve into necrotizing infections.

What is new in the prevention of SSIs? What are the principles of SSI prevention?

Recent global guidelines for the prevention of SSIs can support healthcare workers to develop or strengthen infection prevention and control programs, with a focus on surgical safety, as well as antimicrobial resistance action plans. We recommend that all healthcare workers adopt these evidence-based recommendations in their clinical practice (recommendation 1C).

SSIs are the most common healthcare-associated infections among surgical patients. It is obviously important to improve patient safety by reducing the occurrence of SSIs. Preventing SSIs is a global priority. Bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, making SSI prevention even more important nowadays.

SSIs are a major clinical problem in terms of morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, and overall direct and not-direct costs worldwide. Despite progress in prevention knowledge, SSIs remain one of the most common adverse events in hospitals. SSI prevention is complex and requires the integration of a range of measures before, during, and after surgery.

Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recently published guidelines for the prevention of SSIs. The 2016 WHO Global guidelines for the prevention of surgical site infection are evidence-based including systematic reviews presenting additional information in support of actions to improve practice.

The guidelines include 13 recommendations for the pre-operative period, and 16 for preventing infections during and after surgery. They range from simple precautions such as ensuring that patients bathe or shower before surgery, appropriate way for surgical teams to clean their hands, guidance on when to use prophylactic antibiotics, which disinfectants to use before incision, and which sutures to use.

The proposed recommendations are as follows:
"Strong" – Expert panel was confident that benefits outweighed risks, considered to be adaptable for implementation in most (if not all) situations, and patients should receive intervention as course of action.
"Conditional" – Expert panel considered that benefits of intervention probably outweighed the risks; a more structured decision-making process should be undertaken, based on stakeholder consultation and involvement of patients and healthcare professionals.

Postoperative Period

Implementation of standardized guidelines aims to improve overall patient care and decrease patient morbidity and mortality. The 2017 NACC guidelines recommend using a sterile occlusive dressing over the wounds for 24–48 hours. Routine postoperative antibiotics beyond 24 hours and topical antimicrobial agents are not recommended. The patient and family should be well educated on the care of the incision and techniques for wound surveillance, along with a two-week follow-up. If the surgical dressing needs to be changed, it should be done using hand washing and sterile technique. A study of nearly 200 pain physicians demonstrated that 44% of clinicians utilize antibiotics up to 24 hours following implant, 24% use antibiotics for 3–5 days, and 14% for more than five days. Four percent of physicians reported not administering any antibiotics for the permanent implant.

Despite advances in infection control measures such as sterile precautions, operating room negative pressure ventilation, surgical barriers, and antimicrobial prophylaxis, surgical site and implanted device infection remain a significant cause of SCS failure, loss of efficacy, device explantation, and subsequent morbidity and mortality. Surveillance programs have been implemented in surgical settings to effectively risk-stratify patients and reduce SSI. For example, patients should be evaluated within 10–14 days following surgery to assess for adequate wound healing and to identify signs of SSI. Further, patients should be educated to recognize the signs and symptoms of an SSI, as vigilance and early recognition are critical to improved outcomes.

Introduction

Surgical site infection (SSI) is defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as the infection occurs within 30 days of the surgical operation at the site of the surgery, or within a year if an implant is left in place, and the infection is thought to be secondary to surgery.SSIs are classified by the CDC into three categories: superficial incisional if limited to the skin and subcutaneous tissue at the site of the incision, deep incisional when involving fascial and muscle layers, and organ space when involving a body cavity or visceral organs.

These SSIs are among the most common healthcare associated infections, occurring following 1%–3% of all surgical procedures, and their rates are much higher following abdominal surgeries than with other types of surgeries, with many studies indicating wide variations in the reported incidences based on the operating conditions.

Although regulations of antisepsis were described very early by Joseph Lister in 1867, SSI is still a common problem in surgical patients despite of the advancements in the medical field. It is associated with increased morbidity, readmissions, length of hospital stay, mortality, and healthcare costs.

With the rising rates and morbidities associated with these infections, various studies have made several efforts to find better ways to optimize patients prior to surgery or improve perioperative conditions and management of patients during the recovery period in order to prevent SSIs, including the recommendations published by the WHO.

The risk factors associated with the development of an SSI vary according to specific patient factors and clinical characteristics, in addition to the nature of the surgical procedure. Despite the considerable number of clinical studies that have reported on these risk factors for SSIs following abdominal surgeries, it can be challenging to control the level of details available and to comprehensively adjust for all the variables in the estimation of particular risk factors. A comprehensive and detailed assessment of the multifactorial nature of these risk factors could help in improving the quality of surgical care.

### Challenges and management of surgical site occurrences [^113jZ4HC]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Postoperative complications such as surgical site infections, dehiscence, seromas, and hematomas prolong wound care and impose significant cost increases to patients and healthcare providers. Clinicians aiming to reduce the incidence of these complications should be aware of risk factors associated with surgical type, procedures used, patient characteristics, and postoperative care. Today, improved guidelines and general practices for managing surgical incisions have reduced the incidence of complications to historic lows. In addition to these standard care options, advanced wound care approaches have been extensively studied and exist as options for clinicians to provide adjunctive postoperative support and facilitate wound healing. These systems include advanced wound dressings and closed-incision negative-pressure therapy. Advanced wound care is not appropriate in all settings, and healthcare providers must assess each case for specific needs to be addressed by the available incision management plans. Emerging therapies that are intended to improve the continuum of postoperative care should continue to be evaluated in controlled clinical trials to determine their effectiveness under different circumstances and to support the creation of more robust guidelines for their use.

### Dressings for the prevention of surgical site infection [^112Y3mJQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical wounds (incisions) heal by primary intention when the wound edges are brought together and secured, often with sutures, staples, or clips. Wound dressings applied after wound closure may provide physical support, protection and absorb exudate. There are many different types of wound dressings available and wounds can also be left uncovered (exposed). Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common complication of wounds and this may be associated with using (or not using) dressings, or different types of dressing.

Objectives

To assess the effects of wound dressings compared with no wound dressings, and the effects of alternative wound dressings, in preventing SSIs in surgical wounds healing by primary intention.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register (searched 19 September 2016); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 8); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily and Epub Ahead of Print; 1946 to 19 September 2016); Ovid Embase (1974 to 19 September 2016); EBSCO CINAHL Plus (1937 to 19 September 2016). There were no restrictions based on language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing wound dressings with wound exposure (no dressing) or alternative wound dressings for the postoperative management of surgical wounds healing by primary intention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction independently.

Main Results

We included 29 trials (5718 participants). All studies except one were at an unclear or high risk of bias. Studies were small, reported low numbers of SSI events and were often not clearly reported. There were 16 trials that included people with wounds resulting from surgical procedures with a 'clean' classification, five trials that included people undergoing what was considered 'clean/contaminated' surgery, with the remaining studies including people undergoing a variety of surgical procedures with different contamination classifications. Four trials compared wound dressings with no wound dressing (wound exposure); the remaining 25 studies compared alternative dressing types, with the majority comparing a basic wound contact dressing with film dressings, silver dressings or hydrocolloid dressings. The review contains 11 comparisons in total.

Primary Outcome

SSIIt is uncertain whether wound exposure or any dressing reduces or increases the risk of SSI compared with alternative options investigated: we assessed the certainty of evidence as very low for most comparisons (and low for others), with downgrading (according to GRADE criteria) largely due to risk of bias and imprecision. We summarise the results of comparisons with meta-analysed data below:- film dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings following clean surgery (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.55), very low certainty evidence downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision.- hydrocolloid dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings following clean surgery (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.78), very low certainty evidence downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision.- hydrocolloid dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings following potentially contaminated surgery (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.51), very low certainty evidence downgraded twice for risk of bias and twice for imprecision.- silver-containing dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings following clean surgery (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.62), very low certainty evidence downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision.- silver-containing dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings following potentially contaminated surgery (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.37), very low certainty evidence downgraded twice for risk of bias and twice for imprecision. Secondary outcomesThere was limited and low or very low certainty evidence on secondary outcomes such as scarring, acceptability of dressing and ease of removal, and uncertainty whether wound dressings influenced these outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

It is uncertain whether covering surgical wounds healing by primary intention with wound dressings reduces the risk of SSI, or whether any particular wound dressing is more effective than others in reducing the risk of SSI, improving scarring, reducing pain, improving acceptability to patients, or is easier to remove. Most studies in this review were small and at a high or unclear risk of bias. Based on the current evidence, decision makers may wish to base decisions about how to dress a wound following surgery on dressing costs as well as patient preference.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^117EV1cD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the treatment of infected meshes?

Respect prevention strategies to avoid surgical site infection and prosthetic contamination (recommendation 1A).

We suggest avoidance of mesh contamination following incisional SSI by an early and adequate local source control as well as antibiotic treatment (recommendation 1C).

In chronic sinuses and infected meshes, we suggest a complete surgical removal of the mesh which remains the only way to eradicate infection (recommendation 1C).

No clear recommendations on the benefit of biologic versus synthetic mesh in potentially contaminated fields can be proposed (recommendations 1C).

Hernia repair is one of the most common surgical procedures performed globally. Mesh infection, although infrequent, is a devastating complication of mesh hernioplasties, and for this reason, a prevention strategy is essential. Currently, several types of prosthetic mesh are widely used for repairing abdominal wall defects; however, there is no single universal ideal mesh. Synthetic meshes are easy to handle and well tolerated; however, they can be potentially associated with infection when bacteria adhere to the synthetic material leading to chronic infection. Mesh infection is a challenging complication of abdominal wall defect repairs.
