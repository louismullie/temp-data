## Question

A mother brings her infant for a regular well-child check-up with the pediatrician. During the routine developmental examination, the physician notes that the child is looking at him with his head lifted upwards when he is about to pick up the child from the table. At what age is it common to begin to observe this finding in a child, assuming that the child is developmentally normal?
A. 2 months
B. 6 months
C. 9 months
D. 12 months

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking at what age a typically developing infant commonly lifts the head upward when being picked up from a table, and which option among 2, 6, 9, or 12 months best fits that milestone. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what specific motor behavior is being described and whether it reflects head control or anticipatory posturing. Then, I should verify the expected age range for head control milestones from authoritative sources. Next, I will cross-check contemporary normative data to ensure the timing is accurate. Finally, I will compare the options and confirm the best answer, while noting any nuances that could cause confusion with adjacent ages.

> Let me first confirm the behavior in question: the infant lifts the head upward as the examiner approaches to pick them up, which implies emerging neck and upper trunk control and an anticipatory postural response rather than fully independent unsupported sitting or advanced motor skills, so I should anchor this to early head control milestones rather than later gross motor achievements.

> I need to check the classic milestone timeline for head control. The American College of Surgeons child abuse guidance lists expected milestones as head control or head up by 2 months, roll over or sit with support by 4 months, and sit without support by 6 months, which places the emergence of reliable head control squarely at about 2 months of age, with strengthening thereafter [^113ajnKR].

> Wait, let me verify this against contemporary population data to avoid overreliance on a single source. The Tipat Halav Israel Screening (THIS) scale, derived from millions of developmental assessments, shows that holding the head up is commonly achieved by 2 months, aligning with the 2‑month expectation for head control in typical infants, which supports the 2‑month timing for this behavior [^115R9MYC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider whether the described anticipatory lifting during a pick‑up could reflect a slightly later, more mature postural response. But the foundational prerequisite is adequate head control, which is established by 2 months and continues to consolidate over the next several months, so an infant with good head control at 2 months would plausibly demonstrate anticipatory lifting when being picked up, whereas waiting until 6 months would be too late for this specific observation [^113ajnKR].

> Let me compare the options carefully. At 2 months, head control emerges and the described lifting is expected; at 6 months, infants are typically sitting without support, which is a more advanced milestone and beyond the window for the earliest reliable head‑lifting behavior; 9 and 12 months reflect even later gross motor achievements, making them clearly too late for this specific finding, so the best fit is 2 months [^113ajnKR].

> I should double-check for any conflicting data suggesting later attainment. Some cohorts note variability in milestone timing, but even where ranges exist, head control clusters around the early infancy period, and no credible source places the onset of reliable head lifting at 6 months or later, reinforcing that 2 months is the appropriate answer here [^113ajnKR].

> Conclusion: The infant's lifting of the head upward when being picked up is most commonly observed beginning at 2 months of age in typically developing children, so the correct choice is A. 2 months [^113ajnKR].

The correct answer is **2 months**. By 2 months, most infants develop sufficient neck and upper trunk control to lift their head and briefly hold it upright when being picked up, reflecting normal early motor development [^113ajnKR]. This milestone is typically assessed during routine well-child visits to ensure appropriate progression of gross motor skills [^112yMnME].

---

## Developmental milestone: head control at 2 months

At 2 months, infants typically achieve **early head control**, allowing them to lift their head and chest briefly during prone positioning and to hold their head upright for short periods when supported upright [^113ajnKR]. This early head control reflects developing neck and upper trunk musculature and is a key indicator of normal motor development [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance of head lifting at 2 months

Head lifting at 2 months is clinically significant because it demonstrates:

- **Neck muscle strength**: Sufficient strength to support the head briefly when upright [^1179wxwW].

- **Upper trunk control**: Emerging control of the upper trunk, essential for later motor milestones [^notfound].

- **Normal motor development**: Indicates typical progression of gross motor skills [^113ajnKR].

---

## Comparison with other developmental milestones

| **Age** | **Milestone** |
|-|-|
| 2 months | - Head control <br/> - Lifts head when picked up [^113ajnKR] |
| 4 months | - Rolls over <br/> - Sits with support [^113ajnKR] |
| 6 months | - Sits without support <br/> - Bears weight on legs [^113ajnKR] |
| 9 months | - Crawls <br/> - Pulls to stand [^notfound] |
| 12 months | - Walks with support <br/> - May take independent steps [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical implications of delayed head lifting

If an infant does not demonstrate head lifting by 2 months, clinicians should consider **further evaluation** for possible developmental delays or underlying medical conditions [^113ajnKR]. Delayed head control may indicate:

- **Neuromuscular disorders**: Such as hypotonia or cerebral palsy [^notfound].

- **Genetic or metabolic conditions**: Affecting muscle tone or strength [^111dSPHp].

- **Environmental factors**: Such as inadequate tummy time or limited opportunities for motor development [^112ECKSD].

---

## Clinical assessment of head control

During well-child visits, clinicians assess head control by observing the infant's ability to lift and hold the head upright when picked up or during prone positioning [^114iFRES]. This assessment helps identify **normal development** or potential delays requiring further evaluation or intervention [^112yMnME].

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **2 months**. By this age, most infants can lift their head when picked up, reflecting normal early motor development and emerging neck and upper trunk control [^113ajnKR].

### Well-child visits for infants and young children [^117HJwcY]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

The well-child visit allows for comprehensive assessment of a child and the opportunity for further evaluation if abnormalities are detected. A complete history during the well-child visit includes information about birth history; prior screenings; diet; sleep; dental care; and medical, surgical, family, and social histories. A head-to-toe examination should be performed, including a review of growth. Immunizations should be reviewed and updated as appropriate. Screening for postpartum depression in mothers of infants up to six months of age is recommended. Based on expert opinion, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends developmental surveillance at each visit, with formal developmental screening at nine, 18, and 30 months and autism-specific screening at 18 and 24 months; the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation. Well-child visits provide the opportunity to answer parents' or caregivers' questions and to provide age-appropriate guidance. Car seats should remain rear facing until two years of age or until the height or weight limit for the seat is reached. Fluoride use, limiting or avoiding juice, and weaning to a cup by 12 months of age may improve dental health. A one-time vision screening between three and five years of age is recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to detect amblyopia. The American Academy of Pediatrics guideline based on expert opinion recommends that screen time be avoided, with the exception of video chatting, in children younger than 18 months and limited to one hour per day for children two to five years of age. Cessation of breastfeeding before six months and transition to solid foods before six months are associated with childhood obesity. Juice and sugar-sweetened beverages should be avoided before one year of age and provided only in limited quantities for children older than one year.

### Fifteen-minute consultation on the infant with a large head [^114cHLuj]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2013). Low credibility.

An infant with a large head (2.5 SDs above normal for weight and gender or above 99.6th centile for age) is a common clinical presentation. Usually, it is due to benign isolated macrocephaly or familial macrocephaly (FM) where some close family members are similarly affected(1); neither condition requires any further intervention. However, there are a few important underlying causes the clinician needs to actively consider and investigate when indicated before reassuring parents. These considerations include whether there is any associated developmental disorder or suggestion of a syndromic association or evidence of raised intracranial pressure (ICP).

Methods

Determining psychometric properties of the Specific Test of Early Infant Motor Performance (STEP)

Specific STEP Items

The ten STEP items comprise pull to sit, prone extension, head movement in supine with and without visual stimulation, head movements in supported sitting, supported standing, grasp, rolling elicited by leg and arm, and kicking (Fig. 1 and Supplemental Figure 4). These are elicited by a therapist with the infant in different positions to assess overall posture and the quality of movement of the head, arms, and legs as well as visual grasp responses while the infant is supine. A unique feature of the STEP is that each item looks at the quality of movement, not just presence or absence of the motor skill. For example, the Prone Extension item rates an infant on how high the infant can lift and hold the head up while prone, as well as the position and movement of upper and lower extremities, all of which are required for successful head lift (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1

STEP scoring procedures

Each of the 10 items is rated on a unique 4-point pictorial scale accompanied by brief descriptions, with scores from zero to three, progressing from immature to more mature motor movements, and summed for a maximum total score of 30 (presented in Fig. 1).

The unique STEP scoring scale was derived from careful review and kinematic analysis of existing video recordings of a prior preterm cohort, in devising a novel linear scale (0–3 points) for each of the STEP items. A consensus panel of pediatric specialists included one PhD occupational therapist, three clinical occupational therapists, two developmental pediatricians, and one developmental pediatric geneticist, who reviewed and revised the new scales, providing feedback on each item of the STEP. Pictorial representations were refined based on this feedback.

### Common questions about developmental dysplasia of the hip [^111YYbJQ]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Developmental dysplasia of the hip is a common musculoskeletal condition in newborns. Infants with developmental dysplasia of the hip, whether treated or untreated, have a higher incidence of early-onset hip osteoarthritis in adulthood. Evidence to support universal screening by physical examination or ultrasonography is limited and often conflicting. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence that screening for developmental dysplasia of the hip prevents adverse outcomes. Physical examination screening is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America. These organizations recommend use of the Ortolani and Barlow maneuvers to screen infants up to three months of age. Several recent studies support starting assessment for limited hip abduction at eight weeks of age, which is the most sensitive test for developmental dysplasia of the hip from this age on. Infants with overtly dislocated or dislocatable hips should be referred to an orthopedist on a priority basis at the time of diagnosis. Infants with equivocal hip examination findings at birth can be reexamined in two weeks. If there is subluxation or dislocation at the follow-up examination, referral should be made at that time. If the examination findings are still equivocal, the infant can undergo ultrasonography of the hips or be reexamined every few weeks through the first six weeks of life. Although equivocal findings commonly resolve spontaneously, infants with persistent equivocal findings of developmental dysplasia of the hip longer than six weeks should be evaluated by an orthopedist. Treatment generally involves flexion-abduction splinting. The benefits of treatment are unclear, and there are risks to treatment, most notably an increased occurrence of avascular necrosis of the femoral head.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for congenital muscular torticollis, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, APTA 2024 guidelines recommend to elicit a general medical and developmental history of the infant before initial screening, including the following specific health history factors:

- chronological and corrected age

- age of onset of symptoms

- pregnancy and birth history

- head posture/preference

- other known or suspected medical conditions

- developmental milestones.

Surveillance after normal infant hip exam — "Moderate evidence supports that a practitioner re-examine infants previously screened as having a normal hip examination on subsequent visits prior to 6 months of age", with Strength of Recommendation: Moderate. The rationale states, "If faced with a child who has a normal physical examination, there is limited evidence that performing subsequent hip physical examination screening of children up to 6 months of age will detect additional children with DDH", and adds, "There is no literature to define the optimal frequency or duration of follow-up surveillance". Risks and harms highlight that "There is a potential risk of over diagnosis and treatment".

Introduction

Early neurodevelopmental care is globally challenged by a scarcity of objective and scalable solutions available for early neurological assessments. More than one in ten infants require active medical follow-up due to perinatal events or abnormal neurological findings. Only a small minority of these infants will be eventually diagnosed with severe disabilities, such as the severe type of cerebral palsy, while a larger portion of infants will develop mild or moderate neurocognitive impairments, such as disorders of communication and attention. All of these conditions prompt early therapeutic interventions. However, how to distinguish these infants from the majority, who will show a typical range of neurodevelopmental outcomes despite early concerns, has remained elusive.

The early development of an infant's motor abilities provides an essential framework in the developmental cascade related to language and cognitive abilities –. This has prompted a wide clinical and research approach to survey or observe how the infant reaches developmental milestones, such as rolling, sitting, or walking –. They are useful for a wide-scale population screening for developmental delays, and they even generalize fairly well across different cultures. However, milestone assessment does not quantitate the spontaneous motor ability of infants, and it is not sensitive to the wide variability that characterizes natural motor development. More fine-grained information can be obtained by trained professionals using standardized neurodevelopmental assessments. which collate empirical sets of clinically observable or testable items, such as side turning or holding a toy, which requires an evaluation that is at least partly subjective. These test batteries are performed in a controlled environment, such as a doctor's appointment, which is an unnatural situation from an infant's perspective, compromising ecological validity from the assessor's perspective. There is hence a demand to develop methods for early neurodevelopmental tracking that are robust to variability in infant physiology, the skills of the assessor, and the testing environment. This could be solved with an objective measurement of spontaneous behavior at home, the most ecologically valid environment. Recent progress in sensor technology has made it possible to record extended periods of infants' spontaneous motor ability in out-of-hospital settings –, with quantitation of behavior at an accuracy that compares with human observers.

### Association between developmental milestones and age of schizophrenia onset: results from the Northern Finland birth cohort 1966 [^114iFRES]. Schizophrenia Research (2019). Medium credibility.

2.2 Measures

2.2.1 Developmental milestones

The following developmental milestones were available in the NFBC 1966 and utilised in the analysis: making sounds; being able to hold head up when arms lifted; making a grip on an object (grab object); turning from back to tummy; sitting without support; touching thumb with index finger (like a tweezer); capable of standing up (lift themselves up); walking with support; standing without support; and walking without support. For each of the milestones, the month in which it is achieved is recorded for each individual. This data was gathered during monthly visits to the Finnish child welfare clinics (mean number of 10 visits during first year of life) where nurses and doctors interviewed (using unstructured interview) the parents and systematically observed the children. This information was merged with parental responses to a questionnaire on motor development gathered at one year of age.

2.2.2 Diagnosis of psychotic disorder

Diagnoses of psychotic disorders were collected from all available nationwide registers, including inpatient and outpatient hospital visits (Care Register for Health Care) and registers for Social Insurance Institute. The diagnoses were categorized following the conventions of the ICD-8, ICD-9, and ICD-10 for the years in which they were utilised. Diagnoses were collected up until December 2013. Further information on how these classifications were defined are available from previous studies.

We established two psychosis outcome groups. A schizophrenia group comprised all those individuals with diagnosis of schizophrenia (ICD-10 code F20). A non-schizophrenia psychosis group included individuals with any other non-affective psychosis (ICD-10 codes: F21-F25, F28, F29, F302, F312, F315, F323, F333).

### ACR appropriateness criteria on developmental dysplasia of the hip – child [^116UN8gJ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) affects 1.5 of every 1,000 caucasian Americans and less frequently affects African Americans. Developmental dysplasia of the hip comprises a spectrum of abnormalities, ranging from laxity of the joint and mild subluxation to fixed dislocation. Early diagnosis of DDH usually leads to low-risk treatment with a harness. Late diagnosis of DDH in children may lead to increased surgical intervention and complications. Late diagnosis of DDH in adults can result in debilitating end-stage degenerative hip joint disease. Screening decreases the incidence of late diagnosis of DDH. Clinical evaluation for DDH should be performed periodically at each well-baby visit until the age of 12 months. There is no consensus on imaging screening for DDH. Consideration for screening with ultrasound is balanced between the benefits of early detection of DDH and the increased treatment and cost factors. In addition, randomized trials evaluating primary ultrasound screening did not find significant decrease in late diagnosis of DDH. In the United States, hip ultrasound is selectively performed in infants with risk factors, such as family history of DDH, breech presentation, and inconclusive findings on physical examination. Ultrasound for DDH should be performed after 2 weeks of age because laxity is common after birth and often resolves itself. A pelvic radiograph can optimally be performed after the age of 4 months, when most infants will have ossification centers of the femoral heads.

### Knowledge, attitude, and practices of parents regarding the red flags of developmental milestones in children aged 0–5 years in karachi, Pakistan: a cross-sectional study [^112wxhoh]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Knowledge related to different parameters of developmental delay.

The median knowledge score for gross motor, fine motor, and social milestones was 4(IQR- 3–5) while the median score for language was 5 (IQR 4–6). Table 1 depicts the knowledge on different items of developmental delay. Regarding knowledge of gross motor milestones, more than half had knowledge of the correct age a child should be able to lift his head and chest while lying on his stomach (64.1%), should be able to walk with support e.g. with one hand-held or by holding onto furniture (70%). On the domain of knowledge related to fine motor milestones, more than half had correct knowledge of the age a child should be able to reach for objects (57.9%) and the age a child should be able to use scissors to cut out a figure/picture (56.7%). On the component of social milestones, the majority had knowledge of the correct age a child should be toilet trained (65.1%) and should be able to dress and undress except by tying shoelaces (71.5%). On the domain of language milestone, most had correct knowledge of the age does a child say his first word (67.9%), the age at which a child should have a vocabulary of 50 or more words (83.3%), age a child enjoys being read to (80.5%), age a child should be able to give his/her full name and age (57.2%), age a child should be able to call his mother and father "mama" and "dada" respectively (61.8%) and age a child should be able to respond to simple instructions like "sit down" or "bring it here" (58.5%) Fig. 1.

Multivariate Linear Regression Analyses of 9 Early Motor Developmental Milestones and Schizotypal Scales by Gender

Early Motor Developmental Milestones

Data on 9 early motor developmental milestones were collected from visits to Finnish child welfare centers. These milestones included walking unsupported, standing unsupported, walking with support, capable to stand up (lift themselves), touching thumb with index finger, sitting unsupported, turning from back to tummy, make a grip on an object (grab object), holding the head up. The achievement of milestones was assessed by medical personnel at approximately monthly intervalsand recorded on a separate welfare card as a standard practice in Finland. The data on milestones were collected at an age of at least 11.5 month or later in 96% of cases. The mean number of appointments during the first year was 10. If a participant missed an appointment, then information on milestones were recorded during the next visit retrospectively.

### Evidence-informed milestones for developmental surveillance tools [^112HrUDT]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Learn the Signs. Act Early. program, funded the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) to convene an expert working group to revise its developmental surveillance checklists. The goals of the group were to identify evidence-informed milestones to include in CDC checklists, clarify when most children can be expected to reach a milestone (to discourage a wait-and-see approach), and support clinical judgment regarding screening between recommended ages. Subject matter experts identified by the AAP established 11 criteria for CDC milestone checklists, including using milestones most children (≥ 75%) would be expected to achieve by specific health supervision visit ages and those that are easily observed in natural settings. A database of normative data for individual milestones, common screening and evaluation tools, and published clinical opinion was created to inform revisions. Application of the criteria established by the AAP working group and adding milestones for the 15- and 30-month health supervision visits resulted in a 26.4% reduction and 40.9% replacement of previous CDC milestones. One third of the retained milestones were transferred to different ages; 67.7% of those transferred were moved to older ages. Approximately 80% of the final milestones had normative data from ≥ 1 sources. Social-emotional and cognitive milestones had the least normative data. These criteria and revised checklists can be used to support developmental surveillance, clinical judgment regarding additional developmental screening, and research in developmental surveillance processes. Gaps in developmental data were identified particularly for social-emotional and cognitive milestones.

### Detection and nonoperative management of pediatric developmental dysplasia of the hip in infants up to six months of age [^111eYJnx]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric developmental dysplasia of the hip — stable hip with ultrasound imaging abnormalities — Limited evidence supports observation without a brace for infants with a clinically stable hip with morphologic ultrasound imaging abnormalities. Strength of Recommendation: Limited. For an infant with a normal physical examination and ultrasound abnormalities, there is limited evidence to support observation without treatment of that infant with serial ultrasound evaluation up to 6 weeks of age. One low-strength study (Wood 2000) evaluated a group of at-risk patients who were evaluated by ultrasound between two and six weeks of age with clinically stable hips showing ultrasonographic abnormalities that were randomized to treatment with Pavlik harness or observation. The two primary outcome measures were the acetabular coverage on ultrasound and acetabular index on radiograph. While acetabular coverage, measured ultrasonographically, improved in both groups, and was statistically better in the splinted group at the final three-month follow-up, there was no difference in acetabular index. The risk of implementing this recommendation is that necessary treatment could be delayed.

### Comparison of developmental milestone attainment in early treated HIV-infected infants versus HIV-unexposed infants: a prospective cohort study [^1179wxwW]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Developmental milestones

Developmental milestones were assessed at enrollment and at monthly visits for the duration of follow-up. Milestones were adapted from the Denver Developmental Screening Test. The same team of clinical officers performed study visits and assessed milestones. Caregivers self-reported the age at which the milestone had been achieved at monthly visits. Analyses presented here utilized the self-reported age wherever possible, and an estimated age (using the date of study visit at which the milestone was first noted by the clinician) was used in cases in which the self-reported age was missing. Sensitivity analyses including only the clinician-reported age gave similar results. Milestones included full neck control (defined as whether the infants could support his or her own head) (neck control), sitting with support (defined as whether the child could sit with a straight back on the caregiver's lap or on the floor between the caregiver's legs), sitting unsupported (defined as whether the child could sit on a flat surface or on the caregiver's lap without needing support), walking with support (defined as whether the child could walk well with the help of someone holding one or both hands or when supporting self using furniture or a wall), walking unsupported (defined as whether the child could take a few steps without needing support), monosyllabic speech (defined as whether the infant was able to say one-syllable words or sounds, referring to a specific person or object) (speech), throwing toys (defined as whether the child could throw a toy such as a ball while playing), naming objects (defined as whether the caregiver reported that the child could point to and name common household items such as cups or plates). This analysis was focused primarily on milestones expected to occur within a few months of the 6-month on-ART visit, namely walking unsupported and speech.

Laboratory testing

In Nairobi, flow cytometry was performed to obtain enrollment and 6-monthly CD4 counts and percentages. Whole blood specimens were centrifuged using a Ficoll density gradient to separate plasma, which was cryopreserved at −70 ° C. Plasma HIV RNA levels were ascertained using the Gen-Probe HIV Viral Load Assay (San Diego, CA) in Seattle, WA. Blood hemoglobin levels were assessed in Nairobi.

### Analysis of cranial type characteristics in term infants: a multi-center study [^114Mw9tx]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Positional head deformity (PHD) refers to changes in the shape of an infant's skull in the front, back, or sides due to an external force. PHD can lead to cranial or facial unsightliness, resulting in the child developing an inferiority complex and even being bullied by other children. Serious PHD may also be combined with impaired nervous system development and cognitive function, resulting in intellectual disabilities, learning difficulties, and/or language disorders. PHD is a common problem in the first six months of life and is present in 20–46% of live births. The earlier the discovery of PHD, the better is the effect of the intervention and the lower is its cost. After six months of age, the growth rate of the infant's skull decreases, while the hardness of the skull and the free movement of the head increases; therefore, PHD generally does not continue to progress; however, treatment difficulty also increases compared to that before six months of age. Therefore, the key period for prevention and management of PHD is up to six months of age.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^113ajnKR]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Best Practices Guidelines — Child abuse recognition (history-based predictors and red flags) notes that in a multivariate analysis one of the best predictors of child physical abuse was injury inconsistent with the history, and another good predictor is referral to a clinician for suspected child abuse. Reliability of the historical information is a concern. History red flags include that the history changes over time or discrepancies are noted between sources; delay in seeking care for more than 24 hours after the injury; no history of trauma is reported and/or possible trauma is denied when an obvious injury is present; an injury is attributed to self-inflicted harm, a pet or sibling, or to resuscitation or treatment efforts; and a prior history of an unexplained death of a child in the household is reported. An injury mechanism inconsistent with the infant's development and/or age (e.g., a 2-month-old rolling over) is highlighted, with expected milestones listed as 2 months: head control/head up, 4 months: roll over/ sit with support, and 6 months: sit without support.

### Developmental screening: is there enough time? [^111KCQUh]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine developmental screening in well-child care. Providers cite time restraints as a limitation preventing its widespread adoption. The objectives were to determine whether routine screening lengthened well-visits and was associated with changes in parent satisfaction and report of anticipatory guidance.

Methods

Visits before and after implementation of routine screening were timed. Parents whose children were seen before or after screening began were contacted to query their perceptions of the visit.

Results

There was no change in visit lengths after the screener was included. With screening, more parents reported their provider talked about their concerns, and that their questions were answered. There were no changes in parent satisfaction ratings or reports of anticipatory guidance discussions.

Conclusions

The perceived obstacle that routine screening requires more time than pediatricians have should not prevent its adoption. Screening tools may empower some parents otherwise reluctant to raise concerns unsolicited.

### Early developmental milestones and risk of schizophrenia: a 45-year follow-up of the copenhagen perinatal cohort [^111Detzt]. Schizophrenia Research (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between age of neuromotor milestone attainment and risk of adult schizophrenia. 5765 mothers of the Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort recorded 12 developmental milestones during the child's first year of life. Cohort members were followed until they were 46–48 years old through record linkage with the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register. The age at which milestones were met in the 92 individuals who later developed schizophrenia was compared with milestone attainment in the 691 individuals who developed other psychiatric disorders and in the 4982 cohort controls who were never admitted to a psychiatric department. Group comparisons were adjusted for gender, mother's age, father's age, parental social status, breadwinner's education, single mother status and parity. Individuals who developed schizophrenia reached all developmental milestones later than controls and differed significantly from the controls with respect to the mean age of reaching the 12 milestones. Five developmental milestones in particular (smiling, lifting head, sitting, crawling, and walking) differed significantly. Individuals who later developed psychiatric disorders other than schizophrenia reached most developmental milestones earlier than those who developed schizophrenia, but later than the controls. The two psychiatric groups only differed significantly with respect to age of walking without support. The findings corroborate and methodologically extend previous research from prospective longitudinal cohort studies suggesting developmental delays observable as early as within the first year of life. These early developmental delays may not only characterize schizophrenia, but may be associated with a range of psychiatric disorders.

### Detection and nonoperative management of pediatric developmental dysplasia of the hip in infants up to six months of age [^1174rdid]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Medium credibility.

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in infants — etiology and risk factors: The etiology in typically developing children is unknown, and both genetic and environmental influences appear to play a role; absence of a femoral head from within an acetabulum and altered proximal femoral anatomy have been linked to progressive acetabular changes over time; the terminology used to define DDH risk factors is not precise and physical examination findings have semantic and normative limitations that change over time; case-control and observational studies have suggested that breech positioning at delivery, family history of DDH, limited hip abduction, talipes, female gender, swaddling, large birth size, and first born have been associated with a higher probability of finding DDH.

If the major goal of follow-up is to provide ongoing clinical care for a high-risk child, a minimal checklist of areas to cover for a health professional, such as a paediatrician, would be represented by the shaded areas in Additional file 1: Table S1. Depending on what is found at each assessment, referral for more thorough evaluation of some areas might be required. If progress is otherwise satisfactory, then follow-up could be limited to the areas highlighted, but occasionally other issues might require assessment.

The issue of how long to follow a child who is progressing normally and whose family is coping appropriately will depend on many circumstances. Children at two years who are walking freely with no abnormal neurological signs, talking in 2–3 word sentences, with no vision or hearing problems, whose parents have no major behavioural concerns, and who have no other health problems that require ongoing care, and whose family is functioning well, can be discharged from specialist surveillance and referred back to primary care services, with a clear management and follow-up plan. Whether later assessments at preschool or early school ages are warranted could be decided on an individual basis and informed by screening during primary care visits or by family concerns. However, it must be recognised that many of the cognitive and academic problems that occur at school-age will not be predicted by progress in the first few years of life. Many high-risk children will not be able to function adequately in the preschool or school setting. They will remain undiagnosed and unassessed until they have failed and been brought to the attention of someone at an age that is usually too late for effective intervention. Ideally the highest risk children should be reassessed prior to school entry, and after the first few years at school. The reality is that resources are limited, and few centres are able to offer such assessments routinely, even though the cost of follow-up is minimal compared with the cost of providing intensive care. While the cost of follow-up needs to be acknowledged, the cost of inaction, which is more difficult to measure, may be much greater. Moreover, one of the other difficulties experienced by families is that once they are 'out of the system', it is hard to get back in to mobilise the resources required quickly. As a minimum, parents of high risk children, health professionals and educators need to be "alert but not alarmed" and advised that serious issues can still arise at later times. Maintaining good records of previous assessments will facilitate reassessments at later ages.

### International consensus statement on the diagnosis, multidisciplinary management and lifelong care of individuals with achondroplasia [^116t6BXx]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Achondroplasia in infants — family guidance, growth tracking, hearing/ENT, and vaccination — emphasizes routine evaluation and anticipatory care: The specialist care team, working in parallel with the local health-care team, should undertake regular evaluation of infants in the first year of life. Frequency should be at least every 2–4 months initially and then every 3–6 months depending on medical concern and local resources. Parents of infants with achondroplasia should be provided with specific charts and a growth parameter register (height, weight and head circumference) for management follow-up. Parents should be provided with early information on positioning and handling infants with achondroplasia, including avoidance of early sitting and appropriate options for car seats and prams. Hearing evaluation is recommended in infants with achondroplasia at an early stage and should be monitored regularly. Recurrent and chronic otitis media are common in infants with achondroplasia and early referral to an otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat; ENT) specialist should be considered. Infants with achondroplasia should receive regular vaccinations according to national immunization programmes.

### Clinical practice guidelines: childhood hearing screening [^112yXCdU]. AAA (2011). Medium credibility.

Childhood hearing screening — pure tone screening protocol recommendations specify to perform biologic check on pure tone equipment prior to daily screening, to screen using pure tones for populations age 3 (chronologically and developmentally) and older, and to perform a pure tone sweep at 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz at 20 dB HL. Present a tone at least twice but no more than 4 times if a child fails to respond. Screen in an acoustically appropriate screening environment; the screening environment should not exceed 50, 58, and 76 dB SPL respectively for 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz as measured by a sound level meter, and if no sound level meter is available, the screening environment should be quiet enough for a normal hearing adult to perceive 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz tones presented at 10 dB HL. Lack of response at any frequency in either ear constitutes a failure, and rescreen immediately; any child that fails to respond at any frequency in either ear should be rescreened immediately, preferably by a different tester and with a different audiometer to include removing earphones and carefully replacing them over the ears. Table guidance indicates (right ear) No at 500 Hz, 20 dB at 1000 Hz, 20 dB at 2000 Hz, No at 3000 Hz, 20 dB at 4000 Hz, No at 6000 Hz, and No at 8000 Hz. Note that the following guidelines are considered to be the minimum standard for educational settings; programs are encouraged to follow a more intensive rescreening and referral protocol where staffing patterns permit.

### Active monitoring versus an abduction device for treatment of infants with centered dysplastic hips: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial (TReatment with active monitoring (TRAM)-trial) [^114h68QB]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) is one of the most common pediatric orthopedic disorders, affecting 1–3% of all newborns. DDH encompasses a wide spectrum of growth disorders of neonatal and infant hips, ranging from mild acetabular dysplasia with a well-centered femoral head to severe acetabular dysplasia with dislocation of the femoral head. Untreated DDH can lead to chronic pain, gait abnormalities, and early-onset hip osteoarthritis. It is estimated that up to 26% of hip arthroplasties in patients aged 40 years or younger are performed due to untreated or insufficiently treated hip dysplasia.

Centered DDH refers to centered hips with acetabular dysplasia, classified as Graf type IIa-/IIb/IIc with ultrasound evaluation (Table 1). The optimal treatment of centered DDH is currently under debate. Abduction treatment is the most used treatment method for children under six months of age with centered DDH worldwide. However, it is approximated that 85% of immature dysplastic hips will normalize at the age of three months without treatment. Also, it is estimated that more than 80% of centered DDH hips (Graf IIa- to IIc) under six months will normalize without treatment. This suggests that ultrasonography screening at a young age might introduce DDH overdiagnosis and possibly unnecessary treatment of immature hips that are not truly pathological.

Table 1
Ultrasonography classification of hip dysplasia by Graf

A few studies have compared active monitoring and abduction treatment for infants with centered DDH. A recent review summarizes that there is no difference in acetabular index between active monitoring and abduction treatment for infants up to four months of age with centered DDH after three months. However, the included six studies showed considerable methodological heterogeneity and two non-randomized studies were rated as serious risk of bias. A large randomized clinical trial, embedded in clinical practice, is warranted to validate the outcomes of the previous studies, and study the cost-effectiveness of active monitoring versus abduction treatment for infants with centered DDH. Therefore, the current randomized controlled trial aims to study the (cost)-effectiveness of active monitoring versus abduction treatment for infants with centered DDH.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^113LjTYh]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition — essential history elements for potentially abused children specify questions to ask during history taking, including who brought the child to the emergency department (ED) and whether presentation was delayed; who provided the historical information; what exactly happened (for example, height of fall, what the patient fell from, what they landed on); when the injury happened with attention to any injuries prior to this event or identifying when the child was last well/normal; how it happened, what the child was doing, and the child's behavior before, during, or after; where the injury happened; what happened immediately after the injury with the note that a history of a child standing up on a broken femur would be consistent with fabrication of mechanism; who witnessed the incident and who was around but did not witness it; the history of previous injuries; and, for children less than one year, which developmental milestones have been achieved and when they were achieved.

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in infants — scope and intended users are outlined: This clinical practice guideline is based upon a systematic review of published articles related to the detection and early management of hip instability and dysplasia in typically developing children less than 6 months of age, and it provides practice recommendations for the early screening and detection of hip instability and dysplasia while also highlighting gaps in the published literature that should stimulate additional research. The evidence review includes treatment and diagnostic articles related to DDH published in or after 1966 and incidence/natural history articles published in or after 1950. The guideline is intended for use by appropriately trained practitioners involved in the medical evaluation of typically developing children less than 6 months of age, including pediatricians, family physicians, qualified mid-level practitioners with appropriate physician oversight, radiologists who perform diagnostic imaging of children, and orthopedic surgeons, and it is not intended for use as a benefits determination document.

### Genetic vulnerability of exposures to antenatal maternal treatments in 1-to 2-month-old infants [^111aJna6]. Infancy (2021). Medium credibility.

5 | CONCLUSION

Head movements in early life have been typically used to reveal by cognitive psychologists what infants know, but recent findings indicate that head movements can also reveal critical biological information in early life about how infants are. Collaborative multi-disciplinary studies, including clinical trials in basic science in humans, are required to probe the specific contributions of environment (i.e. fetal exposures) versus genetics to the neurobiological sensorimotor processes unfolding during human prenatal and postnatal periods, and how perturbations of these processes may converge to produce atypical longer-term sensorimotor developmental consequences for the child. This study establishes for the first time that in newborns at 1–2 months after birth there are deleterious sensorimotor consequences associated with prenatal exposure to psychotropic medications, including analgesics containing an opioid-type ingredient. The consequences of these exposures are more severe in the presence of familial, genetic risk for autism. This finding suggests new research directions for the study of genetic vulnerability to antenatal exposure to maternal treatments during pregnancy and their contribution to infant development.

### Abusive head trauma in infants and children: technical report [^113HNkmM]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Takeaway points for abusive head trauma (AHT) screening — sentinel and contextual signs include the following: Bruising is a key sentinel finding in infants, occurring in upwards of 28% of "definite" abuse cases, macrocephaly is present in a majority of patients with AHT, bruising that is more likely to occur in AHT versus nAHT can be distinguished on the basis of a child's age, developmental abilities, and distribution of bruising, bruising in nonmobile children has a strong association with abuse over accident, bruising in the TEN-4-FACESp distribution has high sensitivity and specificity for abusive injury and, absent a clear and consistent accidental history, warrants an evaluation for possible abuse, and children with severe, inherited bleeding disorders have more and larger bruises than children without a bleeding disorder but rarely bruise on the ears, neck, fleshy cheeks, eyes, or genitalia.

### The prevalence of bowel and bladder function during early childhood: a population-based study [^116yHnmb]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

At the age of 5 years most Dutch children are fully toilet-trained. Nevertheless, fecal incontinence is common even in fully toilet-trained children. Constipation appears to be common as well, with an equally high prevalence in infants, toddlers, and older children. Furthermore, fecal incontinence and constipation frequently coexist and are often accompanied by urinary incontinence, which requires attention. Remarkably, treatment of fecal incontinence and constipation is lacking in most of the affected children. Therefore, awareness is needed of both bowel and bladder dysfunction in infants, toddlers, and young children to prevent these problems from persisting at older ages. This awareness can, for instance, be created during regular developmental check-ups at the child health care center within the first years of life.

### Abusive head trauma in infants and children: technical report [^115qR2X8]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Abusive head trauma (AHT) — history features and comparative patterns: In accidental trauma, caregivers are often able to give a clear, consistent description of events, whereas histories that are vague, change over time, or are developmentally implausible occur more often in AHT. In one study of children younger than 2 years with serious injuries, 75% of accidental injuries were witnessed by caregivers versus 2.5% in AHT. For children younger than 3 years with subdural hemorrhages, parents are not always present when an accidental injury occurred. A history of a child who falls, cries, and is readily consoled, with injury recognition delayed, is common in low-height/short-distance accidental falls with a linear skull fracture. In various clinical series, approximately 85% to 95% of children judged to have AHT present with either no history of trauma (range 43%–72% of children) or a minor accidental mechanism such as a fall less than 3 feet (25%–42% of children). In a New Zealand series, about 14% of assault cases had an admission of causation, with age dependence and a higher percentage of admissions in children older than 2 years; among those older than 2 years who had been assaulted, blunt impacts were reported.

### Novel variant causing OTUD6B-related syndrome with ocular dysplasia and hypothyroidism: the first Chinese case [^111dSPHp]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

At 6 months, genetic tests utilizing whole-exome sequencing and copy number variation analysis revealed a genetic mutation in the OTUD6B gene.

She experienced twice episode of febrile seizure At age 13 and 17 months, respectively, and abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns observed during her sleep in the subsequently test.

The child experienced severe delays in developmental milestones. She achieved head lifting at 5 months and briefly achieved independent sitting at 10 months. Teeth erupted late at approximately 1 year. Before turning 1 year old, she experienced difficulties with swallowing and was prone to choking on milk. After a year of comprehensive hospital-based rehabilitation, marked improvements were observed in her gross motor skills and swallowing ability. At approximately 2 years, she transitioned to solid foods; however, she experienced allergies and recurring eczema. She started walking independently at 2 and a half years, with reduced nystagmus severity. At 3 years and 6 months, she continues to demonstrate severe cognitive and language developmental delay without active language development.

Her newborn metabolic screening showed hypothyroidism, although her parents have misplaced this report. She started levothyroxine sodium tablets that same week. At her last visit, age 3 years 6 months, the dose was down to 12.5 µg daily, with every thyroid check since 3monts age within the normal range.

### PGALS-paediatric gait arms legs and spine: a simple examination of the musculoskeletal system [^115zH8MM]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Use of pGALS to distinguishing normal from abnormal

Key to appropriate interpretation of pGALS is knowledge of ranges of normal joint movement in different ethnicity and age groups, looking for asymmetry and careful examination for subtle changes. It is essential to check for verbal and non-verbal clues of discomfort, which may suggest joint pathology (such as facial expression, withdrawal of limb, or refusal to be examined further). Furthermore it is important that observers are aware of normal variants in gait, leg alignment and normal motor milestones (List 4 and Table 1) as these are a common cause of parental concern, especially in the pre-school child, and often can be allayed with explanation and reassurance. Normal variants do not cause pain and it is important not to ascribe MSK symptoms to the co-existence of a normal variant (e.g. the 3 year child with a limp and observed to have flat feet – the latter being normal at this age, but limp is not). Indicators for concern regarding normal variants are given (List 4).

List 4 Normal variants in gait patterns and leg alignment

Habitual toe walking is common in young children up to 3 years.

In toeing can be due to:

- Persistent femoral ante version (characterised by child walking with patellae and feet pointing inwards and is common between ages of 3–8 years)

- internal tibial torsion (characterized by child walking with patella facing forward and toes pointing inwards and is common from onset of walking to 3 years)

- metatarsus adductus (characterized by a flexible 'C shaped' lateral border of the foot and most resolve by 6 years).

Bow legs (genu varus) are common from birth to early toddler, often with out-toeing (maximal at approximately 1 year of age), and most resolve by 18 months.

Design and setting of the study

The head-mounted display will be used to keep the distance between the eyes and the visual stimuli constant across 3 experimental conditions (seated, standing, and free position). The visual target stimulus consists of a yellow fish placed in the center of the visual blue background that is oriented toward the left or right side (Fig. 1). This target will be presented either above or below a fixed cross and with or without flanker stimuli. The target will appear either alone (neutral condition) or in the center of a horizontal row of five yellow flanking fishes who will be oriented in the same direction (congruent condition) or in the opposite direction (incongruent condition). Children will be instructed to identify, as quickly and accurately as possible, the direction of the central fish by pressing the right or the left mouse button whatever the direction of the possible flanking fishes. The children will use their preferred hand. Each fish is subtended 1.6 degrees of visual angle and the contours of adjacent fish are separated by 0.2 degrees. The five fish are subtended a total of 8.8 degrees. The target will be presented about 1 degree above or below fixation.

Fig. 1
Schematic of the Attention Network Test for Child (Child ANT) adapted from Rueda et al

Each target will be preceded by one of the following four warning cues (asterisk) conditions, as illustrated in Fig. 1: (1) no cue with only the fixation cross displayed; (2) a center cue presented at the location of the fixation cross; (3) a double cue, appearing simultaneously 1 degree above and 1 degree below the fixation cross then the target appears at the level of only one of these two cues; or (4) a spatial cue, appearing 1 degree above or 1 degree below the fixation cross, then the target appears at the location of the cue. Each trial will begin with a fixation period of random duration (400–1600 ms). After that fixation period, the warning cue will be presented for 100 ms and will be followed by another fixation period of 400 ms. subsequently, the target and flankers will appear simultaneously. They will be presented until the child responds. The maximal response time allowed will be 2500 ms. After the response, the target and flankers will disappear, and there will be a last fixation period of 3500 ms minus the response time (RT). Then, the next trial can begin.

Tipat Halav Israel Screening Developmental Scale Study Cohort

The current study included all children born between January 1, 2014, and September 1, 2020, who were followed at the MCHCs and who had at least 1 developmental evaluation recorded during the study period. To assess the developmental norms for a healthy, low-risk population, exclusion criteria were defined to identify children with potential of abnormal development. The exclusion criteria included preterm birth (gestational age of < 37 weeks), low birth weight (< 2.5 kg), abnormal weight measurement (< 3% according to standardized child growth charts), abnormal head circumference measurement (microcephaly [< 3%] or macrocephaly [> 97%] according to standardized child growth charts), missing gestational age at delivery, and visits without developmental data or without the child's age.

### Clinical practice guidelines: childhood hearing screening [^113AwARu]. AAA (2011). Medium credibility.

Childhood hearing screening — background and need for guidelines — highlights early identification benefits and endorsed screening intervals. Hearing loss is described as "the most prevalent developmental abnormality present at birth", and identification "by 6 months of age" with early intervention is associated with typical language development. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) "endorses hearing screening throughout infancy, early childhood, middle childhood and adolescence", with "all newborns are to be screened" per the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH) and additional screening "during routine well child visits at ages 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10". The American Academy of Audiology (AAA) states that children with undetected hearing loss or middle ear disease "be identified so that appropriate audiologic and medical management can be provided", and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) "endorses the identification of school children at risk for hearing impairment". Evidence gaps are noted: among "9-year-olds with educationally significant hearing loss, up to 50% will have passed newborn hearing screening", and "pediatricians typically neither recheck hearing nor refer more than half of the ten percent of children who fail their hearing screening". The burden is underscored by the estimate that "9–10 per 1000 children will have identifiable permanent hearing loss in one or both ears by school-age".

### Latin American consensus: children born small for gestational age [^117FCdWe]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Growth and SGA

Follow-up

Most children born SGA recover from their weight and height deficiency. Term SGA newborns generally complete catch-up growth at about 2 years of age, whereas premature newborns may take longer to catch up than full-term newborns. The recovery is completed when they reach their genetic potential as determined by parental height. However, 10% to 15% of those born SGA will continue to have significantly short stature (height ≤ -2 SD) during childhood and adult life.

Approximately 90% of healthy, full-term children born SGA will undergo catch-up growth during their first 2 years of life, which can occur as early as 12 weeks postnatal age. As such, this consensus recommends that children born SGA should be evaluated every 3 months during the first year of life and every 6 months during the second year. Weight, length, and head circumference should be measured at all appointments. A child who does not show catch-up growth during the first 6 months of life should be evaluated further. The same recommendation is valid for a child whose weight is ≤ -2 SD at age 2 years. In these cases, common pediatric diseases, genetic disorders and hypothalamic and/or pituitary dysfunctions should be ruled out. SGA children who do not recover height generally have an adequate endogenous growth hormone (GH) secretion in response to pharmacological tests. However, they often have low serum IGF-1 levels and altered physiological GH secretion patterns.

Ideally, SGA implies length and weight reference data in a geographical population whose ethnicity is known. If local charts endorsed by local Pediatrics Associations are not available, from birth until age 5 years, the WHO growth charts could be used. The WHO charts combine data of a longitudinal follow-up from birth to 24 months and a cross-sectional survey of children aged 18 to 71 months; breastfed infants and young children from Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman, and USA were included. After age 5 years, the WHO Reference 2007 — an update of the 1977 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/WHO reference, using the original NCHS data set supplemented with data from the WHO child growth standards — is recommended.

### Decreased head circumference velocity as related to developmental deficit in infancy [^113Koxox]. Pediatric Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

We evaluated the significance of head circumference growth velocity as related to developmental deficits during infancy. Head circumferences, lengths, and developmental diagnoses were retrieved in a standard manner at ≥ 2 time points from 437 infants with developmental deficits, and 3909 normally developing infants. Infants' ages ranged from 1–24 months, with final diagnoses ascertained at age 24 months. Increased velocity during the first 2 months in typical infants was evident in the study group during the period 2–4 months. A differential head circumference growth velocity was observed, and infants diagnosed with motor delay presented decreased velocity between ages 2–4 months, compared with infants receiving other nonmotor developmental diagnoses. These differences remained after controlling for birth weight and length. No significant sex effect was evident. Infants with developmental deficits demonstrate delayed acceleration of head circumference velocity, compared with typical infants in the first 2 months. Infants with motor delay manifest decreased velocity, compared with infants presenting other developmental deficits. These differences may be related to delayed white matter maturation.

### Attainment of smiling and walking in infancy associates with developmental delays at school entry in moderately-late preterm children: a community-based cohort study [^115DJKpw]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Developmental milestones: 'smiling-age' and 'walking-age'

In the Netherlands, development of all children is monitored routinely by PCH physicians during scheduled well-child visits. During these visits, developmental milestones are assessed including "smiling back in response" and "walking independently". For these two milestones, exact attainment ages are recorded, whereas for other milestones, it is only assessed if they have been attained or not. PCH physicians record the chronological attainment ages of these two milestones very accurately (in weeks and months, respectively) based upon parental report. Parents are not asked beforehand to determine attainment of these two milestones. Around the approximate attainment age, PCH physicians ask whether the milestone is attained and at what age. In general, for full-term children, for smiling this approximate attainment age is 6 weeks and for walking 18 months. We calculated the corrected smiling-age and walking-age by subtracting the number of weeks a child was born too early from the chronological age. We did so for all MLP children.

Ages and stages questionnaire

Development at age 4 (range 43–49 months calendar age) was assessed by parents using the Dutch version of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) 48 months' form. The ASQ was completed after informed consent was provided, as part of the LOLLIPOP study; the ASQ is not part of routine care in PCHCs in the Netherlands. The Dutch ASQ is recognized as a valid, reliable, cost-effective, fast and easy way to screen children for developmental delay, with high sensitivity (89%) and acceptable specificity (80%) for the detection of school problems. The ASQ 48 months' form contains 30 items in 5 developmental domains: communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving and personal-social functioning. All five domains add up to a total ASQ score which indicates a child's general development. A score below − 2 standard deviations (SDS) for the reference group of Dutch full-term children was considered to be below the threshold, both for the ASQ total score and the separate domains.

### Predictors of early life milestones: results from the copenhagen perinatal cohort [^112TGA3y]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Postnatal growth and development

Weight, length, and head increase during the first year of life were derived from the delivery and the 1-year follow-up measures. Weight, length, and head increase from age one to three were calculated from the 1-year and the 3-year follow-up measures. Finally, the overall mean of the 1-year milestones analyzed previously was included as a predictor to investigate developmental continuity between the first year and the following two years. The 12 motor milestones included in the Overall 1-year mean are described in detail elsewhere.

### The satisfactory growth and development at 2 years of age of the INTERGROWTH-21Fetal growth standards cohort support its appropriateness for constructing international standards [^1132aiXa]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

At 1 year of age, a comparison of the preterm cohort only with the age- and sex-specific WHO Child Growth Standards at postnatal corrected age, length, and head circumference had a mean z-score of 0.1 for both measures; the medians were at the 52nd percentiles of the WHO Child Growth Standards; for weight, the mean ± SD z-score was 0.2 ± 1.1, and the median was at the 57th percentile.

At 2 years of age, the growth of the children who were included in the INTERGROWTH-21 st Preterm Postnatal Growth Standards also plotted similarly onto the WHO Child Growth Standards (Table 6; Figure 2). For length and head circumference, the mean ± SD z-scores were -0.1 ± 1.2 and 0.0 ± 1.1, respectively, and the median was at the 47th percentile for head circumference of the WHO Child Growth Standards for both measures. For weight, the mean ± SD z-score was 0.2 ± 1.1, and the median was at the 53rd percentile.

The mean postnatal ages, at which the 4 main WHO milestones for gross motor developmentwere achieved for the total cohort and preterm subgroup (chronologic and corrected age) are presented in Figure 3. Both groups overlapped well for these milestones at the 50th, 3rd, and 97th percentiles of the WHO range for normal term infants. By 2 years of age, > 99% of the children had achieved the 4 motor development milestones with > 97% within the range of the WHO milestones (data not shown). However, although the preterm subgroup overlapped very well when corrected age was used, they displayed a delay of approximately 1 month in achieving the "walking alone" and "standing alone" milestones, when estimated age after birth was used (Figure 3).

### Anthropometric indices growth references (length, weight and head circumferences) of children aged 0–24 months in north-east of iran by GAMLSS [^114YDDwn]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The presence of impaired growth represents a significant global public health concern, and the accurate diagnosis thereof is crucial for timely intervention. Growth monitoring enables early identification of physical growth deviations, facilitating timely intervention. The importance of prompt diagnosis stems from the potential for long-term functional impairments in adulthood. Consequently, growth screening and surveillance are integral to comprehensive pediatric healthcare. However, focusing on children's growth raises two fundamental questions: the underlying growth mechanisms and the ideal growth trajectories.

Physical growth adheres to a generally predictable phased pattern, enabling healthcare professionals to perform practical evaluations of child growth and facilitate early detection of various developmental disorders through the utilization of growth charts. A growth chart serves as a potent visual tool as it portrays both the child's size across different ages and their growth rate over time, as indicated by the slope of the curve. These charts are derived from reference populations and typically display the average anthropometric index for age, along with z-scores (standard deviation scores) or percentiles. It is important to note that growth charts do not directly represent an individual's growth but rather illustrate their statistical position within the reference population distribution. The presence of two types of growth charts, namely growth standards and growth references, can lead to confusion. Growth references serve as descriptive tools, illustrating the typical patterns of children's growth in a geographic area at a specific time and offering a basis for comparison. However, deviations from these normal patterns, as indicated by the charts, do not automatically imply abnormal growth. The growth standard is essentially similar to the growth reference, with the distinction that it is derived from longitudinal data, and the reference sample is specifically chosen based on health-related considerations. Hence, the growth standard proves to be a more efficacious reference for delineating the optimal growth trajectory of a child, depicting not only how children typically grow but also how they ought to grow.

### Low birth weight, developmental milestones, and behavioral problems in Chinese children and adolescents [^117S4MSr]. Psychiatry Research (2001). Low credibility.

This study examined the association of low birth weight (LBW) and developmental milestones with behavioral and emotional problems in a general population sample of 3344 Chinese children and adolescents aged 6–16 years in 1997. Parents completed a self-administrated questionnaire including information about birth weight and developmental milestones (i.e. lifting the head up, tooth eruption, speech, walking and bedwetting cessation), and the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL). Teachers completed the Teacher's Report Form (TRF) to assess classroom behavior problems. Results indicated that LBW and delayed developmental milestones were significantly associated with an increased risk for almost all parent- and teacher-reported behavioral problems after controlling for the potential effects of child's gender, age and birth order, parental ages at birth, education, occupation, complications at birth and number of children in the family. LBW was significantly associated with delay in achieving all developmental milestones including lifting of the head, tooth eruption, sitting without support, walking without help, speech as saying words with meaning, and bedwetting cessation. It is concluded that LBW and delayed early childhood development may predict the occurrence of a wide range of behavioral and emotional problems in later childhood and adolescence.

### Probiotics and the development of very low birthweight infants: follow-up study of a randomised trial [^116o78zu]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Outcomes at the 18-month medical check-up

At the 18-month follow-up (table 2), there were no significant differences between the groups in body weight, body length, head circumference, oxygen use, incidence of cerebral palsy or mean DQ18 scores (among the infants whose scores were obtained, not inferred). However, the range of DQ18 scores was very wide. We thus calculated the distribution of developmental levels in each group; in this analysis, we also included the infants whose scores were only inferred, not calculated (because developmental testing was either not feasible or considered unnecessary). We found significant between-group differences in the distribution of developmental levels, with more favourable development among infants in the B-group (partial correlation coefficient, 0.589; P = 0.038) (see table 2, online supplementary figure 1).

Table 2
Outcomes at the 18-month medical check-up

Subgroup analyses

To evaluate the treatment effect in subgroups of infants defined by certain baseline characteristics, we chose several background risk factors including gestational age, birth weight, light-for-dates status, delivery mode, Apgar scores, antenatal steroid use, sex, establishment of total parenteral nutrition and age at full enteral feeding. The differences between subgroups were calculated, as well as the partial correlation coefficient between the distribution of developmental levels and each risk factor, based on the ordered logistic regression model (table 3). Significantly more favourable development was noted in the B-group than in the P-group subgroups, among the infants with a birth weight ≥ 1000 g, gestational age ≥ 28 weeks, caesarean delivery, antenatal steroid use, female sex or ≥ 13 days until full enteral feeding (see table 3, online supplementary figure 1).

### Differentiating transient from persistent developmental delays in a nationwide infant cohort [^1171UJou]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Early childhood developmental surveillance is critical for identifying children at risk of developmental delays and ensuring timely intervention. Current well-child surveillance policies are not well designed to distinguish transient delays from persistent ones, potentially leading to unnecessary referrals or missed opportunities for early support.

Objective

To evaluate whether the Tipat Halav Israeli Surveillance (THIS) developmental scale can be leveraged for distinguishing transient from persistent developmental delays and thus augment the precision of early childhood surveillance policies.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study used national data from maternal child health clinics in Israel that perform routine developmental surveillance of children aged 0 to 6 years, serving approximately 65% of Israeli children. Participants were individuals born at 37 weeks' gestation or later in the years 2014 to 2022 and assessed between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2022, who failed to attain at least 1 developmental milestone between age 9 and 12 months based on their electronic health records. Analysis was done between July 2024 and April 2025.

Exposure

Age-appropriate milestone attainment results at ages 9 to 12 months, along with demographic and birth-related covariates.

Main Outcome and Measures

The primary outcome was ongoing milestone attainment failure at age 12 to 24 months. Accuracy of machine learning models trained to predict the outcome was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, while for simpler decision rules, sensitivity and specificity were computed.

Results

In a cohort of 529 797 infants born at 37 weeks' gestation or later and assessed at age 9 to 12 months, developmental delays were observed in 37 760 (7.1%), among whom 20 862 (55.2%) were male and median gestational age was 39 weeks (IQR, 38–40 weeks). A total of 35 163 (93.1%) were assessed again in their subsequent year of life, among whom persistent delay was suggested for 8802 (25.0%). Machine learning models distinguished transient from persistent delays, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranging from 0.71 (95% CI, 0.70–0.72) to 0.77 (95% CI, 0.74–0.79). Simply counting the number of developmental domains in which unmet milestones occurred showed good fidelity as well (eg, sensitivity of 0.48 and specificity of 0.81 to identify persistent gross motor delay after early milestone failure in that domain plus 1 other).

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study of infants showing early signs of developmental delay suggests that transient delays can be effectively distinguished from persistent ones using routine well-child surveillance data and also provides evidence for the validity of counting domains in which milestones are not attained, which is often used in practice. This suggests an accessible approach for developmental surveillance that may improve outcomes for children worldwide.

### Standardization of a developmental milestone scale using data from children in Israel [^115R9MYC]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Can accurate developmental norms for children be determined on the basis of national developmental assessments of a multicultural population?

Findings

This cross-sectional, population-based study analyzed 3 774 517 developmental assessments of 643 958 children from birth to age 6 years, conducted by trained nurses in Maternal Child Health Clinics (known as Tipat Halav) in Israel. A contemporary developmental scale, the Tipat Halav Israel Screening Developmental Scale, was built accordingly, presenting the 75%, 90%, and 95% achievement rate for evaluated milestones.

Meaning

This developmental scale based on a diverse population in Israel is recommended for further evaluation worldwide.

### Establishing new norms for developmental milestones [^114gMjKM]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Pediatric surveillance of young children depends on providers' assessment of developmental milestones, yet normative data are sparse. Our objectives were to develop new norms for common milestones to aid in clinical interpretation of milestone attainment.

Methods

We analyzed responses to the developmental screening form of the Survey of Well-being of Young Children from 41465 screens across 3 states. Associations between developmental status and a range of child characteristics were analyzed, and norms for individual questions were compared to guidelines regarding attainment of critical milestones from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Results

A contemporary resource of normative data for developmental milestone attainment was established. Lower developmental status was associated with child age in the presence of positive behavioral screening scores (P < .01), social determinants of health (P < .01), Medicaid (P < .01), male sex (P < .01), and child race (P < .01). Comparisons between Survey of Well-being of Young Children developmental questions and CDC guidelines reveal that a high percentage of children are reported to pass milestones by the age at which the CDC states that "most children pass" and that an even higher percentage of children are reported to pass milestones by the age at which the CDC states that parents should "act early". An interactive data visualization tool that can assist clinicians in real-time developmental screening and surveillance interpretation is also provided.

Conclusions

Detailed normative data on individual developmental milestones can help clinicians guide caregivers' expectations for milestone attainment, thereby offering greater specificity to CDC guidelines.

### "GET-UP" study rationale and protocol: a cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effects of reduced sitting on toddlers' cognitive development [^115fdPuk]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The early years are critical in setting the trajectory of an individual's life. Healthy child development up to the age of 5 years provides the basis for a prosperous and sustainable society. The material and psychosocial context of poverty adversely affects multiple aspects of development in children and developmental deficits associated with poverty start before birth and can be detected as early as infancy. The best available knowledge on the basic principles of neuroscience indicate that providing supportive conditions for early childhood development is more effective and less costly than attempting to address the consequences of early adversity later. Indeed, early life experiences from birth to school entry are essential to build strong neurodevelopmental trajectories crucial for long-term social and occupational functioning.

Specifically, the first 5 years of life are important for the development of executive functions (EFs). EFs are often conceived as higher-order cognitive control processes, which consist of three inter-related functions. The first, working memory, is involved in "holding information in mind and working with it", which is important for everything from understanding language to mental mathematics and reasoning. Central to working memory is the activation of information via attention. Inhibition, by contrast, involves "inhibiting (or suppressing) attention [or action] to other things in the environment (distracters) so you can stay focused on what you want". Lastly, cognitive flexibility involves an ability "to shift mental sets or see something from different perspectives". Together, these cognitive control processes enable us to perform the full range of everyday and extra-ordinary tasks that are essential for adaptive human function.

The cognitive control provided by EFs is essential for the behavioural, emotional and social controls that contribute to positive life trajectories. That is, ample research has indicated a link between EFs and school readiness, academic success, social and emotional development, criminality and employment success. Moreover, in the largest prospective study of self-regulation conducted thus far conducted so far (1000 children who were followed from birth to age 32), it was reported that childhood self-control (at ages 3 to 11) predicted better physical health, less substance dependence, higher personal finances and less criminal offending outcomes in adulthood, following a gradient of self-regulation, even after adjusting the analysis for IQ, sex, and social class while growing up. More than fixed trajectories of self-regulatory development, this study also demonstrated the malleability of self-regulation over time, as well as improved trajectories when this occurred.

### Developmental correlates of head circumference at birth and two years in a cohort of extremely low gestational age newborns [^1143YjUT]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the developmental correlates of microcephaly evident at birth and at 2 years in a cohort born at extremely low gestational age.

Methods

We assessed development and motor function at 2 years of 958 children born before the 28th week of gestation, comparing those who had microcephaly at birth or 2 years with children with normal head circumference while considering the contribution of neonatal cranial ultrasound lesions.

Results

A total of 11% of infants in our sample had microcephaly at 2 years. Microcephaly at 2 years, but not at birth, predicts severe motor and cognitive impairments at 2 years. A total of 71% of children with congenital microcephaly had a normal head circumference at 2 years and had neurodevelopmental outcomes comparable with those with normal head circumference at birth and 2 years. Among children with microcephaly at 2 years, more than half had a Mental Developmental Index < 70, and nearly a third had cerebral palsy. The risks were increased if the child also had cerebral white matter damage on a cranial ultrasound scan obtained 2 years previously.

Conclusion

Among extremely low gestational age newborns, microcephaly at 2 years, but not at birth, is associated with motor and cognitive impairment at age 2.

### Movement planning reflects skill level and age changes in toddlers [^113hPktt]. Child Development (2010). Low credibility.

Kinematic measures of children's reaching were found to reflect stable differences in skill level for planning for future actions. Thirty-five toddlers (18–21 months) were engaged in building block towers (precise task) and in placing blocks into an open container (imprecise task). Sixteen children were retested on the same tasks a year later. Longer deceleration as the hand approached the block for pickup was found in the tower task compared with the imprecise task, indicating planning for the second movement. More skillful toddlers who could build high towers had a longer deceleration phase when placing blocks on the tower than toddlers who built low towers. Kinematic differences between the groups remained a year later when all children could build high towers.

### Detection and nonoperative management of pediatric developmental dysplasia of the hip in infants up to six months of age [^111ngubN]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Medium credibility.

Monitoring of patients during brace treatment — limited evidence supports that the practitioner perform serial physical examinations and periodic imaging assessments (ultrasound or radiograph based on age) during management for unstable infant hips, with Strength of Recommendation: Limited. If brace treatment is initiated, there is limited evidence that episodic serial physical and imaging reassessments during the treatment cycle can lead to changes or duration of the treatment plan, and two low strength studies report monitoring using physical exam, ultrasound, and radiography following the appearance of the ossific nucleus. Both studies identified failure of reduction or persistent dysplasia in patients undergoing brace treatment, and these findings necessitated a change in treatment plan or duration, although no parameters for optimal timing or frequency of imaging were established by research protocol.

### A longitudinal study of developmental and behavioral screening and referral in north carolina's assuring better child health and development participating practices [^114WaKev]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Screening children for developmental and behavioral delays is an important part of primary care practice. Well-child visits provide an ideal opportunity to engage parents and to do periodic screening. Screening identifies children who may be at risk and need further evaluation. In North Carolina's Assuring Better Child Health and Development project best-practices process, screening was incorporated as a routine part of well-child visits regardless of payor. The schedule of screenings, using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, was 6, 12, 18 or 24, 36, 48, and 60 months. From the practices' population, a cohort of 526 children, screened from the age of 6 months during August 2001 through November 2003, was retrospectively reviewed. The main objectives of this descriptive study were to determine the number of children who were screened and whether this rate improved with time, observe patterns and trajectories for children identified at risk in 1 or more of the 5 developmental domains, and examine referral rates and physician referral patterns.

### Challenges to implementation of developmental screening in urban primary care: a mixed methods study [^112tWPKq]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Six focus groups (two parent and four clinician groups) were conducted, involving a total of 8 parents and 22 primary care clinicians. The parents that participated were female and predominantly African-American, reflecting the population from which they were drawn (Table 1). Clinician participants were mostly female and Caucasian, and had been in practice an average of 16 years (Table 1). All except one clinician were Board Certified in Pediatrics. Themes derived from the focus groups were categorized using the Theory of Planned Behavior. We used three major categories to categorize themes according to the theoretical model: attitudes towards development, subjective norms towards screening, and perceived behavioral control towards implementing screening practices in the primary care setting.

Table 1
Characteristics of focus groups participants

Attitudes towards development

Both parents and clinicians endorsed the importance of discussing the child's development during the well visit. However, parents felt pediatricians undervalued parental knowledge and concerns about child development (Table 2). Parents voiced a desire to provide greater input on their child's development and share in treatment decisions. Conversely, clinicians perceived that parents in their practice lacked knowledge of normal development. They reported that they routinely did not rely solely on parental report of development, but utilized a combination of parental report, clinician observation, and clinician expertise to assess development (Table 2).

Table 2
Perceived challenges to screening from focus groups

Subjective norms towards screening

In these urban practices prior to this study, clinicians acknowledged that they frequently employed surveillance to assess development, relying on a set of age-specific milestones that were incorporated into the electronic health record to identify delays at well child visits. Clinicians reported validated developmental screening tools were used sporadically and only when parents raised concerns (Table 2). Likewise, parents felt clinicians did not spend adequate time to assess their children's development. They desired more information on development for their children (Table 2). Parents preferred clinicians to be more proactive in referring their children to developmental services rather than using a watch-and-wait approach for screening and referral.

### A picture is worth a thousand words [^115ERfuh]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2008). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of weight faltering can be challenging and often controversial. The determination should be made based on careful evaluation of growth parameters, including longitudinal patterns plotted on age- and gender-appropriate growth charts. For children with suspected or diagnosed weight faltering, the initial work-up should be limited, with laboratory tests and studies directed by findings on history and physical examination. Treatment should include nutritional counselling, familial support, and close outpatient follow-up. Hospitalisation may be useful in some cases but should not be used routinely to assist in the diagnostic work-up. Patients with limited response to these interventions may require further evaluation.

### Prevalence and location of petechial spots in well infants [^1116kp8n]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the prevalence and distribution of petechiae in well infants and to evaluate their relationship with age.

Design

500 afebrile and well-appearing infants aged 1–12 months were examined for petechiae. The sites of the petechiae were noted on a skin map and the parent's explanation recorded. Data collection included the number of petechiae, age and birth rank.

Results

10% of the infants had petechiae: 6.6% had one petechia and 3.4% more than one. Petechiae were on the trunk in 58% of infants, two of whom had them on more than one area. In 42% of the infants, the petechial spots were distributed on the head and neck as well as on the upper and lower extremities. Petechiae were significantly more common in infants over 6 months of age (68% vs 32%, p < 0.05). During a 3-week follow-up period, all study infants remained well.

Conclusion

10% of infants less than 1 year of age were found to have petechiae. These data suggest that no further evaluation is necessary in cases where up to four isolated petechiae are observed, even if not confined to one body area, and the infant is well and afebrile.

The electronic medical records of 839 574 children who visited the study MCHCs between January 2014 and September 2020 were available for analysis. Preterm children (gestational age < 37 weeks; 63 151 children), infants with low birth weight (< 2.5 kg; 24 068 infants) or missing birth weight (2187 infants), children with abnormal weight measurement (< 3% according to standardized child growth charts; 42 381 children), abnormal head circumference measurement (< 3% or > 97% according to standardized child growth charts; 41 532 children), and children with missing gestational age (18 123 children) or missing weight or head circumference measures (4174 children) were excluded from the analysis. Visits without developmental data or with missing age were removed (1757 children). Thus, 195 616 children were excluded. A total of 643 958 children (319 562 female children [49.6%]) with 3 774 517 developmental evaluations were included in the analysis (Figure 1). The mean (SD) number of developmental evaluation visits per child was 5.9 (2.4) visits.

### Visual system assessment in infants, children, and young adults by pediatricians [^116MXQF3]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement — visual system assessment in infants, children, and young adults — states that examination of the eyes and visual system should begin in the nursery and continue throughout both childhood and adolescence during routine well-child visits in the medical home. Newborn infants should be examined using inspection and red reflex testing to detect structural ocular abnormalities, such as cataract, corneal opacity, and ptosis. Instrument-based screening, if available, should be first attempted between 12 months and 3 years of age and at annual well-child visits until acuity can be tested directly. Direct testing of visual acuity can often begin by 4 years of age, using age-appropriate symbols (optotypes). Children found to have an ocular abnormality or who fail a vision assessment should be referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist or an eye care specialist appropriately trained to treat pediatric patients.

### Standardization of a developmental milestone scale using data from children in Israel [^114mXR7h]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Routine developmental screening tests for children are used worldwide for early detection of developmental delays. However, assessment of developmental milestone norms lacks strong normative data, and there are inconsistencies among different screening tools.

Objective

To establish milestone norms and build an updated developmental scale.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a cross-sectional, population-based study conducted between 2014 and 2020. Developmental assessments were conducted by trained public health nurses, documented in national maternal child health clinics, known as Tipat Halav, which serve all children in Israel. Participants included all children born between January 2014 and September 2020, who were followed at the maternal child health clinics from birth to age 6 years. Exclusion criteria were preterm birth, missing gestational age, low birth weight (< 2.5 kg), abnormal weight measurement (< 3% according to standardized child growth charts), abnormal head circumference measurement (< 3% or > 97% according to standardized child growth charts), and visits without developmental data or without the child's age. Data analysis was performed from September 2020 to June 2021.

Exposures

In total, 59 milestones in 4 developmental domains were evaluated, and the achievement rate per child's age was calculated for each milestone.

Main Outcomes and Measures

A contemporary developmental scale, the Tipat Halav Israel Screening (THIS) Developmental Scale, was built, presenting the 75%, 90%, and 95% achievement rates for each milestone. The THIS scale was compared with other commonly used screening tests, including the Denver Developmental Screening Test II (Denver II), the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Developmental Assessment.

Results

A total of 839 574 children were followed in the maternal child health clinics between January 2014 and September 2020 in Israel, and 195 616 children were excluded. A total of 3 774 517 developmental assessments were performed for the remaining 643 958 children aged 0 to 6 years (319 562 female children [49.6%]), resulting in the establishment of new developmental norms. In terms of the comparable milestones, THIS milestones had a match of 18 of 27 (67%) with the Denver II, 7 of 7 (100%) with AIMS, and 10 of 19 (53%) with the CDC Developmental Assessment. The remaining unmatched milestones were achieved earlier in the THIS scale compared with other screening tools.

Conclusions and Relevance

The THIS developmental scale is based on the largest population evaluated to date for developmental performance, representing the heterogeneous, multicultural population comprising this cohort. It is recommended for further evaluation worldwide.

### Efficacy of the small step program in a randomised controlled trial for infants below age 12 months with clinical signs of CP; a study protocol [^111mYvS8]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The rationale for dividing the intervention program into the three focus areas of hand use, mobility, and communication is to facilitate the learning process within each area. Typically, a child learns a lot within each area during the first year of life, and each focus area includes a huge amount of competence for parents as the training providers to capture. There is a limited amount of time during the day when a small child can attend to practice because caring and sleeping usually predominate their days. By introducing specific foci, we intend to help the family to optimize the training and to use their time as efficiently as possible. The hand-use focus will be used to help the child explore their external world through object manipulation, and this creates an important link to the child's cognitive development. Knowledge about fine motor development and object exploration will guide the introduction of new activities. Voluntary action starts to emerge at birth, and von Hofsten and Lindhagen have demonstrated that reaching and grasping actions can be detected even in new-borns, though it takes some months before grasping actions are obvious and frequent. In the first year of life, infants gradually gain remarkable control over their hands, and they begin exploring and manipulating objects with increasing skill. The mobility focus will be used to reach new gross motor ability goals with the overall aim that children should be able to move about and explore their external world on their own. This includes activities like maintaining and changing body position, sitting and standing, and any other form of mobility. The principles for reaching goals will be based on matching the child's present capacity and environment with the target actions. As a consequence, motor learning will not be expected to occur in the same order as in children with typical development. However, we do expect accelerated motor development to occur because there is a rapid pace during the first year of life during typical development. The communication focus will be used to enhance sensitive parental communication strategies that support child-centred interactions and child initiatives. The infants' early communication skills will cover a wide range of behaviours such as crying, body movements, gestures, and directed gaze. These communication signals are the foundation for later linguistic skills and cognitive development. An important landmark to develop is shared focus or joint attention, i.e. the mutual attention between the infant and the parent. A particularly important form of joint attention is triadic engagement in which the infant can alternate his/her gaze between the parent and an outside object or event. Joint attention forms both a cognitive as well as a socio-emotional foundation for the child's learning during activities and for their inter-personal engagement. Raising awareness of the child's communicative attempts and learning to respond and maintain communication will guide the training.

### Comprehensive pediatric eye and vision examination [^113uq3tZ]. AOA (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric eye and vision examination — frequency of care and early developmental considerations states that children should receive periodic eye and vision examinations to diagnose and treat disease early to prevent or minimize vision loss and maximize visual abilities, and the recommended frequency varies with a child's age, ocular and medical history, and other related risk factors. For infants and toddlers (newborn through 2 years of age), at 6 months the average child has reached key developmental milestones, making this an appropriate age for the first eye and vision examination; within the first 6 months of life, rapid changes occur in most components of the visual system. Because the developing visual system is considered most susceptible to interference during the first few years of life, early diagnosis and treatment are critical to avoid vision loss. There is a high prevalence of eye and vision problems in preterm children, and preterm infants with a history of ROP should be closely monitored.

### Clinical practice guidelines: childhood hearing screening [^1155xvUf]. AAA (2011). Medium credibility.

World Health Organization screening principles — ten criteria for appraising the appropriateness of screening programs are listed, emphasizing that "The condition sought should be an important health problem", that "There should be an accepted treatment for patients with recognized disease", and that "Facilities for diagnosis and treatment should be available". Additional principles include that "There should be a recognizable latent or early symptomatic stage", "There should be a suitable test or examination", and "The test should be acceptable to the population". The framework further specifies that "The natural history of the condition, including development from latent to declared disease, should be adequately understood", "There should be an agreed policy on whom to treat as patients", "The cost of case-finding (including diagnosis and treatment of patients diagnosed) should be economically balanced in relation to possible expenditure on medical care as a whole", and "Case findings should be a continuing process and not a 'once and for all' project".

### American academy of audiology clinical consensus statement: assessment of vestibular function in the pediatric population [^112ZtKN3]. Journal of the American Academy of Audiology (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric rotational chair testing — recording methods outline that methods depend on the child's characteristics, that binocular video goggles are not available in infant/toddler sizes, and that electronystagmography electrodes and/or an infrared camera are recommended for infants and young toddlers with defined limitations. Various recording methods are available for rotational chair testing and the method used will be dependent on the child's age, size, developmental level, and overall compliance. Currently, there are no commercially available binocular goggles sized for infants and young children, so testing with electronystagmography electrodes using a bitemporal montage and/or infrared camera is recommended for infants and young toddlers, but the infrared camera only allows subjective observation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), permits reporting only presence/absence of a VOR response, and cannot be used for VOR suppression testing. Monocular goggles may be used in children about 2 years of age with caregiver assistance or by holding goggles to the face, though this may not be feasible for step velocity testing; adult binocular goggles can be used if binocular recording is preferred but may gap on the child's face, requiring other modifications to ensure a vision-denied state if not using an enclosed rotational chair.

### Positional plagiocephaly: an analysis of the literature on the effectiveness of current guidelines [^114fUVwn]. Neurosurgical Focus (2013). Low credibility.

Object

Positional plagiocephaly (PP) has been on the rise in recent years. In this review, the authors' aim was to assess the effectiveness of current recommendations to parents on this exceedingly common problem through a comprehensive literature search. Additionally, the current treatment options and the most recent studies on PP are reviewed.

Methods

A search of the existing literature was conducted to obtain all relevant studies on guidelines, recommendations, parental and clinician practices, and epidemiological aspects.

Results

Although the incidence and risk factors for PP have been well delineated, there continues to be debates on its management and association with developmental delays. Current guidelines and recommendations on prevention set by the American Association of Pediatrics may not be easily followed by both parents and clinicians. There is also evidence that certain populations, including those with lower education, socioeconomic status, and in particular geographic regions may be more affected by the condition. Additionally, the marketing and financial aspects of PP treatments exist and should be addressed.

Conclusions

Better awareness and education are necessary to inform the population as a whole, although certain populations should be given special attention. Additionally, current guidelines and recommendations can be modified to foster a better grasp of the condition by both parents and clinicians. Adjusting current recommendations, introducing initiatives, and offering elaborate educational campaigns would help deliver these aims. Educating parents on PP as early as possible through clearer guidelines and close monitoring is central to preventing and managing this common condition.

### Screening for autism spectrum disorder in young children: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116LUjsS]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) screening — recommendations of other organizations: The American Academy of Pediatrics' Bright Futures guidelines recommend universal screening for ASD in all children at ages 18 and 24 months with developmental surveillance and monitoring; the American Academy of Family Physicians concludes current evidence is insufficient for children without raised concerns; the American Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society recommend routine developmental surveillance for all children followed by autism screening using validated instruments (the M-CHAT or Autism Screening Questionnaire); the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry recommends routine inclusion of ASD symptomatology in developmental and psychiatric assessments; and the UK National Screening Committee does not recommend systematic population screening, citing concerns about diagnostic stability at young ages, limited positive predictive value data, and weak treatment-efficacy evidence.

### Long-term follow-up of 2 newborns with a combined birth weight of 540 grams [^112njp47]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Long-term growth and developmental data are presented for the smallest and third smallest surviving newborns in the world literature to 5 and 20 years of age, respectively. Both patients exhibited normal motor and language development.

### The value of head circumference measurements after 36 months of age: a clinical report and review of practice patterns [^115j8V1u]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

OBJECT The cranium is documented to grow from birth through adolescence. The standard of practice in primary care is measuring head circumference and plotting growth using curves that stop at 36 months. The authors report the importance of their experience with measuring head circumference in the child and same-sex parent beyond 36 months. METHODS In the University of Florida genetics and pediatric neurosurgery clinics, head circumference is measured and plotted on growth charts through 18 years of age. Circumference and rate of growth over time are compared with those of the same-sex parent. A diagnostic workup is initiated if there is a discrepancy with the patient's head circumference or if there is significant change in the growth rate of the cranium. RESULTS Between January 2004 and December 2007, the lead author examined 190 patients referred by pediatricians and/or pediatric subspecialists because of the concerns regarding head size of the child. Neuroimaging was performed in 70% of the patients prior to referral. None of the patients had their head size compared with that of their same-sex parent prior to referral. On assessing referring physician responses as to why the same-sex parents, head measurements were not pursued prior to imaging or referral to the specialists, the results were: 1) only have head circumference sheets to 36 months of age (n = 28); 2) the American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend it (n = 3); and 3) the head stops growing at 36 months of age (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS Pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists need instruction on head circumference measurement in children from infancy through adolescence, and when indicated, in comparison with the head size of the same-sex parent. This measurement may be an effective and inexpensive assessment tool.

### Infant developmental milestones and subsequent cognitive function [^113Vun3o]. Annals of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Developmental delay is associated with a subsequent diagnosis of learning disability. However, the relationship between the age of reaching infant developmental milestones and later intellectual function within the general population remains unresolved. We hypothesized that earlier attainment of developmental milestones would be associated with better subsequent intellectual performance throughout the range of abilities, rather than confined to extremes.

Methods

Developmental data were obtained at age 2 years in the National Survey of Health and Development, a representative sample of 5,362 children born in the United Kingdom in 1946. Data on intellectual function and educational attainment at ages 8, 26, and 53 years were also obtained. Multiple linear regression and logistic regression were used to analyze the effect of age of reaching developmental milestones on subsequent cognition and educational attainment.

Results

The age of reaching developmental milestones was associated with intellectual performance at ages 8, 26, and 53 years; for every month earlier a child learned to stand, there was, on average, a gain of one half of one intelligence quotient point at age 8. Speech development had a small but statistically significant effect on subsequent educational attainment (later developers were less likely to progress beyond basic education); this effect was not apparent for motor development. Effect sizes were reduced when the slowest developers were excluded, but many effects remained significant.

Interpretation

The association between later development and poorer subsequent intellectual function is small, but it does have theoretical implications; we suggest it is secondary to suboptimal cortical-subcortical connectivity.

### Toilet training [^112XXitU]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Toilet training is a developmental task that impacts families with small children. All healthy children are eventually toilet trained, and most complete the task without medical intervention. Most research on toilet training is descriptive, although some is evidence based. In the United States, the average age at which training begins has increased over the past four decades from earlier than 18 months of age to between 21 and 36 months of age. Newer studies suggest no benefit of intensive training before 27 months of age. Mastery of the developmental skills required for toilet training occurs after 24 months of age. Girls usually complete training earlier than boys. Numerous toilet-training methods are available. The Brazelton child-oriented approach uses physiologic maturity, ability to understand and respond to external feedback, and internal motivation to assess readiness. Dr. Spock's toilet-training approach is another popular method used by parents. The American Academy of Pediatrics incorporates components of the child-oriented approach into its guidelines for toilet training. "Toilet training in a day", a method by Azrin and Foxx, emphasizes operant conditioning and teaches specific toileting components. Because each family and child are unique, recommendations about the ideal time or optimal method must be customized. Family physicians should provide guidance about toilet-training methods and identify children who have difficulty reaching developmental milestones.

Results

Study selection

The process of search and study selection (PRISMA diagram) of this systematic review is showed in Fig. 1. Totally, 504 potential articles were retrieved through searching of PubMed (n = 79), Google Scholar (n = 601), Scopus (n = 93) and ScienceDirect (n = 51) databases. Following the elimination of duplicate articles, 473 studies remained for additional screening. Of these, 442 studies were excluded in the first stage of screening based on the title and abstract of the articles. During critical analysis, 31 articles were screened of which 8 articles were excluded because of non-availability of full text (n = 1), being out of the studied life stage (fetal period) (n = 1), studying autism in combination with Fragile X Syndrome (n = 1), were at ages > 2 years (n = 2), did not measure growth factors during the first year (n = 1), were on high-risk children for ASD (siblings of a child with ASD) (n = 1), and were unrelated (n = 1). Finally, 23 articles were included in the current systematic review.

Quality of articles

As presented in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, the quality of each included study was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scales for cross-sectional and case-control studies resulting in the mean scores of 7.6 and 7.5, respectively (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). These findings indicated that the included studies had a good quality. The most of studies had enough sample sizes and represented infants of the wider community thus scoring well in the selection domain. Scores about the comparability domain were relatively good due to all of the reviewed studies did not adjust all potentially important confounders.

Characterizes of the included studies

The main characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table 1. Of 23 included studies, 16 studies had a retrospective design that used medical records, and 7 studies were conducted prospectively. Both genders had been included in 19 studies, but in 4 cases, it had only been restricted to males. A total of 4959 autistic children were included in this study.

### External hydrocephalus: a probable cause for subdural hematoma in infancy [^112mDjwp]. Pediatric Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Subdural hemorrhage is common in infancy, particularly in the first year of life. The most common cause is nonaccidental (child abuse), with accidental in second place. We present three healthy infants, ages 4, 5, and 7 months that, during an evaluation for macrocephaly, were found to have frontal subdural hematoma in association with prominent extracerebral cerebrospinal fluid spaces (external hydrocephalus). There was no history of trauma or risk factors for child abuse. Skull surveys and ophthalmologic examinations were normal. All infants were neurologically intact and achieved normal developmental milestones in one-year follow-up. We suggest that some infants with external hydrocephalus may be at risk for development of subdural hematoma with minimal or no trauma, most likely secondary to stretching of the bridging veins in the unusually widened subarachnoid spaces. Child abuse, although it should always be kept in mind and should be excluded, may not be the most common cause in this specific context.

### A review of infant growth and psychomotor developmental outcomes after intrauterine exposure to preeclampsia [^112Ppu7F]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Infant development after preeclampsia exposure

Infant psychomotor development refers to the maturation of the brain and central nervous system in four main domains: gross and fine motor skills, speech and language, performance and cognition, and social and personal skills. Despite being a dynamic process influenced by genetic, perinatal, and environmental factors, normal development generally occurs in an ordered and sequential pattern correlating to age-dependent developmental milestones.

Assessment of infant development

Developmental assessment is a longitudinal process involving joint surveillance by both clinicians and parents. Developmental screening tools assist the identification of potential developmental delay, defined in infants as > 2SDs below the mean on age-appropriate standardised testing. The Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ), Parents Evaluation of Developmental Status and Survey of Well-being of Young Children are commonly used, parent-completed screening surveys that assess many domains including fine and gross motor, receptive and expressive communication, problem solving, and personal or social skills. These tools consider parental observation which may increase their sensitivity, however, they may not be suitable for infants younger than 4 months or those with special needs. The Parent Report of Children's Abilities-Revised is useful for screening preterm infants, while the parent-completed Child Development Inventory can assist identification of children with special needs. Similarly, the child-administered Battelle Developmental Inventory Screening Tool, 2 nd edition can be modified for special needs children to assess psychomotor development. The Denver Developmental Screening Test, 2 nd edition and the Brigance Screens also assess infant psychomotor domains through direct elicitation and observation of the child, however are longer to administer (10–20 min) than parent-completed surveys. While these screening tools are generally simple, quick and cost effective to implement in a primary care setting, they are not diagnostic, so children identified at risk of developmental delay require specialist diagnostic developmental assessment.

### Patterns of bruising in preschool children – a longitudinal study [^116M2TMt]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

This large longitudinal study confirms a strong relationship between the presence, number and location of bruises and different stages of motor development. Bruising in babies who were not yet rolling over was uncommon. The percentage of collections with at least one bruise, and the number of bruises at each collection, increased with incremental developmental stage. The most common sites of bruising were below the knees, 'facial T' and head, while rare sites included the ears, neck, genitalia, hands, in any child and buttocks and front trunk in early mobile and premobile children.

There are few studies of bruising in young children. A longitudinal cohort study explored parental reports of injuries in 11 466 children, younger than 6 months of age. Parents recorded 3357 falls in 22% (2554) of these children, visible injuries were reported in 14% of these cases, 56% of which were bruises. Most visible injuries (97%) were to the head. The study concluded that accidents were surprisingly common in infants aged 6 months and younger. The majority were falls, however, injuries were infrequent, and generally trivial.

Other studies have shown that older children have more bruises than younger children.and two studies showed that bruising increased with developmental stage. For all developmental groups the prevalence of bruises in this study was greater than in previous studies (table 4). Explanations for this may include the method of data collection; parents may have been more vigilant in recording faint bruises that they had been monitoring for days prior to the collection date. It is possible that bruises that had not resolved over the weekly interval between collections may have been double counted. However the mean numbers of bruises were similar in the first collection for each child to those for later collections.

Disease Onset

Age of onset was available for 95 patients, for 65 of them the age was recorded in years, and for 30 of them as "infancy" (0–2 years of age), "early childhood" (3–8 years of age), and "middle childhood" (9–11 years of age). Table 3 summarizes the age of onset by developmental stage for all 95 patients. The mean (± SD, median) age of onset for the patients with available age (n = 65) was 3.9 years old (SD ± 3.0; median 3 years). Twelve patients (18.5%) were symptomatic at birth. All patients were symptomatic before 12 years of age (range, 0–11 years). Age at baseline examination is detailed in the BCVA section below.

Table 3
Clinical Findings

Symptoms and Clinical Examination Findings

One hundred and one patients had recorded symptoms at disease onset. A universal finding was decreased visual acuity (100%). The clinical presentation varied (Table 3), but common symptoms included reduced color vision (78.6%), photophobia (53.5%), and nyctalopia (43.6%), with nystagmus occurring in a large proportion of patients (38.6%). Twenty-nine patients (28.7%) had photophobia and nyctalopia, with or without other symptoms. Patients with nystagmus tended to be younger, and the nystagmus was observed to reduce with increasing age. Beyond the 5 common signs, 5 young children had strabismus, and 3 infants had head shaking.

On clinical examination, all patients had clear ocular media. On fundoscopy the peripheral retina was normal in most, including 4 with a tigroid appearance, but 4 patients showed subtle pigment mottling. Macular appearance was variable, being normal in a minority, but in most cases, it ranged from an absent or reduced reflex to a bull's eye appearance, and in advanced cases retinal pigment epithelium hyperpigmentation and atrophic changes were common.

Results

Clinical profile of the study cohort

The overall cohort comprised 17 females and 18 males, whose age at last evaluation ranged between 2 and 36 years [median 13 years, interquartile range (IQR) 12 years]. An overview of the clinical findings can be found in Fig. 1A and Table 1. Detailed clinical information is available in Supplementary Table 2. Consanguinity was reported in 17 families (85%). Pregnancy and delivery were unremarkable for most the patients for whom information was available (27/31, 87%), and all newborns were at term. Birth parameters of length, weight and head circumference, when available, were within normal ranges for almost all the infants. Only two infants presented with decreased head circumference at birth (HP:0011451), and two had low birth weight (HP:0001518). Most of the newborns (31/35, 89%) manifested infantile hypotonia (HP:0008947). Failure to thrive (HP:0001508) and feeding difficulties in the infantile period were documented in 52% and 30% of those examined, respectively (11/21 and 8/26, respectively).

### Promoting optimal development: identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through developmental surveillance and screening… [^112yMnME]. publications.aap.org (2020). Medium credibility.

Special attention to surveillance is recommended at the 4- to 5-year well-child visit, prior to entry into elementary education, with screening completed if there are any concerns. Developmental surveillance includes bidirectional communication with early childhood professionals in child care, preschools, Head Start, and other programs, including home visitation and parenting, particularly around developmental screening. The identification of problems should lead to developmental and medical evaluations, diagnosis, counseling, and treatment, in addition to early developmental intervention. Children with diagnosed developmental disorders are identified as having special health care needs, with initiation of chronic condition management in the pediatric medical home.

Discrete ages for use of these tests are recommended in Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents, Fourth Edition and the accompanying periodicity schedule at the 9-, 18-, and 30-month well-child visits. 16, 17, The recommendation for screening at discrete ages contrasted with earlier statements in which screening at every visit was recommended. Although this clinical report is focused on children ages 0 to 5 years, these recommendations may be considered a minimum and are not intended to be prescriptive. National and international groups focused on young children concur that early childhood spans ages 0 to 8 years and endorse screening beyond age 3 years. The US Administration for Families, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation 26 states that to be effective, screening should begin early and be repeated through early childhood.

Therefore, it is argued that developmental screening may need to be more frequent to optimize the opportunities for detection of risk and connection to intervention. The Algorithm The algorithm presents steps for screening a patient without identified risks for developmental problems at a health supervision visit. Close modal. Step 1: Patient Without Identified Risks or Developmental Problems Arrives for Health Supervision Visit A parent's or professional's developmental concerns should be addressed by the pediatric health care professional as part of developmental surveillance at each pediatric health supervision visit throughout the first 5 years of life, as outlined in the AAP. The recommended ages for developmental screening at the health supervision visit are a starting point for children who are without known identified risks and are not suspected of having a developmental concern.

Because development is dynamic in nature and surveillance has limits, periodic screening with a validated instrument should occur so that a developmental concern not detected by surveillance or an earlier screening can be detected by subsequent screening. Any time that parents, professionals, or others involved in the care of the child raise concerns during surveillance, it is appropriate to perform additional developmental screens using validated tests. These screenings should be recognized separately, with appropriate coding, billing, and payment and with the additional cost acknowledged in capitated expectation. 33 32 Given that developmental and behavioral risks increase with age, a child identified with risks or concerns may merit at least annual formal screening if concerns continue to be identified through surveillance.

### Child development… [^113PeKnH]. Wikipedia (2007). Low credibility.

Childhood is divided into three stages of life which include early childhood, middle childhood, and late childhood. Early childhood typically ranges from infancy to the age of 6 years old. During this period, development is significant, as many of life's milestones happen during this time period such as first words, learning to crawl, and learning to walk. There are various definitions of the periods in a child's development, since each period is a continuum with individual differences regarding starting and ending. Some age-related development periods with defined intervals include: newborn; infant; toddler; preschooler; school-aged child; teens; adolescence; college age.

Stages Sensory Motor: In the first stage in Piaget's theory, infants have the following basic senses: vision, hearing, and motor skills. In this stage, knowledge of the world is limited but is constantly developing due to the child's experiences and interactions. According to Piaget, when an infant reaches about 7–9 months of age they begin to develop what he called object permanence, meaning the child now has the ability to understand that objects keep existing even when they cannot be seen. An example of this would be hiding the child's favorite toy under a blanket, and although the child cannot physically see it they still know to look under the blanket. Preoperational:

During this stage, young children begin analyzing their environment using mental symbols, including words and images; the child will begin to apply these in their everyday lives as they come across different objects, events, and situations. However, Piaget's main focus on this stage, and the reason why he named it "preoperational, " is that children at this point are not able to apply specific cognitive operations, such as mental math. However, at about 7, thought processes of children are no longer egocentric and are more intuitive, meaning they now think about the way something looks, though they do not yet use rational thinking. Concrete: In this stage, children between the age of 7 and 11 use appropriate logic to develop cognitive operations and begin applying this new way of thinking to different events they encounter.

Children in this stage incorporate inductive reasoning, which involves drawing conclusions from other observations in order to make a generalization. Unlike in the preoperational stage, children can now change and rearrange mental images and symbols to form a logical thought, an example of this is "reversibility, " where the child now knows to reverse an action by doing the opposite. Continuity and discontinuity Although the identification of developmental milestones is of interest to researchers and caregivers, many aspects of development are continuous and do not display noticeable milestones. Continuous changes, like growth in stature, involve fairly gradual and predictable progress toward adult characteristics. When developmental change is discontinuous, however, researchers may identify not only milestones of development, but related age periods often called stages.

- Uses deliberate pincer grasp to pick up small objects, toys, and finger foods.
- Stacks objects; also places objects inside one another.
