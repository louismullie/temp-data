## Question

What is the ICD-10-CM code for anthrax when the form/site is not specified in the documentation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10-CM code to use when anthrax is documented but the clinical form or site is not specified. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the ICD-10-CM category structure for anthrax. Then, I should verify whether there is a true unspecified code within that category. Next, I will check coding guidance on when unspecified codes are appropriate. Finally, I will confirm the exact code and any required characters or placeholders, and consider any documentation or payer implications for using an unspecified diagnosis code.

> Let me first confirm the ICD-10-CM category for anthrax. Anthrax is classified in ICD-10-CM under A22, which includes multiple subcategories for cutaneous, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and other specified forms, as well as anthrax sepsis, so the parent category is indeed A22 and I should look for an unspecified option within that block [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the existence of a true unspecified code. Within the A22 category, there is A22.9, which is explicitly labeled as "Anthrax, unspecified", and that matches the scenario where the documentation states anthrax but does not specify the form or site of disease, so A22.9 is the correct choice when the manifestation is not documented [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using an unspecified code. I need to check coding guidance on appropriateness. ICD-10-CM allows unspecified codes when sufficient clinical detail is not known or available, and payers should not deny claims solely for lack of specificity when the clinician has documented the condition to the best of the information at hand, which supports using A22.9 when the form is truly not specified in the record [^d495525c].

> I should confirm whether any additional characters are required. Unlike some ICD-10-CM categories that require a seventh character for encounter type or laterality, the A22.9 code is complete as a five-character code and does not require a seventh character or placeholder, so no extra digits are needed in this case [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the form is actually implied by the clinical context even if not explicitly stated? If there is enough information to reasonably infer cutaneous, inhalational, or gastrointestinal disease, the more specific A22.0–A22.8 code should be used instead of A22.9; unspecified should be reserved only when the form truly cannot be determined from the documentation, so I should double-check the record for any clues before finalizing A22.9 [^notfound].

> Final answer: When anthrax is documented but the form or site is not specified, the correct ICD-10-CM code is **A22.9 Anthrax, unspecified** [^notfound].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for anthrax when the form/site is unspecified is **A22.9** (Anthrax, unspecified). Use this code only when the clinical form (cutaneous, inhalation, gastrointestinal, injection) is not documented; if the form is known, use the specific A22 subcategory (A22.0–A22.8). Accurate coding supports surveillance, public health reporting, and appropriate clinical management [^d495525c] [^c7502b32].

---

## ICD-10-CM code for unspecified anthrax

The ICD-10-CM code for anthrax with an unspecified form or site is **A22.9**, defined as "Anthrax, unspecified" [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting use of A22.9

Use **A22.9** when the medical record documents anthrax but does not specify the clinical form or site of infection. Common scenarios include:

- **Initial presentation**: The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of anthrax, but the specific form (cutaneous, inhalation, gastrointestinal, injection) has not yet been determined.
- **Incomplete documentation**: The clinician documents "anthrax" without specifying the form or site of infection.
- **Laboratory confirmation**: Laboratory tests confirm Bacillus anthracis infection, but the clinical form is not specified in the documentation.

---

## Specific ICD-10-CM codes for anthrax by clinical form

When the clinical form or site of anthrax is specified, use the following **specific ICD-10-CM codes**:

| **Clinical form** | **ICD-10-cm code** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Cutaneous anthrax | A22.0 | Cutaneous anthrax |
| Pulmonary anthrax | A22.1 | Pulmonary anthrax |
| Gastrointestinal anthrax | A22.2 | Gastrointestinal anthrax |
| Anthrax sepsis | A22.7 | Anthrax sepsis |
| Other specified anthrax | A22.8 | Other specified anthrax |

---

## Clinical implications of using unspecified codes

Using **unspecified codes** such as A22.9 has important clinical and public health implications:

- **Surveillance and reporting**: Unspecified codes may limit the ability to accurately track and analyze anthrax cases by clinical form, potentially impacting public health surveillance efforts [^b7ad7b35].
- **Clinical decision-making**: Lack of specificity in coding may hinder clinical decision-making and appropriate management strategies, as treatment protocols vary depending on the clinical form of anthrax [^c7502b32].
- **Resource allocation**: Unspecified codes may complicate resource allocation and public health response planning during outbreaks or bioterrorism events [^23b84f6b].

---

## Documentation requirements and coding best practices

To ensure accurate coding and optimal patient care, clinicians should **document the following**:

- **Clinical form**: Clearly specify the clinical form of anthrax (cutaneous, inhalation, gastrointestinal, injection) based on clinical findings, exposure history, and diagnostic tests [^78f0d928].
- **Exposure history**: Document any known or suspected exposure to Bacillus anthracis, including occupational, environmental, or bioterrorism-related exposures [^2c07f2ca].
- **Diagnostic confirmation**: Record laboratory confirmation of Bacillus anthracis infection, including culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or serological testing results [^bdcac5d0].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for anthrax when the form or site is unspecified is **A22.9** (Anthrax, unspecified). Accurate documentation and coding are essential for effective clinical management, public health surveillance, and outbreak response. Clinicians should strive to document the specific clinical form of anthrax whenever possible to ensure precise coding and optimal patient care [^c7502b32].

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### New classification for deaths and injuries involving terrorism [^af9ed204]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2002). Low credibility.

Classification of the deaths and injuries that occurred as the result of the events of September 11, 2001, presented CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) with a dilemma. Under the current classification systems for mortality and morbidity, the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) and the United States' International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), deaths and injuries associated with acts of terrorism could not be identified uniquely.

Sepsis-related death was defined as a death where any of the following ICD-10 codes appears in any field of the death certificate: A40.0 (septicaemia due to streptococcus, group A), A40.1 (septicaemia due to streptococcus, group B), A40.2 (septicaemia due to streptococcus, group C), A40.3 (septicaemia due to streptococcal pneumonia), A40.8 (other streptococcal septicaemia), A40.9 (streptococcal septicaemia, unspecified), A41.0 (septicemia due to Staphylococcus aureus), A41.1 (septicaemia due to other specified staphylococcus), A41.2 (septicaemia due to other unspecified staphylococcus), A41.3 (septicaemia due to Haemophilus influenzae), A41.4 (septicaemia due to anaerobes), A41.5 (septicaemia due to other Gram-negative organisms), A41.8 (other specified septicaemia), A41.9 (septicaemia, unspecified), A02.1 (salmonella septicaemia), A22.7 (anthrax septicaemia), A26.8 (erysipelothrix septicaemia), A32.7 (listerial septicaemia), A42.7 (actinomycotic septicaemia), B00.7 (herpesviral septicaemia), and B37.7 (candidal septicaemia). Like other researchers who have investigated sepsis utilising administrative datasets, we used ICD codes for septicaemia to identify sepsis-associated deaths.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^ee9cc1cf]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Finally, 14 discrepancies (10 in MCA, 4 in MCB) involved the 'unspecified' category. The large number of new and more detailed external cause codes in ICD-10-CM allowed some records to be reassigned to other categories by the ICD-10-CM matrix. However, a single ICD-10-CM code (X58, 'exposure to other specified factors') encompasses both the concept of 'other specified (unintentional injury), not elsewhere classifiable' and the concept of unspecified unintentional injury, whereas these concepts were represented by two different codes in ICD-9-CM (E928.8 and E928.9, respectively). As a result, some records categorised as 'other specified' by the ICD-9-CM matrix were categorised as 'unspecified' by the ICD-10-CM matrix. This finding is also consistent with the Kentucky data, which showed an immediate significant increase in 'unspecified' injury hospitalisation rates and a corresponding decrease in 'other specified' injury hospitalisation rates when ICD-10-CM was implemented.

### Use of automated ambulatory-care encounter records for detection of acute illness clusters, including potential bioterrorism events [^da450e5c]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

While any simplification inevitably hides some potentially important detail, we believe that in addition to making the reports more comprehensible, grouping the ICD-9 codes decreases the impact of variation in coding practices. This effect is particularly important since the earliest manifestations of an outbreak may be nonspecific. The fact that syndromic surveillance focuses on unusual counts of common events means that detection of a signal may not be greatly influenced by intensity of diagnostic testing performed, completeness of documentation in the medical record, or variation between physicians or health-care systems in the use of diagnostic terminology or assignment of ICD-9 codes. For example, we have shown that > 90% of lower respiratory illness episodes are represented by only three of the 119 ICD-9 diagnosis codes included in the lower respiratory illness syndrome. As new ICD coding schemes are adopted, changes to the mapping used to translate code into syndrome will be required, but variation among tens of thousands of discrete individual codes is unlikely to have any major impact at the level of the broad syndromes used in our system.

This emphasis on broad groupings of diagnoses also supports the notion that different data sources, including automated medical records, nurse call centers, and transaction data, might be combined into an integrated surveillance system. Because the focus is on the acute illness that prompts a medical encounter, we expect that the performance characteristics will not be seriously affected by differences between automated data systems, for instance, in the number of diagnoses captured or in the method of assigning diagnosis codes. However, experience with additional systems will be required to elucidate these issues. To the extent that different systems yield similar discrimination of events of interest, it will be possible to integrate them at the regional level, to improve overall sensitivity, and at the national level, to allow coherent surveillance of the entire population.

While many types of data systems can contribute valuable surveillance information, appreciating the added value of more sophisticated data sources is also important. For instance, the availability of temperatures in the automated medical record system described here allows automated surveillance for influenza-like illness. The availability of automated laboratory test results and free text also provides opportunities to detect a wider array of conditions and to improve the specificity of detection of acute illness clusters. For example, anthrax surveillance might be limited to patients with fever and a lower respiratory illness syndrome.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Multisite medical record review of emergency department visits for unspecified injury of head following the ICD-10-CM coding transition [^01756f4a]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI), a disruption of the normal function of the brain due to an external force, can be temporary or have life-long consequences.TBI is preventable. State and federal public health agencies monitor the burden of TBI and identify risk factors in a population, using public health surveillance definitions and existing data sources, such as administrative billing claims for emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalisations. On 1 October 2015 in the USA, morbidity diagnosis coding in billing claims transitioned to the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). This necessitated the development of a new surveillance definition for TBI morbidity.

In 2016, the CDC proposed an ICD-10-CM surveillance definition for TBI morbidity that excludes the diagnosis code for 'unspecified injury of head' (S09.90), although the previous ICD-9-CM TBI morbidity surveillance definition included its complementary ICD-9-CM diagnosis code (959.01). In the ICD-9-CM coding era, multiple studies found that the 'unspecified injury to the head' codes represented a majority (50%–58%) of TBI morbidity records identified in their samples. Notably, in a prospective cohort study, only 25% of cases assigned the diagnosis code 'unspecified injury to the head' (ICD-9-CM 959.01 code) met the clinical definition of TBI. Currently, the positive predictive value (PPV) of the unspecified injury of head ICD-10-CM S09.90 diagnosis code for identifying TBI morbidity is unknown. Given concerns about the validity of this code in ICD-9-CM, the purpose of this study was to assess a sample of ED medical records, identified from administrative billing data and assigned diagnosis code S09.90 (without the proposed TBI codes (referred to as uniquely assigned throughout the manuscript text and tables)), for evidence of TBI based on medical documentation in four states. At the national surveillance level, the effect of excluding the unspecified injury of head S09.90 code from the CDC's TBI morbidity surveillance case definition, on the magnitude of TBI-related ED visits, is unknown. Understanding the PPV of the S09.90 code for TBI in the ED is of paramount importance as prevention strategies and resources are influenced by incidence estimates based on the TBI surveillance case definition.

### The primary care differential diagnosis of inhalational anthrax [^55a01ea0]. Annals of Family Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Inhalational anthrax is an extremely rare infectious disease with nonspecific initial symptoms, thus making diagnosis on clinical grounds difficult. After a covert release of anthrax spores, primary care physicians will be among the first to evaluate cases. This study defines the primary care differential diagnosis of inhalational anthrax.

Methods

In May 2002, we mailed survey instruments consisting of 3 randomly chosen case vignettes describing patients with inhalational anthrax to a nationwide random sample of 665 family physicians. Nonrespondents received additional mailings. Physicians were asked to provide their most likely nonanthrax diagnosis for each case.

Results

The response rate was 36.9%. Diagnoses for inhalational anthrax were grouped into 35 diagnostic categories, with pneumonia (42%), influenza (10%), viral syndrome (9%), septicemia (8%), bronchitis (7%), central nervous system infection (6%), and gastroenteritis (4%) accounting for 86% of all diagnoses. Diagnoses differed significantly between cases that proved to be fatal and those that proved to be nonfatal.

Conclusions

Inhalational anthrax resembles common diagnoses in primary care. Surveillance systems for early detection of bioterrorism events that rely only on diagnostic codes will be hampered by false-positive alerts. Consequently, educating frontline physicians to recognize and respond to bioterrorism is of the highest priority.

### Multisite medical record review of emergency department visits for unspecified injury of head following the ICD-10-CM coding transition [^ed96f549]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Results of this multisite medical record review of sampled ED cases assigned S09.90 unspecified injury of head (without other TBI codes) suggest the potential for missed TBI cases when conducting surveillance using ED administrative data. Individual state PPV ranged from 36% to 52% using criteria that assigned a medium or higher level of certainty a TBI occurred. TBI diagnosis and TBI surveillance using diagnostic coding is impeded by the transitory and variable manifestations of the condition itself, as well as the lack of objective diagnostic tools.

What is already known on this subject

In the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) coding era, multiple studies found that the 'unspecified head injury' codes comprised a majority of traumatic brain injury (TBI) morbidity cases in their emergency department samples. In 2016, the CDC excluded the ICD-10-CM complementary diagnosis code to 'unspecified, head injury' (S09.90) from the proposed TBI morbidity surveillance case definition.

What this study adds

Results of this multisite medical record review of sampled emergency department cases assigned S09.90 'unspecified injury of head' suggest the potential for missed TBI cases in a routinely used public health surveillance data source. Using our high and medium levels of certainty a TBI has occurred, individual state PPV ranged from 36% to 52% and represents a significant percentage of potentially missed TBI cases.

### Multisite medical record review of emergency department visits for unspecified injury of head following the ICD-10-CM coding transition [^9ca50141]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

An ongoing challenge in accurately identifying non-fatal TBI cases in healthcare administrative data is the frequent use of the 'unspecified injury to the head' ICD diagnostic code. Multiple studies using the ICD-9-CM TBI morbidity surveillance case definition found that the 'unspecified' codes comprised a majority (50%–58%) of TBI cases in their sample. In 2016, a proposed ICD-10-CM-based surveillance definition for TBI morbidity was introduced that excluded the unspecified injury of head (S09.90) diagnosis code. To examine the use of this code subsequent to the switch to ICD-10-CM, the current study randomly sampled charts uniquely assigned the S09.90 code (unspecified injury of head) and found wide variation in PPV; among the four states, 23%–41% of sampled records contained high certainty evidence of TBI in the medical record. This finding is consistent with a previous prospective cohort study of patients presenting to an urban academic ED. Bazarian et al found that 75% (299 of 397) of charts assigned ICD-9-CM code 959.01, 'head injury, unspecified', did not meet the clinical definition of mild TBI based on the absence of a documented LOC, mental status change or amnesia.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

Antimicrobial treatment for systemic disease if meningitis is ruled out — combination principles: with the following 4 exceptions, options are similar to suspected meningitis, and first, treatment should include ≥ 2 antimicrobial drugs with activity against B. anthracis; ≥ 1 should have bactericidal activity and ≥ 1 should be a protein synthesis inhibitor.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^d495525c]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity," and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity." Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice." New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness," and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs." To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service," exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms."

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

After applying the most conservative criteria to the medical records, approximately 37%, 27%, 41% and 23% of sampled records from Maryland, Kentucky, Colorado and Massachusetts, respectively, contained evidence of a TBI with high certainty (table 4). In addition, approximately 10%, 10%, 11% and 13% of sampled medical records from Maryland, Kentucky, Colorado and Massachusetts, contained evidence of a TBI with 'medium certainty', respectively. Approximately 23%, 23%, 19% and 38% of medical records from Maryland, Kentucky, Colorado and Massachusetts had 'low certainty' evidence of a TBI, respectively. Results presented here should not be interpreted as TBI prevalence for each state as they were drawn among a sample of cases.

### Centers for disease control and prevention expert panel meetings on prevention and treatment of anthrax in adults [2014] [^f53370b1]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Anthrax — initial evaluation and hospitalization: Hospitalization is warranted for all patients with systemic cutaneous anthrax; gastrointestinal, injection, or inhalation anthrax; or anthrax meningitis or bacteremia. Initial evaluation should be similar to an acute febrile illness with an emphasis on obtaining pretreatment blood and other appropriate cultures, and failure to fulfill systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria should not decrease concern for sepsis. Inhalation anthrax can have a prodromal phase followed by a fulminant phase, and patients with systemic anthrax may show transitory improvement followed by precipitous hemodynamic deterioration; therefore hospitalized patients should have careful hemodynamic monitoring, including continuous pulse oximetry and telemetry. Chest computed tomography might be needed to identify the characteristic widened mediastinum and pleural effusions, and unless contraindicated, lumbar puncture should be performed to rule out meningitis.

### Use of the postacute sequelae of COVID-19 diagnosis code in routine clinical practice in the US [^505766f9]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

A new International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis code (U09.9 Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified) was introduced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on October 1, 2021.

Objective

To examine the use of the U09.9 code and describe concurrently diagnosed conditions to understand physician use of this code in clinical practice.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study of US patients with an ICD-10-CM code for post-COVID-19 condition used deidentified patient-level claims data aggregated by HealthVerity. Children and adolescents (aged 0–17 years) and adults (aged 18–64 and ≥ 65 years) with a post-COVID-19 condition code were identified between October 1, 2021, and January 31, 2022. To identify a prior COVID-19 diagnosis, 3 months of continuous enrollment (CE) before the post-COVID-19 diagnosis date was required.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Presence of the ICD-10-CM U09.9 code.

Results

There were 56 143 patients (7723 female patients [61.2%]; mean [SD] age, 47.6 [19.2] years) with a post-COVID-19 diagnosis code, with cases increasing in mid-December 2021 following the trajectory of the Omicron case wave by 3 to 4 weeks. The analysis cohort included 12 622 patients after the 3-month preindex CE criteria was applied. Among this cohort, the median (IQR) age was 49 (35–61) years; however, 1080 (8.6%) were pediatric patients. The U09.9 code was used most often in the outpatient setting, although 305 older adults (14.0%) were inpatients. Only 698 patients (5.5%) had at least 1 of the 5 codes listed as possible concurrent conditions in the coding guidance. Only 8879 patients (70.4%) had a documented acute COVID-19 diagnosis code (569 [52.7%] among children), and the median (IQR) time between acute COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 diagnosis codes was 56 (21–200) days. The most common concurrently coded conditions varied by age; children experienced COVID-19-like symptoms (eg, 207 [19.2%] had cough and 115 [10.6%] had breathing abnormalities), while 459 older adults aged 65 years or older (21.1%) experienced respiratory failure and 189 (8.7%) experienced viral pneumonia.

Conclusions and Relevance

This retrospective cohort study found patients with a post-COVID-19 ICD-10-CM diagnosis code following the acute phase of COVID-19 disease among patients of all ages in clinical practice in the US. The use of the U09.9 code encompassed a wide range of conditions. It will be important to monitor how the use of this code changes as the pandemic continues to evolve.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Management of anthrax [^764bcf27]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

From 3 October 2001 through 16 November 2001, in the United States, there were 18 confirmed cases of inhalational and cutaneous anthrax, an additional 4 suspected cases of cutaneous anthrax, and 5 deaths due to inhalational anthrax. Although the number of cases was relatively small, this experience brought bioterrorism and its potential to sharp focus as thousands of people began receiving prophylactic antibiotics after possible exposure to anthrax spores. These events have resulted in a substantial impact on the health care system, including the rewriting of pneumonia guidelines, new emphasis on identification of microbial etiology, substantial infusion of funds for bioterrorism-related research, and a sudden mandate for regional disaster and public health planning. This article provides clinicians with clinically relevant information about the diagnosis and management of anthrax.

### Use of ICD-10-CM coded hospitalisation and emergency department data for injury surveillance [^ee350889]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Injury surveillance, the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of injury data, provides critical information to support public health efforts to reduce injury-related morbidity, mortality and disability. For the past several decades, state and local health departments and national agencies in the USA have relied on the use of hospital discharge and emergency department (ED) data coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to conduct injury surveillance. Surveillance case definitions and analyses have been based on ICD-9-CM codes. However, a US mandate to code using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM)has resulted in a need to update injury surveillance case definitions and analysis guidance based on ICD-10-CM.

Beginning in October 2015, the US Department of Health and Human Services required all hospitals and healthcare providers covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act to use the ICD-10-CM to report electronic healthcare transactions. The coding structure of ICD-10-CM is based on ICD-10 mortality coding and classification published by the WHO, however, the classification scheme has been greatly expanded to capture the diagnostic detail needed for medical diagnoses. ICD-10-CM contains nearly five times the number of codes found in ICD-9-CM (approximately 72 000 codes in ICD-10-CM compared with 15 000 codes in ICD-9-CM). Because ICD-10-CM captures greater detail than either ICD-9-CM or ICD-10, this classification system has the potential to provide enhanced understanding of the types and causes of non-fatal injury.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^5e1c6ada]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — ICD-10 CM coding rules for seventh characters and laterality state that the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category and must always be the 7th character in the data field; if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Inhalational anthrax due to bioterrorism: would current centers for disease control and prevention guidelines have identified the 11 patients with inhalational anthrax from October through November 2001? [^3b8befd6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

A panel of 10 physicians used the nominal group technique to assess the ability of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) interim guidelines for clinical evaluation of persons with possible inhalational anthrax (IA) to retrospectively identify the 11 patients with IA seen during the October 2001 bioterrorism outbreak. The guidelines would not have identified 10 of 11 of these patients, primarily because the guidelines were designed to address only those patients with a known history of exposure or clearly identified environmental or occupational risk. The panel suggested revisions to the guidelines, primarily consisting of broadening the criteria for evaluation to include either known exposure or environmental occupational risk, or to include clinical symptoms consistent with IA. These extensions of the guidelines retrospectively identified 8 of 11 of the patients with IA from October 2001.

This notice describes the clinical evaluation of persons who are not known to be at increased risk for anthrax but who have symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI). Clinicians evaluating persons with ILI should consider a combination of epidemiologic, clinical, and, if indicated, laboratory and radiographic test results to evaluate the likelihood that inhalational anthrax is the basis for ILI symptoms.

### Centers for disease control and prevention expert panel meetings on prevention and treatment of anthrax in adults [2014] [^0235012a]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance considerations in systemic anthrax — naturally occurring B. anthracis has variable β-lactam resistance, particularly to cephalosporins; thus, cephalosporins are contraindicated. In addition, multidrug resistance in naturally occurring B. anthracis infection has been reported and can be induced in vitro. This finding increases concern that a B. anthracis strain could be resistant to ≥ 1 recommended antimicrobial drug options or that use of β-lactams for a strain that was originally β-lactam susceptible could lead to development of β-lactam-resistance during prophylaxis, if adherence to treatment is poor. Another concern is that β-lactam use could induce resistance during treatment, especially with the high bacterial loads characteristic of systemic anthrax, and penicillin-based antimicrobial drug use requires a high index of suspicion for emergence of resistance.

### The impacts of ICD-10-CM on U.S. army injury surveillance [^03443bd9]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Injuries are the leading cause of medical encounters and lost work days in the U.S. Army, affecting more than half of active-duty soldiers annually. Historically, Army injury surveillance has captured both acute traumatic and cumulative microtraumatic overuse injuries. This article describes how the transition from the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM impacted U.S. military injury surveillance by comparing injury rates and distributions under both systems.

Methods

Mapping ICD-9-CM codes to the expanded ICD-10-CM codes is not a straightforward endeavor; therefore, the Army Public Health Center incorporated ICD-10-CM codes into a comprehensive, systematic approach to taxonomically categorize injuries. This taxonomic methodology was applied to Army injuries under ICD-10-CM (2016–2019) and compared with the ICD-9-CM Army injury surveillance definitions (2012–2015).

Results

Soldier injury rates appeared to increase when surveillance with ICD-10-CM began. Soldiers experienced 1,276 incident injury medical encounters per 1,000 person-years in 2015 (ICD-9-CM), compared with 1,804 injuries per 1,000 in 2016 (ICD-10-CM), a 41% increase. Importantly, the distribution of injuries also shifted, such that the average cumulative microtraumatic injury rate increased by 42% during 2016–2019 (ICD-10-CM) compared with the 2012–2015 average (ICD-9-CM), whereas acute traumatic injuries only increased by 17%.

Conclusions

The enhanced descriptions provided by ICD-10-CM codes and the applied taxonomic categorizations have improved precision in Army injury surveillance. Data unequivocally show that most injuries in this physically active population are cumulative microtraumatic injuries. The taxonomic methodology can be extended to injury surveillance in other populations and may allow a more efficient transition to ICD-11-CM.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

Anthrax pathogenesis describes that B. anthracis is a nonmotile spore-forming, gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium, with spores as the infectious form that can remain dormant for decades while vegetative B. anthracis rarely causes disease. Route of entry determines clinical form: skin exposure leads to cutaneous or injection anthrax, gastrointestinal exposure leads to gastrointestinal anthrax, and inhalational exposure leads to inhalation anthrax; after entry, spores are believed to germinate locally or be transported by phagocytic cells to the lymphatics and regional lymph nodes, where they germinate; or both.

### Use of ICD-10-CM coded hospitalisation and emergency department data for injury surveillance [^33894c69]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Epidemiologists and researchers who are transitioning from the use of ICD-9-CM coded data to ICD-10-CM coded data should note the substantial differences in the injury diagnosis and external cause-of-injury codes in the two coding systems. These differences, which have the potential to either introduce or alleviate bias in non-fatal injury measurement, have been described in detail elsewhere. Important differences that have implications for injury surveillance include:

Changes in the codes that identify events involving poisoning or toxic effects. In ICD-9-CM, two codes were required to describe each poisoning event — a diagnosis code (960–979 and 980–989) to describe the type of drug or toxic substance involved and an external cause code (E850–E858, E860–E869, E930–E949, E950–E952, E961–E962 and E980–E982) to describe the intent of the poisoning or adverse effect (eg, accidental (unintentional), intentional self-harm, homicide or undetermined). In ICD-10-CM, the information about both the drug or substance involved and the intent are captured in a single code (T36–T50 for drugs and biological substances, and T51–65 for toxic effects of non-drug substances). These T codes contain a character in the code to specify the intent of the poisoning (ie, accidental (unintentional), intentional self-harm, assault, undetermined, adverse effect and underdosing).
Expansion of codes to identify events involving asphyxiation. ICD-10-CM contains more than 40 diagnosis codes for asphyxiation or strangulation by different mechanisms (T71 codes), compared with a single diagnosis code in ICD-9-CM (994.7). The T71 codes include a character in the code to specify the intent (ie, accidental (unintentional), intentional self-harm, assault and undetermined) of the asphyxiation.
Separate codes in ICD-10-CM (T74 and T76) distinguish between suspected and confirmed child and adult abuse and neglect.
Introduction of the new concept of encounter type in ICD-10-CM. Most injury diagnosis codes and external cause codes in ICD-10-CM include a seventh character (a letter) that provides information on the type of medical care encounter when the diagnosis or external cause-of-injury was determined. The character specifies whether the injury diagnosis is related to: (1) the initial encounter, defined as while the patient is receiving active treatment for the condition, (2) a subsequent encounter, defined as routine care during the healing or recovery phase after the active treatment phase has ended or (3) sequelae, defined as complications or conditions that arise as a direct result of an injury.
Consideration of both diagnosis codes and external cause codes to identify all cases of intentional self-harm. In ICD-9-CM, all mechanisms of intentional self-harm were captured using external cause codes. In ICD-10-CM, while many mechanisms of intentional self-harm are captured using external cause codes (X71–X83), intentional self-harm involving poisoning or asphyxiation are captured by diagnosis codes (subsets of T36–T65 and T71).

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^d657da98]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study suggests that users of injury morbidity data can anticipate some discontinuities in temporal trends at the injury cause/mechanism level due to the switch from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM on 1 October 2015, and the resulting switch from the ICD-9-CM matrix to the ICD-10-CM matrix. The CRs reported in tables 4 and 5, based on dually coded datasets from two large academic trauma centres, illustrate the potential magnitude of these discontinuities and highlight specific differences between external cause of injury codes in the two code sets. For several mechanisms/causes, the CRs were equal to unity, but different records were classified in the same category (PPA < 100%) by the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM matrices.

### Anthrax as a biological weapon, 2002: updated recommendations for management [^23b84f6b]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To review and update consensus-based recommendations for medical and public health professionals following a Bacillus anthracis attack against a civilian population.

Participants

The working group included 23 experts from academic medical centers, research organizations, and governmental, military, public health, and emergency management institutions and agencies.

Evidence

MEDLINE databases were searched from January 1966 to January 2002, using the Medical Subject Headings anthrax, Bacillus anthracis, biological weapon, biological terrorism, biological warfare, and biowarfare. Reference review identified work published before 1966. Participants identified unpublished sources.

Consensus Process

The first draft synthesized the gathered information. Written comments were incorporated into subsequent drafts. The final statement incorporated all relevant evidence from the search along with consensus recommendations.

Conclusions

Specific recommendations include diagnosis of anthrax infection, indications for vaccination, therapy, postexposure prophylaxis, decontamination of the environment, and suggested research. This revised consensus statement presents new information based on the analysis of the anthrax attacks of 2001, including developments in the investigation of the anthrax attacks of 2001; important symptoms, signs, and laboratory studies; new diagnostic clues that may help future recognition of this disease; current anthrax vaccine information; updated antibiotic therapeutic considerations; and judgments about environmental surveillance and decontamination.

Anthrax in adults — procedures and surgical interventions: Pleural fluid drainage has been positively associated with survival, and these data support the need for early and aggressive drainage of any clinically or radiographically apparent pleural effusions; chest tube drainage is recommended over thoracentesis because many effusions will require prolonged drainage. Thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracic surgery might be required to remove gelatinous or loculated collections, and ascites should also be drained and monitored for reaccumulation; continuous drainage might be required. Surgery might be contraindicated or indicated, depending on the type of anthrax; for cutaneous disease, surgery is contraindicated for acute disease, with the exception of tracheotomy for airway obstruction and surgical intervention for large or circumferential extremity lesions causing compartment syndrome. Surgery may be indicated for gastrointestinal anthrax to identify and address potentially fatal complications, such as bowel ischemia, necrosis, and perforation, and for injection anthrax, surgery is used to obtain diagnostic specimens and to remove the necrotic nidus of infection; surgery for injection anthrax should be more limited than that for necrotizing fasciitis, and resection should be performed only to healthy tissue. Compression of soft tissues can be released by incision, excision, or fasciotomy and might be required for treatment of compartment syndrome, and diathermy dissection is advised to optimize hemostasis.

Pathogenesis and disease across exposure routes — Bacillus anthracis enters as spores via the epidermis, gastrointestinal epithelium, or lung mucosa; symptoms of any form usually begin within 7 days of exposure; inhalation anthrax is not pneumonia and typically involves mediastinal lymph nodes; vegetative spread can cause systemic anthrax with hypotensive shock and sudden death, which is typically fatal unless diagnosed and treated promptly; anthrax meningitis can occur secondary to any of the three forms and is most often associated with inhalation anthrax.

Anthrax — hemodynamic support: Despite potential pathophysiologic differences, standard sepsis and septic shock guidelines should be followed for anthrax patients, including fluids, vasopressors, blood products, and invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhage commonly occur and must be aggressively managed, and might pose contraindications to invasive central catheter placement. Fresh frozen plasma and plasmapheresis should be considered, and fibrinogen levels should be kept > 100 mg/dL. Because of the risk for coagulopathy, mechanical rather than pharmacologic prophylaxis is preferred for prevention of deep vein thrombosis. An echocardiogram might be needed to identify pericardial effusions, as reported for 3 of 10 patients with inhalation anthrax in 2001.

Critical care evaluation for anthrax emphasizes early intervention and quantifies mortality by clinical form: Early diagnosis of anthrax and initiation of appropriate treatment, particularly administration of a combination of antimicrobial drugs, are critical to improving survival. After treatment, uncomplicated cutaneous anthrax has a mortality rate of < 2%, and even with antimicrobial drug treatment and modern critical care, injection, gastrointestinal, and inhalation anthrax have mortality rates of 28%, ≥ 40%, and 45%, respectively. Anthrax meningitis is nearly always fatal, even with treatment, many patients with cutaneous anthrax can be treated as outpatients, and examples of systemic involvement signs include tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, hyperthermia, hypothermia, and leukocytosis.

Retinal arterial occlusion ICD-10 CM codes — Central retinal artery occlusion includes H34.11, H34.12, and H34.13; arterial branch occlusion includes H34.231, H34.232, and H34.233; partial retinal artery occlusion includes H34.211, H34.212, and H34.213; and transient retinal artery occlusion includes H34.01, H34.02, and H34.03. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality, and if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3; ICD = International Classification of Diseases and CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States.

Figure 1
The anatomy of an ICD-10-CM drug poisoning diagnosis code. ICD-10-CM, International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification.

Several key changes in the diagnosis codes from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM guidance had to be considered when defining and tracking drug overdose indicators. These include the following:

External cause of injury codes for drug poisoning were combined with diagnostic codes in ICD-10-CM: under ICD-9-CM, poisoning surveillance indicators relied on both poisoning diagnosis codes, which described the substances involved, and poisoning external cause codes, which conveyed the intent (eg, suicide or unintentional). Under ICD-10-CM, the poisoning diagnosis codes or T-codes (T36-T50) include information on both the substances involved and intent of the injury (ie, '1': accidental, '2': intentional self-harm, '3': assault, '4': undetermined, '5': adverse effect and '6': underdosing).
Coding of undetermined and accidental poisonings changed in ICD-10-CM: under ICD-9-CM, medical coders were instructed to select undetermined intent for external causes of injury when the intent was unspecified in the medical record; however, the guidance under ICD-10-CM instructs coders to default to accidental intent and only select undetermined intent if the medical record explicitly indicates that the intent is undetermined.
ICD-10-CM introduced the concept of underdosing: ICD-10-CM introduced the concept of 'underdosing', the use of less than the prescribed drug according to a provider or drug manufacturer.
ICD-10-CM introduced the concept of encounter type: ICD-10-CM introduced the new concept of encounter type for many injury diagnosis codes. For drug poisoning T-codes, a seventh character of 'A' indicates an initial encounter, 'D' indicates a subsequent encounter and 'S' indicates sequela. An initial encounter captures when a patient is receiving active treatment for the injury event, though it may not be the first encounter related to that injury event (eg, receiving treatment from two physicians for the same injury). A subsequent encounter captures when a patient is seen after active treatment for a follow-up related to the initial injury (eg, follow-up visit related to an overdose). A sequela captures when a patient is being treated for a secondary condition that arose because of the injury (eg, peripheral neuropathy).

### Centers for disease control and prevention expert panel meetings on prevention and treatment of anthrax in adults [2014] [^96a68e52]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Anthrax — mechanical ventilation: Some patients with anthrax might require mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress or airway protection, and others might need respiratory support for airway edema; substantial edema with fatal outcome can occur with cutaneous lesions involving the head, neck, or thorax and with oropharyngeal lesions, so aggressive monitoring for airway compromise is warranted. In inhalation anthrax, respiratory failure is more consistent with reaccumulating pleural effusions than with adult respiratory distress syndrome, and standard mechanical ventilatory principles apply. Airway pressures may be difficult to interpret if pulmonary compliance is reduced by chest wall edema or by pleural or peritoneal effusions, and the need for ventilation and its duration may be reduced by pleural space drainage.

During 1999–2010, there were 1,676 unspecified neuroinfectious disease deaths among persons 2–22 years old; 49% (826/1,676) occurred during July–September of each year studied, and of those, 23% (192/826) were reported from an included state in the southern United States; 52% (100/192) were male and 48% (92/192) female. An average of 16 (8 male, 8 female) unspecified neuroinfectious deaths per year fit the typical pattern of PAM, in addition to the average 3 laboratory-confirmed cases annually during this time period.

Among all unspecified neuroinfectious deaths, the most common unspecified neuroinfectious death code used was G03.9 meningitis unspecified (n = 505) (Table). For the top 5 codes, 8%–16% of cases matched all the risk factors and 2 had a sex ratio of exactly 50%. We did not have access to death certificates for 20 known laboratory-confirmed case-patients to determine what ICD-10 codes were used in these cases.

Treatment for Cutaneous Anthrax without Systemic Involvement

Uncomplicated cutaneous anthrax has been successfully treated with a single oral antimicrobial drug (Technical Appendix Table 5). Oral fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin) and doxycycline are equivalent first-line agents. Clindamycin is an alternative option if fluoroquinolones and doxycycline are contraindicated or unavailable. Given the long history of successful treatment of localized uncomplicated cutaneous anthrax with penicillin, amoxicillin and penicillin VK are also alternative therapeutic options if the isolate is known to be susceptible to penicillin. However, adequate dosages must be used because of the potential for development of drug resistance during treatment with subtherapeutic dosing.

Duration of treatment for localized or uncomplicated cutaneous disease depends on the B. anthracis exposure source. If naturally acquired (e.g. animals with anthrax, products such as hides from animals with anthrax), a 7–10-day course of antimicrobial drugs is sufficient. If bioterrorism-related exposure or an aerosol exposure is suspected, the recommendation is the same as that for PEP (Technical Appendix Table 2) because the patient is likely to have also inhaled spores.

### Anthrax in Europe: its epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and role in bioterrorism [^891d95af]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

In the 2001 bioterrorist attack in the United States, in which at least 22 cases of anthrax occurred, there was initial uncertainty as to whether the index case was acquired from natural sources, and many of the additional cases posed diagnostic challenges to clinicians unfamiliar with the disease. The existence in Europe of terrorist groups with demonstrated violent tendencies suggests Europe is not immune to bioterrorist attack, and the same epidemiological and clinical confusion could happen here. Bacillus anthracis is distributed widely in the soils of Europe and foci of animal disease occur, notably in southern and eastern Europe. Sporadic human cases occur in these areas, and occasional additional cases have been acquired from contaminated, imported materials or acquired in countries outside of Europe, where anthrax may be common. Depending upon the intent of a bioterrorist, illness-caused B. anthracis could take one of several clinical forms-inhalational, cutaneous or gastrointestinal-and each would pose diagnostic difficulties. Understanding the epidemiologic, pathophysiologic and bioterrorism principles of anthrax are the clinician's best means of early detection of cases.

A confirmed case of anthrax was defined as clinically compatible illness (cutaneous, inhalational, or gastrointestinal) that was either 1) laboratory confirmed by isolation of B. anthracis from a patient's clinical specimens, or 2) associated with other laboratory evidence of B. anthracis infection based on at least two supportive tests. A suspected case of anthrax was defined as a clinically compatible illness with no alternative diagnosis and no isolation of B. anthracis, but with either 1) laboratory evidence of B. anthracis by one supportive laboratory test or 2) an epidemiologic link to an environmental B. anthracis exposure.

### Ready or not! here comes ICD-10 [^7cb0ab4c]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) is a new system that is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on 16 January 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of 1 October 2013. While ICD-9 and ICD-10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains more than 141 000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the < 20 000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion and expense. Published statistics illustrate that there are instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 distinct ICD-10 codes. Also, there are multiple instances where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of healthcare whereas detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25 000 to $50 000.

Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Variation in completeness of coding external cause of injuries under ICD-10-CM [^617b7d53]. Injury Prevention (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Information about causes of injury is key for injury prevention efforts. Historically, cause-of-injury coding in clinical practice has been incomplete due to the need for extra diagnosis codes in the International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding. The transition to ICD-10-CM and increased use of clinical support software for diagnosis coding is expected to improve completeness of cause-of-injury coding. This paper assesses the recording of external cause-of-injury codes specifically for those diagnoses where an additional code is still required.

Methods

We used electronic health record and claims data from 10 health systems from October 2015 to December 2021 to identify all inpatient and emergency encounters with a primary diagnosis of injury. The proportion of encounters that also included a valid external cause-of-injury code is presented.

Results

Most health systems had high rates of cause-of-injury coding: over 85% in emergency departments and over 75% in inpatient encounters with primary injury diagnoses. However, several sites had lower rates in both settings. State mandates were associated with consistently high external cause recording.

Conclusions

Completeness of cause-of-injury coding improved since the adoption of ICD-10-CM coding and increased slightly over the study period at most sites. However, significant variation remained, and completeness of cause-of-injury coding in any diagnosis data used for injury prevention planning should be empirically determined.

### Accuracy of the modified global burden of disease international classification of diseases coding methods for identifying sepsis: a prospective multicentre cohort study [^de41b062]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

ICD-10-AM codes adapted from the GBD sepsis study demonstrated a low accuracy in identifying clinically diagnosed sepsis cases using Sepsis 3 criteria. Of the methods assessed, the modified GBD implicit plus method produced the most reliable estimates of sepsis incidence and mortality. All ICD coding methods showed poor agreement with clinical diagnosis of sepsis. Unspecified sepsis, infection, and organ dysfunction codes along with incomplete documentation of causative microorganisms and organ dysfunction contributes significantly to inaccuracies in using the modified GBD codes to identify sepsis.

Since October 3, 2001, CDC and state and local public health authorities have been investigating cases of bioterrorism-related anthrax. This report updates findings as of October 31, and includes interim guidelines for the clinical evaluation of persons with possible anthrax. A total of 21 cases (16 confirmed and five suspected) of bioterrorism-related anthrax have been reported among persons who worked in the District of Columbia, Florida, New Jersey, and New York City (Figure 1). Until the source of these intentional exposures is eliminated, clinicians and laboratorians should be alert for clinical evidence of Bacillus anthracis infection. Epidemiologic investigation of these cases and surveillance to detect new cases of bioterrorism-associated anthrax continues.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^d719b817]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study suggest that the transition to ICD-10-CM in October 2015 was associated with changes in levels and trends for most diagnostic categories in 3 common diagnostic classification systems. While the broad categories used in WHO disease chapters showed only small changes at the transition, numerous large changes (ie, ≥ 20%) in diagnostic category prevalence occurred in the more detailed HHS-HCCs and AHRQ-CCS categories. These 2 classification systems have been widely adopted by health care organizations for many purposes. Given the frequent, large discontinuities in diagnostic category prevalence rates that we identified, predictive models and diagnostic category mappings developed for ICD-9-CM should be refined for ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for health care payment, performance assessment, or disease surveillance.

Anthrax epidemiology and bioterrorism context — anthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis, occurs in humans after exposure to infected animals or tissues or direct exposure to B. anthracis spores, and can occur in three forms: cutaneous, gastrointestinal, or inhalation. B. anthracis is considered one of the most serious biowarfare or bioterrorism agents due to persistence of spores, ease of respiratory infection, and high mortality of inhalation anthrax; CDC has classified anthrax as a category A biological warfare agent, and an unintentional release in the former Soviet Union in 1979 resulted in 64 deaths.

### Algorithms for the identification of anthrax meningitis during a mass casualty event based on a systematic review of systemic anthrax from 1880 through 2018 [^4cd58705]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

During an anthrax mass casualty event, prompt identification of patients with anthrax meningitis is important. Previous research has suggested use of a screening tool based on neurological symptoms and signs.

Methods

Using historical anthrax patient data from 1880 through 2018, we analyzed risk factors for meningitis. We developed lists of symptoms and signs (ie, algorithms) for predicting meningitis with high sensitivity and specificity. We evaluated both single and paired algorithms as screening tools.

Results

A single algorithm with 1 or more neurological symptoms or signs identifying patients with likely meningitis achieved high sensitivity (86%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 71%-100%) and specificity (90%; 95% CI, 82%-98%). Pairing algorithms with the same symptoms and signs (severe headache, altered mental status, meningeal signs, and "other neurological deficits") improved specificity (99%; 95% CI, 97%-100%) but left 17.3% of patients in a middle "indeterminate" meningitis category and in need of additional diagnostic testing to determine likely meningitis status. Pairing algorithms with differing symptoms and signs also improved specificity over the single algorithm (92%; 95% CI, 85%-99%) but categorized just 2.5% of patients as indeterminate.

Conclusions

Our study confirms prior research suggesting quick and reliable assessment of patients for anthrax meningitis is possible based on the presence or absence of certain symptoms and signs. A single algorithm was adequate; however, if we assumed low-resource diagnostic testing was feasible for some patients, pairing algorithms improved specificity. Pairing algorithms with differing symptoms and signs minimized the proportion of patients requiring additional diagnostics.

Critical Care Measures and Procedures

Evaluation

Early diagnosis of anthrax and initiation of appropriate treatment, particularly administration of a combination of antimicrobial drugs, are critical to improving survival. After treatment, uncomplicated cutaneous anthrax has a mortality rate of < 2%. However, even with antimicrobial drug treatment and modern critical care, injection, gastrointestinal, and inhalation anthrax have mortality rates of 28%, ≥ 40%; and 45%, respectively. Anthrax meningitis is nearly always fatal, even with treatment. Many patients with cutaneous anthrax can be treated as outpatients. However, patients with symptoms or signs of systemic involvement (e.g. tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, hyperthermia, hypothermia, leukocytosis) or with lesions that involve the head, neck, or upper torso or that are large, bullous, multiple, or surrounded by edema, have higher mortality rates. Hospitalization is warranted for all patients with systemic cutaneous anthrax; gastrointestinal, injection, or inhalation anthrax; or anthrax meningitis or bacteremia.

Initial evaluation of patients suspected of having anthrax (Technical Appendix Table 1) should be similar to the standard evaluation for patients with an acute febrile illness and should have an emphasis on obtaining pretreatment blood and other appropriate cultures. However, failure to fulfill systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria should not decrease concern for sepsis because patients with systemic anthrax might not initially appear critically ill. Inhalation anthrax can have a prodromal phase followed by a fulminant phase. Patients with systemic anthrax have had debilitating symptoms, followed first by transitory improvement and then by precipitous hemodynamic deterioration. Because of this potential for sudden decompensation, hospitalized patients should have careful hemodynamic monitoring, including continuous pulse oximetry and telemetry (Technical Appendix Table 1). Chest computed tomography might be needed to identify the characteristic widened mediastinum and pleural effusions as well as common that are inapparent on chest radiographs (e.g. pericardial effusion). Unless contraindicated, lumbar puncture should be performed to rule out meningitis.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^793b6597]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

According to a report of the Injury Surveillance Workgroup, a group of experts assembled by the Safe States Alliance to provide recommendations for injury surveillance and data analysis around the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM transition, changes in the injury counts by category can be explained by changes to coding guidelines, differences in the basic structure of the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM matrices, differences in assignment of external cause codes to specific matrix cells, new or more detailed codes in ICD-10-CM, and other considerations. We found evidence supporting most of these explanations.

The most common reason for different classification of the same record by the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM matrices was assigning an external cause to different mechanisms/causes. For example, 'MV non-traffic' is a new ICD-10-CM category that was created to support better surveillance of these injuries. As a result, some records assigned to the 'other transport' by the ICD-9-CM matrix (eg, E820-E825, fifth digits 0–4) were reassigned to the new 'MV non-traffic' category by the ICD-10-CM matrix. However, our finding that most of the MCA records reassigned to the new 'MV non-traffic' category were classified as MVT by the ICD-9-CM matrix suggests that some coders became more attentive to the distinction between traffic and non-traffic injuries while they were preparing for ICD-10-CM. 'Other land transport' is another new ICD-10-CM mechanism/cause that was separated out of the 'other transport' in the ICD-9-CM matrix; however, we observed no cases of differential classification involving this category.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^ea22eb00]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

A total of nine discrepancies (three in MCA, six in MCB) involved the ICD-10-CM external cause code of V.19.9 ("pedal cyclist… injured in unspecified traffic accident cause"), which was assigned to the 'MVT pedal cyclist' category by the ICD-10-CM matrix, while the equivalent ICD-9-CM code (E826.1) was assigned to the 'other pedal cyclist' category by the ICD-9-CM matrix. This choice may reflect an assumption by the developers of the ICD-10-CM matrix that unspecified pedal cyclist traffic injuries are likely to involve an MV.

Sixteen MCA records and three MCB records were classified as fall injuries by the ICD-9-CM matrix, but as overexertion, 'struck by/against', or machinery-related injuries by the ICD-10-CM matrix. One contributing factor is that ICD-10-CM has a specific set of external cause codes for 'slipping, tripping, and stumbling without falling' (W18.4-), which are classified as overexertion injuries by the ICD-10-CM matrix, whereas the same concept of accidental slipping was indexed to E885.9 ('fall from other slipping, tripping, or stumbling') in ICD-9-CM. The latter code was classified as a fall in the ICD-9-CM matrix, even though it was also used to describe slipping events without falls. Another contributing factor is that ICD-10-CM has codes for 'striking against unspecified object with subsequent fall' (W18.00-) and 'striking against other object with subsequent fall' (W18.09-), whereas ICD-9-CM only offered the options of striking an 'object in sports' (E917.5), 'caused by a crowd, by collective fear or panic' (E917.6), furniture (E917.7), and 'other stationary object' (E917.8), with subsequent fall. A patient who described 'bumping into something and falling' would thus be classified as having had a fall injury by the ICD-9-CM matrix, but as having had a 'struck by/against' injury by the ICD-10-CM matrix. An interrupted time series analysis from Kentucky showed an immediate significant increase in hospitalisation rates for 'struck by/against' injuries in October 2015, presumably also due to this difference between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM.

Signs and Symptoms Predictive of Meningitis

Three recent studies (two of which shared overlapping data sets) have examined presenting signs, symptoms, and laboratory results associated with anthrax meningitis (Table 4). One study evaluated systemic anthrax in adults and two evaluated cutaneous anthrax in adults. All three studies found that fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, and headache were associated with meningitis. Two studies also found nonheadache, nonmeningeal neurologic signs (e.g. seizures and cranial nerve signs) to be associated with meningitis. Predictors found in one study included altered mental status and meningeal signs, fever (> 38.0°C or > 100.4°F), tachypnea (> 20 breaths per minutes), tachycardia (≥ 100 beats per minute), systolic and diastolic hypertension (≥ 130 and ≥ 90 mm Hg, respectively), and evidence of coagulopathy. Presenting bacteremia was predictive of meningitis in one of the studies and bacteremia at any point throughout hospitalization was predictive in another.

### Half century since SIDS: a reappraisal of terminology [^e49a0c92]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Sudden infant death diagnostic shift and ICD categorization — Inconsistent reporting and changes in understanding have led to a diagnostic shift away from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) toward undetermined cause and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed, creating variability in attribution and difficulty differentiating explained versus unexplained causes. For mortality surveillance in the United States, sudden infant death causes are grouped into SIDS (ICD-10 code R95), unknown or unspecified causes (ICD-10 code R99), and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (ICD-10 code W75), which are included under sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) to allow consistent monitoring of mortality trends that include both explained and unexplained causes. International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) codes are applied to cause-of-death determinations but may not reflect the certifier's intent; the ICD-10-CM was adapted from the ICD-10 for morbidity reporting in US health care settings, and the ICD-10, not the ICD-10-CM, is used for official reporting of mortality statistics in the United States and other nations.

Pathogenesis

B. anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, is a nonmotile spore-forming, gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium. The spores of B. anthracis, which can remain dormant in the environment for decades, are the infectious form, but vegetative B. anthracis rarely causes disease. Spores introduced through the skin lead to cutaneous or injection anthrax; those introduced through the gastrointestinal tract lead to gastrointestinal anthrax; and those introduced through the lungs lead to inhalation anthrax. After entering a human or animal, B. anthracis spores are believed to germinate locally or be transported by phagocytic cells to the lymphatics and regional lymph nodes, where they germinate; or both. B. anthracis begins producing toxins within hours of germination. Protective antigen (PA) and edema factor (EF) combine to form edema toxin (ET) and PA and lethal factor (LF) combine to form lethal toxin (LT). After binding to surface receptors, the PA portion of the complexes facilitates translocation of the toxins to the cytosol, in which EF and LF exert their toxic effects.

### Factors affecting the mesothelioma detection rate within national and international epidemiological studies: insights from Scottish linked cancer registry-mortality data [^8601b85f]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

ICD-9 code 163 (malignant neoplasm of pleura) listed as underlying cause of death detected only 40% of Scottish mesothelioma cases (all body sites) from the cancer registry in 1981–1999. This is lower than both the previously published 55% figure, derived from UK mesothelioma register data 1986–1991, which is based on any mention of mesothelioma on death certificates, cross-referenced to cancer registry data, and the 44% figure derived from Scottish mortality data 1981–1999, which captured any mention of mesothelioma on the death certificate. Detection from cancer registry data increased to 75% under ICD-10 in Scotland, confirming earlier predictions of the benefit of ICD-10's more specific mesothelioma codes. Including the accidental poisoning codes E866.4 (ICD-9) and X49 (ICD-10), covering poisoning by 'unspecified' and 'other' causes, which appear to have been used as coding surrogates for mesothelioma when asbestos exposure was explicitly mentioned in deaths suggestive of a mesothelioma, and which are recorded as the underlying cause of death in 4–7% of mesotheliomas, may improve the mesothelioma detection rate in future epidemiological studies.

### Etiology of encephalitis in Australia, 1990–2007 [^db90a1ed]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Definitions

An encephalitis-associated hospital stay was defined as a hospitalization for which the primary discharge diagnosis was an ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-AM code for acute encephalitis. Relevant ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-AM codes were obtained by searching the alphabetical list of ICD codes for all codes that include the term enceph, but excluding nonencephalitis conditions (e.g. anencephaly) and including rabies. Additionally, 2 ICD-9-CM codes used for encephalitis-related conditions before July 1998 did not include the prefix enceph-, unlike nomenclatures used in ICD-10-AM encephalitis codes. One of these ICD-9-CM codes was 49.8, defined as other non–arthropod-borne viral diseases of central nervous system –other specified non–arthropod-borne viral diseases of the central nervous system. The other code was 49.9, defined as other non–arthropod-borne viral diseases of central nervous system –unspecified non–arthropod-borne viral diseases of the central nervous system. The use of these codes was found by comparing data extracted for 1998 and 1999. For these 2 years, coding was performed in both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-AM, and data were then compared to identify the additional codes.

The Table shows the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-AM encephalitis-associated conditions with codes used for encephalitis hospitalizations during 1990–2007. These codes were further classified by investigators into encephalitis with known pathogens or unknown pathogens (Table).

This Report Updates Previous Cdc Guidelines and Recommendations On Preferred Prevention and Treatment Regimens Regarding Naturally Occurring Anthrax. Also Provided Are A Wide Range Of Alternative Regimens To First-Line Antimicrobial Drugs For Use If Patients Have Contraindications Or Intolerances Or After A Wide-Area Aerosol Release Of

Bacillus anthracis spores if resources become limited or a multidrug-resistant B. anthracis strain is used (Hendricks KA, Wright ME, Shadomy SV, et al; Workgroup on Anthrax Clinical Guidelines. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expert panel meetings on prevention and treatment of anthrax in adults. Emerg Infect Dis 2014;20:e130687; Meaney-Delman D, Rasmussen SA, Beigi RH, et al.

Specifically, this report updates antimicrobial drug and antitoxin use for both postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) and treatment from these previous guidelines best practices and is based on systematic reviews of the literature regarding 1) in vitro antimicrobial drug activity against B. anthracis; 2) in vivo antimicrobial drug efficacy for PEP and treatment; 3) in vivo and human antitoxin efficacy for PEP, treatment, or both; and 4) human survival after antimicrobial drug PEP and treatment of localized anthrax, systemic anthrax, and anthrax meningitis.

Changes From Previous Cdc Guidelines and Recommendations Include An Expanded List Of Alternative Antimicrobial Drugs To Use When First-Line Antimicrobial Drugs Are Contraindicated Or Not Tolerated Or After A Bioterrorism Event When First-Line Antimicrobial Drugs Are Depleted Or Ineffective Against A Genetically Engineered Resistant

B. anthracis strain. In addition, these updated guidelines include new recommendations regarding special considerations for the diagnosis and treatment of anthrax meningitis, including comorbid, social, and clinical predictors of anthrax meningitis. The previously published CDC guidelines and recommendations described potentially beneficial critical care measures and clinical assessment tools and procedures for persons with anthrax, which have not changed and are not addressed in this update. In addition, no changes were made to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations for use of anthrax vaccine (Bower WA, Schiffer J, Atmar RL, et al. Use of anthrax vaccine in the United States: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, 2019. MMWR Recomm Rep 2019;68[No. RR-4]:1–14). The updated guidelines in this report can be used by health care providers to prevent and treat anthrax and guide emergency preparedness officials and planners as they develop and update plans for a wide-area aerosol release of B. anthracis.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^7fc5a2da]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

From 1979 through September 2015, the Clinical Modification of the 9th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) was used in the USA to code morbidity data. On 1 October 2015, the Clinical Modification of the 10th Revision of ICD (ICD-10-CM), developed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, was implemented in the USA for classification and coding of morbidity data. ICD-10-CM codes provide much more detail about diseases, injuries, and external causes of injuries than ICD-9-CM codes, making this classification system more useful for measuring quality of care, public health surveillance and epidemiological research.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD)injury matrices are nationally and internationally recognised tools or frameworks for organising and reporting ICD-coded injury data. These tools have multiple versions based on different clinical modifications of the ICD, and can categorise both external cause codes, which describe the mechanism and intent of injury, and diagnosis codes, which describe the body region and type of injury. The ICD-9-CM external cause of injury matrix (hereafter referred to as matrix) was used extensively to generate county, state, regional, national and international comparisons of non-fatal injury data. The ICD-10-CM matrix should prove to be similarly useful over the next decade.

Data from Sweden suggest that the conversion to ICD-10 may have been associated with important discontinuities in observed rates at the mechanism/cause level. To interpret injury morbidity data across the transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM in the USA, it would be helpful to understand any differences in how the same records would be classified using the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM matrices. We were able to obtain such dually coded data from two large academic trauma centres and apply both matrices to estimate comparability ratios (CRs) and identify potential reasons for discrepant classification of mechanism/cause.

Blepharitis ICD-10 CM coding — Blepharitis, which includes entities with the following ICD-10 classifications, lists Ulcerative (H01.01-), Squamous (H01.02-), Stye (H00.01-), Meibomitis (H01.02-), Abscess of eyelid (H00.03-), and Parasitic infestation of eyelid (B89). CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; "(-) = 1, right upper eyelid; 2, right lower eyelid; 4, left upper eyelid; 5, left lower eyelid," and when laterality is specified "Right upper eyelid is always 1," "Right lower eyelid is always 2," "Left upper eyelid is always 4," and "Left lower eyelid is always 5." "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters" and "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field;" if a 7th character is required and the code is "not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters." For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality;" if no bilateral code exists and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned" and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available." A starred note instructs to "Code first underlying disease, as leishmaniasis (085.0–085.9), loiasis (125.2), onchocerciasis (125.3), or pediculosis (132.0)."

### Development and performance of a checklist for initial triage after an anthrax mass exposure event [^eb16964a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Population exposure to Bacillus anthracis spores could cause mass casualties requiring complex medical care. Rapid identification of patients needing anthrax-specific therapies will improve patient outcomes and resource use.

Objective

To develop a checklist that rapidly distinguishes most anthrax from nonanthrax illnesses on the basis of clinical presentation and identifies patients requiring diagnostic testing after a population exposure.

Design

Comparison of published anthrax case reports from 1880 through 2013 that included patients seeking anthrax-related care at 2 epicenters of the 2001 U.S. anthrax attacks.

Setting

Outpatient and inpatient.

Patients

408 case patients with inhalation, ingestion, and cutaneous anthrax and primary anthrax meningitis, and 657 control patients.

Measurements

Diagnostic test characteristics, including positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs) and patient triage assignation.

Results

Checklist-directed triage without diagnostic testing correctly classified 95% (95% CI, 93% to 97%) of 353 adult anthrax case patients and 76% (CI, 73% to 79%) of 647 control patients (positive LR, 3.96 [CI, 3.45 to 4.55]; negative LR, 0.07 [CI, 0.04 to 0.11]; false-negative rate, 5%; false-positive rate, 24%). Diagnostic testing was needed for triage in up to 5% of case patients and 15% of control patients and improved overall test characteristics (positive LR, 8.90 [CI, 7.05 to 11.24]; negative LR, 0.06 [CI, 0.04 to 0.09]; false-negative rate, 5%; false-positive rate, 11%). Checklist sensitivity and specificity were minimally affected by inclusion of pediatric patients. Sensitivity increased to 97% (CI, 94% to 100%) and 98% (CI, 96% to 100%), respectively, when only inhalation anthrax cases or higher-quality case reports were investigated.

Limitations

Data on case patients were limited to nonstandardized, published observational reports, many of which lacked complete data on symptoms and signs of interest. Reporting bias favoring more severe cases and lack of intercurrent outbreaks (such as influenza) in the control populations may have improved test characteristics.

Conclusion

A brief checklist covering symptoms and signs can distinguish anthrax from other conditions with minimal need for diagnostic testing after known or suspected population exposure.

### Exploring injury intentionality and mechanism via ICD-10-CM injury codes and self-reported injury in a large, urban emergency department [^2516c2cb]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Health systems capture injuries using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnostic codes and share data with public health to inform injury surveillance. This study analyses provider-assigned ICD-10-CM injury codes among self-reported injuries to determine the effectiveness of ICD-10-CM coding in capturing injury and assault.

Methods

Self-reported injury screen records from an urban, level 1 trauma centre collected between 20 November 2015 and 30 September 2019 were compared with corresponding provider-assigned ICD-10-CM codes discerning the frequency in which intentions are indicated among patients reporting (1) any injury and (2) assault.

Results

Of 380922 patients screened, 32788 (8.61%) reported any injury and 6763 (1.78%) reported assault. ICD-10-CM codes had a sensitivity of 67.40% (95%CI 66.89% to 67.91%) for any injury and specificity of 89.79% (95% CI 89.69% to 89.89%]). For assault, ICD-10-CM codes had sensitivity of 2.25% (95%CI 1.91% to 2.63%) and specificity of 99.97% (95%CI 99.97% 99.98%).

Discussion

This study found provider-assigned ICD-10-CM had limited sensitivity to identify injury and low sensitivity for assault. This study more fully characterises ICD-10-CM coding system effectiveness in identifying assaults.

### Conference report on public health and clinical guidelines for anthrax [^e5b08192]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

On March 13–14, 2006, a meeting on anthrax, sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in collaboration with the Southeastern Center for Emerging Biologic Threats, was held at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. The meeting's agenda included discussion of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), screening and evaluation, and treatment of the various manifestations of human anthrax. The goal was to convene subject matter experts for a review of research developments and clinical experience with anthrax prophylaxis and treatment and to make consensus recommendations for updating guidelines for PEP, treatment, and clinical evaluation of patients with anthrax. A 2001 conference on guidelines for anthrax has previously been summarized in this journal. This article summarizes the meeting's presentations and discussion. Consensus recommendations are summarized in the Table. Updated CDC guidelines for treatment and prophylaxis of anthrax will be published in detail in other CDC publications and are available on CDC's website at http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/index.asp.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^950eb144]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Dually coded data

Hospital inpatient discharge data independently coded according to ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting in two university medical centres located in California (MCA) and in the Midwest (MCB) were used for this study. These data were generated in the ordinary course of business, as part of the process of training and supervising professional coders and predicting the local financial impact of the code set conversion.

At MCA, dual coding was usually done by the same coder, during the same reading of the original record, although in some cases, ICD-10-CM coding was performed by a different coder after the ICD-9-CM coded claim had been submitted. All professional coders at MCA had sufficient experience with ICD-10-CM to be classified as proficient in ICD-10-CM coding. A deidentified version of this dually coded dataset with 5167 systematically sampled records from September 2014 through September 2015 was obtained. From this dataset, 335 records that were originally coded as inpatient claims but later reconciled as 'observation stay' or ambulatory claims were excluded, leaving 4832 records for analysis.

At MCB, dual coding was typically done by different coders after the ICD-9-CM coded claim had been submitted. The prior ICD-9-CM coding was not available to the coders performing ICD-10-CM coding. All professional coders were internally trained in ICD-10-CM and had sufficient experience to be classified as proficient in ICD-10-CM. A deidentified version of this dually coded dataset with 5305 systematically sampled records from 2011 and 2012 was obtained. From this dataset, 94 records were excluded because of the absence of valid diagnosis codes, leaving 5211 inpatient records for analysis.

The University of California Davis Institutional Review Board (ID = 9 86 385) determined that this study did not involve human subjects at either site. Due to unavoidable differences in dual coding methods and time periods, we chose to analyse MCA and MCB data separately.

Inhalation anthrax — incubation in outbreaks and case fatality — A reported human case suggests the incubation period was as short as 1 day. In the 1979 Sverdlovsk outbreak, cases were reported 2–43 days after the initial release, and the modal incubation period was reported as 9–10 days, slightly longer than estimated incubation periods of 2–6 days in a few reported outbreaks. During the U.S. bioterrorism events of 2001, the median incubation period for six of the first 10 cases was 4.5 days (range: 4–6 days), and a review indicates the estimated incubation period was 4.5 days. Case-fatality ratios of 86% and 89% were reported after the 1979 Sverdlovsk outbreak and in the United States during the 20th century, respectively, and during 2001 the case-fatality ratio for inhalation anthrax treated in intensive care units was 45% (five of 11 cases).

### The anthrax attacks 10 years later [^2c476afb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Ten years ago, just weeks after the September 11 attacks, the United States experienced a deliberate act of bioterrorism. Through use of the postal service, anthrax spores were widely disseminated, including to homes, the Senate, and major newsrooms, resulting in morbidity and mortality and effectively disrupting our way of life and revealing our vulnerability. Even though such attacks had been the subject of much writing and had been planned for, detection of and the appropriate response to an attack with an agent from the so-called "Category 'A' List" had only been considered in theoretical terms. What transpired during the following difficult weeks, including how public health and federal government agencies performed, has been both praised and criticized. An intertwined epidemiologic and criminal investigation of such magnitude was unprecedented in U.S. history. To address the question of whether we as a nation are now better prepared for future threats involving biologic agents, it is important to learn from the lessons of the 2001 anthrax attacks, including the critical role of clinicians in surveillance. As physicians involved in diagnosing anthrax in the index case and alerting authorities, we offer our perspective on these events a decade after their occurrence.

ICD-10-CM laterality and 7th-character rules — Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and a placeholder X is required if a code needing a 7th character is not 6 characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the code indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When laterality is specified in the diagnosis code, Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.
