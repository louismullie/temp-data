## Question

what rvsp is high for pulmonary embolism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what RVSP (right ventricular systolic pressure) is considered "high" in the context of acute pulmonary embolism and how to interpret it prognostically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how RVSP is estimated noninvasively and what normal values are. Then, I should verify disease-specific thresholds in acute PE that correlate with risk. Next, I will integrate RVSP with other echocardiographic markers and guideline-based risk stratification. Finally, I should consider limitations and practical next steps for management and follow-up, including when to suspect chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

> Let me first confirm the measurement and normal ranges. RVSP is typically estimated from the peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity using the simplified Bernoulli equation (RVSP = 4 × [TR velocity]² + right atrial pressure), and in the absence of pulmonary outflow obstruction, RVSP approximates systolic pulmonary artery pressure; normal resting RVSP is generally around 12–16 mmHg, with an upper limit of normal around 35–36 mmHg when assuming a normal RAP of 3–5 mmHg, so anything above that warrants evaluation for pulmonary hypertension, though this is a generic threshold rather than PE-specific [^96032b68] [^6a4242f5].

> Now, I need to check disease-specific thresholds in acute PE. Wait, let me verify the prognostic cutoffs reported in PE cohorts. Several studies and reviews converge on the notion that RVSP around or above 40 mmHg signals pathologic elevation in acute PE, and values around 50 mmHg or higher are particularly concerning for adverse outcomes; for example, in a prospective intermediate-risk PE cohort, patients with clinical deterioration had higher RVSP and larger RV size, and in a catheter-directed therapy series, the mean RVSP was 50 ± 12 mmHg, reflecting substantial RV pressure overload in that population [^a9f57109] [^aa35123a]. I should also confirm that a systolic PAP above 50 mmHg at presentation has been flagged as a risk factor for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, reinforcing the prognostic significance of higher RVSP in PE [^61ba761a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should integrate RVSP with other RV markers because RVSP alone is neither sensitive nor specific enough for risk stratification in PE. RV/LV diameter ratio, TAPSE, and qualitative RV systolic function carry stronger and more consistent prognostic value than RVSP alone, and in fact, some contemporary studies in intermediate-risk PE found RVSP did not independently predict early deterioration when considered alongside RV size and function, whereas RV/LV ratio and TAPSE did, highlighting that RVSP should be interpreted in the context of RV morphology and function rather than in isolation [^a7ab7309] [^a9f57109]. Let me reconsider: this means RVSP > 40–50 mmHg is abnormal and worrisome, but I should weigh it alongside RV/LV ratio, TAPSE, and biomarkers like troponin and BNP to guide escalation decisions [^c18e402d].

> Next, I should review guideline-aligned risk stratification to ensure I'm framing RVSP correctly. The ESC 2019 framework separates high-risk (hemodynamic instability), intermediate-risk (stable with RV dysfunction and/or biomarker elevation), and low-risk PE; within intermediate-risk, RV dysfunction on imaging and elevated biomarkers define intermediate-high risk, and while RVSP is not itself a formal criterion, an elevated RVSP supports the presence of RV pressure overload and can contextualize other findings when integrated with RV size and function and biomarkers [^c18e402d] [^0bf11370]. I should double-check that this aligns with bedside practice: yes, RVSP informs the hemodynamic burden but does not replace composite risk assessment [^c18e402d].

> I will now examine practical thresholds and what to do with them. Let me think about a pragmatic approach: RVSP ≥ 40 mmHg is clearly elevated and should prompt closer monitoring and consideration of RV dysfunction on echo; RVSP ≥ 50 mmHg is high and, especially when accompanied by RV dilation or systolic dysfunction, should heighten concern for decompensation and may influence decisions about level of care, early PERT involvement, and consideration of advanced therapies if deterioration occurs; however, I need to ensure I balance this against bleeding risk and guideline cautions against routine thrombolysis in stable patients [^c18e402d] [^067de318]. But wait, what if the patient is young and otherwise low risk with RVSP 45 mmHg and no RV dilation? In that scenario, I should avoid overcalling risk and instead integrate the full picture before escalating therapy [^c18e402d].

> Next, I should review longitudinal implications and follow-up. I should confirm that an elevated RVSP at presentation tracks with a higher likelihood of persistent RV dysfunction and possibly CTEPH; indeed, meta-analytic data show substantial prevalence of persistent RVD at 3–12 months after PE, and baseline RVSP elevation is associated with later pulmonary hypertension, with some series noting that baseline RV-RA gradients above about 45 mmHg predict later PH, which supports arranging echocardiographic follow-up at 3–6 months in those with initially elevated RVSP or RV dysfunction [^e03d0b03] [^d7678674]. Hold on, I should verify that this follow-up is guideline-concordant; contemporary guidance emphasizes structured follow-up to detect CTEPH in at-risk survivors, which fits with monitoring patients who presented with elevated RVSP and RV strain [^61ba761a].

> Finally, I need to ensure I acknowledge limitations and technical caveats. RVSP estimation depends on a measurable TR jet and assumptions about RAP; in about 20–30% of patients, TR signal is inadequate, and even when measurable, estimated RVSP correlates imperfectly with invasive pressures, so a "high" RVSP supports concern but a "normal" RVSP does not exclude significant RV dysfunction or adverse risk, reinforcing the need to integrate multiple parameters and clinical judgment [^96032b68] [^0e49e753]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied RVSP > 50 mmHg mandates thrombolysis; I should correct that: guidelines do not endorse routine thrombolysis in stable patients solely for elevated RVSP, and decisions should be individualized within PERT frameworks rather than based on a single number [^c18e402d] [^067de318].

> Bottom line, after verifying across studies and guidelines, RVSP ≥ 40 mmHg is abnormal in acute PE and values ≥ 50 mmHg are high risk and correlate with worse outcomes, but RVSP should be interpreted alongside RV/LV ratio, TAPSE, and biomarkers within ESC risk categories; persistent elevation after treatment warrants surveillance for chronic thromboembolic disease and structured follow-up echocardiography [^a9f57109] [^aa35123a] [^c18e402d] [^61ba761a].

In acute pulmonary embolism, **RVSP ≥ 40 mmHg** is considered elevated and indicates right ventricular pressure overload [^96032b68]; values **≥ 50 mmHg** are associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality and hemodynamic deterioration [^b2f447e6]. RVSP should be interpreted alongside other echocardiographic markers (RV/LV ratio, TAPSE) and biomarkers (troponin, BNP) for risk stratification [^a9f57109] [^f1bb5ca5]. Persistent RVSP elevation after treatment may signal chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and warrants follow-up [^61ba761a] [^d7678674].

---

## Normal RVSP values and physiological considerations

Normal RVSP is **12–16 mmHg** [^6fbc2a08]; values up to 35 mmHg are considered normal under stress or with higher right atrial pressure [^96032b68]. RVSP is estimated from the tricuspid regurgitation jet using the simplified Bernoulli equation, adding right atrial pressure [^96032b68].

---

## RVSP thresholds in acute pulmonary embolism

In acute PE, **RVSP ≥ 40 mmHg** is abnormal and reflects acute pulmonary hypertension from increased pulmonary vascular resistance [^96032b68]. Values **≥ 50 mmHg** are linked to higher mortality, hemodynamic instability, and right ventricular dysfunction [^b2f447e6] [^4378f370].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated RVSP in PE

Elevated RVSP signals **right ventricular pressure overload** and dysfunction, which predict adverse outcomes in PE [^8a2185e5]. RVSP correlates with RV/LV ratio, TAPSE, and biomarkers (troponin, BNP), strengthening its prognostic value [^a9f57109] [^f1bb5ca5].

---

## RVSP and risk stratification in PE

RVSP is used with clinical scores and imaging to **risk-stratify PE** [^c18e402d]. Patients with RVSP ≥ 50 mmHg, RV/LV ratio ≥ 1.0, and elevated biomarkers are at higher risk of deterioration and may benefit from closer monitoring or advanced therapies [^a9f57109] [^067de318].

---

## Limitations and considerations

RVSP estimation depends on **echocardiographic quality** and a measurable tricuspid regurgitation jet; missing or unreliable jets are common [^e2b82caf]. Pre-existing pulmonary hypertension or chronic lung disease can elevate baseline RVSP, complicating interpretation in acute PE [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and management implications

Persistent RVSP elevation after treatment may indicate **chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)** and should prompt further evaluation [^61ba761a]. Serial echocardiography helps track RV recovery or persistence of pulmonary hypertension [^cc3e03c1].

---

## Summary of RVSP thresholds and clinical implications

| **Rvsp threshold** | **Clinical significance** | **Implications** |
|-|-|-|
| ≥ 40 mmHg | Elevated; abnormal in acute PE | Indicates RV pressure overload; monitor closely |
| ≥ 50 mmHg | High risk | Associated with increased mortality, RV dysfunction, and hemodynamic instability |
| Persistent elevation after treatment | Possible CTEPH | Requires further evaluation and follow-up |

---

In acute PE, **RVSP ≥ 40 mmHg is abnormal**, and **≥ 50 mmHg signals high risk**; RVSP should be integrated with other markers for risk stratification and management decisions [^96032b68] [^c18e402d].

Recommendations for echocardiography in suspected pulmonary embolism—TTE is recommended for risk stratification in patients with PE (primarily for assessment of RV size and function), TTE may be considered in acutely ill, unstable patients in whom hemodynamically significant PE is suspected, and echocardiography is not recommended as a primary means of diagnosing PE.

### Intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism: echocardiography predictors of clinical deterioration [^a7ab7309]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

We observed increased RV/LV ratio and decreased LV basal diameter in our intermediate-risk PE cohort compared to the normal reference range, and significant measurement differences between those with clinical deterioration and those without. Decreased RV systolic function represents a more advanced pathophysiological stage of PE than having RV dilatation alone. RV dilatation and RV systolic dysfunction were determined to be distinct variables of importance.

Our report addresses recently identified high priority knowledge gaps and research opportunities by the 2018 American Thoracic Society Research Statement. Few studies on acute pulmonary hypertension syndromes systematically compare TTE metrics to inform our decisions on prognosis or therapeutic efficacy. Reports use TTE metrics for study inclusion, prognosis, and therapeutic efficacy, but criteria and definitions vary, at times with discordance [–,,,]. In some, the definitions involve qualitative assessments or unstated definitions of RV dilatation or abnormal RV systolic function. In many of the composite abnlRV studies, there was no rationale for the choice of metrics. In some studies, there was discordance between TTE metrics. Khemasuwan et al. studied the association of a wide array of TTE metrics with clinical outcomes in 211 critically ill PE patients in the intensive care unit and found RV/LV ratio, RVSP, and TAPSE were independently associated with hospital mortality. In our study, RV/LV ratio and TAPSE were also found to be associated with clinical deterioration events within 5 days, but RVSP was not (p = 0.74). The implications for clinical research include recommendation that TTE metrics of RV size and systolic function should not be used interchangeably to define abnlRV either as inclusion criteria or as efficacy endpoints.

### Intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism: echocardiography predictors of clinical deterioration [^e2b82caf]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study had several limitations, including the sample size, demographic limitations of a regional study, and unchallenged generalizability based on practice variation between physicians and facilities, the latter of which affected the decision to perform a reperfusion intervention (one component of our composite primary outcome). We predefined clinical deterioration endpoints to minimize variation in interpretation. We defined the endpoint of respiratory failure as the use of high-flow nasal cannula, bilevel positive airway pressure, or intubation, which would have the least disagreements among abstractors. It is also worth noting that not all TTE metrics were recorded for every enrolled patient. The LR odds ratio and coefficient results for RVSP go against conventional wisdom and experience. It is plausible that RV pressure does not linearly increase as PE severity worsens or that RVSP may have complex interactions with the onset, or progressive worsening, of RV systolic dysfunction. PE patients with missing values (not performed, technically difficult, or not possible) may have had qualitatively enlarged RV measurements that were clinically significant.

One of the independent predictors of clinical deterioration was not having initial anticoagulation administered in the ED. This was a statistical association without a causative association. The involved patients in our database were adequately treated. In these cases, the explanation for increased risk for primary outcome was not inadequate PE treatment. The lack of anticoagulation in the ED was due to recognition of the PE in the unique individual patients as being complex and high acuity. Those cases involved early decisions for escalated PE interventions or restraint due to concurrent bleeding or preexisting anticoagulation.

It is plausible that TTE cardiac output metrics, which we did not study, may have greater prognostic value and relevance than RV measurements for subsequent hemodynamic deterioration. In addition, although we reported on single early TTE metrics, the direction and magnitude of acute changes may be important predictors of clinical deterioration.

### Right ventricular functional recovery assessment with stress echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise testing after pulmonary embolism: a pilot prospective multicentre study [^1dd4a4a9]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

The feasibility of stress echocardiography to assess RV contractile reserve and RV–PA coupling has been established,and may have a role in early detection of pulmonary hypertension in at-risk patients. However, the lack of consensus on the threshold for normal responses in commonly used measures of RV function such as TAPSE/RVSP has prevented wider implementation in clinical practice.An additional limitation of the more traditional supine or semisupine stress echocardiography is that supine exercise assessment does not predict ventricular performance during upright exercise.Therefore, measurements of RV performance used in the investigation of exertional breathlessness post-PE should be assessed during upright exercise, ideally with upright invasive CPET. A further consideration is measurements made during exercise recovery may be unreliable due to rapid normalisation of pulmonary pressures to baseline in more subtle cases of pulmonary vascular disease.Therefore, the assessments may be better performed at peak exercise. However, RV pressure–volume analysis with invasive upright CPET is not routinely available and difficult to perform outside expert centres and research settings. More recently, echocardiography has been shown to be a reliable alternative non-invasive imaging modality for this purpose, and has good agreement with invasive pulmonary pressure measurements during upright exercise, particularly in patients with high-quality TR Doppler signal.

### Additive value of right ventricular global longitudinal strain to a conventional echocardiographic parameter to improve prognostic value in intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism [^24afb150]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Venous thromboembolic disease, including acute pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common disease with an annual incidence of approximately 100 to 300 cases per 100 000 people.It is the third leading cause of vascular disease worldwide, after acute myocardial infarction and stroke, associated with a high mortality rate of approximately 10 to 30 per 100 000 people.

Acute PEs are typically stratified into 3 groups based on presentation. Patients with high‐risk (also termed massive) PE are defined by hemodynamic instability, have a high mortality rate of 15% to 52%, and require emergent intervention.Low‐risk (also termed nonmassive) patients with PE, are defined as those who are normotensive with no evidence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, have a mortality of <2%, and can be managed conservatively.Finally, intermediate‐risk (also termed submassive) patients with PE are characterized by hemodynamic stability on presentation but with evidence of abnormal RV structure and function.

Patients with intermediate‐risk PE carry a significant mortality rate between 3% and 15%.Short‐term mortality in patients with intermediate‐risk PE is most often related to the acute PE, whereas long‐term mortality is generally associated with other causes.Despite this significant mortality, optimal evaluation techniques remain unclear, and treatment recommendations are less well established. Current recommendations in the 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines include dividing patients with intermediate‐risk PE into intermediate‐low‐risk and intermediate‐high‐risk groups based on RV dysfunction on imaging and cardiac biomarkers.

RV dysfunction in patients with intermediate‐risk PE is commonly characterized by echocardiographic parameters and has been associated with increased risk of hemodynamic deterioration and death.Right to left ventricular end‐diastolic diameter ratio (RV/LV ratio) and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) have previously been associated with unfavorable prognosis in patients with acute PE.Despite the usefulness of these parameters, standardized and comprehensive assessment by conventional echocardiography remains challenging due to the complex morphology and function of the right ventricle.

### Prospective evaluation of right ventricular function and functional status 6 months after acute submassive pulmonary embolism: frequency of persistent or subsequent elevation in estimated pulmonary artery pressure [^93238f77]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Background

No published data have systematically documented pulmonary artery pressure over an intermediate time period after submassive pulmonary embolism (PE). The aim of this work was to document the rate of pulmonary hypertension, as assessed noninvasively by estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) of >or= 40 mm Hg 6 months after the diagnosis of submassive PE.

Methods

We enrolled 200 normotensive patients with CT angiography-proven PE and a baseline echocardiogram to estimate RVSP. All patients received therapy with unfractionated heparin initially, but 21 patients later received alteplase in response to circulatory shock or respiratory failure. Patients returned at 6 months for repeat RVSP measurement, and assessments of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) score and 6-min walk distance (6MWD).

Results

Six months after receiving a diagnosis, 162 of 180 survivors (90%) returned for follow-up, including 144 patients who had been treated with heparin (heparin-only group) and 18 patients who had been treated with heparin plus alteplase (heparin-plus-alteplase group). Among the heparin-only patients, the RVSP at diagnosis was >or= 40 mm Hg in 50 of 144 patients (35%; 95% CI, 27% to 43%), compared with 10 of 144 patients at follow-up (7%; 95% CI, 3% to 12%). However, the RVSP at follow-up was higher than the baseline RVSP in 39 of 144 patients (27%; 95% CI, 9% to 35%), and 18 of these 39 patients had a NYHA score of >or= 3 or exercise intolerance (6MWD, < 330 m). Among heparin-plus-alteplase patients, the RVSP was >or= 40 mm Hg in 11 of 18 patients at diagnosis (61%; 95% CI, 36% to 83%), compared with 2 of 18 patients at follow-up (11%; 95% CI, 1% to 35%). The RVSP at follow-up was not higher than at the time of diagnosis in any of the heparin-plus-alteplase patients (95% CI, 0% to 18%).

Conclusions

Six months after experiencing submassive PE, a significant proportion of patients had echocardiographic and functional evidence of pulmonary hypertension.

### Risk stratification of pulmonary embolism [^3d3e5d05]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pulmonary embolism is the third most frequent type of cardiovascular disease behind coronary artery disease and stroke. Patients with acute pulmonary embolism have significant variability in short-term mortality from less than 0.6% in low-risk patients to 19% in high-risk patients. Risk stratification plays an important role in the management of acute pulmonary embolism as it can determine the need for urgent reperfusion therapies versus conservative strategies.

Recent Findings

The three fundamental steps of risk stratification include the immediate identification of patients that are at high risk for mortality, the identification of patients that are at an increased risk of complications from pulmonary embolism that requires hospital monitoring and potential escalation of therapies, and the identification of patients at a low risk that can be treated as an outpatient.

Summary

It is vital to immediately identify high-risk patients for mortality so that they can be evaluated for urgent reperfusion therapies to improve outcomes. Risk stratification for intermediate-risk patients is based on right ventricular dysfunction in patients with hemodynamic stability. RV dysfunction can be assessed by clinical signs and symptoms along with ECHO and cardiac biomarkers. Identifying the low-risk population can help reduce the healthcare burden by allowing for early discharge and outpatient management.

### Guidelines for the use of echocardiography as a monitor for therapeutic intervention in adults: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography [^cc3e03c1]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism therapy monitoring—transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) role and serial reassessment: Although “not diagnostic of pulmonary embolism,” initial TTE can aid evaluation by detecting right ventricular dilation with “RVIDD/LVIDD ratio > 0.9” and can assist in ruling out other causes; once established, “hypotensive patients and those with elevated cardiac biomarkers or echocardiographic indices of RV strain are at an increased risk, and thrombolysis is considered a class II indication.” For follow-up, “Patients with massive pulmonary embolism can have serial assessments of RV size and FAC (Figure 5), assessments of RV systolic pressures, and IVC assessments using ASE RV guidelines for normal ranges,” and “The writing group recommends that considerable attention be given to maintaining the same identical imaging plane of the right ventricle when serially examining RV size and FAC.”

Measurements

Laboratory measurements

Laboratory cardiac biomarker testing was obtained for patients with dyspnea or chest pain as per usual medical care or upon confirmation of PE during ED evaluation. We used a troponin i-STAT cardiac troponin test cartridge (Abbott Point of Care, Abbott Park, IL) measured in ng/mL for troponin I or high-sensitivity troponin assay. We used the i-STAT BNP test cartridge (Abbott Point of Care, Abbott Park, IL) measured in pg/mL. We evaluated laboratory values in two ways: continuous and binary. For the binary evaluations, normal point-of-care BNP measurements were considered to be below 90 ng/mL. Normal values for troponin I were less than 0.07 ng/mL. Normal values for high-sensitivity troponin were less than 12 for females and less than 20 for males.

Echocardiography measurements

Cardiac sonographers, certified by the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonographers, performed all comprehensive TTE within the institution's echocardiography laboratory accredited by Intersocietal Commission for the Accreditation of Echocardiography Laboratories. Trained sonographers followed a protocol and standards established and operationalized by the Code PE scientific advisory committee, cardiology leaders, and echocardiography managers of the participating hospitals. The RV-focused view was used to measure RV end-diastolic internal diameter at the base, mid-section, and at its major axis (RV base to apex or length). LV basal end-diastolic measurements were performed in the parasternal long axis. RV systolic function measurements of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and RV annulus peak systolic velocity (S’) were performed using M mode at the RV free wall annulus and tissue Doppler of the basal segment, respectively. RV systolic pressure (RVSP) was determined by tricuspid regurgitation peak velocity using continuous Doppler. RV/LV basal diameter ratio (RV/LV) was calculated. TTE images were saved as digital files, wirelessly transmitted, and archived in the secure local server and portal system, Merge Cardio™ (IBM Watson Health). Staff cardiologists interpreted TTE images and measurements and were blind to the study and patient clinical outcomes.

### Prognostic value of right ventricular dysfunction or elevated cardiac biomarkers in patients with low-risk pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f1bb5ca5]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Right ventricular dysfunction and elevated cardiac biomarkers

Visualization of RV dysfunction (due to pressure overload) at presentation was based on echocardiography or CTPA. Since the definition of the parameters of RV dysfunction, and the cut-off values that were used, varied over time, we included studies requiring at least one of the following criteria: dilatation of the right ventricle (e.g. diastolic diameter ≥30 mm in the parasternal short-axis view) on echocardiography or an elevated RV/left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ratio (cut-off of 0.9 or 1.0) on echocardiography, or CTPA; hypokinesis of the RV free wall or abnormal motion of the interventricular septum on echocardiography; tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity (cut-off 2.7 or 2.8 m/s) on echocardiography.

We further defined myocardial injury and (right) heart failure based on elevated circulating levels of cardiac troponins [troponin I (TnI) or T (TnT), by standard or high-sensitivity (hs) assays] and natriuretic peptides [B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)], respectively. Since current ESC guidelines do not recommend specific assays or cut-offs, we based our classification on the cut-offs reported in the selected studies.

Study outcomes

We defined early all-cause mortality, i.e. death during the hospital stay or within the first 30 days following diagnosis of acute PE, as the primary outcome of our meta-analysis. The secondary outcomes were (i) early PE-related adverse outcome, defined as (PE-related) mortality, haemodynamic collapse (with need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, or catecholamine administration), or recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE); (ii) early PE-related mortality; and (iii) long-term all-cause mortality.

### Can right ventricular assessments improve triaging of low risk pulmonary embolism? [^0e9c1e4b]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Identifying right ventricle (RV) abnormalities is important to stratifying pulmonary embolism (PE) severity. Disposition decisions are influenced by concerns about early deterioration. Triaging strategies, like the Simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (sPESI), do not include RV assessments as predictors or early deterioration as outcome(s). We aimed to (1) determine if RV assessment variables add prognostic accuracy for 5-day clinical deterioration in patients classified low risk by sPESI, and (2) determine the prognostic importance of RV assessments compared to other variables and to each other.

Methods

We identified low risk sPESI patients (sPESI = 0) from a prospective PE registry. From a large field of candidate variables, we developed, and compared prognostic accuracy of, full and reduced random forest models (with and without RV assessment variables, respectively) on a validation database. We reported variable importance plots from full random forest and provided odds ratios for statistical inference of importance from multivariable logistic regression. Outcomes were death, cardiac arrest, hypotension, dysrhythmia, or respiratory failure within 5 days of PE.

Results

Of 1736 patients, 610 (35.1%) were low risk by sPESI and 72 (11.8%) experienced early deterioration. Of the 610, RV abnormality was present in 157 (25.7%) by CT, 121 (19.8%) by echocardiography, 132 (21.6%) by natriuretic peptide, and 107 (17.5%) by troponin. For deterioration, the receiver operating characteristics for full and reduced random forest prognostic models were 0.80 (0.77-0.82) and 0.71 (0.68-0.73), respectively. RV assessments were the top four in the variable importance plot for the random forest model. Echocardiography and CT significantly increased predicted probability of 5-day clinical deterioration by the multivariable logistic regression.

Conclusions

A PE triaging strategy with RV imaging assessments had superior prognostic performance at classifying low risk for 5-day clinical deterioration versus one without.

### Advanced management of intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism [^0df75e55]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment of high-intermediate risk submassive pulmonary embolism

Once a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is made, prompt initiation of anticoagulation is imperative as it has been shown to reduced mortality. Similarly, conservative efforts to reduce the RV afterload, including oxygen supplementation and inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) to assist with pulmonary vasodilation can aid in preserving stability. In cases of severe RV dysfunction, an inotropic agent such as dobutamine, should be initiated. Supportive vasopressor therapy is required to keep mean arterial pressures (MAP) greater than 65 mmHg, with norepinephrine as the treatment of choice. However, once dobutamine or vasopressors are used, the patient has progressed to a high-risk pulmonary embolism category and treatment algorithms can change. In significant pulmonary embolism, high afterload leads the right ventricle to dilate further. The use of extraneous intravenous fluid therapy can lead to acute RV decompensation by worsening septal shift and impacting LV preload. In patients who are clinically deteriorating because of hypoxemia and respiratory distress, the decision to pursue invasive positive pressure ventilation is challenging due to concern for worsening RV afterload. The application of positive thoracic pressure can cause an acute decrease in RV preload. Therefore, an attempt to try conservative treatment, such as high flow nasal oxygen, should be considered prior to considering mechanical ventilation. If mechanical ventilation is pursued, hemodynamically neutral agents should be used for induction as the elevated PVR makes the right ventricle extremely preload sensitive. The use of propofol, a negative inotrope, has been associated with increased mortality in submassive pulmonary embolism and should be avoided.

### Intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism: echocardiography predictors of clinical deterioration [^6fbc2a08]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Of the intermediate-risk PE patients without anticoagulation initiated within the ED course, seven were transported to inpatient units and received early thrombolysis, and one had anticoagulation delayed until head CT was completed before thrombolysis was administered. Two of the acute PE patients had active bleeding while already on anticoagulation (with therapeutic levels). The proportion with CT RV/LV ratio ≥ 1.0 was not significant between outcome groups.

Table 1 and Additional file 3 : Table S2 show assessed RV variables overall and as stratified by primary outcome and secondary outcomes, respectively. Within 5 days, 115 (37.6%) patients experienced one or more clinical deterioration events or required an emergent in-hospital intervention. There were 3 (1.0%) deaths; 66 patients (21.6%) had one or more escalated PE interventions; 43 (14.1%) had symptomatic sustained hypotension addressed with intravenous fluid boluses; 31 (10.1%) had respiratory failure; 31 (10.1%) had new dysrhythmia requiring treatment; 20 (6.5%) had sustained hypotension treated with adrenergic agents; and 12 patients (3.3%) had cardiac arrest. There were no clinical deterioration events among the quasi-control group.

Random forest

First, we fit a random forest (RF) model using a full dataset (i.e. without splitting into test and training datasets) for both primary and secondary outcomes. We assessed variable importance plots based on mean decrease in accuracy to investigate the most important predictors of clinical deterioration and used “out-of-bag” prediction estimates to evaluate model fit in terms of F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).

RF out-of-bag estimates have been shown to demonstrate consistent and unbiased results of model performance, without the requirement of needing separate test and training datasets. This artifact of RFs is advantageous in our prediction model development given the limited dataset from which we were building. Next, we compared LR and RF prediction metrics. (Detailed methods are available in the Appendix accompanying the online article.)

Missing data

We used RF imputation to impute missing values across all predictors, except for tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity and RVSP, which when attempted or performed were classified as derived variables for trace or undetectable measurements. We conducted a sensitivity analysis by comparing prediction models based on imputed datasets with those based on complete case datasets.

Pulmonary embolism—RV dilatation, prognostic markers, and diagnostic approach: RV dilatation is defined by an RV/LV ratio > 1:1, and the presence of RV strain in patients with PE is prognostically important and associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality. TTE is not sufficiently sensitive to rule out PE; imaging modalities such as computed tomographic angiography should be used to diagnose PE. A PE presenting with hypotension is called massive PE, while nonmassive PEs can be risk stratified by TTE into submassive PE (no hypotension but RV strain or myocardial necrosis) and low risk (no hypotension nor RV strain).

### Additive value of right ventricular global longitudinal strain to a conventional echocardiographic parameter to improve prognostic value in intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism [^b47fbb16]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The combination of RVGLS and RV/LV ratio demonstrates significant prognostic value for short‐term mortality risk in patients with intermediate‐risk PE. These parameters provide a practical method for evaluating RV size and function and are attainable in the vast majority of patients in this scenario. Application of disease‐specific thresholds optimizes their prognostic value. This approach holds promise for incorporation into treatment pathways. Further study is needed to validate these findings and determine the role of RVGLS and RV/LV ratio in patients with intermediate‐risk PE.

### Additive value of right ventricular global longitudinal strain to a conventional echocardiographic parameter to improve prognostic value in intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism [^77b17923]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

We believe there are several reasons for the significant findings in our review. The combination of measurements we identified provides a readily attainable assessment of pathologic effects on both RV size and RV function. Many prior reviews have evaluated individual parameters that are valuable but fail to provide superior prognostic value in isolation. This is reflected in recommendations to evaluate and consider a broad mix of echocardiographic parameters in risk stratification of PE.By using 2 parameters in risk stratification, the process is streamlined, but overvaluing a single abnormal measurement is also prevented. Finally, our study identified threshold values that are distinct from traditional boundaries for defining upper or lower limits of normal. These disease‐specific thresholds improve the prognostic value and should be validated in future research.

In additional groups, with 1 high‐risk and 1 low‐risk parameter, short‐term mortality rates were intermediate as might be expected. The Kaplan‐Meier curves demonstrate that mortality risk is more significant in patients with abnormal RVGLS and normal RV/LV ratio than the opposite combination. This suggests that abnormal RV function portends higher risk than chamber dilation relative to the left ventricle. Patients with abnormal RVGLS in isolation may have preexisting dysfunction, which predisposes them to high mortality risk despite a lack of relative RV dilation or de novo dysfunction from acute PE. Patients with only an abnormal RV/LV ratio are most likely earlier in the cascade of changes that are expected in acute RV afterload, which aligns with lower morbidity and mortality risk. Moreover, significant differences were observed between patients with low RVGLS and low RV/LV ratio and patients with low RVGLS and high RV/LV ratio in the Kaplan‐Meier curves. RV/LV ratio may serve as a discriminator when RVGLS is reduced.

### The impact of right ventricular dysfunction on the prognosis and therapy of normotensive patients with pulmonary embolism [^a5ffcf9f]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

The prognosis and optimal therapy of patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) are strongly influenced by the presence or absence of associated hemodynamic derangements. Patients with normal systemic arterial pressure have a relatively low risk of recurrent PE and death when treated promptly with therapeutic anticoagulation. Those who present with hypotension, shock, or cardiac arrest, however, have a much higher mortality rate and often receive thrombolytic therapy. Recent evidence indicates that the presence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction identifies a subgroup of normotensive patients with a much more guarded prognosis who may benefit from more intensive therapy with thrombolytic agents. This article reviews our current understanding of the pathophysiology and diagnosis of RV dysfunction and its impact on the prognosis and therapy of normotensive patients with PE.

### Diagnostic and prognostic value of echocardiography in pulmonary hypertension: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses [^0e49e753]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

We performed this umbrella review according to the results of AMSTAR and the grading of the evidence, which indicated good performance of echocardiography for the tentative diagnosis and prognostication of PH. For the detection of PH, sPAP had high sensitivity but relatively low specificity, and RVOT AT had both high sensitivity and specificity. For the prognosis prediction, PE, RAA and TAPSE provide prognostic value in patients with PAH. RVLS has independent prognostic value in patients with PH.

Echocardiography for detecting PH

RHC, which can directly measure pulmonary artery pressure, is considered the gold standard method to diagnose PH. However, it is invasive, costly, and has potentially fatal complications; therefore, it cannot be widely performed. In view of this, echocardiography is an effective tool for detecting PH, as it is non-radiating, non-invasive, and accurate. sPAP estimated by the tricuspid regurgitation method was the most commonly used method, and some studies used RAP, RVSP, etc. instead of sPAP to detect PH. Recently, RVOT AT has been used to detect PH, but it has not yet been widely deployed. It should be noted that echocardiography is helpful for screening, but insufficient for diagnosis at present, and the accuracy of echocardiography in the diagnosis of PH is often questioned. Therefore, several meta-analyses have been conducted to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of echocardiography, which must be evaluated and pooled. Our umbrella review recommended four meta-analyses that involved one piece of high evidence and four pieces of moderate evidence.

Definition of PE severity

In the current paper we have adopted the American Heart Association (AHA) classification.Massive PE is defined as sustained hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) for >15 min secondary to acute PE or a requirement of inotropes or signs of shock. Submassive PE is defined by evidence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and/or evidence of myocardial necrosis. Patients with none of these features are defined as low-risk.

### Assessment of right ventricular function in the research setting: knowledge gaps and pathways forward. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^15a2a1a5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Right ventricular (RV) responses to pulmonary embolism (PE) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are marked by rapid increases in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) that are poorly tolerated, with the RV failing and developing conduction abnormalities, and both large PE and severe ARDS resulting in uncoupling of the RV from the pulmonary circulation and subsequent inefficient forward flow. The primary insult with PE comes from macrovesel occlusions, whereas ARDS results from microvessel occlusion with widespread but heterogeneous alveolar consolidation and elements of acute hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Both conditions shift the pulmonary vasoconstrictor–dilator balance toward an increase in arterial load and result in chemokine and cytokine release, recruitment of inflammatory cells, and production of reactive oxygen species. LV diastolic dysfunction may arise after acute PE and persist despite PH resolution but likely is not a main contributor to symptoms. Approximately 4% of acute PE survivors develop chronic thromboembolic PH (CTEPH), and CTEPH has a high index of recovery after intervention. RVF is an independent cause of increased mortality in ARDS.

While these findings require confirmation in other populations and settings, they provide some evidence to support the use of outpatient management for patients based more strongly on the risk of complications (as estimated using risk scores) rather than only by imaging findings. Of note, many of these concerning imaging findings should not be considered present or absent but rather considered across a spectrum of severity. For example, an RV/LV ratio of 1.1 and 1.5 are both >1.0, but patients with an RV/LV of 1.5 are at higher risk of complications than patients with an RV/LV of 1.1. Furthermore, other rare situations, including thrombotic occlusion of the inferior vena cava and clot in transit, may portend higher risk of complications.

### Additive value of right ventricular global longitudinal strain to a conventional echocardiographic parameter to improve prognostic value in intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism [^b8e38c4f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction has been identified as a prognostic marker for adverse events in patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism. We hypothesized that right-sided strain parameters have additive value to conventional echocardiographic parameters to further risk-stratify patients for mortality.

Methods and Results

This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism between 2010 and 2018. All-cause 30-day mortality was evaluated. Echocardiographic strain parameters and conventional RV measurements were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Two hundred fifty-one patients were analyzed. Mortality at 30days was 12.4%. Image quality was sufficient for RV strain analysis in 230 patients (91.6%). Right to left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ratio (RV/LV ratio) (odds ratio [OR], 1.490 [95% CI, 1.120-1.990]) and RV global longitudinal strain (RVGLS) (OR, 0.742 [95% CI, 0.605-0.910]) were independently associated with 30-day mortality. Using RVGLS and RV/LV ratio in an additive fashion, we found that 99 patients with a high RVGLS (>17.7%) and low RV/LV ratio (<1.03) had a 30-day mortality of 1.0%. Conversely, 39 patients with a low RVGLS (≤17.7%) and high RV/LV ratio (≥1.03) had a 30-day mortality of 46.2%. Kaplan-Meier analysis depicted the significantly different prognosis among the groups ( P <0.001).

Conclusions

The combined evaluation of RVGLS and RV/LV ratio is a practical method of evaluating RV dysfunction. Using both parameters in patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism identifies those at highest and lowest risk of short-term mortality. This approach offers promise for improved risk stratification and guidance of treatment pathways.

### Right ventricular dysfunction in hemodynamically stable patients with acute pulmonary embolism [^ead5eea1]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Echocardiography for risk stratification in hemodynamically stable patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) is well-established. Right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) is associated with an elevated mortality and adverse outcome. The aim of our study was to compare RVD criteria and investigate the role of elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) in the diagnosis of RVD.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed the echocardiographic and laboratory data of all hemodynamically stable patients with confirmed PE (2006-2011). The data were compared with three different definitions of RVD: Definition 1: RV dilatation, abnormal motion of interventricular septum, RV hypokinesis or tricuspid regurgitation. Definition 2: as with definition 1 but including elevated sPAP (>30mmHg). Definition 3: elevated sPAP (>30mmHg) as single RVD criterion.

Results

A total number of 129 patients (59.7% women, age 70.0years (60.7/81.0)) were included in this study. Median Troponin I level was measured as 0.02ng/ml (0/0.14); mean sPAP 33.9±18.5mmHg. The troponin cut-off levels for predicting a RVD of the 3 RVD definitions were in definition 1-3: >0.01ng/ml, >0.01ng/ml and >0.00ng/ml. Analysis of the ROC curve showed an AUC for RVD definitions 1-3: 0.790, 0.796 and 0.635.

Conclusions

The combination of commonly used RVD criteria with added elevated sPAP improves the diagnosis of RVD in acute PE. Troponin I values of >0.01ng/ml in acute PE point to an RVD.

Results

Between May 2016 and January 2023, a total of 104 patients diagnosed with high- or intermediate-risk PE at Wollongong Hospital underwent CDT-PPS (Table I).

Table I 
Baseline characteristics

Risk stratification

Of the 104 patients, 47% had high-risk PE, and the simplified pulmonary embolism severity index scores deemed >80% of the patients as high risk(Table II).

Table II

Of the 104 patients, 11 (11%) had absolute contraindications to lysis and 49 (47%) had relative contraindications to lysis (Table III). When the HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly, drugs/alcohol concomitantly) bleeding risk score was calculated, 60 patients (58%) were considered at a moderate risk of bleeding (HAS-BLED score, 1-2) and 10 (10%) at a high risk of bleeding (HAS-BLED score, >3).The latter included nine unstable patients with high-risk PE that could not be anticoagulated; six were actively bleeding, two had recently undergone neurosurgical interventions, and one was in rehabilitation for an ischemic stroke suffered 2 weeks prior. Of the 104 patients, 83 (80%) had concomitant deep vein thrombosis, 15 (14%) had saddle embolus, and 1 had a documented thrombus in transit in the RV at echocardiography.

Investigations

CTPA revealed bilateral lobar PE in 80% of cases, saddle PE in 14%, and single-sided lobar in 5%. The patient who was pregnant underwent a ventilation perfusion scan, which revealed bilateral lobar filling defects.

Echocardiography was performed preoperatively in 84 patients (81%); 16 patients (15%) were deemed too unstable for echocardiography, and for 4 (4%), the service was unavailable. Of the 104 patients, 89% had a RV/LV ratio >1, and in 93%, the mean RVSP was 50 ± 12 mm Hg.

### Assessment of right ventricular function in acute pulmonary embolism [^89ef4d4c]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The optimal approach to assess right ventricular (RV) function in patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) lacks clarity.

Methods

This study aimed to evaluate the optimal approach to assess RV function in normotensive patients with acute symptomatic PE. Outcomes assessed through 30-days after the diagnosis of PE included all-cause mortality and complicated course.

Results

Eight hundred forty-eight patients were enrolled. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and transthoracic echocardiography agreed on the presence or absence of RV overload in 449 (53%) patients. The combination of the simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (sPESI) and MDCT showed a negative predictive value for 30-day all-cause mortality of 100%. Of the 43% that had an sPESI of >0 points and MDCT RV enlargement, 41 (11.3%) experienced a complicated course that included 24 (6.6%) deaths. One hundred twenty-nine patients (15%) had an sPESI of >0 points, MDCT, and echocardiographic RV overload. Of these, 21 (16.3%) experienced a complicated course within the first 30days, and 10 (7.7%) of them died.

Conclusions

Incorporation of echocardiographic RV overload to the sPESI and MDCT did not improve identification of low-risk PE patients, whereas it improved identification of those at intermediate-high risk for short-term complications.

### D-dimer and simplified pulmonary embolism severity index in relation to right ventricular function [^900ba8fb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Right ventricular (RV) involvement in pulmonary embolism (PE) is an ominous sign. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which the d-dimer level or simplified PE severity index (sPESI) indicates RV dysfunction in patients with preserved systemic arterial pressure.

Methods

Right ventricular function was studied in 34 consecutive patients with acute nonmassive PE by echocardiography including Doppler tissue imaging within 24 hours after arrival to the hospital. d-Dimer and sPESI were assessed upon arrival.

Results

d-Dimer correlated with RV pressure (Rs, 0.60; P < .001) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR; Rs, 0.68; P < .0001) and tended to be related to myocardial performance index (MPI; Rs, 0.31; P = .067). Compared to a level less than 3.0 mg/L, patients with d-dimer 3.0 mg/L or higher had lower systolic tricuspid annular velocity (11.3 ± 2.7 vs 13.5 ± 2.7 cm/s; P < .05), a prolonged MPI (0.8 ± 0.3 vs 0.5 ± 0.2; P < .01), increased RV pressure (58 ± 13 vs 37 ± 12 mm Hg; P < .001), and increased PVR (3.3 ± 1.1 vs 1.8 ± 0.4 Woods units; P < .001). Patients in the high-risk sPESI group had higher filling pressure than those in the low risk sPESI group.

Conclusions

In the acute stage of PE, a d-dimer level 3 mg/L or higher may identify nonmassive PE patients with RV dysfunction and thereby help to determine their risk profile. We found no additional value for sPESI in this context.

### Natriuretic peptides in acute pulmonary embolism: a systematic review [^0fde2342]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) have a high risk of death, and it is important to recognize factors associated with higher mortality. Recently, several biomarkers have been studied for risk stratification in patients with PE.

Objectives

Evaluate the available evidence on (a) the accuracy of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) for the diagnosis of right ventricular dysfunction and (b) their value as a prognostic factor of all-cause in-hospital or short-term mortality in patients with PE.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, and citation review of relevant primary and review articles.

Selection Criteria

We selected studies evaluating the accuracy of BNP or NT-proBNP for the diagnosis of right ventricular dysfunction. We also selected studies that reported data on BNP or NT-proBNP as a predictor of short-term mortality in patients with PE.

Results

Sixteen studies met our inclusion criteria. The pooled diagnostic odds ratio for the diagnosis of right ventricular dysfunction in pulmonary embolism was 39.45 (95% CI; 15.54-100.12) and 24.73 (95% CI 2.02-302.37) for BNP and NT-proBNP, respectively. The pooled odds ratio for all-cause in-hospital or short-term mortality was 6 (95% CI 1.31-27.43; p: 0.021) and 16.12 (95% CI 3.1-83.68; p: 0.001) for BNP (cutoff: 100 pg/ml) and NT-proBNP (cutoff: 600 ng/L), respectively.

Conclusion

The results of this meta-analysis indicate that BNP and NT-proBNP are associated with the diagnosis of right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) in patients with an acute PE and are significant predictors of all-cause in-hospital or short-term mortality in these patients.

### Advanced management of intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism [^a2117bed]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary embolism is extremely common both in the general public and in hospitalized patients, but patients who have intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism continue to pose significant treatment dilemmas. This is because the short-term mortality of a pulmonary embolus ranges from 2% in normotensive patients, 30% in patients with right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, and up to 65% in patients with cardiac arrest on presentation.

Understanding why a pulmonary embolism can pose such danger is anchored in the delicate balance that exists between the thrombus and obstructive shock. Once thrombus has formed in or embolized to the pulmonary artery, it acutely generates increases in pulmonary hypertension inducing right-sided heart failure. This is the primary driver of mortality in patients presenting with acute pulmonary embolism.

The increase in RV afterload is not simply from the physical obstruction of the pulmonary vascular bed but also the result of vasoconstrictive effects of thrombus-derived mediators such as thromboxane-A2 and serotonin. Although the right ventricle dilates to overcome the rise in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), eventually the dilation increases to the point of myocyte dysfunction and decreased strength of RV contraction. Additionally, the pressure overload in the right ventricle results in bowing of the intraventricular septum, decreasing left ventricular (LV) preload and negatively impacting cardiac output.

Treatment should be modified based on disease severity, but at present no perfect predictors exist to determine which patients will decompensate. Clinical decision must be made by integrating clinical evaluation, often employing a pulmonary embolism score, in conjunction with imaging and laboratory markers that note RV dysfunction and injury. This method seems to correlate best with risk of decompensation.

The Bova score was developed to determine which hemodynamically stable patients with pulmonary embolism had worse outcomes. Patients with a heart rate ≥ 110 beats/min, systolic BP 90–100 mmHg for at least 15 min, RV dysfunction, and elevated cardiac troponin had an increased risk of decompensation. Other scores, such as the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) or simplified PESI (sPESI), combined with an assessment of RV function have been used to divide patients into intermediate-low risk and intermediate-high risk and help make treatment decisions. In this chapter, we will review the evidence for various treatment modalities in patients with intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism. Intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism is best defined as a patient who has a pulmonary embolism, is hemodynamically stable, but has an elevated pulmonary embolism score and both radiographic and laboratory signs of right heart strain (Fig. 1).

### Pulmonary embolism [^8a2185e5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on pulmonary embolism: 
- Definition: PE is defined as an occlusion of the pulmonary artery or one of its branches, most often caused by a thrombus originating from deep veins of the lower extremities. The clot blocks blood flow to the pulmonary circulation, leading to impaired oxygen exchange and potentially life-threatening hemodynamic instability.
- Pathophysiology: Most pulmonary emboli (70-80%) arise from thrombi in the deep veins of the legs or pelvis, though about 6% originate in the upper extremities. Thrombosis is promoted by Venous stasis, Endothelial injury, and Hypercoagulability-the classic Virchow triad. Risk factors include major surgery, trauma, immobility, cancer, estrogen therapy, pregnancy, and inherited thrombophilias. Hemodynamic compromise results from increased pulmonary vascular resistance, RV overload, reduced LV filling, and decreased cardiac output.
- Epidemiology: PE occurs in approximately 60-120 cases per 100,000 people per year, causing an estimated 60,000-100,000 deaths annually in the US. Incidence increases with age, from fewer than 50 per 100,000 in those younger than 50 to about 350 per 100,000 in people older than 75. Widespread use of CT pulmonary angiography has increased diagnosis, including detection of smaller, nonfatal emboli. In-hospital mortality is about 14%, and 90-day mortality approaches 20%.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for PE include immobilization or recent surgery, previous history of DVT or PE, malignancy, and certain genetic conditions. Other factors such as HR > 100 bpm and the presence of hemoptysis can also increase the likelihood of PE according to the Wells' Criteria.
- Disease course: Clinically, PE can present with a variety of symptoms including acute dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, tachycardia, and syncope. Some patients may also present with hemoptysis or signs of DVT such as unilateral leg swelling. Severe cases can cause hypotension, right HF, or cardiac arrest. Complications can include RV dysfunction, arrhythmia, hemodynamic collapse, and death.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of PE varies depending on patient's hemodynamic status, underlying disease, and the presence of RV dysfunction. Adverse events within 30 days of PE diagnosis, such as death, secondary cardiogenic shock, or recurrent VTE, occur in approximately 7.4% of patients. Long-term prognosis can be influenced by the cause of the PE, with idiopathic PE associated with a worse long-term survival compared to other causes.

Risk stratification

Risk stratification is performed using clinical scores, laboratory values and imaging. The pulmonary embolism rule out criteria (PERC) help in cases with a low pre-test probability ≤ 15% while the revised Geneva Score objectifies the risk for PE and helps justify imaging studies. The simplified pulmonary embolism severity index (sPESI) predicts 30-day mortality in PE patients. In practice, the revised Geneva Score is most helpful as it is designed to avoid or potentially trigger CT imaging for confirmative diagnosis and definitive risk stratification. The 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines categorize PE into low, intermediate-low and intermediate-high as well as high estimated acute mortality risk from right heart failure (Table 1). According to this classification, defining clinical features of at least intermediate-risk PE include a heart rate greater than 110/min, a systolic blood pressure under 100 mmHg, or an oxygen saturation below 90%. The intermediate-high-risk group additionally exhibits elevated cardiac biomarkers and signs of right ventricular dysfunction in echocardiography or CT angiography. Intermediate-low-risk patients meet at most one of these criteria. High-risk patients are characterized by hemodynamic instability, often requiring circulatory support. Treating elevated-risk PE is challenging because patients may decompensate suddenly after prolonged periods of stability.

A recent meta‐analysis of patients identified as low risk by the PESI, sPESI, and Hestia criteria investigated the prognostic significance of RV dysfunction diagnosed on the basis of echocardiography or CT pulmonary angiography 51. In addition, the prognostic significance of elevations in troponin or natriuretic peptide levels was evaluated. The investigators found that, in low‐risk patients with acute PE, early mortality was associated with the presence of RV dysfunction at admission. The findings of this study may, therefore, have implications for the management of patients who are identified as low risk based solely on clinical criteria, but who also present with RV dysfunction based on imaging or laboratory markers.

Finally, the 2016 VESTA study was designed to assess the incremental value of NT‐proBNP testing in patients meeting the Hestia criteria, ~1 in 10 patients had elevated NT‐proBNP levels; however, none of these patients with elevated NT‐proBNP levels experienced a primary outcome event (30‐day composite outcome of PE or major bleeding‐related mortality, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, admission to the intensive care unit, or rescue reperfusion), leading the authors to conclude that NT‐proBNP testing does not clearly provide incremental safety when selecting patients with acute PE for outpatient treatment 52.

Right ventricular failure (RVF)—acute on chronic decompensation: Acute decompensation is usually provoked by one or more precipitating factors (e.g., infection, pulmonary embolism, bleeding disorders) or by progression of the underlying disease; patients frequently deteriorate and enter a vicious cycle of hypotension, ischemia, and decreased pump function or may stabilize and revert to more or less stable chronic RVF, and mortality after hospital discharge remains high (35% at 12 mo).

### Guidelines for the echocardiographic assessment of the right heart in adults and special considerations in pulmonary hypertension: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^f98aa93c]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Table 8—Pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) phenotypes by etiology: In group 3 due to lung disease, abnormal diastolic function is typically ≥ Grade 1, the mitral E/e′ ratio is normal unless there is concomitant group 2 disease, the right ventricle (RV) is typically normal or small with RV hypertrophy until late with RV function typically preserved until late, and abnormal RVSP occurs with peak TR velocity ≥ 2.9 m/s. In group 4 chronic thromboembolic disease, there is mild right atrial and RV enlargement with RVH until late—possibly appearing similar to Group 1 PAH—abnormal RV function, and abnormal RVSP with peak TR velocity ≥2.9 m/s. Abnormal RVSP is defined as ≥ 2.9 m/s or ≥ 2.8 m/s with two adjunctive echo signs, and combined echo phenotypes may occur and change with stage, disease duration, and co-morbid conditions.

### Multimodality assessment of right ventricular strain in patients with acute pulmonary embolism [^0d4ab793]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Optimal risk stratification is essential in managing patients with an acute pulmonary embolism (PE). There are limited data evaluating the potential additive value of various methods of evaluation of right ventricular (RV) strain in PE. We retrospectively evaluated RV strain by computed tomography (CT), transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), electrocardiography (ECG), and troponin levels in consecutive hospitalized patients with acute PE (May 2007 to December 2014). Four-hundred and seventy-seven patients met inclusion criteria. RV strain on ECG (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 3.3; p = 0.03), CT (OR 2.7, CI 1.5 to 4.8, p <0.001), TTE (OR 2.8, CI 1.5 to 5.4, p <0.001), or a positive troponin (OR 2.7, CI 2.0 to 6.9, p <0.001) were associated with adverse events. In patients with ECG, CT, and TTE data, increased risk was only elevated with RV strain on all 3 parameters (OR 4.6, CI 1.8 to 11.3, p <0.001). In all patients with troponin measurements, risk was only elevated with RV strain on all 3 parameters plus a positive troponin (OR 8.8, CI 2.8 to 28.1, p <0.001) and was similar in intermediate-risk PE (OR 11.1, CI 1.2 to 103.8, p = 0.04). In conclusion, in patients with an acute PE and evaluation of RV strain by ECG, CT, and TTE, risk of adverse events is only elevated when RV strain is present on all 3 modalities. Troponin further aids in discriminating high-risk patients. Multimodality assessment of RV strain is identified as a superior approach to risk assessment.

### Additive value of right ventricular global longitudinal strain to a conventional echocardiographic parameter to improve prognostic value in intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism [^f8a4570a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Using the combination of RVGLS and RV/LV ratio in patients with intermediate‐risk PE, we believe can further risk‐stratify and identify those potentially at highest risk for adverse outcomes. This study suggests that using this approach would lead to a reclassification of patients within the current intermediate‐low/high‐risk classification scheme, which may not capture some of the patients with true RV dysfunction given the complexity of identifying RV dysfunction. Because the highest risk group in our study had a mortality that is comparable with patients with high‐risk PE, it may be reasonable to change the treatment plan to be more consistent with patients with high‐risk PE. However, future studies of intervention will be needed before this becomes standard practice.

To our knowledge, this study is the first to focus on the combination of 2D STE and conventional echocardiographic measurements to assess risk in patients with intermediate‐risk PE. This approach may help identify patients at highest risk of mortality and be a keystone for making decisions of treatment pathways. Further validation of our findings and the impact this approach may have on management pathways would be warranted.

Study Limitations

There are several limitations in this study. First, the design of this study was a single‐center retrospective cohort study. Validation in other patient populations would be needed and add value to our findings. The sample size is larger than some prior studies evaluating 2D STE in PE but was still relatively small. As a single‐site study, we cannot exclude site‐specific biases in echocardiographic measurements, although we believe the use of semiautomated strain analysis reduces this risk. Our study evaluated all‐cause mortality and did not evaluate mortality beyond the short term (30 days). Although prior reports have indicated that short‐term mortality is more likely related to PE, we cannot exclude other causes of mortality distinct from the acute disease process. We do not have data on HIV status or restrictive lung disease, which can contribute to development of RV dysfunction or PH in this retrospective review.

### Additive value of right ventricular global longitudinal strain to a conventional echocardiographic parameter to improve prognostic value in intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism [^49444f44]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

In this study, RV/LV ratio outperformed other conventional echocardiographic parameters, and provides further support for this echocardiographic parameter being of importance when assessing patients with intermediate‐risk PE. RV/LV ratio demonstrated an AUC of 0.794 for 30‐day mortality, and using the best cutoff value of 1.03, PPV and NPV were 25.3% and 94.9%, respectively. This indicated that those with an RV/LV ratio <1.03 had a low risk of short‐term mortality.

Echocardiography enables combined parameters to be measured, such as TAPSE/SPAP, which is tightly linked to RV‐PA coupling and predicts outcome in PH.In our study, echocardiographic parameters related to RV‐PA coupling did not have a significant correlation with mortality in patients with intermediate‐risk PE. We have some potential reasons to explain it. Chronic PH represents a long‐term RV pressure overload, whereas this study measured acute PE in an intermediate‐risk population. In patients with chronic PH, the RVFAC/SPAP and TAPSE/SPAP ratios will be lower than what is found in acute PE. This is because a slower increase in PA pressures over a longer time period allows the right ventricle a greater amount of time to adapt to the increasing afterload. In these situations, PA pressures can increase to high levels resulting in a lower ratio.In addition, French et al reported the simple ratios may not address the question of disproportionality of RV adaptation, because the relationship between RV function and afterload was nonlinear.RV‐PA coupling parameters may perform better in chronic conditions.

### Prognostic role of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion to systolic pulmonary artery pressure ratio for the identification of early clinical deterioration in intermediate-high-risk pulmonary embolism patients [^b3c53cfa]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The ratio of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) to echocardiographically measured systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PASP) has been proposed as a surrogate of RV-arterial coupling. In this analysis, we assess the prognostic role of TAPSE/PASP for early clinical deterioration and short-term mortality in an often clinically challenging population of intermediate-high-risk patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). A post hoc analysis of intermediate-high-risk patients with PE enrolled in the Italian Pulmonary Embolism Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01604538) was performed. All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography at admission. The primary and secondary outcomes were clinical deterioration within 48 hours from admission and 30-day all-cause mortality, respectively. In 422 intermediate-high-risk patients with PE (mean age 71.2 ± 5.3 years, 238 men), 37 (8.7%) experienced clinical deterioration within 48 hours of admission. The 30-day mortality rate was 6.6% (n = 28). The receiver operating characteristic analysis established 0.33 as the optimal cut-off value for the TAPSE/PASP in predicting 48-hour clinical deterioration (area under the curve 0.79 ± 0.1). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 81%, 88.5%, 40.5%, and 97.9%, respectively. The multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that a TAPSE/PASP ≤0.33 was an independent predictor of 48-hour clinical deterioration (hazard ratio 2.06, 95% confidence interval 1.98 to 2.11, p <0.0001) and 30-day mortality (hazard ratio 2.28, 95% confidence interval 2.25 to 2.33, p <0.001). TAPSE/PASP shows promise as a noninvasive prognostic predictor to identify intermediate-high-risk patients with PE at a higher risk of early clinical deterioration and short-term mortality.

### A multimodality imaging approach to defining risk in patients with acute pulmonary embolism [^a34304d8]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Morbidity and mortality for acute pulmonary embolism (PE) remain high. Therapies such as catheter-directed thrombolysis may improve outcomes, but these are generally reserved for higher-risk patients. Imaging may help guide the use of the newer therapies, but current guidelines focus more on clinical factors. Our goal was to create a risk model that incorporated quantitative echocardiographic and computed tomography (CT) measures of right ventricular (RV) size and function, thrombus burden, and serum biomarkers of cardiac overload or injury.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of 150 patients evaluated by a PE response team. Echocardiography was performed within 48 hours of diagnosis. Computed tomography measures included RV/left ventricular (LV) ratio and thrombus load (Qanadli score). Echocardiography was used to obtain various quantitative measures of RV function. We compared characteristics of those who met the primary endpoint (7-day mortality and clinical deterioration) to those who did not. Receiver operating curve analysis was used to assess the performance of different combinations of clinically relevant features and the association with adverse outcomes.

Results

Fifty-two percent of patients were female, with age 62 ± 17 years, systolic blood pressure 123 ± 25 mm Hg, heart rate 98 ± 19, troponin 3.2 ± 35 ng/dL, and b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) 467 ± 653. Fourteen (9.3%) were treated with systemic thrombolytics, 27 (18%) underwent catheter-directed thrombolytics, 23 (15%) were intubated or required vasopressors, and 14 (9.3%) died. Patients who met the primary endpoint (44%) versus those who did not (56%) had lower RV S' (6.6 vs 11.9 cm/sec; P < .001) and RV free wall strain (-10.9% vs -13.6%; P = .005), higher RV/LV ratio on CT, and higher serum BNP and troponin levels. Receiver operating curve analysis demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.89 for a model that included RV S', RV free wall strain and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion/RV systolic pressure ratio from echo, thrombus load and RV/LV ratio from CT, and troponin and BNP levels.

Conclusion

A combination of clinical, echo, and CT findings that reflect the hemodynamic effects of the embolism identified patients with adverse events related to acute PE. Optimized scoring systems that focus on reversible abnormalities attributable to PE may allow more appropriate triaging of intermediate- to high-risk patients with PE for early interventional strategy.

### High plasma lactate levels are associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with pulmonary embolism [^f1c872f4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective was to investigate the prognostic value of plasma lactate in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE).

Methods

This was a retrospective study at the emergency department (ED) of a third-level teaching hospital. The authors considered consecutive patients with a diagnosis of PE established by lung scan or spiral computed tomography (CT) and confirmed by pulmonary angiography if necessary. Only patients for whom plasma lactate levels had been tested within 6 hours from presentation to the ED were included. Primary outcome was in-hospital death due to any cause; secondary outcome was mortality related to PE.

Results

From September 1997 to June 2006, a total of 384 patients were diagnosed with PE in the ED. Of these patients, 287 had registered plasma lactate levels and were included in this analysis. Included patients had a mean age of 70 (SD ± 15 years, range = 18 to 100 years), 163 (57%) were female, 26 (9%) showed systolic blood pressure lower than 100 mm Hg at presentation, and 160 (56%) had echocardiographic evidence of right ventricular dysfunction (RVD). Twenty patients died during their hospital stay (7%). Plasma lactate levels ≥ 2 mmol/L were associated with in-hospital mortality from all causes (odds ratio [OR] = 4.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.57 to 13.53) and with PE-related mortality (OR = 4.94, 95% CI = 1.38 to 17.63), independent of hypotension or RVD at presentation.

Conclusions

High plasma lactate was associated with increased in-hospital mortality in this sample of patients with acute PE.

### Additive value of right ventricular global longitudinal strain to a conventional echocardiographic parameter to improve prognostic value in intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism [^5447b9e0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary outcome was all‐cause mortality at 30 days. All‐cause 30‐day mortality was evaluated as short‐term mortality and is likely most associated with the PE, compared with long‐term mortality, where confounding factors would impact the mortality rate. Timing of mortality from diagnosis was determined by chart review. All survivors had a follow‐up visit or documentation in the electronic medical record indicating that they were alive at least 30 days after index hospitalization.

We further classified our patients into intermediate‐low‐risk and intermediate‐high‐risk PE cohorts based on previously defined definitions.Intermediate‐low‐risk patients with PE had either evidence of RV dysfunction on imaging or elevated cardiac biomarkers. Intermediate‐high‐risk patients with PE had both RV dysfunction on imaging and elevated cardiac biomarkers. The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

Echocardiographic Analysis

Echocardiographic data were analyzed in accordance with the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines.All echocardiographic parameters were analyzed with TomTec TTA2.42 (TomTec Imaging Systems, Munich, Germany) by the echocardiographic core laboratory (Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pulmonary Artery), which was blinded to all clinical and outcome data. When obtaining echocardiographic measurements in all patients, the most representative view that accurately reflected appropriate chamber size and function, as well as the most representative Doppler signal, was chosen. Echocardiographic parameters in the assessment of right‐sided heart for intermediate‐risk PE in this study are shown in Figure 1. Left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end‐diastolic diameter, RV end‐diastolic diameter, RV/LV ratio, RV fractional area change (RVFAC), TAPSE, tissue Doppler imaging‐derived RV systolic velocity (RV S′), pulmonary vascular resistance, and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) were measured as conventional echocardiographic parameters. Left ventricular end‐diastolic diameter and RV end‐diastolic diameter were measured at the level of the mitral and tricuspid valve tips in the apical 4‐chamber view to generate the RV/LV ratio.Pulmonary vascular resistance was estimated using the methodology of Abbas et al.SPAP was calculated using the simplified Bernoulli equation. RA pressure assessments were based on inferior vena cava size and collapsibility.RVFAC/SPAP, TAPSE/SPAP, and RV S′/SPAP were calculated as indices of RV‐PA coupling.McConell sign and diastolic septal flattening were evaluated as previously reported.

### Value of transthoracic echocardiography in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: results of a prospective study in unselected patients [^567084e3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Echocardiography is advocated by some as a useful diagnostic test for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), but its diagnostic accuracy is unknown. The present study was undertaken to determine prospectively the sensitivity and specificity of transthoracic echocardiography in the diagnosis of PE.

Subjects and Methods

We examined 110 consecutive patients with suspected PE. The study protocol included assessment of clinical probability, echocardiography, and perfusion lung scanning. Pulmonary angiography was performed in all patients with abnormal scans. As echocardiographic criteria to diagnose acute PE, we used the presence of any two of the following: right ventricular (RV) hypokinesis, RV end-diastolic diameter >27 mm (without RV wall hypertrophy), or tricuspid regurgitation velocity >2.7 m/sec. Clinical estimates of PE served as pretest probabilities in calculating, after echocardiography, the posttest probabilities of PE.

Results

Pulmonary angiography confirmed PE in 43 (39%) of 110 patients. Echocardiographic diagnostic criteria for PE yielded a sensitivity of 56% and a specificity of 90%. For pretest probabilities of 10%, 50%, and 90%, the posttest probabilities of PE conditioned by a positive echocardiogram were 38%, 85%, and 98%, respectively. The posttest probabilities of PE conditioned by a negative echocardiogram were 5%, 33%, and 81%, respectively.

Conclusions

In unselected patients with suspected PE, transthoracic echocardiography fails to identify some 50% of patients with angiographically proven PE. Although echocardiographic findings of RV strain, paired with a high clinical likelihood, support a diagnosis of PE, the transthoracic echocardiography has to have a better sensitivity to be used as a screening test to rule out PE.

Figure 3 
Incremental value of combined RVGLS with RV/LV ratio on 30‐day mortality.

Compared with RV/LV ratio alone, the combination of RVGLS and RV/LV ratio more accurately assessed the risk for 30‐day mortality. In patients with an RV/LV ratio <1.03 and RVGLS >17.7%, 30‐day mortality decreased from 4.4% to 1.0%. Meanwhile, in patients with an RV/LV ratio ≥1.03 and RVGLS ≤17.7%, 30‐day mortality increased from 25.3% to 46.2%. RVGLS indicates right ventricular global longitudinal strain; and RV/LV ratio, right to left ventricular end‐diastolic diameter ratio.

Using the 2 cutoff values of RV/LV ratio and RVGLS, all patients were divided into 4 groups. Kaplan‐Meier curves demonstrated a significant difference in 30‐day mortality based on RV/LV ratio with the additional of RVGLS (log‐rank P <0.001) (Figure 4). In those with a high RVGLS (>17.7%) and low RV/LV ratio (<1.03), we found a 99.0% survival rate, compared with those with a low RVGLS (≤17.7%) and high RV/LV ratio (≥1.03), where the survival rate was 53.8% (P <0.001). In those with a high RVGLS (>17.7%) and high RV/LV ratio (≥1.03), patients had a 97.7% survival rate. Conversely, those with a low RVGLS (≤17.7%) and low RV/LV ratio (<1.03) demonstrated an 83.3% survival rate (P =0.020).

### Quantitative measures of right ventricular dysfunction by echocardiography in the diagnosis of acute nonmassive pulmonary embolism [^ac21a4b2]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is used in the risk assessment of patients with pulmonary embolism (PE), but the incremental diagnostic information from quantitative measures of right ventricular (RV) size, pressure, and function by TTE has yet to be fully evaluated.

Methods

In 300 consecutive patients with suspected first nonmassive PE, TTE and ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy were performed.

Results

Among measures of RV anatomy, RV pressure estimates, and estimates of global and regional RV function with significant diagnostic information in a logistic regression analysis, the acceleration time of RV outflow less than 89 milliseconds, the ratio of RV to left ventricular diameter greater than 0.78, RV outflow tract fractional shortening less than 35%, and signs of RV strain on electrocardiogram had independent, incremental diagnostic information (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve = 0.81). If D-dimer greater than 4.1 mmol/L was included, the area under the curve increased to 0.88. The negative and positive predictive values if any 2 of 3 factors in the final model were present were 88% and 70%, respectively.

Conclusion

TTE is able to identify differential diagnoses and enhance pretest probability of PE significantly. TTE could therefore be considered as an integral part of the initial diagnostic workup of patients suspected of PE, especially if definitive diagnostic imaging has limited availability.

### Additive value of right ventricular global longitudinal strain to a conventional echocardiographic parameter to improve prognostic value in intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism [^dea960ca]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Patient data were expressed using mean±SD or median with interquartile range, and χ 2 or Fisher exact tests were used to compare nominal variables between survivors and nonsurvivors at 30 days. Parameters that fit a normal distribution were analyzed using paired/unpaired t tests. When data did not fit a normal distribution, the Mann‐Whitney U /Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used. The independent associations with 30‐day mortality were evaluated in univariable and multivariable analyses. Variables with a univariate value of P <0.05 were incorporated into the multivariable logistic regression models or Cox proportional hazards regression models. If >2 variables were used to measure a pathophysiological parameter (eg, TAPSE and RV S′ as markers of RV systolic function related to the basal segments of the RV free wall), the more clinically relevant parameter was entered into the model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analyses were performed for evaluating 30‐day mortality. Best cutoff thresholds were determined based on sensitivity and specificity from the ROC curves. We performed a multivariable ROC curve analysis to verify whether RVGLS along with RV/LV ratio could improve the predictive performance. Kaplan‐Meier survival analyses were created using threshold values and compared by log‐rank tests. Correlation analysis was performed using linear regression by Pearson correlation coefficient, whereas agreement between methods was assessed using Bland‐Altman analysis. Statistical significance was set at P <0.05. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software (IBM, Armonk, NY; version 29.0.0.0).

### Advanced management of intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism [^9b0221ec]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Systemic thrombolysis and catheter-directed therapies have emerged at the forefront of management to acutely relieve RV obstruction in intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism as surgical pulmonary embolectomy has historically been associated with a higher mortality. However, over time, surgical technique has been revised and standardized to minimize perioperative mortality and thus sparked a renewed interest in expanding the scope of surgical interventions. Recent data from experienced surgical centers have shown in-hospital mortality as low as 11.7% in patients undergoing surgical embolectomy for acute high-risk pulmonary embolism. On deeper review of the data, it was noted that this value was largely driven by patients with massive pulmonary embolism and those with pre-operative arrest rather than patients in the intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism category. The safety of surgical embolectomy in submassive pulmonary embolism has been further underscored in other small single center studies, with one such study quoting no mortality in their cohort of patients. In fact, the mortality from surgical pulmonary embolectomy in acute pulmonary embolism has been shown to be equivalent to that from thrombolysis. The New York State Registry, which included 174,322 patients hospitalized with pulmonary embolism between 1999 and 2013, revealed no difference in short-term mortality between surgical embolectomy and thrombolysis. Moreover, those who underwent surgical pulmonary embolectomy had lower rates of stroke, recurrent pulmonary embolism, and need for reintervention. Improvements in operative techniques and subsequent outcomes have highlighted that surgical pulmonary embolectomy is both safe and effective. This has led to garnered interest in perhaps expanding the criteria for surgical referral, particularly in cases of intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism. Nevertheless, this is not yet formally part of any guideline and likely requires a multidisciplinary discussion on a case-by-case basis.

### Real-time risk stratification in acute pulmonary embolism: the utility of RV / LV diameter ratio [^937440f9]. Thrombosis Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

This study evaluates the prognostic utility of the RV/LV diameter ratio in predicting low cardiac index (CI) in patients with acute intermediate-risk PE.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 112 patients with acute PE who underwent catheter-based therapies. The RV/LV diameter ratio was measured from standard axial views on computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). Multivariable regression models were used to assess the relationship between the RV/LV diameter ratio and invasive hemodynamic parameters.

Results

A total of 63 patients (56.3 %) had a low CI (≤2.2 L/min/m 2 ). The optimal cut-off for the RV/LV ratio to predict low cardiac index was 1.0 (area under the curve: 0.64). In a multivariable model, the RV/LV ratio (every 0.1 increase) was a significant predictor of low CI (OR: 1.11, 95 % CI 1.01-1.23, p = 0.03). Patients with a high RV/LV ratio (>1.0) had a lower pre-procedure cardiac index (2.0 [IQR 1.7, 2.6] vs 2.7 [IQR 2.4, 3.0] L/min/m 2 , p < 0.001), higher pre-procedure mPAP (34.0 [IQR 27.0, 41.0] mm Hg vs 28.0 [IQR 20.0, 35.0] mm Hg, p = 0.015), and were more likely to have a low cardiac index (65 % vs 3 %, p = 0.001). Every 0.1 increase in the ratio was associated with a 0.5 mm Hg increase in mPAP (p < 0.001) and a 0.05 L/min/m 2 lower cardiac index (p = 0.002). The RV/LV ratio demonstrated moderate sensitivity (64.5 %) and high specificity (84.2 %) for predicting low cardiac index.

Conclusion

The RV/LV diameter ratio offers real-time risk stratification and is a predictor of low cardiac index in patients with acute PE.

### Management of venous thrombo-embolism: an update [^6a1875d4]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Venous thrombo-embolism is the third most frequent acute cardiovascular syndrome after myocardial infarction and stroke. Recently published landmark trials paved the way for significant progress in the management of the disease and provided the evidence for the ESC Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Guidelines 2014 update. Risk stratification strategies for non-high-risk PE continue to evolve, with an increasing emphasis on clinical prediction rules and right ventricular (RV) assessment on computed tomographic pulmonary angiography. In the field of anticoagulation treatment, pharmacogenetic testing for vitamin K antagonists on top of clinical parameters was not found to offer a significant benefit during the initiation phase; on the other hand, dosing based on the patient's clinical data seems superior to fixed loading regimens. The phase 3 trial programme of new oral anticoagulants in the treatment of venous thrombo-embolism has been completed, and the results indicate that these agents are at least as effective and probably cause less major bleeding than currently standard treatment. A multicentre prospective phase 4 trial will determine whether early discharge and out-of-hospital treatment of low-risk PE with the oral factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban is feasible, effective, and safe. For intermediate-risk PE defined on the basis of imaging tests and laboratory biomarkers, the bleeding risks of full-dose thrombolytic treatment appear too high to justify its use, unless clinical signs of haemodynamic decompensation appear. Patients in whom PE has resulted in chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension and who are not suitable for pulmonary endarterectomy, may be expected to benefit from emerging pharmaceutical and interventional treatment options.

### Society of Interventional Radiology position statement on catheter-directed therapy for acute pulmonary embolism [^067de318]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Medium credibility.

European Society of Cardiology—management of acute pulmonary embolism: In patients with PE presenting with shock or hypotension, intravenous unfractionated heparin should be administered as the preferred mode of initial anticoagulation, and primary reperfusion treatment, particularly systemic thrombolysis, is the treatment of choice for patients with high-risk PE. If thrombolysis is contraindicated or has failed to improve hemodynamic status, surgical embolectomy is recommended if expertise/resources are available, and percutaneous catheter-directed therapy (CDT) should be considered if on-site expertise/resources are available. For PE without shock or hypotension, treatment escalation is recommended for the intermediate (high)-risk category defined by the presence of RV dysfunction and abnormal cardiac enzyme levels, with RV/LV diameter ratio ≥ 0.9 on CT prompting cardiac troponin testing unless primary reperfusion is not an option. Rescue reperfusion with thrombolysis if clinical signs of hemodynamic decompensation appear, surgical pulmonary embolectomy, or percutaneous CDT may be considered as alternative options to systemic thrombolysis, and surgical pulmonary embolectomy or percutaneous CDT may be considered as alternative rescue procedures when decompensation appears imminent and anticipated bleeding risk under systemic thrombolysis is high.

### Risk stratification and treatment of pulmonary embolism with intermediate-risk of mortality [^c57f4d4f]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Intermediate-risk pulmonary embolisms (PE) represent a heterogeneous group at the high end of hemodynamically stable patients, characterized by a higher mortality rate. This challenging population gathers many unsolved question regarding its therapeutic management. The purpose of this review is to provide an updated overview of the literature regarding further risk stratification and treatment options in this population.

Recent Findings

If anticoagulation represents the undisputed first line of treatment, some patients especially in the intermediate-high risk subgroup may necessitate or could benefit from therapeutic escalation with reperfusion therapies. This includes systemic thrombolysis (ST) or catheter-directed therapies (CDT). ST, despite its high efficacy, is not recommended in this population because of prohibitive bleeding complications. Therefore, reduced-dose ST appears to be a promising option and is actually under evaluation. CDT are percutaneous reperfusion techniques developed to acutely decrease pulmonary vascular obstruction with lower-dose or no thrombolytic agents and, thus, potentially improved safety compared to ST.

Summary

Great progress has been made in the recent years providing a wide range of therapeutic options. Optimal selection of patients who could benefit from these treatments is the key and is based on clinical, biological and radiological parameters evaluating right ventricle function and allowing accurate risk stratification. Pulmonary Embolism Response Team represents an efficient modality for therapeutic management especially in the intermediate-high risk subgroup.

### Guidelines for the use of echocardiography in the evaluation of a cardiac source of embolism [^d4c4403a]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism—role of echocardiography focuses on risk stratification and characteristic findings in hemodynamically significant PE. Echocardiography is not a diagnostic modality of choice for the diagnosis of PE per se but is used for patient risk stratification; both transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) provide noninvasive assessment of right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) size, systolic function, regional wall motion, valvular abnormalities, and right-heart pressures, and thrombi in transit are rare to see with a serpentine thrombus traversing the right-heart chambers. The typical echocardiographic pattern of hemodynamically significant PE shows RV strain, interventricular septum bulging into the left ventricle, and dilated proximal pulmonary arteries; distinction of high-risk from low-risk patients should be rapidly performed so management can be tailored.

### Prevalence of long-term right ventricular dysfunction after acute pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e03d0b03]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) is associated with adverse outcomes of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). However, there are no studies describing the long-term, full-spectrum right ventricular parameters on morphology, pressure and function at certain follow-up time points after PE onset. More exploration of right ventricular function would provide useful clues for long-term management of patients with PE.

Methods

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we completed a literature search in Pubmed, EMBASE and WebofScience (from Jan 1st, 1998 to April 20th, 2023). Studies of patients with acute PE followed-up longer than 3 months with right ventricle assessment and written in English-language were included. Right ventricular function was assessed by either echocardiography or computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA). The primary outcome was structural and functional parameters of the right ventricle, and the secondary outcomes were functional assessments [New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification and 6-min walk test distance (6 MWD)], at each follow-up time points. Random effect meta-analyses were performed using R software (PROSPERO: CRD42023433332).

Findings

A total of 33 studies (3920 patients) were included in the final analysis. The 3-month, 6-month and 1-year prevalence of right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) was 0.34 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21-0.48, I 2 = 96%], 0.26 (95% CI 0.17-0.36, I 2 = 93%) and 0.34 (95% CI 0.19-0.48, I 2 = 94%), respectively. Pooled tricuspid annulus plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), right ventricular to left ventricular diameter (RV/LV) ratio and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) at 1-year was 21.80 mm (95% CI 20.08-23.52, I 2 = 93%), 0.64 (95% CI 0.48-0.81, I 2 = 92%) and 27.33 mmHg (95% CI 18.88-35.78) (I 2 = 96%), respectively. The proportion of NYHA III-IV was 0.06 (95% CI 0.0-0.12) and the pooled 6 MWD was 462.98 m (95% CI 447.55-478.41) over 1 year. Patients treated with thrombolysis had lower prevalence of RVD (1-year 0.17 and 0.07 in systemic thrombolysis and catheter-directed thrombolysis, respectively) than those treated with anticoagulation therapy alone (1-year 0.24) but the pooled risk ratio (RR) was not statistically significant.

Interpretation

Although the conclusion of this study may be limited by its high heterogeneity from varied study designs, inclusion criteria and definition of RVD of each study, our findings suggested that persistent RVD and functional impairment were of considerable high prevalence during long-term follow-up after acute PE. Treatment strategy may influence the prevalence of long-term RVD.

### Comparison of various prognostic scores for identification of patients with intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism [^d288737a]. Thrombosis Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Various risk assessment tools have been proposed to identify stable patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) who are at high risk of early adverse outcome (i.e., intermediate-high risk).

Methods

We evaluated the ability of the 2019 ESC, Bova, modified FAST and PEITHO-3 models for predicting a 30-day complicated course (death, haemodynamic collapse, and/or recurrent PE) in a cohort of 848 stable patients with acute PE. We also tested whether replacement of echocardiographic right ventricle (RV) dysfunction by computed tomographic (CT) RV enlargement provides comparable prognostic information for identifying these patients.

Results

A complicated course occurred in 63 (7.4 %) of the 848 patients with PE during the first month of follow-up. The proportion of patients designated as having intermediate-high risk PE was 6.7 % with the ESC model, 4.4 % with the Bova score, 15.7 % with the FAST score, and 5.2 % with the PEITHO-3 model. However, among patients identified as intermediate-high risk, the 30-day complicated course rate was higher with the Bova score (21.6 %) than with the ESC model (17.5 %), the PEITHO-3 model (15.9 %), or the modified FAST score (14.3 %). When echocardiographic RV dysfunction was replaced by CT RV enlargement in the models, the proportion of patients classified as having intermediate-high risk PE and the rate of an adverse outcome among them slightly increased.

Conclusions

The Bova score might identify patients with intermediate-high risk PE slightly better than the ESC, PEITHO-3, and modified FAST score. When echocardiography is not readily available, CT-assessed RV enlargement might be used for identifying intermediate-high risk PE.

### 4-level clinical pretest probability score for suspected pulmonary embolism to safely decrease imaging testing (...) [^6246d279]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance The 4PEPS strategy may lead to a substantial and safe reduction in imaging testing for patients with suspected PE. It should now be tested in a formal outcome study. The outcome was a PE diagnosed on CTPA or high-probability V/Q scan during the initial diagnostic workup or a venous thromboembolism occurring during follow-up in a patient in whom PE was initially ruled out. In all studies, the following were considered as VTE: symptomatic PE objectively confirmed with CTPA or high-probability V/Q scan and/or deep vein thrombosis on compression ultrasonography and/or sudden unexpected death potentially related to PE according to an independent adjudication committee. The safety of the 4PEPS strategy was retrospectively assessed using the false-negative rate if the strategy had been applied in the 2 external validation cohorts.

This is the rate of PE diagnoses during the initial diagnostic process or VTEs found during the 3-month follow-up among patients with a very low CPP, a low CPP and D-dimer level less than 1. 0 μg/mL, a moderate CPP and D-dimer level less than the age-adjusted cutoff value, or a negative CTPA or V/Q scan. No fatal PE or high-risk hemodynamically unstable PE were observed, and 3 of 11 false-negative VTEs in the high-prevalence cohort and 3 of 14 false-negative VTEs in the moderate-prevalence cohort were subsegmental PE. The upper limit of the 95% CI of the false-negative rate was less than the predefined cutoff value to consider the 4PEPS strategy as safe in the first and second external validation cohorts. In conclusion, using a bayesian approach, we derived a new 4-level clinical probability score to help ED physicians make decisions regarding patients suspected of PE.

The accuracy, safety, and efficacy of the 4PEPS strategy were confirmed in 2 independent external validation cohorts, one with a moderate PE prevalence and the other with a high PE prevalence. For both cohorts, applying 4PEPS resulted in a very low rate of diagnostic failure and a substantial reduction in imaging testing. It should now be tested in a formal outcome study.

### Diagnostic strategies for suspected pulmonary embolism (...) [^ec4bac02]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. However, after a timely and accurate diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment, patients usually quickly recover and most will have an excellent prognosis. The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism can be difficult because patients may present with nonspecific clinical manifestations and typical signs and symptoms frequently are absent. 1 In the past few decades, a rapid and reliable diagnosis of pulmonary embolism has been made easier with the availability of high-resolution computed tomography pulmonary angiography.

However, because many patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism have alternative diagnoses, such as pulmonary infections, cardiac conditions, pleural disease, or musculoskeletal problems, much effort has been devoted to develop triage protocols to identify the right patients who need CTPA to avoid unnecessary scanning, contrast-induced nephropathy, radiation exposure, cost, and overdiagnosis of small subsegmental clots, of which the clinical relevance is controversial. 2, 3 This is becoming more important as the threshold of physicians to consider the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is currently much lower, as illustrated by a decreasing pulmonary embolism prevalence in diagnostic management studies. In some studies, pulmonary embolism was confirmed in less than 10% of patients in whom the diagnosis was initially suspected. 4, 5 Levi M, van Es N.

### Quality of life 1 month after acute pulmonary embolism in emergency department patients [^a81fa1c4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Severe RV dilation was determined by an absolute RV basal diameter of >41 mm or, relatively, as RV diameter greater than or equal to the LV basal diameter. Severe RV systolic dysfunction was determined by visual estimation, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion less than 10 mm, or interventricular septal position being flat or bending toward the LV base. RV dilatation was considered a requirement for determining RVD. A GDE score was assigned 0 points if no severe RV dilatation was found. A score of 1 point was assigned for severe RV dilatation alone, 2 points were assigned for severe RV dilatation combined with septal deviation or severe RV systolic dysfunction, and 3 points were assigned for severe RV dilatation and both septal deviation and severe RV systolic dysfunction. For this study, RVD was a binary variable and present if GDE score was greater than 0. PE risk stratification was determined using the previously reported PE short-term clinical outcomes risk estimation (PE-SCORE) model, which was developed and validated in the registry database.The 9-variable points model had scores of 0 to 10 points: Low risk of clinical deterioration = 0, intermediate risk = 1 to 4 points, and high risk = 5 to 10 points. For comparison, we provided the numbers and proportions of our study population considered low risk by two other risk stratification tools: the simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index and the European Society of Cardiology Guidelines.

Subsequent rehospitalization was defined as a hospitalization after the index PE hospitalization but within 30 days of PE diagnosis. We considered rehospitalization to be a surrogate for impaired cardiopulmonary functioning or unresolved acute PE-related cardiopulmonary dysfunction.

### The PERT concept: a step-by-step approach to managing pulmonary embolism [^7c853cd8]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major source of morbidity and mortality. The presentation of acute PE varies, ranging from few or no symptoms to sudden death. Patient outcome depends on how well the right ventricle can sustain the increased afterload caused by the embolic burden. Careful risk stratification is critical, and the PE response team (PERT) concept offers a rapid and multidisciplinary approach. Anticoagulation is essential unless contraindicated; thrombolysis, surgical embolectomy, and catheter-directed approaches are also available. Clinical consensus statements have been published that offer a guide to PE management, but areas remain for which the evidence is inadequate. Although the management of low-risk and high-risk patients is more straightforward, optimal management of intermediate-risk patients remains controversial. In this document, we offer a case-based approach to PE management, beginning with diagnosis and risk stratification, followed by therapeutic alternatives, and finishing with follow-up care.

### Reducing the hospital burden associated with the treatment of pulmonary embolism [^fa3b8e52]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

Reassuringly, prospective studies identifying patients with low‐risk PE using a validated clinical prediction rule (PESI) with additional exclusion criteria or using the Hestia exclusion criteria reported low rates of adverse outcomes at 30 or 90 days – the incidences of mortality, recurrent VTE, and major bleeding at 90 days ranged from 0% to 1.5%, 0% to 2.0%, and 0% to 1.8%, respectively 29, 40, 52, 58, 59, 60, 61. Several of the more recent studies have included a high proportion of patients with PE treated as outpatients with DOACs; consistently low rates of outcome events at 90–180 days were reported (Table 3) 27, 58, 60, 62, 63.

Despite current guidelines not advocating routine cardiac evaluation in patients with low‐risk PE, a post hoc analysis of the original Hestia study assessed the utility of RV functional assessment in selecting patients with PE for outpatient treatment and exclusion criteria for three of the most recently completed prospective studies (i.e. the VESTA study, the LoPE study, and MERCURY PE) and the ongoing HotPE trial include evidence of RV functional impairment/damage 58, 60, 64, 65. Of the 275 patients treated as outpatients in the Hestia study, 95 (35%) had evidence of RV dysfunction on a CT angiogram (vs. 59% of the 221 patients treated in hospital) and would have, therefore, been classified as “intermediate risk” by ESC criteria. At the 30‐day follow‐up, two outpatients had died of non‐PE‐related causes one (0.6%) in the subgroup with normal RV function and one (1.1%) in the subgroup with RV dysfunction, suggesting some patients with modest RV dysfunction can be safely treated at home 64 (for comparison, in normotensive patients with Hestia exclusion criteria who were treated in hospital, 3/89 (3.4%) patients with normal RV function died during the same period versus 4/106 (3.8%) patients with RV dysfunction 64). However, other investigators have argued that CT scans used to identify patients with RV dysfunction may overestimate RV strain. This would mean that the risk level is likely to be overestimated in many patients with modest RV dysfunction identified in this manner, and in reality they are actually low‐risk patients 66. In MERCURY PE and the LoPE study, patients with troponin elevation and signs of RV strain on echocardiography, respectively, were excluded. Of the 251 outpatients enrolled in both studies, none died or experienced a recurrent venous thromboembolic event by the 90‐day follow‐up (1 patient in the LoPE study experienced a trauma‐related major bleeding event), demonstrating that low‐risk patients without any evidence of RV damage/dysfunction can be safely treated without hospitalization.

### Guidelines for the echocardiographic assessment of the right heart in adults: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography endorsed by the European association of echocardiography, a registered branch of the European Society of Cardiology, and the Canadian society of echocardiography [^96032b68]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Medium credibility.

Hemodynamic assessment of the right ventricle and pulmonary circulation—estimation methods, formula, and diagnostic thresholds. SPAP can be estimated using TR velocity, PADP from the end-diastolic pulmonary regurgitation velocity, and mean PA pressure from PA acceleration time or derived from systolic and diastolic pressures. RVSP is calculated by the simplified Bernoulli equation, “RVSP = 4(V)^2 + RA pressure,” using peak TR jet velocity with RA pressure estimated from IVC diameter and respiratory changes; in the absence of a pulmonic valve/RVOT gradient, “SPAP is equal to RVSP.” Normal cutoff for invasively measured mean PA pressure is “25 mmHg,” and normal resting values are “a peak TR … of ≤2.8 to 2.9 m/s or a peak systolic pressure of 35 or 36 mm Hg, assuming an RA pressure of 3 to 5 mm Hg.” Further evaluation is recommended for dyspnea with estimated “RVSP ≥ 40 mm Hg,” and some consider “SPAP greater than two thirds of the systemic blood pressure as indicative of severe PH.” Obstruction at the RVOT or pulmonic valve should be excluded when RVSP is elevated.

### Validation of a model for identification of patients at intermediate to high risk for complications associated with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism [^73e41dd9]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Bova score for pulmonary embolism" for pulmonary embolism.

The Bova Score is a clinical calculator used in the management of patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). It is specifically designed to stratify the risk of adverse outcomes in patients diagnosed with PE, including the risk of early death or complications within 30 days of diagnosis. The Bova Score takes into account factors such as age, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and the presence of right ventricular dysfunction or myocardial injury. 

This scoring system is particularly useful in guiding treatment decisions, such as whether a patient requires hospitalization or can be managed as an outpatient, and whether more aggressive therapies are needed. 

The Bova Score is not applicable to patients without a confirmed diagnosis of PE, or those with chronic PE. It should also be used with caution in patients with other severe comorbidities that could independently increase their risk of adverse outcomes.

The Bova score calculator for pulmonary embolism (PE) helps assess the risk of complications and mortality following a PE episode. Using this tool, clinicians evaluate four key clinical parameters. Here's a breakdown of how the scoring works:

Inputs include:
- **Systolic Blood Pressure (BP)**: Two categories are considered—greater than 100 mm Hg and between 90 to 100 mm Hg. A systolic BP less than 90 mm Hg excludes a patient from Bova scoring. For the score, "> 100 mm Hg" assigns 0 points, while "90-100 mm Hg" assigns 2 points.

- **Cardiac Troponin Levels**: This measures cardiac muscle damage. If levels are "Elevated," it contributes 2 points to the score; if "Normal," it adds 0 points.

- **Right Ventricular Dysfunction**: Assessed via echocardiogram or CT scan—options being "Yes" or "No". A finding of dysfunction ("Yes") scores 2 points, while its absence ("No") scores 0 points.

- **Heart Rate (Beats per Minute)**: Heart rate is classified as "< 110" or ">= 110". A rate under 110 receives 0 points, whereas a rate of 110 or more adds 1 point to the score.

The total Bova score is the sum of these individual scores, ranging from 0 to 7. This is then interpreted based on pre-defined risk categories:

- A score of 0-2 indicates a low risk, with a 4.4% chance of PE-related complications and a 3.1% risk of mortality.
- Scores between 3 and 4 suggest a moderate risk, where complications rise to 18%, and mortality risk increases to 6.8%.
- Scores from 5 to 7 denote a high risk, with a 42% likelihood of complications and a 10% risk of mortality.

This scoring procedure empowers healthcare providers to stratify risk levels efficiently in patients experiencing a PE, guiding clinical decision-making and management strategies.

### Thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: a critical appraisal [^3f6533c2]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a prevalent condition that may account for > 300,000 deaths annually in the United States alone. Although thrombolytics have been studied as a treatment for acute PE since the 1960s, to date there have been only 11 randomized controlled trials comparing thrombolytic therapy to conventional anticoagulation, and the numbers of patients included in these trials has been small. Many studies confirm that thrombolytic therapy leads to rapid improvement in hemodynamic aberrations associated with PE, and this approach to massive PE with cardiogenic shock is a guideline-based practice. It is widely accepted that acute PE without associated right ventricular (RV) dysfunction or hemodynamic instability can be readily managed with standard anticoagulation. The appropriate therapy for submassive PE (PE associated with RV dysfunction but preserved systemic arterial BP) remains an area of contention, and definitive data proving mortality benefit in this setting are lacking. Further efforts at risk stratification may better determine who is in need of aggressive therapy. This article reviews historical aspects of and current evidence for thrombolytic therapy in acute PE with specific attention to bleeding risk, and data regarding hemodynamic parameters and mortality. We also discuss risk stratification techniques and propose a clinical algorithm for the incorporation of thrombolytic therapy.

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^61ba761a]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

The InShape III and IV studies also highlight the importance of reviewing the index CTPA at the time of the acute presentation.This should include an assessment for webs, attenuated vessels (which may be difficult to appreciate), enlarged bronchial arteries and mosaic perfusion in addition to features of PH (pulmonary artery size ≥30 mm,right ventricular outflow hypertrophy ≥6 mm and right ventricular:left ventricular ratio ≥1).An echocardiogram is only required in highly selected patients at the time of acute PE; however, if performed, a systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) of >50 mm Hg on echocardiography at the time of acute PE is a risk factor for CTEPH.This reflects an inability of the RV to generate a sPAP >50 mm Hg in the absence of pre-existing pulmonary vascular disease. While CTPA is an excellent test for delineating proximal CTEPH, subtle abnormalities may be missed by radiologists not used to assessing CTEPH.

If CTEPH is suspected, an assessment should be made as to whether the patient is likely to benefit from intervention if CTEPH is confirmed, before proceeding with further investigation. Where CTEPH is suspected and further investigation is appropriate, the 2022 ESC/ERS guidelines recommend an assessment of lung perfusion(nuclear medicine imaging such as single-photon emission CT (SPECT) imaging, CT imaging using dual-energy CT or lung subtraction iodine mapping, or magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion mapping) in combination with an assessment of the likelihood of PH using echocardiography.If perfusion abnormalities are present and the patient has an intermediate or high echocardiographic probability of PH (ie, either tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV) ≥2.9 m/s or TRV ≤2.8 m/s with other echocardiographic signs of PH), referral to a PH centre for further evaluation should be considered.

### Simultaneous pulmonary artery pressure and left ventricle stroke volume assessment predicts adverse events in patients with pulmonary embolism [^7cb934b4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This investigation illustrates the utility of using PASP/LVSV to predict adverse events or the need for employing advanced therapies in patients with acute intermediate‐risk PE. This ratio provides simultaneous information on both right and left heart performance, which is important in the context of obstructive shock from acute PE. RV dysfunction in the context of acute hemodynamically compromising PE ultimately can affect left‐sided cardiac function as illustrated by the decrease in LVOT VTI recently reported and confirmed using our calculation.PASP/LVSV, therefore, is a simple and logical echocardiographic‐derived variable to evaluate interventricular dependence because an increase in the numerator and decrease in the denominator are equally poor prognostic indicators.

In the context of acute PE, PASP/LVSV ≥1.0 mm Hg/mL is associated with a decrease in multiple parameters of RV performance including tricuspid annular systolic excursion, RVOT VTI, RVOT acceleration time, and RV tissue Doppler velocity. We were pleased to see that both LVOT VTI and RVOT VTI, as recently reported, predicted adverse outcomes in patients with intermediate‐risk PE,and predicted the primary end point in this study. This suggests generalizability of these findings, though LVOT VTI and RVOT VTI predicted the outcome less robustly than PASP/LVSV ≥1.0 mm Hg/mL. A notable difference in our investigation is that we evaluated both intermediate‐risk and high‐risk PE, which may be more useful for institutions with a PERT. We also used LVOT VTI as a continuous variable in our prediction model compared with Yuriditsky and colleagues who used a <15 cm VTI cut‐point in a dichotomous model to define low LV oputput. Nonetheless, we draw the same conclusions as these authors.

### Impact of pulmonary hypertension on the outcomes of noncardiac surgery: predictors of perioperative morbidity and mortality [^8c35555f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to determine the predictors of short-term morbidity and mortality (< 30 days) after noncardiac surgery in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH).

Background

Pulmonary hypertension is considered to be a significant preoperative risk factor.

Methods

The PH and surgical data bases were matched from 1991 to 2003. Patients were excluded if PH was secondary to left heart disease, not present before surgery, or the procedure involved cardiopulmonary bypass. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify variables associated with short-term morbidity and mortality.

Results

Of 1,276 patients in the PH database, 145 patients (73% female) met all study criteria. The mean age (+/-SD) was 60.1 +/- 16.0 years. Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) (mean +/- SD) on the two-dimensional echocardiogram was 68 +/- 21 mm Hg. There were 60 patients (42%) who experienced one or more short-term morbid event(s) (1.8 events/patient experiencing any event). A history of pulmonary embolism (p = 0.01), New York Heart Association functional class > or = II (p = 0.02), intermediate- to high-risk surgery (p = 0.04), and duration of anesthesia > 3 h (p = 0.04) were independent predictors of short-term morbidity. There were 10 early deaths (7%). A history of pulmonary embolism (p = 0.04), right-axis deviation (p = 0.02), right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy (p = 0.04), RV index of myocardial performance > or = 0.75 (p = 0.03), RVSP/systolic blood pressure > or = 0.66 (p = 0.01), intraoperative use of vasopressors (p < 0.01), and anesthesia when nitrous oxide was not used (p < 0.01) were each associated with postoperative mortality.

Conclusions

In patients with PH undergoing noncardiac surgery with general anesthesia, specific clinical, diagnostic, and intraoperative factors may predict worse outcomes.

### Prognostic value of the shock index along with transthoracic echocardiography in risk stratification of patients with acute pulmonary embolism [^b2f447e6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The initial clinical presentation and echocardiography have key roles in risk stratification of patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). To assess the value of shock index and echocardiographic abnormalities as predictors of in-hospital complications and mortality, echocardiographic features of 159 patients diagnosed with acute PE were reviewed. A shock index > or =1, independent of echocardiographic findings, was associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Regardless of shock index, moderate to severe right ventricular (RV) hypokinesis and a ratio of RV to left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic diameter >1 was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality and demonstrated the best predictive values for short-term outcomes. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of diastolic LV impairment (E/A wave <1), RV hypokinesis, RV/LV >1, and end-diastolic RV diameter >3 cm for in-hospital mortality were 100%. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) was higher in patients who died before discharge. A cut-off point >50 mm Hg for systolic PAP was significantly associated with increased in-hospital death. In conclusion, among conventional echocardiographic abnormalities attributed to RV dysfunction (E/A wave <1, RV hypokinesis, RV/LV >1, RV end-diastolic diameter >3 cm, and interventricular septal flattening), moderate to severe RV hypokinesis and RV/LV >1 have better predictive values for short-term outcomes of patients with acute PE. In addition, a shock index > or =1 and systolic PAP >50 mm Hg could also be helpful in the triage of these patients.

### Assessment of right ventricular function in the research setting: knowledge gaps and pathways forward. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^8e73dea6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Table 3—key knowledge gaps and solution pathways for right ventricular (RV) function across preclinical models, human studies, and clinical trials emphasize unresolved definitions, modeling, and intervention testing. Key gaps include defining “normal” and “abnormal” RV structure and function and effects of age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status; clarifying how RV development, cardiopulmonary interactions under stress, and critical exposures shape “normal” versus “abnormal” function; determining the impact of existing and novel pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) therapies; improving animal and in vitro models across pulmonary hypertension (PH) groups; and delineating mechanisms of RV dysfunction in acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and which interventions improve RV function. Solution approaches/pathways forward include global replication and validation of a critical set of RV biomarkers across age, sex, race/ethnicity, exercise, and other exposures; studying human RV stem cells; defining a small unique set of RV function biomarkers to quantify load-independent effects of medical and nonmedical PH treatments; developing novel in vivo, in vitro (e.g., “heart on a chip,” induced pluripotent stem cells [iPSCs]), and in silico models that replicate critical aspects of RV failure (RVF) in all PH groups; and prospectively studying mechanisms of RVF and the effects of novel RV-directed therapies (e.g., prone positioning in ARDS) in patient cohorts and animal models of acute and chronic PE and ARDS.

### Usefulness of combined assessment with computed tomographic signs of right ventricular dysfunction and cardiac troponin T for risk stratification of acute pulmonary embolism [^b10db63c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incremental value of combined assessment with computed tomographic (CT) signs of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and cardiac troponin T level for predicting early death or adverse outcomes due to acute pulmonary embolism (PE). One hundred seventy-three non-high-risk patients with acute PE, confirmed by CT pulmonary angiography, were retrospectively evaluated. The area under the curve and hazard ratio of CT signs and troponin T levels were compared for predicting early death or adverse outcomes. Patients were classified into intermediate- and low-risk groups on the basis of CT signs and troponin T levels, and mortality was compared. Seventeen patients (9.8%) died within 3 months. Early mortality of intermediate-risk patients (14% to 19%) was higher than that of low-risk patents (2% to 6%). A ratio of RV volume to left ventricular volume > 1.5 had the highest area under the curve (0.709) and hazard ratio (5.402) for predicting early death. The combination of CT signs and elevated troponin T level had an increased area under the curve and hazard ratio for predicting early death and adverse outcomes compared to those of CT signs or elevated troponin T level alone. In conclusion, the combined assessment of the ratio of RV volume to left ventricular volume and an elevated troponin T level provided incrementally more prognostic information in non-high-risk patients with acute PE compared to the single predictor of CT signs or troponin T level.

Table 4 
Univariable and Multivariable Analysis of 30‐Day Mortality in Strain Parameters

Because the univariable and multivariable models did not include clinical parameters in Tables 3 and 4, we instead created other models that included parameters used to calculate the simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index score, namely age, malignancy, chronic cardiopulmonary disease, heart rate, and systolic BP.In these models, the RV/LV ratio and RVGLS were associated with 30‐day mortality, with statistical significance after adjusting for age, heart rate, and systolic BP (Table S2).

Combination ofand/Ratio for Survival

Based on the findings of the multivariable analyses, we evaluated the combination of RV/LV ratio with RVGLS in identifying risk of short‐term mortality (Figure 3). We used threshold parameters from ROC curves with an RV/LV ratio of 1.03 and RVGLS of 17.7%. Patients with an RV/LV ratio <1.03 had a 30‐day mortality rate of 4.4% compared with 25.3% in those with an RV/LV ratio ≥1.03. By adding RVGLS to the RV/LV ratio, individuals with an RV/LV ratio <1.03 and RVGLS >17.7% identified a population with an even lower mortality at 30 days of 1.0% as opposed to 4.4% using RV/LV ratio alone. Individuals with an RV/LV ratio ≥1.03 and RVGLS ≤17.7% identified a higher risk group for mortality at 30 days of 46.2% as opposed to 25.3% using RV/LV ratio alone.

4.1 ∣ RISK STRATIFICATION WITH EMERGING RISK FACTORS

Risk stratification using PESI scoring places our patient in the low-risk category (class II—84 points for age, history of cancer, and heart rate of ≥110 beats/min). While PESI does include 11 clinical factors to predict 30-day mortality, it does not capture features such as RV strain or positive cardiac biomarkers. The Bova score was derived to evaluate and risk stratify normotensive patients and included just 4 clinical features—systolic blood pressure, elevated cardiac troponin, RV dysfunction based on certain imaging criteria, and heart rate. Calculating the Bova score for our patient places her at intermediate risk (Bova stage II—3 points for RV dysfunction and elevated troponin level), which predicts 6.8% 30-day PE-related mortality, significantly higher than her PESI risk estimation of 1.7% to 3.5% 30-day mortality.

Elevated cardiac troponins are seen in up to 60% of all acute PE patients and have been demonstrated to have increased risk of all-cause mortality even in hemodynamically stable patients. While not particularly sensitive if used in isolation, combining troponin with the clinical scenario and diagnosis of acute PE does improve its diagnostic utility. Similarly, echocardiographic findings may be useful for guidance of risk assessment and triaging for hemodynamically stable patients (Figure 3). Features such as hypokinesis of RV free wall compared with RV apex (McConnell’s sign) may suggest a higher risk of PE-related complications. Other features such as RV pressure overload, noted a systolic septal flattening (D-sign), and RV systolic dysfunction noted as reduced tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion may suggest RV systolic dysfunction. Increased RV dilation suggesting volume/pressure overload can present as RV/LV diameter ≥1.0, evaluated by both CT and echocardiogram. Discovery of intra-cardiac thrombus in transit may also be observed, though this is rare.

### Patient information: pulmonary embolism (...) [^3bb42ab2]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Signs and Symptoms of Pulmonary Embolism Patients with a small PE may experience no symptoms. Larger PEs commonly cause shortness of breath and chest pain. Very large PEs can limit the heart’s ability to deliver blood to the lung, causing low blood pressure, fainting, or death. Risk Factors for Pulmonary Embolism. Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism The first step of diagnosis involves determining the likelihood of PE using a validated scoring system or the clinical opinion of a treating clinician. Patients at low or moderate risk of PE typically undergo blood testing for D-dimer, which is a by-product of blood clotting. If the D-dimer level is low, no further evaluation for PE is needed. An imaging study should be ordered for all patients at high risk of PE and those at low or intermediate risk who have elevated D-dimer. The preferred imaging test is a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram, which uses intravenous contrast to identify blood clots in the pulmonary artery.

The preferred medication for most patients with PE is a direct oral anticoagulant, which includes apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran. Vitamin K antagonist drugs are recommended for patients with certain conditions associated with increased risk of blood clots. Pregnant patients with PE should be treated with low-molecular-weight heparin because this medication does not cause fetal anomalies. Patients at high risk of death from PE without an increased risk of bleeding should receive a clot-dissolving medication. Other treatment options for high-risk PE may include catheter-based therapy or surgery to remove blood clots from the lung. Potential Consequences of Pulmonary Embolism. Some patients develop post-PE syndrome, which may include shortness of breath and decreased health-related quality of life several months after starting anticoagulation.

Approximately 1% to 4% of patients with an acute PE develop chronically elevated pressure in the pulmonary artery. This condition has a mortality rate of 25% to 30% at 3 years, if untreated, but can be cured or improved with surgery.

### Echocardiographic evolution of pulmonary artery pressure after acute pulmonary embolism. results from IPER registry [^d7678674]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

The aim of the study is to describe the course of the echocardiographically measured pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PAsP) in a series of patients included in the Italian Pulmonary Embolism Registry (IPER).

Methods

Patients with confirmed PE received an echo-Doppler evaluation within 24 hours from hospital admission and after one year. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) was considered "likely" , "possible" or "unlikely" with a right ventricular-right atrial (RV-RA) pressure gradient>45 mm Hg, between 32 and 45 mm Hg and ≤31 mm Hg and no additional echocardiographic variables suggestive of PH, respectively.

Results

We studied 286 patients (169 females and 117 males, mean age 67 ± 15; mean follow-up 387 ± 45 days): 240 had a baseline tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and a RV-RA gradient of variable degree. PH was considered likely, unlikely and possible in 97, 93 and 50 patients respectively. At FU echocardiography, 6 patients (2.1%) had a likely PH and all of them were part of the group of 97 patients with a baseline likely PH; 24 patients (8.4%) had a possible PH, and 67% of them had an initial likely PH. No patients with a baseline unlikely PH or without TR developed a follow-up PH (both likely or possible). The probability to show a likely PH at FU echocardiography for patients with a baseline RV-RA gradient>45 mm Hg was 6.2%, while the probability not to have a likely PH for patients with a baseline RV-RA gradient ≤ 45 mm Hg was 100%.

Conclusion

In our study population of patients with acute PE, we observed that those presenting with a baseline echocardiographic RV-RA pressure gradient ≤ 45 mm Hg were completely free from a likely PH after 1-year.

### Prevention of early complications and late consequences after acute pulmonary embolism: focus on reperfusion techniques [^b4e2bdb2]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major cause of acute cardiovascular mortality and long-term morbidity. Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is the key determinant of prognosis in the acute phase of PE, and residual RV dysfunction is associated with the development of post-PE functional impairment, chronic thromboembolic disease, and higher costs of treatment over the long term. Patients with clinically overt RV failure, i.e. hemodynamic collapse at presentation (high-risk PE), necessitate immediate thrombolytic treatment to relieve the obstruction in the pulmonary circulation; surgical or catheter-directed removal of the thrombus can be an alternative option. For patients with a high risk of bleeding or active hemorrhage, or for normotensive patients with intermediate-risk PE, systemic (intravenous) standard-dose thrombolysis is not recommended since the risks of treatment outweigh its benefits. In such cases, rescue thrombolysis should be considered only if hemodynamic decompensation develops while on heparin anticoagulation. For survivors of acute PE, little is known on the possible effects of thrombolytic treatment on the risk of chronic functional and hemodynamic impairment. Catheter-directed, ultrasound-assisted, low-dose thrombolysis leads to recovery of RV dysfunction, and its safety profile appears promising. However, adequately powered prospective trials focusing on both short- and long-term clinical outcomes are needed to establish novel interventional techniques in the treatment of PE.

### Management of massive and submassive pulmonary embolism: focus on recent randomized trials [^674a5bb2]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although early pulmonary revascularization is the treatment of choice for patients with high-risk (massive) pulmonary embolism, it remains controversial in patients with intermediate-risk (submassive) pulmonary embolism until recently. Recent published data on the management of high-risk and intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism patients will be the main focus of this review.

Recent Findings

The PEITHO trial supports the rationale of risk stratification in normotensive patients with pulmonary embolism. Patients with right ventricular dilation on echocardiography and positive cardiac troponin test have a high intermediate risk of complication and death. Thrombolysis prevents hemodynamic collapse in these patients but with an increased risk of major bleeding particularly in older patients (>75 years). Reduced dose of thrombolysis and catheter-based reperfusion with or without fibrinolysis have shown promising results.

Summary

Thrombolysis is the treatment of choice for patients with high-risk pulmonary embolism. Surgical embolectomy is recommended in case of absolute contra-indication to thrombolysis. In patients with acute right ventricular dysfunction on cardiac imaging and myocardial injury, thrombolysis should be considered if they are 75 years or less of age and are at low risk of bleeding. Full-dose thrombolysis may be excessively risky in patients over 75 years. In patients with either RV dilation or elevated cardiac biomarker, thrombolysis is not recommended.

### Shock score for prediction of clinical outcomes among stable patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism [^8c0dba20]. Thrombosis Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The Composite Pulmonary Embolism Shock (CPES) score has been developed to identify normotensive patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and a low cardiac index (referred to as normotensive shock). We aimed to externally assess the validity of this model for predicting a complicated course among hemodynamically stable patients with acute PE.

Methods

Using prospectively collected data from the PROgnosTic valuE of Computed Tomography scan (PROTECT) study, we calculated the CPES score for each patient and the proportion of patients with a score > 3. We calculated the test performance characteristics to predict a complicated course (i.e., death from any cause, hemodynamic collapse, or recurrent PE) and the discriminatory power using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

Results

Sixty-three of the 848 (7.4 %) patients had a complicated course during the 30-day follow-up period. Of the 848 enrolled patients, the CPES score was positive (i.e., score > 3) in 78 (9.2 %). The specificity was 92.1 % (723/785), the positive predictive value was 20.5 % (16/78), and the positive likelihood ratio was 3.22 for a complicated course. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for a complicated course were 0.71 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.78). With the higher score risk classification threshold (cutoff score > 4), the proportion of patients designated as positive was 2.1 %, and the specificity was 98.1 %. When echocardiographic right ventricle (RV) dysfunction was replaced by computed tomographic RV enlargement, the specificity was 85.4 %, the positive predictive value was 14.2 %, and the positive likelihood ratio was 2.06 for a complicated course. When analyses were restricted to the subgroup of patients with intermediate-risk PE, the specificity and the positive predictive value for a complicated course were identical to the overall cohort.

Conclusions

The CPES score has acceptable C-statistic, excellent specificity, and low positive predictive value for identification of hemodynamic deterioration in normotensive patients with PE.

### Assessment of right ventricular strain by computed tomography versus echocardiography in acute pulmonary embolism [^82ce2451]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Right ventricular strain (RVS) identifies patients at risk of hemodynamic deterioration from pulmonary embolism (PE). Our hypothesis was that chest computed tomography (CT) can provide information about RVS analogous to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and that RVS on CT is associated with adverse outcomes after PE.

Methods

Consecutive emergency department patients with acute PE were prospectively enrolled and clinical, biomarker, and imaging data were recorded. CTs were overread by two radiologists. We compared diagnoses of RVS on CT (defined as right ventricle:left ventricle ratio ≥ 0.9 or interventricular septal bowing) to echocardiography (defined as right ventricular hypokinesis, right ventricular dilatation, or interventricular septal bowing). We calculated the test characteristics (with 95% confidence interval) of CT and TTE for a composite outcome of severe clinical deterioration, thrombolysis/thrombectomy, or death within 5 days.

Results

A total of 298 patients were enrolled; 274 had CT and 118 had formal TTE. Of the 104 patients who had both CT and TTE, the mean (±SD) age was 58 (±17) years; 50 (48%) were female and 88 (85%) were Caucasian. Forty-two (40%) had RVS by TTE and 75 (72%) had RVS by CT. CT and TTE agreed on the presence or absence of RVS in 61 (59%) cases (κ = 0.24). Using TTE as criterion standard, the test characteristics of CT for RVS were as follows: sensitivity = 88%, specificity = 39%, positive predictive value = 49%, and negative predictive value = 83%. Fourteen (13%) patients experienced severe clinical deterioration or required hospital-based intervention within 5 days. This occurred in 30% of patients with RVS on both TTE and CT, 20% of patients with RVS on TTE alone, 3% of patients with RVS on CT alone, and 4% of patients without RVS on either modality.

Conclusions

In acute PE, CT is highly sensitive but only moderately specific for RVS compared to TTE. RVS on both CT and TTE predicts more events than either modality alone. TTE confers additional positive prognostic value compared to CT in predicting post-PE clinical deterioration.

### Guidelines for the appropriate use of bedside general and cardiac ultrasonography in the evaluation of critically ill patients-part II: cardiac ultrasonography [^359cb17f]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To establish evidence-based guidelines for the use of bedside cardiac ultrasound, echocardiography, in the ICU and equivalent care sites.

Methods

Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system was used to rank the "levels" of quality of evidence into high (A), moderate (B), or low (C) and to determine the "strength" of recommendations as either strong (strength class 1) or conditional/weak (strength class 2), thus generating six "grades" of recommendations (1A-1B-1C-2A-2B-2C). Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation was used for all questions with clinically relevant outcomes. RAND Appropriateness Method, incorporating the modified Delphi technique, was used in formulating recommendations related to terminology or definitions or in those based purely on expert consensus. The process was conducted by teleconference and electronic-based discussion, following clear rules for establishing consensus and agreement/disagreement. Individual panel members provided full disclosure and were judged to be free of any commercial bias.

Results

Forty-five statements were considered. Among these statements, six did not achieve agreement based on RAND appropriateness method rules (majority of at least 70%). Fifteen statements were approved as conditional recommendations (strength class 2). The rest (24 statements) were approved as strong recommendations (strength class 1). Each recommendation was also linked to its level of quality of evidence and the required level of echo expertise of the intensivist. Key recommendations, listed by category, included the use of cardiac ultrasonography to assess preload responsiveness in mechanically ventilated (1B) patients, left ventricular (LV) systolic (1C) and diastolic (2C) function, acute cor pulmonale (ACP) (1C), pulmonary hypertension (1B), symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) (1C), right ventricular (RV) infarct (1C), the efficacy of fluid resuscitation (1C) and inotropic therapy (2C), presence of RV dysfunction (2C) in septic shock, the reason for cardiac arrest to assist in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (1B-2C depending on rhythm), status in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) (1C), the presence of pericardial effusion (1C), cardiac tamponade (1B), valvular dysfunction (1C), endocarditis in native (2C) or mechanical valves (1B), great vessel disease and injury (2C), penetrating chest trauma (1C) and for use of contrast (1B-2C depending on indication). Finally, several recommendations were made regarding the use of bedside cardiac ultrasound in pediatric patients ranging from 1B for preload responsiveness to no recommendation for RV dysfunction.

Conclusions

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding several class 1 recommendations for the use of bedside cardiac ultrasound, echocardiography, in the ICU. Evidence-based recommendations regarding the appropriate use of this technology are a step toward improving patient outcomes in relevant patients and guiding appropriate integration of ultrasound into critical care practice.

### Simultaneous pulmonary artery pressure and left ventricle stroke volume assessment predicts adverse events in patients with pulmonary embolism [^a6570850]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 336 PERT activations had complete data and 215 met the inclusion criteria. We purposefully excluded patients known to have preexisting pulmonary hypertension, chronic PE, a previous RV infarction, or incomplete evaluation by echocardiography. The median PASP/LVSV cut‐point for distinguishing between groups was 1.0 mm Hg/mL resulting in 103 patients with PASP/LVSV <1.0 mm Hg/mL and 112 patients with PASP/LVSV ≥1.0 mm Hg/mL.

Study Population

Patients with PASP/LVSV <1.0 mm Hg/mL and ≥1.0 mm Hg/mL had similar baseline characteristics, with 52% women and an average patient age of 59±15.5 years as a patient cohort. About one‐half of the patient cohort had a history of cardiopulmonary disease, and one‐third had a history of cancer. PE and concurrent proximal lower extremity deep vein thrombosis comprised 67% of the study population. Saddle PE was identified in 53% of patients (Table 1).

Baseline Patient Characteristics

Clinical Presentation and Risk Stratification

On presentation, there was no difference in baseline hemodynamics including heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure for patients with PASP/LVSV <1.0 mm Hg/mL and PASP/LVSV ≥1.0 mm Hg/mL (Table S1). PASP/LVSV ≥1.0 mm Hg/mL was associated with evidence of increased myocardial strain with elevated NT pro‐BNP (3599 versus 1428 pg/mL, P <0.001) and evidence of decreased organ perfusion with elevated lactate (2.9 versus 1.8 mM, P =0.003) in the setting of acute PE (Figure 1). Myocardial necrosis evaluated by elevated blood TnT was similar between patients with PASP/LVSV <1.0 mm Hg/mL and PASP/LVSV ≥1.0 mm Hg/mL (67.9% versus 60.2%, P =0.24) respectively.

Interrater reliability for the calculated PESI class was very high (Cohen κ = 0.83). Moreover, the calculated value matched the documented PESI score or class in more than 90% of cases (52 of 56) in which PESI score or class was documented by ED clinicians. The Table compares demographic variables and components of the PESI score for low- and high-risk groups.

Figure 1. 
Risk Stratification of Acute Pulmonary Embolisms Diagnosed in the Emergency Department (ED-PEs)

Acute ED-PE cases were divided into low- and high-risk groups based on Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) score or class. As in previous reports, cases were spread fairly evenly among the 5 risk classes. A higher proportion was seen in the highest risk class, reflecting the high acuity and rate of comorbidities in the patient population in this study. The low-risk group was further divided based on the presence or absence of 5 concerning findings on pulmonary embolism–protocol computed tomography (CTPE; ie, findings widely believed to confer higher risk).

### Randomized controlled trial of mechanical thrombectomy with anticoagulation versus anticoagulation alone for acute intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism: primary outcomes from the STORM-PE trial [^6ce872b3]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism (PE) have an elevated right-to-left-ventricular (RV/LV) diameter ratio and are at risk of early clinical decompensation and mortality. Reperfusion therapy aims to rapidly relieve acute RV pressure overload and normalize hemodynamics. STORM-PE is the first reported randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy and evaluate the safety of mechanical thrombectomy (MT), specifically computer assisted vacuum thrombectomy (CAVT) with anticoagulation (AC) compared to AC alone.

Methods

STORM-PE is an international RCT with 1:1 randomization to CAVT with AC or AC alone. Eligible adults had acute onset (symptoms ≤14 days), intermediate-high risk PE, and were normotensive, with an RV≤LV ratio ≥1.0 on computed tomography pulmonary angiography and elevated cardiac biomarkers. The primary endpoint analysis tested for a difference between groups for the change in RV/LV ratio at 48 hours, assessed by a blinded independent imaging core laboratory. Secondary endpoints included major adverse events (MAE) within 7 days (a composite of clinical deterioration necessitating rescue therapy, PE-related mortality, symptomatic recurrent PE, and major bleeding), adjudicated by an external clinical events committee. Additional outcomes included change in vital signs and core lab assessed PA obstruction at 48 hours.

Results

A total of 100 patients enrolled across 22 sites were randomized to CAVT (N=47) or AC alone (N=53). Baseline characteristics were comparable between arms. At 48 hours, mean reduction in RV/LV ratio was greater for CAVT (0.52±0.37) than AC (0.24±0.40), a difference of 0.27 (95% CI, 0.12, 0.43; P <0.001). Refined modified and modified Miller score exhibited greater changes for CAVT than AC at 48 hours ( P <0.001). Early normalization of vital signs within 48 hours was more frequent after CAVT. The MAE rate within 7 days was not different between groups (CAVT 4.3% vs AC 7.5%, P =0.681). Two PE-related deaths occurred in the CAVT arm.

Conclusions

CAVT was superior to AC alone in reducing RV/LV ratio within 48 hours in intermediate-high risk PE patients, accompanied by earlier normalization of vital signs and comparable MAE rates to AC.

### Additive value of right ventricular global longitudinal strain to a conventional echocardiographic parameter to improve prognostic value in intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism [^e182d2e9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic Findings

Baseline echocardiographic parameters are shown in Table 2. Left ventricular end‐diastolic diameter, RV/LV ratio, RVFAC, TAPSE, RV S′, and RVFAC/SPAP were significantly different when comparing nonsurvivors to survivors at 30 days. Right‐sided strain parameters were feasible in the vast majority of patients (230 patients had acceptable RV strain measurements; 91.6%). Twenty‐one patients (8.4%) were not measurable for RV strain because of poor image quality or suboptimal strain traces. Comparing those where RV strain could and could not be measured, there were no differences in baseline clinical characteristics or echocardiographic parameters (Table S1). RA strain was measured in 222 patients (88.4%). RVGLS, RVFWS, and RA strain were significantly reduced in nonsurvivors compared with survivors.

Table 2 
Baseline Echocardiographic Parameters in Survivors and Nonsurvivors Within 30 Days

Echocardiographic Parameters for Survival

To identify an independent prognostic factor, univariable and multivariable analyses were performed. The univariable analysis in conventional echocardiographic parameters showed RV/LV ratio, RVFAC, TAPSE, and RV S′ were associated with 30‐day mortality. RVFAC/SPAP had a nonsignificant trend toward 30‐day mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.392 [95% CI, 0.143–1.070]; P =0.068). However, on multivariable analysis using the parameters mentioned above, only RV/LV ratio was independently associated with 30‐day mortality (OR, 1.490 [95% CI, 1.120–1.990]; P =0.007) (Table 3). The variance inflation factors of the 3 parameters were <2, which showed that there was no strong evidence of a multicollinearity problem among the variables. Given the findings on multivariable analysis, further evaluation of RV/LV ratio was performed. ROC curve analysis demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.794 for assessing 30‐day mortality (Figure 2A). Using the ROC curve, we identified a threshold value of 1.03 for the RV/LV ratio, which provided a balanced sensitivity and specificity of 76.7% and 68.9%, respectively, for 30‐day mortality. This RV/LV ratio demonstrated a positive predictive value of 25.3% and a negative predictive value of 94.9%.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^d72d989a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE)—high pretest probability: For patients with high pretest probability of PE according to either clinician gestalt or a clinical prediction tool, imaging studies should be performed. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the preferred method of diagnosis when it is available and there is no contraindication to radiographic contrast dye. Ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) lung scanning should be used when CTPA is unavailable or contraindicated. Of note, a D-dimer assay should not be obtained in patients with a high pretest probability of PE because a negative value will not obviate the need for imaging.

### Right ventricular echocardiographic parameters are associated with mortality after acute pulmonary embolism [^4378f370]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Low credibility.

Background

There is limited information on the utility of certain echocardiographic measurements, such as right ventricular (RV) strain analysis, in predicting mortality in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE).

Methods

A total of 211 patients with acute PE admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU) were retrospectively identified. Echocardiographic variables were prospectively measured in this cohort. The focus was on ICU, hospital, and long-term mortality.

Results

The mean age was 61 ± 15 years. Median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IV and simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index scores were 60 (interquartile range, 40-71) and 2 (interquartile range, 1-2), respectively. Thirty-eight patients (18%) died during the sentinel hospitalization (13% died in the ICU). A total of 61 patients (28.9%) died during a median follow-up period of 15 months (interquartile range, 5-26 months). The echocardiographic variables associated with long-term mortality (from PE diagnosis) were ratio of RV to left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (hazard ratio [HR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-4.8), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.31-0.92), and RV-right atrial gradient (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.4). ICU mortality was associated with ratio of RV to LV end-diastolic diameter (HR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.3-15), RV systolic pressure (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (HR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.18-0.9), and inferior vena cava collapsibility < 50% (HR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.7-11). These variables remain significantly associated with mortality after adjusting by Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IV score, Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index score, or the use of thrombolytic agents. RV strain parameters were not correlated with hospital or long-term mortality.

Conclusions

Four simple parameters that measure different aspects of the right ventricle (ratio of RV to left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, RV systolic pressure, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, and inferior vena cava collapsibility) were independently associated with mortality in patients presenting with acute PE who were admitted to the ICU.

### Additive value of right ventricular global longitudinal strain to a conventional echocardiographic parameter to improve prognostic value in intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism [^6eefd56d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 4 
Kaplan‐Meier curves depicting survival of patients with intermediate‐risk PE.

Kaplan‐Meier curves of patients with intermediate‐risk PE with RVGLS and RV/LV ratio available at baseline. The patient population was divided into 4 groups based on the best cutoff values of 17.7% in RVGLS and 1.03 in RV/LV ratio analyzed by ROC curves. Kaplan‐Meier analysis showed significant differences among the 4 groups. PE indicates pulmonary embolism; ROC, receiver operating characteristic; RVGLS, right ventricular global longitudinal strain; and RV/LV ratio, right to left ventricular end‐diastolic diameter ratio.

The AUC of the multivariate ROC was significantly greater for RVGLS with RV/LV ratio compared with RV/LV ratio alone (0.869 versus 0.794, P =0.015). The AUC of the multivariable ROC was also greater for RVGLS with RV/LV ratio compared with RVGLS alone, although the difference was not significant (0.869 versus 0.855, P =0.430) (Figure S2).

### Effective risk stratification in pulmonary embolism: evaluating current tools and identifying research gaps [^b812fbf4]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently, most international guidelines advocate for risk stratification of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) as a framework to guide treatment decisions. Key prognostic factors for patients with PE include clinical presentation, comorbidities, (imaging) biomarkers and haemodynamic status. The most widely used risk stratification algorithm, outlined in the 2019 European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society guidelines, classifies patients with PE into high-risk (massive), (high or low) intermediate-risk (submassive) and low-risk (nonmassive) categories. It is well established that the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality, increases with each escalating risk level. However, substantial variation remains among leading international guidelines regarding risk stratification and corresponding treatment recommendations. This inconsistency stems from a lack of grade/level 1A evidence (i.e. strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence) to guide treatment decisions for certain PE risk profiles. In the coming years, ongoing randomised trials comparing novel reperfusion strategies with the current standard of care may reshape risk stratification. If successful, the selection criteria for these studies could lay the foundation for improved risk categories.This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of existing risk stratification algorithms and their associated treatment recommendations, identify knowledge gaps and outline future research priorities.

### Intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism: echocardiography predictors of clinical deterioration [^a9f57109]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

We determine the predictive value of transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) metrics for clinical deterioration within 5 days in adults with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism (PE).

Methods

This was a prospective observational study of intermediate-risk PE patients. To determine associations of TTE and clinical predictors with clinical deterioration, we used univariable analysis, Youden's index for optimal thresholds, and multivariable analyses to report odds ratios (ORs) or area under the curve (AUC).

Results

Of 306 intermediate-risk PE patients, 115 (37.6%) experienced clinical deterioration. PE patients who had clinical deterioration within 5 days had greater baseline right ventricle (RV) dilatation and worse systolic function than the group without clinical deterioration as indicated by the following: RV basal diameter 4.46±0.77 versus 4.20±0.77 cm; RV/LV basal width ratio 1.14±0.29 versus 1.02±0.24; tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) 1.56±0.55 versus 1.80±0.52 cm; and RV systolic excursion velocity 10.40±3.58 versus 12.1±12.5 cm/s, respectively. Optimal thresholds for predicting clinical deterioration were: RV basal width 3.9 cm (OR 2.85 [1.64, 4.97]), RV-to-left ventricle (RV/LV) ratio 1.08 (OR 3.32 [2.07, 5.33]), TAPSE 1.98 cm (OR 3.3 [2.06, 5.3]), systolic excursion velocity 10.10 cm/s (OR 2.85 [1.75, 4.63]), and natriuretic peptide 190 pg/mL (OR 2.89 [1.81, 4.62]). Significant independent predictors were: transient hypotension 6.1 (2.2, 18.9), highest heart rate 1.02 (1.00, 1.03), highest respiratory rate 1.02 (1.00, 1.04), and RV/LV ratio 1.29 (1.14, 1.47). By logistic regression and random forest analyses, AUCs were 0.80 (0.73, 0.87) and 0.78 (0.70, 0.85), respectively.

Conclusions

Basal RV, RV/LV ratio, and RV systolic function measurements were significantly different between intermediate-risk PE patients grouped by subsequent clinical deterioration.

### Assessment of right ventricular function in the research setting: knowledge gaps and pathways forward. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^6c251410]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Assessment of inflammation in right ventricular failure (RVF)—rationale, current knowledge, gaps, and pathways forward: Inflammation is an integral contributor to the development of both acute and chronic RVF, and strategies aimed at decreasing RV inflammation may prevent or delay the progression from adaptive to maladaptive RV remodeling and result in improved outcomes; monitoring RV inflammation may serve as a “biomarker” of RV function and/or treatment response. Inflammation, among other processes, likely contributes to RV fibrosis and contractile dysfunction, with influx of inflammatory cells and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules observed rapidly (within 2 h) after onset of right ventricular pressure overload (RVPO), an influx of neutrophils and M1 macrophages in the RV outflow tract within 18 hours in animal pulmonary embolism (PE) models, and secretory M2 macrophages predominating 6 weeks after acute RVPO; in chronic RVPO, abundant proinflammatory cytokine expression is noted, although the degree of inflammation appears to be less than in RVF from acute RVPO. Key knowledge gaps include that whether inflammation is a cause or a consequence of RVF is unknown and that initiators of RV inflammation and links to fibrosis, apoptosis, and metabolic dysfunction need to be identified; a better understanding of effects of established and novel pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) therapies and specific antiinflammatory strategies on acute and chronic RV inflammation is needed. Pathways for progress include further characterization of inflammatory processes in the RV using biopsy and novel imaging.
