## Question

why vitamin b12

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why vitamin B12 is important, what it does in the body, who is at risk of deficiency, how to diagnose and treat it, and what the evidence shows for off-label uses like pain, cognition, and stroke prevention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core physiology and biochemical roles of B12. Then, I should verify the clinical consequences of deficiency and who gets it. Next, I will review how to diagnose it accurately, including when to use MMA and holotranscobalamin. After that, I need to compare treatment options and dosing by scenario, including oral versus intramuscular therapy and special populations. Finally, I will examine the evidence for non-deficiency indications and synthesize a practical answer with safety considerations and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the core physiology. Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble cobalamin that functions as a cofactor for two critical enzymes: methionine synthase, which remethylates homocysteine to methionine and regenerates tetrahydrofolate, and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which converts methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA in mitochondrial metabolism. These reactions underpin DNA synthesis, methylation, and mitochondrial energy production, and explain why deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia and neurotoxicity.

> Wait, let me verify the absorption pathway because most deficiency is malabsorptive. B12 is released from food proteins in the stomach, binds intrinsic factor, and is absorbed in the terminal ileum via cubilin–amnionless receptors; a small fraction is absorbed by passive diffusion, which becomes clinically relevant at high oral doses, and the liver stores about 2–3 mg, enough to last years before deficiency manifests clinically [^115GTMDr] [^114Ru4BF].

> I will now examine the clinical consequences of deficiency. Hematologically, impaired DNA synthesis leads to megaloblastic anemia with macrocytosis and hypersegmented neutrophils. Neurologically, demyelination and axonal degeneration cause symmetric neuropathy, ataxia, paresthesias, and subacute combined degeneration, and prolonged deficiency beyond about three months risks irreversible spinal cord injury, so I need to ensure timely recognition and treatment [^114Ru4BF] [^112C48BN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prevalence without context. Subclinical B12 deficiency is common, especially in older adults, with estimates ranging from roughly 2.5% to over 20% depending on definitions and biomarkers; clinical deficiency is less frequent but can occur at any age, with higher risk in older adults, strict vegetarians, and people with malabsorption or after bariatric surgery [^113VrFbh] [^112Tv4yo].

> Next, I should review who is at risk and why. Risk groups include older adults due to atrophic gastritis and hypochlorhydria, individuals with pernicious anemia or ileal disease, those on metformin or proton pump inhibitors, post-bariatric patients, strict vegans, and people with alcohol use disorder. I should double-check that these align with guideline summaries and primary care recommendations, which they do [^1159x2yR] [^112FxXC7].

> Let me think about diagnosis carefully, because serum B12 alone is imperfect. Initial testing with serum B12 is reasonable, but if results are borderline or clinical suspicion is high, I should confirm with methylmalonic acid and possibly homocysteine, and consider holotranscobalamin, the active B12 fraction, to improve specificity. Relying on a single test courts misclassification, so combining markers is prudent in equivocal cases [^115wscRB] [^117XBUaq] [^116cZtCK].

> I should confirm treatment principles before choosing a route. The therapeutic goals are to reverse metabolic abnormalities and prevent or halt neurologic injury; in the absence of neurologic involvement, high-dose oral cyanocobalamin is efficacious and cost-effective, whereas severe deficiency or neurologic symptoms warrant intramuscular therapy for faster repletion, with subsequent transition to oral maintenance when stable [^1142nVEF] [^1159x2yR].

> Now, let me detail oral therapy and dosing. For uncomplicated deficiency, 1,000–2,000 mcg of oral cyanocobalamin daily achieves hematologic and neurologic responses comparable to intramuscular therapy because passive diffusion at high doses overcomes intrinsic factor loss. Typical maintenance after correction is 50–150 mcg daily, with periodic reassessment of B12 status and symptoms [^1155La4y] [^1142nVEF].

> I need to check intramuscular regimens and maintenance. Standard adult protocols use 100 mcg IM or SC daily for 6–7 days, then every other day for 7 doses if there is a response, then every 3–4 days for 2–3 weeks, followed by monthly 100 mcg maintenance. This schedule balances rapid repletion with practical long-term care and is supported by FDA labeling and hematology guidance [^116FaFV4] [^112AYQCp].

> But wait, what about special populations and formulations. After bariatric surgery, lifelong B12 supplementation is required and many patients need 1,000 mcg orally daily or periodic IM therapy. In smokers or those with suspected cyanide exposure risk, hydroxocobalamin is preferred because it is a cyanide scavenger. In patients with impaired renal function, high-dose cyanocobalamin may worsen renal outcomes, so methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin should be favored for stroke prevention trials and clinical use when feasible [^notfound] [^112cAgSs] [^1158dRUR].

> Hold on, I should verify safety and monitoring. During early therapy for severe megaloblastic anemia, hypokalemia and thrombocytosis can occur, so I should monitor potassium and reticulocyte response. Folate should be corrected if low, but indiscriminate folate without B12 can mask hematologic signs while allowing neurologic damage to progress. Anaphylaxis to parenteral B12 is rare but reported, and cobalt sensitivity is a contraindication [^112C48BN] [^113xG8Vs] [^114ts34c].

> Let me consider non-deficiency indications, starting with pain. Narrative and systematic reviews suggest that high-dose B12, particularly methylcobalamin, may have analgesic and neuroregenerative effects in neuropathic pain and low back pain, and that B12 combined with NSAIDs can augment analgesia. However, evidence quality is limited, optimal dosing is uncertain, and B12 should be considered adjunctive rather than monotherapy for pain [^115Qvpi4] [^11614bhB] [^116RxBV3].

> I should double-check the cognitive data before implying benefit. Cochrane reviews and observational syntheses show no consistent benefit of B12 alone for preventing or treating cognitive decline in unselected populations, though lowering homocysteine with B vitamins may slow brain changes in predisposed individuals; high-dose B12 treatment does not prevent dementia in large registry analyses, so routine B12 supplementation for cognition is not supported outside of treating deficiency [^115HszUP] [^116v4XQe] [^115TkyxL].

> Next, I should review stroke prevention evidence and be precise about nuance. B-vitamin therapy that includes folate and B12 lowers homocysteine by about 25% and reduces stroke risk by roughly 10% overall, but high-dose cyanocobalamin in patients with impaired renal function appears harmful and negates benefit; therefore, in stroke prevention contexts, methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin should be preferred when renal function is reduced, and regional folate fortification status modifies expected benefit [^1158dRUR] [^1168gW2g] [^114Szwmg].

> Let me reconsider pregnancy-related data to avoid overstatement. Supplementation during pregnancy improves maternal and infant B12 status and may reduce maternal deficiency, but randomized trials have not shown clear improvements in maternal anemia or consistent benefits for offspring neurodevelopment, so routine supplementation is reasonable for deficient or at-risk mothers rather than universal prophylaxis for all pregnancies [^115CSFRK].

> I should confirm that I have addressed the original question succinctly. Vitamin B12 is essential because it is a non-negotiable cofactor for methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, thereby enabling DNA synthesis, methylation, and mitochondrial energy metabolism. Deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia and potentially irreversible neurologic injury, which is why timely diagnosis using B12 with confirmatory MMA and holotranscobalamin when needed, and treatment with high-dose oral or intramuscular therapy based on severity and cause, are critical to prevent morbidity [^115UB1L8] [^114Ru4BF] [^1142nVEF].

---

Vitamin B12 is essential for **DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, and neurological function**. Deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia and irreversible nerve damage [^116keXef], so early detection and treatment are critical [^112C48BN]. B12 is found only in animal products or fortified foods; **strict vegetarians, older adults, and people with malabsorption** are at highest risk [^113VrFbh]. Diagnosis relies on serum B12 with confirmatory MMA/homocysteine [^115wscRB]; management is oral high-dose B12 for most, with IM therapy for severe deficiency or malabsorption [^1142nVEF] [^1155La4y]. Routine supplementation is not recommended without deficiency, but targeted use can improve outcomes in at-risk groups [^1176UBAg].

## Physiological functions of vitamin B12

Vitamin B12 is a **water-soluble vitamin** with two active coenzyme forms — methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin — that drive key metabolic processes [^115UB1L8]:

- **DNA synthesis**: Essential for thymidine and purine synthesis, enabling cell division and growth [^115UB1L8].
- **Red blood cell formation**: Required for erythropoiesis; deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia [^112mSydP].
- **Neurological function**: Involved in myelin synthesis and maintenance; deficiency causes demyelination and neuropsychiatric symptoms [^114Ru4BF].
- **Methylation reactions**: Supports methionine synthase and one-carbon metabolism, influencing epigenetics and neurotransmitter synthesis [^115UB1L8].

---

## Sources of vitamin B12

Vitamin B12 is **found almost exclusively in animal-derived foods** or fortified products:

| **Food source** | **Vitamin b12 content (mcg per serving)** |
|-|-|
| Liver (beef) | 70.7 mcg per 3 oz |
| Clams | 84.1 mcg per 3 oz |
| Fish (salmon, trout) | 2.4–5.4 mcg per 3 oz |
| Meat (beef, lamb) | 1.4–2.6 mcg per 3 oz |
| Dairy products (milk, cheese) | 0.4–1.2 mcg per serving |
| Eggs | 0.5–0.6 mcg per large egg |
| Fortified cereals | 1.5–6.0 mcg per serving |

---

Strict vegetarians and vegans are at **high risk of deficiency** and should consume fortified foods or supplements [^113VrFbh] [^1132UHzp].

---

## Causes of vitamin B12 deficiency

Deficiency arises from **insufficient intake, malabsorption, or impaired utilization**:

- **Dietary insufficiency**: Strict vegan diets without supplementation [^112C48BN].
- **Malabsorption**: Pernicious anemia, atrophic gastritis, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, pancreatic insufficiency, bariatric surgery [^1137RxyH] [^112Tv4yo].
- **Impaired utilization**: Genetic disorders (e.g. cobalamin C defect), medications (metformin, PPIs) [^114yJooG].

---

## Clinical manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency

Deficiency presents with **hematological, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms**:

- **Hematological**: Megaloblastic anemia, macrocytosis, hypersegmented neutrophils, pancytopenia [^1145f2Y4].
- **Neurological**: Peripheral neuropathy, subacute combined degeneration, ataxia, paresthesia, cognitive impairment, dementia [^114Ru4BF].
- **Psychiatric**: Depression, irritability, psychosis, memory loss [^1145f2Y4].

---

## Diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency

Diagnosis combines **clinical suspicion with laboratory testing**:

- **Initial test**: Serum total B12; low levels suggest deficiency [^1144XkED].
- **Confirmatory tests**: Methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine; elevated levels indicate functional deficiency [^116QR9MP].
- **Advanced tests**: Holotranscobalamin (active B12) for early deficiency detection [^116cZtCK].

---

## Treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency

Treatment depends on severity, cause, and patient factors:

- **Oral supplementation**: High-dose oral cyanocobalamin (1,000–2,000 mcg daily) is effective for most patients, including those with pernicious anemia [^1155La4y] [^111tiPE5].
- **Intramuscular injection**: Preferred for severe deficiency, neurological symptoms, or malabsorption; typical regimen is 100 mcg IM daily for 1 week, then weekly until hematologic remission, then monthly maintenance [^112FxXC7] [^112AYQCp].
- **Nasal spray**: Alternative for maintenance therapy (500 mcg weekly) [^1149ZCYz].

---

## Prevention of vitamin B12 deficiency

Prevention focuses on **diet, supplementation, and monitoring**:

- **Dietary intake**: Encourage consumption of animal products or fortified foods [^113VrFbh].
- **Supplementation**: Recommended for strict vegetarians, older adults, pregnant/lactating women, and patients on metformin or PPIs [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: Regular B12 assessment in high-risk populations (elderly, post-bariatric surgery, chronic metformin/PPI use) [^1142nVEF].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Elderly**: Increased prevalence due to malabsorption; routine screening and supplementation advised [^113VrFbh].
- **Pregnant/lactating women**: Higher requirements; supplementation recommended to prevent maternal and neonatal deficiency [^115CSFRK].
- **Patients with chronic diseases**: Diabetes, CKD, and gastrointestinal disorders increase risk; individualized supplementation advised [^1145f2Y4] [^112pCC4S].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of supplementation

Vitamin B12 is generally safe; however, **rare hypersensitivity reactions** can occur, particularly with parenteral therapy [^113xG8Vs]. High-dose cyanocobalamin may accelerate renal decline in patients with impaired renal function, so methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin should be considered in CKD [^1158dRUR]. Excess folic acid can mask hematologic signs of B12 deficiency, allowing neurological damage to progress unchecked [^112C48BN].

---

## Current research and controversies

Current debates include the **formulation choice** — cyanocobalamin versus methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin — particularly in patients with renal impairment [^1158dRUR]. Evidence for B12 supplementation in stroke prevention is mixed, with potential harm from high-dose cyanocobalamin in CKD [^1168gW2g]. The role of B12 in cognitive function and dementia remains under investigation, with no definitive benefits established to date [^115TkyxL].

---

Vitamin B12 is **essential for hematologic and neurologic health**; deficiency is preventable and treatable with diet, supplementation, and monitoring.

### Vitamin B12 transport from food to the body's cells – a sophisticated, multistep pathway [^115GTMDr]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B(12) (B(12); also known as cobalamin) is a cofactor in many metabolic processes; deficiency of this vitamin is associated with megaloblastic anaemia and various neurological disorders. In contrast to many prokaryotes, humans and other mammals are unable to synthesize B(12). Instead, a sophisticated pathway for specific uptake and transport of this molecule has evolved. Failure in the gastrointestinal part of this pathway is the most common cause of nondietary-induced B(12) deficiency disease. However, although less frequent, defects in cellular processing and further downstream steps in the transport pathway are also known culprits of functional B(12) deficiency. Biochemical and genetic approaches have identified novel proteins in the B(12) transport pathway — now known to involve more than 15 gene products — delineating a coherent pathway for B(12) trafficking from food to the body's cells. Some of these gene products are specifically dedicated to B(12) transport, whereas others embrace additional roles, which explains the heterogeneity in the clinical picture of the many genetic disorders causing B(12) deficiency. This Review describes basic and clinical features of this multistep pathway with emphasis on gastrointestinal transport of B(12) and its importance in clinical medicine.

PRECAUTIONS

General Precautions: Vitamin B12deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B1 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B, irreversible damage will result.

Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis.

Information for Patients: Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B12for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration.

A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B12. Patients following such a diet should be advised to take oral vitamin B12regularly. The need for vitamin B12is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency in patients undergoing bariatric surgery: preventive strategies and key recommendations [^112Tv4yo]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Advances in bariatric surgery have brought about a paradigm shift in the management of obesity, with benefits extending beyond weight loss. However, nutritional deficiencies are an inherent problem in the postoperative period and often require lifelong supplementation. Vitamin B12, also referred to as cobalamin, is one of the most common micronutrient deficiencies affecting this population. This review explores the pathophysiology of cobalamin deficiency in patients undergoing bariatric surgery and provides an overview of the effectiveness of various available vitamin B12 formulations.

Methods

To identify the relevant literature, a systematic review of MEDLINE was conducted from the earliest dates through September 2012 for English-language articles describing the prevention and management of vitamin B12 deficiency in patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

Results

Intramuscular vitamin B12 continues to be the gold standard of therapy for vitamin B12 deficiency, especially in symptomatic patients. In select patients with asymptomatic vitamin B12 deficiency after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), high-dose oral cyanocobalamin should be given a consideration, especially when there are concerns with the adherence to intramuscular therapy or if compliance comes into question. Unlike patients post-RYGB, those undergoing restrictive procedures such as gastric banding and sleeve gastrectomy may be maintained postoperatively on a lower-dose daily vitamin B12 supplementation. Efficacy data of nasal and sublingual routes for maintenance therapy is currently awaited.

Conclusion

Patients undergoing bariatric surgery must be continuously educated on proper nutrition, the risk of developing significant vitamin B12 deficiency, and the role of supplements in avoiding catastrophic consequences.

### Subclinical cobalamin deficiency [^116v4XQe]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on recent developments and controversies in the diagnosis, consequences, and management of subclinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD), which affects many elderly persons.

Recent Findings

Diagnosis of SCCD depends exclusively on biochemical tests whose individual limitations suggest that combinations of tests are needed, especially in epidemiologic research. The causes of SCCD are unknown in more than 60% of cases, which limits prognostic predictions and identification of health consequences. After years of varying, often inconclusive associations, new clinical trials suggest that homocysteine reduction by high doses of folic acid, cobalamin, and pyridoxine may reduce progression of structural brain changes and cognitive impairment, especially in predisposed individuals. The causative or contributory roles, if any, of SCCD itself in cognitive dysfunction require direct study. If the findings are confirmed, high-dose supplementation with three vitamins will probably be more effective than fortification of the diet.

Summary

The story of SCCD, which is severalfold times more common in the elderly than clinical cobalamin deficiency but also differs from it in arising only infrequently from severe malabsorption and thus being less likely to progress, continues to evolve. Preventive benefits need to be confirmed and expanded, and will require fuller understanding of SCCD pathophysiology, natural history, and health consequences.

Instruct patients to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms of neuropathy develop. Reassess cobalamin levels after 3 months, and obtain second-line tests if there is no improvement.

### B vitamins for stroke prevention [^115jFEPU]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Supplementation with B vitamins (vitamin B 9 (folic acid), vitamin B 12 and vitamin B 6) lowers blood total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations by about 25% and reduces the relative risk of stroke overall by about 10% (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99) compared with placebo. Homocysteine-lowering interventions have no significant effect on myocardial infarction, death from any cause or adverse outcomes. Factors that appear to modify the effect of B vitamins on stroke risk include low folic acid status, high tHcy, high cyanocobalamin dose in patients with impaired renal function and concurrent antiplatelet therapy. In regions with increasing levels or established policies of population folate supplementation, evidence from observational genetic epidemiological studies and randomised controlled clinical trials is concordant in suggesting an absence of benefit from lowering of homocysteine with folic acid for prevention of stroke. Clinical trials indicate that in countries which mandate folic acid fortification of food, folic acid supplementation has no significant effect on reducing stroke risk (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.23). However, in countries without mandatory folic acid food fortification, folic acid supplementation reduces the risk of stroke by about 15% (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.94). Folic acid alone or in combination with minimal cyanocobalamin (≤ 0.05 mg/day) is associated with an even greater reduction in risk of future stroke by 25% (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.86), whereas the combination of folic acid and a higher dose of cyanocobalamin (≥ 0.4 mg/day) is not associated with a reduced risk of future stroke (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.05). The lack of benefit of folic acid plus higher doses of cyanocobalamin (≥ 0.4 mg/day) was observed in trials which all included participants with chronic kidney disease. Because metabolic B 12 deficiency is very common and usually not diagnosed, future randomised trials of homocysteine-lowering interventions for stroke prevention should probably test a combination of folic acid and methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin instead of cyanocobalamin, and perhaps vitamin B 6.

### Vitamin BSupplementation in psychiatric practice [^111paz3w]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Vitamin B 12 (B12, cobalamin) deficiency has been associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms, suggesting a role for B12 supplementation both as a treatment for psychiatric symptoms due to B12 deficiency and as an augmentation strategy for pharmacological treatments of psychiatric disorders. This critical review discusses the major causes of B12 deficiency, the range of psychiatric and non-psychiatric manifestations of B12 deficiency, the indications for testing B12 levels, and the evidence for B12 supplementation for major psychiatric disorders.

Recent Findings

We find that high-quality evidence shows no benefit to routine B12 supplementation for mild depressive symptoms or to prevent depression. There is very limited evidence on the role of B12 supplementation to augment antidepressants. No high-quality evidence to date suggests a role for routine B12 supplementation in any other major psychiatric disorder. No formal guidelines indicate when clinicians should test B12 levels for common psychiatric symptoms, in the absence of major risk factors for deficiency or cardinal symptoms of deficiency. No robust evidence currently supports routine B12 supplementation for major psychiatric disorders. However, psychiatrists should be aware of the important risk factors for B12 deficiency and should be able to identify symptoms of B12 deficiency, which requires prompt testing, medical workup, and treatment. Testing for B12 deficiency should be considered for atypical or severe psychiatric presentations.

### Oral or intramuscular vitamin B12? [^116keXef]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin B(12) deficiency is common, becoming more so with age, and estimates of its population prevalence have ranged from 1.5% to 15%. If untreated, it can lead to megaloblastic anaemia and irreversible neurological complications. In the UK, the usual treatment is regular intramuscular injections of hydroxocobalamin. High-dose oral vitamin B(12) replacement is standard practice in some other countries and less costly. Here we review issues around adopting an oral vitamin B(12) replacement regimen more widely in the UK.

### B vitamins for stroke prevention [^115yrPyP]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Epidemiological studies report an independent, triangular association between MTHFR genotype, high tHcy and increased risk of stroke. RCTs show that B vitamin supplementation (vitamin B 9 (folic acid), vitamin B 12 and vitamin B6) lowers tHcy by about 25% and reduces the relative risk of stroke overall by about 10% compared with placebo.

Factors that appear to modify the effect of B vitamins on stroke risk include low folic acid status, high tHcy (and hence low B 12), high cyanocobalamin dose in patients with impaired renal function and concurrent antiplatelet therapy.

For patients with ischaemic stroke in whom the underlying cause is uncertain (ie, cryptogenic) after standard evaluation, it is recommended that tHcy be measured as part of the advanced evaluation.

If tHcy is raised, potential cause(s) of the hyperhomocysteinaemia (box 1) should be sought from the clinical assessment and measurement of renal function, thyroid function, glycated haemoglobin and holotranscobalamin or methylmalonic acid in the blood, and treated if possible.

If the cause of the hyperhomocysteinaemia remains unexplained and persistent, measurement of possible genetic determinants (eg, MTHFR) is indicated and daily supplementation with 0.5 mg folic acid and about 0.5 mg vitamin B 12 is recommended. This combination would be expected to reduce tHcy by about a quarter to a third (eg, from about 12 umol/L to 8–9 umol/L). While vitamin B 12 can be administered as cyanocobalamin in patients with normal renal function, it is recommended that vitamin B 12 be administered as methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin, particularly in patients with impaired renal function.

Any future trials of B vitamins for stroke prevention in regions without folic acid fortification should endeavour to determine whether the relative effects of B vitamin supplementation in reducing stroke risk are consistent throughout the range of baseline tHcy concentrations, or whether there is a threshold tHcy level below which B vitamins become ineffective (eg, as also for blood pressure-lowering and cholesterol-lowering).

Regarding medical management for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin B12 supplementation, without neurological involvement, ASMBS 2017 guidelines recommend to initiate vitamin B12 supplementation of 1,000 mcg/day to achieve normal levels in post-bariatric surgery patients with vitamin B12 deficiency, and then resume dosages recommended to maintain normal levels.

### Synopsis of the 2020 U.S. VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of adult overweight and obesity [^114aoCvY]. Military Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) and weight loss: Vitamin B-12 has a very limited role in promoting weight loss, and there are no studies evaluating weight loss with vitamin B-12 injections, tablets, sublingual pills, or drinks. Conversely, B-12 deficiency has been associated with weight loss, particularly after bariatric surgical procedures, and can lead to permanent nerve damage if left untreated; no weight loss should be anticipated as a result of the use of exogenous vitamin B-12, injection site reaction might be anticipated if that route is chosen, and in patients with normal renal function a hypervitaminosis state is unlikely.

### Biomarkers of cobalamin (vitamin B-12) status in the epidemiologic setting: a critical overview of context, applications, and performance characteristics of cobalamin, methylmalonic acid, and holotranscobalamin II [^115wscRB]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Cobalamin deficiency is relatively common, but the great majority of cases in epidemiologic surveys have subclinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD), not classical clinical deficiency. Because SCCD has no known clinical expression, its diagnosis depends solely on biochemical biomarkers, whose optimal application becomes crucial yet remains unsettled. This review critically examines the current diagnostic concepts, tools, and interpretations. Their exploration begins with understanding that SCCD differs from clinical deficiency not just in degree of deficiency but in fundamental pathophysiology, causes, likelihood and rate of progression, and known health risks (the causation of which by SCCD awaits proof by randomized clinical trials). Conclusions from SCCD data, therefore, often may not apply to clinical deficiency and vice versa. Although many investigators view cobalamin testing as unreliable, cobalamin, like all diagnostic biomarkers, performs satisfactorily in clinical deficiency but less well in SCCD. The lack of a diagnostic gold standard limits the ability to weigh the performance characteristics of metabolic biomarkers such as methylmalonic acid (MMA) and holotranscobalamin II, whose specificities remain incompletely defined outside their relations to each other. Variable cutoff selections affect diagnostic conclusions heavily and need to be much better rationalized. The maximization of reliability and specificity of diagnosis is far more important today than the identification of ever-earlier stages of SCCD. The limitations of all current biomarkers make the combination of ≥ 2 test result abnormalities, such as cobalamin and MMA, the most reliable approach to diagnosing deficiency in the research setting; reliance on one test alone courts frequent misdiagnosis. Much work remains to be done.

### Cobalamin C defect: natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment [^114yJooG]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Cobalamin C (Cbl-C) defect is the most common inborn cobalamin metabolism error; it causes impaired conversion of dietary vitamin B12 into its two metabolically active forms, methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin. Cbl-C defect causes the accumulation of methylmalonic acid and homocysteine and decreased methionine synthesis. The gene responsible for the Cbl-C defect has been recently identified, and more than 40 mutations have been reported. MMACHC gene is located on chromosome 1p and catalyzes the reductive decyanation of CNCbl. Cbl-C patients present with a heterogeneous clinical picture and, based on their age at onset, can be categorized into two distinct clinical forms. Early-onset patients, presenting symptoms within the first year, show a multisystem disease with severe neurological, ocular, haematological, renal, gastrointestinal, cardiac, and pulmonary manifestations. Late-onset patients present a milder clinical phenotype with acute or slowly progressive neurological symptoms and behavioral disturbances. To improve clinical course and metabolic abnormalities, treatment of Cbl-C defect usually consists of a combined approach that utilizes vitamin B12 to increase intracellular cobalamin and to maximize deficient enzyme activities, betaine to provide a substrate for the conversion of homocysteine into methionine through betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase, and folic acid to enhance remethylation pathway. No proven efficacy has been demonstrated for carnitine and dietary protein restriction. Despite these measures, the long-term follow-up is unsatisfactory especially in patients with early onset, with frequent progression of neurological and ocular impairment. The unfavorable outcome suggests that better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease is needed to improve treatment protocols and to develop new therapeutic approaches.

### Vitamin B12 status and the risk of developing sepsis in patients with bacterial infection: a prospective observational cohort study [^111m1FMJ]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis affects millions of people throughout the world. To this day, it is still one of the main causes of death in intensive care units (ICUs), with high mortality rates across all countries. Sepsis pathophysiology is characterized in part by excessive generation of potent proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide (NO), as well as redox imbalance and widespread immunothrombosis which can result in disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Malnutrition is well known to interfere with the immune system and constitute a risk factor for infection. But there is also increasing evidence that deficiency or marginal deficiency in micronutrients (vitamins and trace elements) is linked with an altered immune function and susceptibility to infection or sepsis.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is a water-soluble vitamin that is obtained from animal dietary sources. Three quarters of vitamin B12 circulate in the blood bound to haptocorrin, and one quarter is bound to transcobalamin to form holotranscobalamin (HTC), the physiologically active form of B12 presented for cellular uptake.

### The importance of methylmalonic acid dosage on the assessment of patients with neurological manifestations following bariatric surgery [^1168W7K2]. Obesity Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 or cyanocobalamin is an important substance that is included in several metabolic pathways. Its deficiency is a common event after bariatric surgery, decreasing the vitamin B12 absorption after almost all of the stomach and duodenum are eliminated from the digestion process. Neurological manifestations of cyanocobalamin deficiency are not uncommon. We report a case of a young woman who developed ataxia, weakness and peripheral neuropathy after bariatric surgery, but with normal value of vitamin B12 dosage. For the diagnosis, it was necessary to dose methylmalonic acid. We discuss the importance of methylmalonic acid dosage after bariatric surgery in patients who present suspect of cyanocobalamin deficiency with normal values of this vitamin and the role of proton pump inhibitor use and vitamin supplementation in patients with early neurological presentation.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of cyanocobalamin IN (also known as Nascobal, B-12):
- **Anaphylaxis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B12 administration. Consider administering an intradermal test if patients are to start intranasal cyanocobalamin before having tolerated cyanocobalamin parenterally.
- **Hypokalemia, thrombocytosis**: use caution in severe megaloblastic anemia, as hypokalemia and sudden may occur when treated intensely.
- **Mask symptoms of folate deficiency**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as indiscriminate administration of vitamin B12 in patients with folate-deficient megaloblastic anemia may mask the diagnosis of folate deficiency.
- **Polycythemia vera**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as vitamin B12 deficiency may suppress the signs of polycythemia vera and treatment with vitamin B12 may unmask this condition.

### Cyanocobalamin (vitamin deficiency injectable system-B12) [^112C48BN]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

General

Vitamin B12deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B12deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B12, irreversible damage will result.

Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis.

Information for Patients

Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B12for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration.

A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B12. Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B12regularly. The need for vitamin B12is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time.

Laboratory Tests

During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary.

Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow.

Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated.

### Effect of combined diclofenac and B vitamins (thiamine, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin) for low back pain management: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116RxBV3]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Implications

The current review and meta-analysis revealed evidence confirming a superior analgesic effect for the combination of diclofenac with TPC over conventional therapy (diclofenac monotherapy) in patients with acute LBP, or acute exacerbations of the chronic condition, with or without degenerative lumbar spine disease without discopathy. The doses of diclofenac ranged between 75 and 150 mg/d, whereas the doses of vitamins B1 and B6 were between 100 and 300 mg/d. The dose of vitamin B12 ranged between 0.75 and 2 mg/d in the study by Mibielli et al. which reported the greatest levels of pain relief. These results are in agreement with those reported by the Magaña-Villa et al. study of patients with severe osteoarthritis of the knee and the Ponce-Monter et al. study of patients with lower limb fractures and surgery, in which cyanocobalamin doses of 2 mg/d or more were used. Importantly, cyanocobalamin as monotherapy delivered by intramuscular route has previously been assessed in patients with chronic back pain against placebo in an RCT, with a greater reduction in the VAS in patients who received vitamin B12 (average reduction of 66 points), compared with those given placebo (average reduction of 34 points; P < 0.0001). We speculate that the analgesic effect of combining thiamine, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin may be largely due to vitamin B12.

### Relationship between serum B12 concentrations and mortality: experience in NHANES [^115YbWbT]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Our current paper could not demonstrate any relationship between dietary vitamin B12 intake and cancer mortality. In previous reports, dietary intake of vitamin B12 (as well as folate and B6) or B12 supplement use was not associated with increased risk of renal, nasopharyngeal, or lung cancer and was associated with a lower risk of pancreatic cancer and decreased risk of breast cancer in BRCA mutation carriers. In the Women's Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study, intervention with a combination of folic acid (2.5 mg daily), vitamin B6 (50 mg), and cyanocobalamin (1000 mcg) for 7.3 years had no effect on the overall risk of cancer or cancer mortality. In contrast, the combined analysis of two studies in Norway — where there is no folic acid fortification of foods — showed that treatment of patients with ischemic heart disease using folic acid (0.8 mg) plus cyanocobalamin (400 mcg) was associated with increased cancer risk and all-cause mortality. The authors suggest that these adverse effects were mediated by folic acid. Supplementation with folate, vitamins B6 and B12, and/or omega-3 fatty acids in a secondary prevention trial showed no benefit of low doses of vitamin B6 (3 mg), cyanocobalamin (20 mcg), and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (0.56 mg) on cancer incidence or cancer mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease.

Vitamin B12 — replacement routes and special situations: Very large doses of sublingual or oral crystalline B12 (500–1000 mcg/d) are ≈1% absorbed by mass action even if IF is absent, and the sublingual and oral routes seem equally effective and may be preferred to a monthly intramuscular injection. In patients with tobacco amblyopia or B12 deficiency who smoke, increased urinary thiocyanate losses mean they should receive hydroxocobalamin, which is a potent cyanide antagonist; this compound is currently available only in parenteral form. Cyanocobalamin, the traditional salt, is used in oral, sublingual, and parenteral multivitamin formulations.

### Treatment of vitamin b (12)-deficiency anemia: oral versus parenteral therapy [^1111nLjr]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the use of oral cyanocobalamin therapy in the treatment of cobalamin (vitamin B(12))-deficient anemia.

Data Sources

Primary and review articles were identified by MEDLINE search (1966-May 2000) and through secondary sources.

Data Synthesis

Cobalamin-deficient anemia is among the most common diagnoses in older populations. Cobalamin-deficient anemia may be diagnosed as pernicious anemia, resulting from the lack of intrinsic factor required for cobalamin absorption or as protein malabsorption from the inability to displace cobalamin from protein food sources. Several studies provide evidence that daily oral cyanocobalamin as opposed to monthly parenteral formulations may adequately treat both types of cobalamin-deficient anemias.

Conclusions

Daily oral cyanocobalamin at doses of 1000–2000 microg can be used for treatment in most cobalamin-deficient patients who can tolerate oral supplementation. There are inadequate data at the present time to support the use of oral cyanocobalamin replacement in patients with severe neurologic involvement.

### Vitamins and minerals: their role in nail health and disease [^11486dRW]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Nail health and appearance are global concerns. We investigated the use of biotin vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol, vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin A, retinoids, retinol, retinal, silicon, zinc, iron, copper, selenium, and vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin) in nail health and disease. The evidence that we adduce in this paper suggests that: 1) proper nail care seems to help maintain nail health; 2) no evidence supports the use of vitamin supplementation with vitamin E, vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin A, retinoids, retinol, retinal, silicon, zinc, iron, copper, selenium, or vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin) for improving the nail health of well-nourished patients or improving the appearance of nails affected by pathologic disease; and 3) brittle nail syndrome appears to abate with supplementation with a 2.5-mg dose of biotin daily or a 10-mg dose of silicon daily, a useful form of which is choline-stabilized orthosilicic acid.

### Vitamin B12 supplementation during pregnancy for maternal and child health outcomes [^115CSFRK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin B 12 deficiency is a major public health problem worldwide, with the highest burden in elderly people, pregnant women, and young children. Due to its role in DNA synthesis and methylation, folate metabolism, and erythropoiesis, vitamin B 12 supplementation during pregnancy may confer longer-term benefits to maternal and child health outcomes.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of oral vitamin B 12 supplementation during pregnancy on maternal and child health outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 2 June 2023, and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, or cluster-RCTs evaluating the effects of oral vitamin B 12 supplementation compared to placebo or no vitamin B 12 supplementation during pregnancy.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Four review authors independently assessed trial eligibility. Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies and conducted checks for accuracy. Three review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. We used GRADE to evaluate the certainty of evidence for primary outcomes.

Main Results

The review included five trials with 984 pregnant women. All trials were conducted in low- and middle-income countries, including India, Bangladesh, South Africa, and Croatia. At enrolment, 26% to 51% of pregnant women had vitamin B 12 deficiency (less than 150 pmol/L), and the prevalence of anaemia (haemoglobin less than 11.0 g/dL) ranged from 30% to 46%. The dosage of vitamin B 12 supplementation varied from 5 μg/day to 250 μg/day, with administration beginning at 8 to 28 weeks' gestation through to delivery or three months' postpartum, and the duration of supplementation ranged from 8 to 16 weeks to 32 to 38 weeks. Three trials, involving 609 pregnant women, contributed data for meta-analyses of the effects of vitamin B 12 supplementation compared to placebo or no vitamin B 12 supplementation. Maternal anaemia: there may be little to no difference for maternal anaemia by intervention group, but the evidence is very uncertain (70.9% versus 65.0%; risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.26; 2 trials, 284 women; very low-certainty evidence). Maternal vitamin B 12 status: vitamin B 12 supplementation during pregnancy may reduce the risk of maternal vitamin B 12 deficiency compared to placebo or no vitamin B 12 supplementation, but the evidence is very uncertain (25.9% versus 67.9%; RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.51; 2 trials, 272 women; very low-certainty evidence). Women who received vitamin B 12 supplements during pregnancy may have higher total vitamin B 12 concentrations compared to placebo or no vitamin B 12 supplementation (mean difference (MD) 60.89 pmol/L, 95% CI 40.86 to 80.92; 3 trials, 412 women). However, there was substantial heterogeneity (I² = 85%). Adverse pregnancy outcomes: the evidence is uncertain about the effect on adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.74; 2 trials, 340 women; low-certainty evidence), and low birthweight (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.43; 2 trials, 344 women; low-certainty evidence). Two trials reported data on spontaneous abortion (or miscarriage); however, the trials did not report quantitative data for meta-analysis and there was no clear definition of spontaneous abortion in the study reports. No trials evaluated the effects of vitamin B 12 supplementation during pregnancy on neural tube defects. Infant vitamin B 12 status: children born to women who received vitamin B 12 supplementation had higher total vitamin B 12 concentrations compared to placebo or no vitamin B 12 supplementation (MD 71.89 pmol/L, 95% CI 20.23 to 123.54; 2 trials, 144 children). Child cognitive outcomes: three ancillary analyses of one trial reported child cognitive outcomes; however, data were not reported in a format that could be included in quantitative meta-analyses. In one study, maternal vitamin B 12 supplementation did not improve neurodevelopment status (e.g. cognitive, language (receptive and expressive), motor (fine and gross), social-emotional, or adaptive (conceptual, social, practical) domains) in children compared to placebo (9 months, Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition (BSID-III); 1 trial; low-certainty evidence) or neurophysiological outcomes (72 months, event-related potential measures; 1 trial; low-certainty evidence), though children born to women who received vitamin B 12 supplementation had improved expressive language domain compared to placebo (30 months, BSID-III; 1 trial; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Oral vitamin B 12 supplementation during pregnancy may reduce the risk of maternal vitamin B 12 deficiency and may improve maternal vitamin B 12 concentrations during pregnancy or postpartum compared to placebo or no vitamin B 12 supplementation, but the evidence is very uncertain. The effects of vitamin B 12 supplementation on other primary outcomes assessed in this review were not reported, or were not reported in a format for inclusion in quantitative analyses. Vitamin B 12 supplementation during pregnancy may improve maternal and infant vitamin B 12 status, but the potential impact on longer-term clinical and functional maternal and child health outcomes has not yet been established.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency – an update [^111b7Xx4]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

We represent an update on diagnosing and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency should be suspected in all patients with unexplained anaemia and/or neurological symptoms, as well as in patients at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency such as the elderly and patients with intestinal diseases. Measurement of plasma cobalamins is suggested as the primary analysis followed by measurement of plasma methylmalonic acid in unsettled cases. Accumulating evidence indicates that the biologically active cobalamin, plasma holotranscobalamin (holoTC), may be superior to plasma cobalamins, and measurement of holoTC is currently introduced in the clinical setting. No consensus exists concerning evaluation of the cause for vitamin B12 deficiency, and pros and cons on the different tests mainly aiming at evaluation of the function of the gastric mucosa are presented. Once the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency has been confirmed efficient treatment can be ensured either by injections every 2–3 month or by a daily dose of 1 mg vitamin B12.

### Functional cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency: role of advanced age and disorders associated with increased oxidative stress [^116QR9MP]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background/Objective

Functional cobalamin (Cbl; vitamin B12) deficiency (that is, high levels of the Cbl-dependent metabolites, methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HCys), despite normal serum Cbl values) is common in the elderly and is associated with neurocognitive abnormalities, but its cause is unknown. As only reduced Cbls are metabolically active, the possibility that functional Cbl deficiency is associated with disorders having biomarkers indicative of increased oxidative stress (oxidant risks) was considered.

Subjects/Methods

A retrospective record review of community-dwelling adults evaluated over a 12-year period for Cbl deficiency in a primary care setting who had serum Cbl values ⩾400pg/ml (n = 170).

Results

When no oxidant risks were present, older subjects (⩾70 years) had higher metabolite values than younger individuals (< 70 years). MMA values were even higher in the elderly when one oxidant risk was present and in younger subjects when two or more oxidant risks were present. Even at Cbl levels ⩾800pg/ml, MMA values were increased in 73% of elderly subjects with at least one oxidant risk. HCys values were also higher in both age groups when at least two oxidant risks were present. Cyanocobalamin therapy decreased MMA and HCys values in 86 and 76% of subjects, respectively, with nonresponders more likely to have two or more oxidant risks.

Conclusion

Functional Cbl deficiency is associated with disorders marked by increased oxidative stress particularly in the elderly; it occurs even when Cbl levels are high and is not consistently corrected with high-dose cyanocobalamin therapy. Thus, current approaches to recognizing and managing this disorder may be inadequate.

### How I treat cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency [^1123to9s]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

The challenges in medical management of cobalamin deficiency lie in attention to the unique pathophysiology that underlies cobalamin deficiency, more than in the mechanics of therapy. The central physiologic principles are that clinically important deficiency is more likely to occur (and progress) when intrinsic factor-driven absorption fails than when diet is poor and that most causes take years to produce clinically obvious deficiency. Transient defects have little clinical impact. The key management principle is the importance of follow-up, which also requires knowing how the deficiency arose. The virtues of these principles are not always fully appreciated. Recent developments have made diagnosis and management more difficult by diminishing the ability to determine cobalamin absorption status. Clinicians must also grapple with premature medicalization of isolated, mild biochemical changes that added many asymptomatic cases of still undetermined medical relevance to their caseload, often expanded by inflated cobalamin level criteria. The potential for misattribution of cobalamin-unrelated presentations to nongermane cobalamin and metabolite abnormalities has grown. Pathophysiologically based management requires systematic attention to each of its individual components: correctly diagnosing cobalamin deficiency, reversing it, defining its underlying cause, preventing relapse, managing the underlying disorder and its complications, and educating the patient.

### Water-soluble vitamins in people with low glomerular filtration rate or on dialysis: a review [^114nGRbK]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12

Background

The main source of cobalamin is from dietary intake of animal and dairy products. Cyanocobalamin, another name for vitamin B12, is an artefactual molecule based on previously used isolation methods from liver specimens and does not have direct biologic activity. The actual biologically active forms proceed from cobalamin. Ingested cobalamin complexes with salivary haptocorrin, which is released from cobalamin by pancreatic proteases in the duodenum. Intrinsic factor secreted from the parietal cells of the stomach then complexes with the released cobalamin. When this complex arrives at the distal ileum, it binds to cubilin on the enterocytes and is endocytosed. The cobalamin molecule is separated from intrinsic factor and transferred to transcobalamin II, which is a plasma transport protein.

At the target cell, the complex is endocytosed into the cellular lysosome where cobalamin is released from transcobalamin. It is metabolized to two active forms: adenosylcobalamin in the mitochondria and methylcobalamin in the cytosol.

Methylcobalamin is a methyl-transferring cofactor to the enzyme methionine synthase. Catalyzed by methionine synthase, methyltetrahydrofolate surrenders a methyl group to cobalamin, which then methylates homocysteine and forms methionine. Methionine is an essential amino acid required in the synthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids.

Adenosylcobalamin is formed within mitochondria and is a cofactor for a mutase known as methylmalonyl-CoA-mutase. This enzyme converts methylmalonyl-CoA into succinyl CoA and is important in the catabolism of various aminoacids and fatty acids. These processes may also require pyridoxine (vitamin B6) as a cofactor.

Unlike cobalamin acquired from dietary sources, pharmacologic sources provide either cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin. Gastrointestinal absorption is saturable. After a 5–50 mcg dose, the maximum amount of absorbed B12 is 1.5 mcg. Dairy products, fish, and shellfish appear to continuously increase plasma vitamin B12 levels with increased daily intake. Meat and meat products, on the other hand, appear to have a plateau effect beyond 4 μg/day. Beyond 10 μg/day, plasma vitamin B12 levels plateau, independent of the food source.

### B vitamins for stroke prevention [^1168gW2g]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Supplementation with B vitamins (vitamin B 9 (folic acid), vitamin B 12 and vitamin B 6) lowers blood total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations by about 25% and reduces the relative risk of stroke overall by about 10% (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99) compared with placebo. Homocysteine-lowering interventions have no significant effect on myocardial infarction, death from any cause or adverse outcomes. Factors that appear to modify the effect of B vitamins on stroke risk include low folic acid status, high tHcy, high cyanocobalamin dose in patients with impaired renal function and concurrent antiplatelet therapy. In regions with increasing levels or established policies of population folate supplementation, evidence from observational genetic epidemiological studies and randomised controlled clinical trials is concordant in suggesting an absence of benefit from lowering of homocysteine with folic acid for prevention of stroke. Clinical trials indicate that in countries which mandate folic acid fortification of food, folic acid supplementation has no significant effect on reducing stroke risk (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.23). However, in countries without mandatory folic acid food fortification, folic acid supplementation reduces the risk of stroke by about 15% (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.94). Folic acid alone or in combination with minimal cyanocobalamin (≤ 0.05 mg/day) is associated with an even greater reduction in risk of future stroke by 25% (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.86), whereas the combination of folic acid and a higher dose of cyanocobalamin (≥ 0.4 mg/day) is not associated with a reduced risk of future stroke (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.05). The lack of benefit of folic acid plus higher doses of cyanocobalamin (≥ 0.4 mg/day) was observed in trials which all included participants with chronic kidney disease. Because metabolic B 12 deficiency is very common and usually not diagnosed, future randomised trials of homocysteine-lowering interventions for stroke prevention should probably test a combination of folic acid and methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin instead of cyanocobalamin, and perhaps vitamin B 6.

How is B 12 deficiency treated?

The therapeutic goals of B 12 treatment are the reversal of metabolic abnormalities and the prevention or reduction of clinical symptoms (fig 1). Treatment depends in part on the severity of symptoms and the cause of the deficiency. In individuals with symptomatic B 12 deficiency despite normal dietary B 12 intake, B 12 malabsorption is the most likely cause and should guide parenteral therapy.

The three key treatment areas are outlined below.

Insufficient dietary intake

To prevent deficiency, oral cyanocobalamin supplementation once daily 20–50 mcg or 50–150 mcg is most commonly recommended. In some countries, methyl- and adenosylcobalamin-containing preparations are available; however, one observational study suggests better efficacy with cyanocobalamin than with methylcobalamin. Exercise caution when using combination preparations to avoid excessive folate or B 6 intake. With advancing age, B 12 absorption declines, and a higher supplemental B 12 dose may be needed. Yearly monitoring of B 12 status and suitable adjustment of the supplementation dose is recommended.

For symptomatic deficiency (box 1) caused by insufficient dietary intake, intramuscular B 12 therapy is usually initiated with the aim of progressing to oral supplements once symptoms have resolved.

### Effect of combined diclofenac and B vitamins (thiamine, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin) for low back pain management: systematic review and meta-analysis [^11614bhB]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Data Synthesis and Analysis

When the measurement of outcomes was sufficiently consistent across trials, we used odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We included unstandardized MDs because they allow for more direct clinical interpretation. When a study seemed to be missing data, we also contacted the corresponding authors. Using a sensitivity analysis, we explored the effects of including studies with high levels of lost data in our overall assessment of the effect of the treatment. When possible, the denominator for each outcome was based on the initial random allocation, taking into consideration the number of participants based on the group to which they were initially assigned (analysis by intention to treat). We also evaluated clinical heterogeneity (differences between studies in key characteristics of the participants, treatments, or outcome measurements). The five studies in the systematic review included patients with LBP. Considering that the studies of Vetter, Kuhlwein, Brüggemann, and Mibielli were sufficiently homogeneous in terms of participants, interventions, and outcomes (low clinical heterogeneity), they were included in the meta-analysis. We excluded the study by Levin et al. because it was open label, performed in patients with chronic LBP, used benfotiamine, and the main outcome was reduction in pain intensity and not the number of patients able to stop therapy due to complete pain relief. The methodological heterogeneity is low in our review, as we only evaluated RCTs and most of the studies included in the analysis have a low or indeterminate risk of bias (Figure 2). We considered any value of I² > 50% to be representative of statistically significant heterogeneity between studies. We also carried out a visual inspection of the graphic representation of the study results with 95% CIs to assess heterogeneity.

Rating Evidence Quality

The "Summary of Findings" table shows the primary outcomes from the review, as recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, version 5.1 (Appendix 2). We assessed the quality of evidence for each outcome based on the GRADE system for five items: risk of bias, inconsistency, problems with applicability of the evidence, imprecision, and publication bias. Each item was assessed independently by two authors (CCO and MNM), with subsequent discussion to reach consensus, if necessary.

### B vitamins in stroke prevention: time to reconsider [^1158dRUR]. The Lancet: Neurology (2017). Medium credibility.

B vitamin therapy lowers plasma total homocysteine concentrations, and might be a beneficial intervention for stroke prevention; however, cyanocobalamin (a form of vitamin B12) can accelerate decline in renal function and increase the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with impaired renal function. Although early trials did not show benefit in reduction of stroke, these results might have been due to harm in participants with impaired renal function. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, cyanocobalamin is harmful, whereas B vitamins appear to reduce cardiovascular events in study participants with normal renal function. Our meta-analysis of individual patient data from two large trials of B vitamin therapy (VISP and VITATOPS) indicates that patients with impaired renal function who are exposed to high-dose cyanocobalamin do not benefit from therapy with B vitamins for the prevention of stroke (risk ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.84–1.27), however, patients with normal renal function who are not exposed to high-dose cyanocobalamin benefit significantly from this treatment (0.78, 0.67–0.90; interaction p = 0.03). The potential benefits of B vitamin therapy with folic acid and methylcobalamin or hydroxycobalamin, instead of cyanocobalamin, to lower homocysteine concentrations in people at high risk of stroke warrant further investigation.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Vitamin B12is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis.

Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B12is transported via specific B12binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B12storage.

Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1000 mcg of vitamin B12, 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage.

Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B12depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B12prevents progression of neurologic damage.

The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B12in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B12is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs).

Vitamin B12is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B12enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B12.

Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B12, and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure.

Presentation and Pathophysiology for Vitamin B12 Deficiency

Vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies are often evaluated together as their roles are intertwined. Vitamin B12, or cobalamin, is found in animal derived foods where it is bound to protein. Very little is found in plant-based foods unless the product is fortified. Gastric acid, pepsin, intrinsic factor, and pancreatic proteases need to be present to aid absorption which occurs in the ileum. Conditions that interfere with B12-intrinsic factor formation, decrease gastric acid, or disrupt absorption at the ileum can result in deficiency. Once absorbed, the active form of the vitamin is bound to transcobalamin II while the inactive form is bound to haptocorrin.

The liver stores approximately 2–3mg of the vitamin which is also reabsorbed via the enterohepatic pathway. Given a typical daily requirement of 2.4mcg, it would take years to deplete stores. The vitamin is essential for DNA synthesis, methylation, production of hematopoietic cell as well as maintenance of the myelin sheath.

Patients often present with glossitis, cognitive changes or a symmetrical neuropathy involving dorsal and lateral columns of the spinal cord causing weakness, ataxia, and paresthesias. Laboratory studies may reveal macrocytosis or hypersegmented neutrophils. In extreme cases, a non-autoimmune hemolytic anemia with associated elevated LDH may be present due to abnormal DNA synthesis. The absence of an anemia should not exclude the disease if other symptoms are present.

Introduction

Vitamin B 12 (cobalamin) plays important roles in cellular metabolism, especially in DNA synthesis, methylation, and mitochondrial metabolism, which is an essential vitamin composed of a cobalt-containing corrinoid ring, upper and lower ligands. The upper ligands of cobalamin can be 5'-deoxyadenosine, methyl, hydroxy, and cyano group, resulting in 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), methylcobalamin (MeCbl), hydroxocobalamin (OHCbl) and cyanocobalamin (CNCbl), respectively. MeCbl and AdoCbl are the natural bioactive forms of vitamin B 12, while CNCbl is an industrially produced stable form and OHCbl is a hydrate that results from breaking the Co–C bond in AdoCbl.

Woodward and Eschemoser, together with about 100 students and researchers, exerted 11 years of efforts to successfully develop a process for the complete chemosynthesis of vitamin B 12 in 1976. Due to the complex and difficult chemical synthetic process, however, vitamin B 12 production has relied on the fermentation of microorganisms such as Pseudomonas denitrificans, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium shermanii and Sinorhizobium meliloti – up to now. Although these strains produce high titers of vitamin B 12, their long period fermentation process and limited genetic engineering tools hinder further improvement. In the search for alternative production methods, various key intermediates or derivatives, such as hydrogenobyrate (HBA), hydrogenobyrinate a, c - diamide (HBAD)and hydrogenobyric acid (Hby), have been obtained from engineered Eschericia coli strains, from which the titer of HBAD and Hby were reported to be 2.94 mg/L and 2.95 mg/L, respectively. More recently, a metabolically engineered E. coli platform, which expressed over 30 heterologous enzymes, was able to produce vitamin B 12 with a titer of 0.67 mg/L in 24 h of fermentation. However, due to intricate and protracted biosynthetic pathway of vitamin B 12, further metabolic engineering to enhance production remains a significant challenge. Therefore, there has been a great demand for alternative method for vitamin B 12 synthesis that does not exclusively rely on chemocatalysis or bacteria fermentation, which led us to consider a cell-free platform.

### Measuring vitamin B-12 bioavailability with [13C]-cyanocobalamin in humans [^115eugch]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin B-12 deficiency is widespread in many parts of the world, affecting all age groups and increasing with age. It is primarily due to a low intake of animal source foods or malabsorption. The measurement of bioavailability of vitamin B-12 is etiologically important in deficiency but is limited due to the use of radioactive isotopes like [57Co]- or [14C]-cyanocobalamin.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to measure the bioavailability of [13C]-cyanocobalamin in humans and to assess the effect of parenteral replenishment of vitamin B-12 on the bioavailability.

Methods

We synthesized a stable isotope-labeled vitamin B-12, [13C]-cyanocobalamin, using Salmonella enterica by providing [13C2]-ethanolamine as a sole carbon source. After purification and mass spectrometry-based characterization, its oral bioavailability was measured in the fasted state with high and low oral doses, before and after parenteral replenishment of vitamin B-12 stores, from the kinetics of its plasma appearance in a 2-compartment model.

Results

[13C]-cyanocobalamin was completely decyanated to [13C]-methylcobalamin describing metabolic utilization, and its plasma appearance showed early and late absorption phases. At a low dose of 2.3 µg, the mean bioavailability was 46.2 ± 12.8 (%, mean ± SD, n = 11). At a higher dose of 18.3 µg, the mean bioavailability was 7.6 ± 1.7 (%, mean ± SD, n = 4). Parenteral replenishment of the vitamin B-12 store in deficient individuals prior to the measurement resulted in a 1.9-fold increase in bioavailability.

Conclusions

Vitamin B-12 bioavailability is dose dependent and at a low dose that approximates the normal daily requirement (46%). The stable isotope method described here could be used to define the etiology of deficiency and to inform the dietary requirement in different physiologic states as well as the dose required for supplementation and food fortification. This trial was registered at the Clinical Trials Registry of India as CTRI/2018/04/012957.

### Dependency on host vitamin B12 has shaped Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex evolution [^114VWYwH]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin B12 (B12), historically known as the "anti-pernicious anemia factor" by its ability to cure pernicious anemia, was first documented in 1926. It has the largest and most complex chemical structure of all the vitamins and biological cofactors, whose intricate structure was solved in 1956 by X-ray crystallography. The term B12 -or cobalamin (Cbl)- refers to a group of water soluble, cobalt-containing corrinoid molecules, which are required in a wide range of metabolic processes both in prokaryotes and animals. Specifically, B12 in animals is essential for carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism, and the formation and regeneration of red blood cells, as well as the maintenance of the central nervous system. Despite most prokaryotes and animals possess enzymes that require B12 as cofactor, only some bacteria and archaea are able to synthesize B12 de novo. However, even though some bacteria of the microbiota residing in the large intestine produce Cbl, mammals are not able to uptake Cbl produced at this location, since the site of B12 absorption is located in the small intestine. Therefore, animals, including humans, must assimilate B12 by dietary intake. Indeed, some mammalian herbivores (including rabbits, mice, rats and primates) practice coprophagy to obtain Cbl as they fail to obtain sufficient vitamin from vegetarian dietary sources. In humans, to obtain full benefits from vegan and vegetarian diets, these individuals should ingest fortified foods and/or B12 supplements.

The presence of B12-dependent enzymes in bacteria and animals makes this vitamin an attractive candidate for host-pathogen cross-talk. Indeed, it has been proposed a role for B12 in shaping the ecological niche of some bacterial genus as Salmonella or Yersinia. While non-typhoidal Salmonellae retain an intact B12 pathway, this is inactivated in the typhoidal human pathogens. Similarly, although Y. enterocolitic a and environmental Yersinia species retain all the genes for B12 synthesis, the human-pathogens Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis have lost most of them. In other words, those serotypes or species maintaining a functional production of endogenous B12 are adapted to cause intestinal infections; while those pathogens lacking B12 biosynthesis are associated with disseminated diseases. Together, maintaining the B12 biosynthesis in enteric pathogens provides a metabolic advantage to outcompete their intestinal microbiota counterparts in an inflamed gut; while loss of B12 synthesis might represent a signature of invasive pathogens for the change of the intestinal niche and a movement away to a more systemic infectious cycle.

### Folic acid with or without vitamin B12 for the prevention and treatment of healthy elderly and demented people [^115HszUP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Folate deficiency can result in congenital neural tube defects and megaloblastic anaemia. Low folate levels may be due to insufficient dietary intake or inefficient absorption, but impaired metabolic utilization also occurs. Because B12 deficiency can produce a similar anaemia to folate deficiency, there is a risk that folate supplementation can delay the diagnosis of B12 deficiency, which can cause irreversible neurological damage. Folic acid supplements may sometimes therefore include vitamin B12 supplements with simultaneous administration of vitamin B12. Lesser degrees of folate inadequacy are associated with high blood levels of the amino acid homocysteine which has been linked with the risk of arterial disease, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. There is therefore interest in whether dietary supplementation can improve cognitive function in the elderly. However, any apparent benefit from folic acid which was given in combination with B12 needs to be "corrected" for any effect of vitamin B12 alone. A separate Cochrane review of vitamin B12 and cognitive function has therefore been published.

Objectives

To examine the effects of folic acid supplementation, with or without vitamin B12, on elderly healthy or demented people, in preventing cognitive impairment or retarding its progress.

Search Strategy

Trials were identified from a search of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register on 10 October 2007 using the terms: folic acid, folate, vitamin B9, leucovorin, methyltetrahydrofolate, vitamin B12, cobalamin and cyanocobalamin. This Register contains references from all major health care databases and many ongoing trials databases. In addition MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO and LILACS were searched (years 2003–2007) for additional trials of folate with or without vitamin B12 on healthy elderly people.

Selection Criteria

All double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials, in which supplements of folic acid with or without vitamin B12 were compared with placebo for elderly healthy people or people with any type of dementia or cognitive impairment.

Data Collection and Analysis

The reviewers independently applied the selection criteria and assessed study quality. One reviewer extracted and analysed the data. In comparing intervention with placebo, weighted mean differences and standardized mean difference or odds ratios were estimated.

Main Results

Eight randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. Four trials enrolled healthy older people, and four recruited participants with mild to moderate cognitive impairment or dementia with or without diagnosed folate deficiency. Pooling the data was not possible owing to heterogeneity in sample selections, outcomes, trial duration, and dosage. Two studies involved a combination of folic acid and vitamin B12. There is no adequate evidence of benefit from folic acid supplementation with or without vitamin B12 on cognitive function and mood of unselected healthy elderly people. However, in one trial enrolling a selected group of healthy elderly people with high homocysteine levels, 800 mcg/day folic acid supplementation over three years was associated with significant benefit in terms of global functioning (WMD 0.05, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.096, P = 0.033); memory storage (WMD 0.14, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.24, P = 0.006) and information-processing speed (WMD 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.16, P = 0.016). Four trials involved people with cognitive impairment. In one pilot trial enrolling people with Alzheimer's disease, the overall response to cholinesterase inhibitors significantly improved with folic acid at a dose of 1mg/day (odds ratio: 4.06, 95% CI 1.22 to 13.53; P = 0.02) and there was a significant improvement in scores on the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and the Social Behaviour subscale of the Nurse's Observation Scale for Geriatric Patients (WMD 4.01, 95% CI 0.50 to 7.52, P = 0.02). Other trials involving people with cognitive impairment did not show any benefit in measures of cognitive function from folic acid, with or without vitamin B12. Folic acid plus vitamin B12 was effective in reducing serum homocysteine concentrations (WMD -5.90, 95% CI -8.43 to -3.37, P < 0.00001). Folic acid was well tolerated and no adverse effects were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

The small number of studies which have been done provide no consistent evidence either way that folic acid, with or without vitamin B12, has a beneficial effect on cognitive function of unselected healthy or cognitively impaired older people. In a preliminary study, folic acid was associated with improvement in the response of people with Alzheimer's disease to cholinesterase inhibitors. In another, long-term use appeared to improve the cognitive function of healthy older people with high homocysteine levels. More studies are needed on this important issue.

### The association between vitamin B12, albuminuria and reduced kidney function: an observational cohort study [^112pCC4S]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Potential mechanisms

B12 in the blood is primarily protein-bound. Approximately 20% of circulating B12 is bound to holotranscobalamin (TC2) with the remainder to haptocorrin. TC2-bound B12 is the biologically active form as B12 bound to haptocorrin cannot be taken up into cells. A congenital form of megaloblastic anemia has been described in infants lacking TC2 despite normal total B12 levels. The kidney plays an important role in TC2 metabolism. TC2 is filtered at the glomerulus and is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule by megalin. B12 is then returned to the blood bound to newly synthesized TC2. Thus, defects in protein reabsorption in the proximal tubule could lead to a loss of biologically active TC2 in the urine.

Increased TC2 and haptocorrin levels have been noted in patients with CKD. Despite this, there is decreased uptake of TC2 into cells. This can lead to a paradoxical increase in cellular homocysteine levels despite normal total B12. Thus, a functional B12 deficiency can occur in patients with CKD in the setting of increased TC2 losses in the urine, decreased TC2 absorption in the proximal tubule and decreased cellular uptake of TC2.

Another important consideration is the possibility that elevated B12 levels and B12 supplementation may be harmful in individuals with CKD. Cyanide metabolism is abnormal in individuals with CKD due to decreased clearance. Cyanocobalamin, the most commonly used form of B12 replacement is metabolized to active methylcobalamin releasing small amounts of cyanide. Under normal circumstances, methylcobalamin acts as a means of removing cyanide from the circulation through conversion to cyanocobalamin. However, in patients with CKD the reduced cyanide clearance prevents conversion of cyanocobalamin to the active form and therefore supplementation in this form is less effective at reducing homocysteine levels.

In fact, a recent randomized trial of cyanocobalamin administration found more rapid GFR decline and cardiovascular morbidity in the treatment arm. It was suggested that this may be related to increased synthesis of assymetric dimethylarginine which is known to inhibit nitric oxide. However, the data above suggest that in fact this finding may result from the use of cyanocobalamin rather than methylcobalamin in this population and that methylcobalamin should be preferred in individuals with CKD. Unfortunately, as we do not have data on vitamin supplementation, this is speculative and would warrant further investigation.

### Folic acid with or without vitamin B12 for cognition and dementia [^114QGbpQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Folates are vitamins essential to the development of the central nervous system. Insufficient folate activity at the time of conception and early pregnancy can result in congenital neural tube defects. In adult life folate deficiency has been known for decades to produce a characteristic form of anaemia ("megaloblastic"). More recently degrees of folate inadequacy, not severe enough to produce anaemia, have been found to be associated with high blood levels of the amino acid homocysteine. Such degrees of folate inadequacy can arise because of insufficient folates in the diet or because of inefficient absorption or metabolic utilisation of folates due to genetic variations. Conventional criteria for diagnosing folate deficiency may be inadequate for identifying people capable of benefiting from dietary supplementation. High blood levels of homocysteine have been linked with the risk of arterial disease, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. There is therefore interest in whether dietary supplements of folic acid (an artificial chemical analogue of naturally occurring folates) can improve cognitive function of people at risk of cognitive decline associated with ageing or dementia, whether by affecting homocysteine metabolism or through other mechanisms. There is a risk that if folic acid is given to people who have undiagnosed deficiency of vitamin B12 it may lead to neurological damage. Vitamin B12 deficiency produces both an anaemia identical to that of folate deficiency but also causes irreversible damage to the central and peripheral nervous systems. Folic acid will correct the anaemia of vitamin B12 deficiency and so delay diagnosis but will not prevent progression to neurological damage. For this reason trials of folic acid supplements may involve simultaneous administration of vitamin B12. Apparent benefit from folic acid given in the combination would therefore need to be "corrected" for any effect of vitamin B12 alone. A separate Cochrane review of vitamin B12 and cognitive function is being prepared.

Objectives

All double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials, in which supplements of folic acid with or without vitamin B12 were compared with placebo for elderly healthy people or people with any type of dementia or cognitive impairment.

Data Collection and Analysis

The reviewers independently applied the selection criteria and assessed study quality. One reviewer extracted and analysed the data. In comparing intervention with placebo, weighted mean differences, and standardized mean difference or odds ratios were estimated.

Main Results

Four randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. One trial (Bryan 2002) enrolled healthy women, and three (Fioravanti 1997; Sommer 1998; VITAL 2003) recruited people with mild to moderate cognitive impairment or dementia with or without diagnosed folate deficiency. Fioravanti 1997 enrolled people with mild to moderate cognitive impairment or dementia as judged by scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Global Deterioration Scale and with serum folate level < 3ng/l. One trial (VITAL 2003) studied the effects of a combination of vitamin B12 and folic acid on patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease or mixed dementia. The analysis from the included trials found no benefit from folic acid with or without vitamin B12 in comparison with placebo on any measures of cognition and mood for healthy or cognitively impaired or demented people: Folic acid effect and healthy participants: there was no benefit from of oral 750 mcg folic acid per day for five weeks compared with placebo on measures of cognition and mood of 19 healthy women aged 65 to 92. Folic acid effect and people with mild to moderate cognitive decline or dementia: there were no statistically significant results in favour of folic acid with or without vitamin B12 on any measures of cognitive function. Scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) revealed no statistically significant benefit from 2 mg per day folic acid plus 1mg vitamin B12 for 12 weeks when compared with placebo (WMD 0.39, 95% CI -0.43 to 1.21, P = 0.35). Cognitive scores on the Alzheimer's Disease Scale (ADAS-Cog) showed no statistically significant benefit from 2 mg /day folic acid plus 1 mg /day vitamin B12 for 12 weeks compared with placebo (WMD 0.41, 95% -1.25 to 2.07, P = 4.63). The Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADL) revealed no benefit from 2mg per day of folic acid plus 1 mg vitamin B12 for 12 weeks in comparison with placebo (WMD -0.57, 95%CI -1.95 to 0.81, P = 0.42). None of the sub tests of the Randt Memory Test (RMT) showed statistically significant benefit from 15 mg of folic acid orally per day for 9 weeks when compared with placebo. One trial (Sommer 1998) reported a significant decline compared with placebo in two cognitive function tasks in demented patients who had received high doses of folic acid (10 mg /day) for unspecified periods. One trial (VITAL 2003) showed that 2 mg folic acid plus 1 mg vitamin B12 daily for 12 weeks significantly lowered serum homocysteine concentrations (P < 0.0001).

Reviewer's Conclusions

There was no beneficial effect of 750 mcg of folic acid per day on measures of cognition or mood in older healthy women. In patients with mild to moderate cognitive decline and different forms of dementia there was no benefit from folic acid on measures of cognition or mood. Folic acid plus vitamin B12 was effective in reducing the serum homocysteine concentrations. Folic acid was well tolerated and no adverse effects were reported. More studies are needed.

### Treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency-methylcobalamine? Cyancobalamine? Hydroxocobalamin?-clearing the confusion [^115k4u63]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (cyancobalamin, Cbl) has two active co-enzyme forms, methylcobalamin (MeCbl) and adenosylcobalamin (AdCbl). There has been a paradigm shift in the treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency such that MeCbl is being extensively used and promoted. This is despite the fact that both MeCbl and AdCbl are essential and have distinct metabolic fates and functions. MeCbl is primarily involved along with folate in hematopiesis and development of the brain during childhood. Whereas deficiency of AdCbl disturbs the carbohydrate, fat and amino-acid metabolism, and hence interferes with the formation of myelin. Thereby, it is important to treat vitamin B12 deficiency with a combination of MeCbl and AdCbl or hydroxocobalamin or Cbl. Regarding the route, it has been proved that the oral route is comparable to the intramuscular route for rectifying vitamin B12 deficiency.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes mellitus: is routine screening and supplementation justified? [^1145f2Y4]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 is an essential micronutrient required for optimal hemopoetic, neuro-cognitive and cardiovascular function. Biochemical and clinical vitamin B12 deficiency has been demonstrated to be highly prevalent among patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It presents with diverse clinical manifestations ranging from impaired memory, dementia, delirium, peripheral neuropathy, sub acute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, megaloblastic anemia and pancytopenia. This review article offers a current perspective on the physiological roles of vitamin B12, proposed pathophysiological mechanisms of vitamin B12 deficiency, screening for vitamin B12 deficiency and vitamin B12 supplementation among patients with diabetes mellitus.

### Plasma vitamin B12 levels, high-dose vitamin B12 treatment, and risk of dementia [^115TkyxL]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

A particular strength of our study is the good comparability of P-B12 measurements. Hence, misclassification of P-B12 levels due to changes in analytical methods is unlikely. Further, we included two different data sources to identify persons treated with high-dose B12 drugs. Although high-dose B12 is available over-the-counter, we consider it likely that patients with P-B12 measurements were prescribed B12 drugs if B12 deficiency was diagnosed. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis on non-reimbursed B12 prescriptions showed robust results. We observed a small difference between patients with low and normal P-B12 in the proportion of deaths during follow-up in the secondary B12-treatment cohort. This could introduce survivor bias. However, we consider the risk of selection bias due to loss to follow-up minimal since all Danish citizens are registered in the Danish Civil Registration System, including date of death or emigration, allowing for censoring in the Cox regression analysis. Another strength is the high positive predictive value of dementia (86%) and Alzheimer's disease (81%) in the DNPR, although less so for other dementia subtypes. The robustness of the results in subanalyses and sensitivity analyses also strengthens our findings. Although hydroxo-B12 is more readily converted to biologically important forms of B12 (methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin) than cyano-B12, our results did not show any specific benefit of any formulation.

In conclusion, these robust results in a large patient population suggest that B12 deficiency does not contribute to the risk of Alzheimer's disease or other dementia types, and that high-dose B12 treatment does not prevent these diseases regardless of P-B12 or P-MMA levels. Our findings from hospital inpatients, hospital outpatients, and general practitioner patients are highly representative of all Danish patients. These findings have high external validity at least for high-income countries. They have public health implications for the assessment of dementia and imply that guidelines suggesting routine screening for B12 deficiency in patients with suspected dementia should be reconsidered.

### Cyanocobalamine injection (Cyanocobalamine) [^117TUHfk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Vitamin B12is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis.

Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B12is transported via specific B12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B storage.

Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1,000 mcg of vitamin B12, 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage.

Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B12depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B12prevents progression of neurologic damage.

The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B12in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B12is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs).

Vitamin B12is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B12enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B12.

Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B12, and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure.

### Oral vitamin B12 versus intramuscular vitamin B12 for vitamin B12 deficiency [^1155La4y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin B12 deficiency is common and rises with age. Most people with vitamin B12 deficiency are treated in primary care with intramuscular vitamin B12 which is a considerable source of work for health care professionals. Several case control and case series studies have reported equal efficacy of oral administration of vitamin B12 but it is rarely prescribed in this form, other than in Sweden and Canada. Doctors may not be prescribing oral formulations because they are unaware of this option or have concerns regarding effectiveness.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of oral vitamin B12 versus intramuscular vitamin B12 for vitamin B12 deficiency.

Search Strategy

Searches were undertaken of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Lilacs in early 2005. The bibliographies of all relevant papers identified using this strategy were searched. In addition we contacted authors of relevant identified studies and Vitamin B12 research and pharmaceutical companies to enquire about other published or unpublished studies and ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining the use of oral or intramuscular vitamin B12 to treat vitamin B12 deficiency.

Data Collection and Analysis

All abstracts or titles identified by the electronic searches were independently scrutinised by two reviewers. When a difference between reviewers arose, we obtained and reviewed a hard copy of the papers and made decisions by consensus. We obtained a copy of all pre-selected papers and two researchers independently extracted the data from these studies using piloted data extraction forms. The whole group checked whether inclusion and exclusion criteria were met, and disagreement was decided by consensus. The methodological quality of the included studies was independently assessed by two researchers and disagreements were brought back to the whole group and resolved by consensus.

Main Results

Two RCT's comparing oral with intramuscular administration of vitamin B12 met our inclusion criteria. The trials recruited a total of 108 participants and followed up 93 of these from 90 days to four months. High oral doses of B12 (1000 mcg and 2000 mcg) were as effective as intramuscular administration in achieving haematological and neurological responses.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence derived from these limited studies suggests that 2000 mcg doses of oral vitamin B12 daily and 1000 mcg doses initially daily and thereafter weekly and then monthly may be as effective as intramuscular administration in obtaining short term haematological and neurological responses in vitamin B12 deficient patients.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency [^111tiPE5]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of macrocytic anemia and has been implicated in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. The role of B12 deficiency in hyperhomocysteinemia and the promotion of atherosclerosis is only now being explored. Diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency is typically based on measurement of serum vitamin B12 levels; however, about 50 percent of patients with subclinical disease have normal B12 levels. A more sensitive method of screening for vitamin B12 deficiency is measurement of serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels, which are increased early in vitamin B12 deficiency. Use of the Schilling test for detection of pernicious anemia has been supplanted for the most part by serologic testing for parietal cell and intrinsic factor antibodies. Contrary to prevailing medical practice, studies show that supplementation with oral vitamin B12 is a safe and effective treatment for the B12 deficiency state. Even when intrinsic factor is not present to aid in the absorption of vitamin B12 (pernicious anemia) or in other diseases that affect the usual absorption sites in the terminal ileum, oral therapy remains effective.

### Vitamin B12 as a treatment for pain [^115Qvpi4]. Pain Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

First isolated as cyanocobalamin in 1948, vitamin B12 has been explored for pain treatment almost since its discovery. With the advent of the opioid epidemic, safer treatments for pain are needed.

Objectives

Our objective was to compile the latest information on potential mechanisms from animal studies and clinical trial data on vitamin B12 for the treatment of pain conditions.

Study Design

We conducted a narrative review.

Methods

PubMed was searched using the terms "methylcobalamin pain", "hydroxycobalamin pain", "cyanocobalamin pain", and "vitamin B12 pain". Animal studies that identified mechanisms of action for the effects of pain were collected. Clinical trials utilizing larger, pharmaceutical doses of vitamin B12 (> 100 µg/dose) in pain treatment were identified and reviewed.

Results

Animal studies support multiple beneficial effects of vitamin B12 including the regeneration of nerves and the inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes and other pain-signaling pathways. In addition, animal studies have demonstrated synergistic benefits of vitamin B12 combined with other pain medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opiates. Clinical trials provide evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin B12 for the treatment of low back pain and neuralgia, although data is still fairly limited and optimal treatment regimens have not been identified.

Limitations

More large, double-blind placebo-controlled trials are needed to fully establish efficacy and best dosing parameters.

Conclusion

Vitamin B12 may prove to be an adjunctive or integrative treatment for pain conditions. While more research is needed, considering the low incidence of side effects and overall safety, B12 may be an additional tool to consider for pain treatment.

### Vitamin B12 as a modulator of gut microbial ecology [^116EZ9q3]. Cell Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

The microbial mechanisms and key metabolites that shape the composition of the human gut microbiota are largely unknown, impeding efforts to manipulate dysbiotic microbial communities toward stability and health. Vitamins, which by definition are not synthesized in sufficient quantities by the host and can mediate fundamental biological processes in microbes, represent an attractive target for reshaping microbial communities. Here, we discuss how vitamin B12 (cobalamin) impacts diverse host-microbe symbioses. Although cobalamin is synthesized by some human gut microbes, it is a precious resource in the gut and is likely not provisioned to the host in significant quantities. However, this vitamin may make an unrecognized contribution in shaping the structure and function of human gut microbial communities.

### Does vitamin B12 influence clinical pregnancy outcome in the follicular-phase GnRH agonist protocol? [^113D6FWS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings support that within a specific range (≤ 358.7 pg/mL), serum vitamin B12 levels may make a modest contribution to improved clinical pregnancy rates in women undergoing in IVF-ET with the follicular-phase GnRHa protocol. Specifically, serum vitamin B12 measurement could be integrated into pre-IVF screening for women at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency or those with unexplained infertility. For individuals with serum vitamin B12 levels below approximately 358.7 pg/mL, targeted vitamin B12 supplementation may help optimize pregnancy outcomes by regulating one-carbon metabolism and mitigating homocysteine-associated toxicity. Conversely, women with serum vitamin B12 levels exceeding this threshold are unlikely to derive benefits from additional supplementation. Thus, routine evaluation of serum vitamin B12 could facilitate the development of personalized nutritional strategies in reproductive medicine, thereby enhancing the efficacy and precision of IVF treatments.

### Problem in the recent American Heart Association guideline on secondary stroke prevention: B vitamins to lower homocysteine Do prevent stroke [^114Szwmg]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

In this article, we discuss a problem in the most recent American Heart Association guideline on secondary stroke prevention that apparently arose from the rules of evidence imposed on the guideline panel. We are told by the cochair of the panel that American Heart Association rules about guidelines for secondary prevention prohibited consideration of primary prevention studies and secondary analyses of secondary prevention studies. However, evidence-based medicine should consider all the best external evidence available and also clinical judgement. The most important problem in the guideline was the recommendation that B vitamins to lower homocysteine do not prevent recurrent stroke. When considering all the best external evidence, it is clear that B vitamins do prevent stroke, but in the early secondary stroke prevention studies, the benefit of B vitamins in participants with good renal function was apparently offset by harm from cyanocobalamin among participants with renal failure (level B-R evidence). We review the evidence that B vitamins should be used to prevent stroke, both in primary and secondary stroke prevention (class 2a recommendation). We also review issues in folate metabolism that require further study, with regard to the form of folate to be used for stroke prevention. We recommend that the guideline be revised to say that B vitamins to lower homocysteine prevent stroke and that methylcobalamin or hydroxycobalamin should be used instead of cyanocobalamin.

### Absorption of water-soluble vitamins [^111bR8Mi]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Water-soluble vitamins are required as enzyme cofactors in a wide variety of metabolic reactions. Riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin C are essential in redox reactions; thiamine and biotin are involved in macronutrient metabolism; and folate, vitamin B12, pyridoxine, and riboflavin play important roles in the regulation of S-adenosylmethionine production and DNA synthesis. Each of the water-soluble vitamins appears to require its own membrane transport process for absorption across the enterocyte. The absorption of vitamin B12, or cobalamin (Cbl), is unique in requiring multiple processes from the stomach to the ileum that involve at least four different binding proteins. Whereas all water-soluble vitamins are absorbed from the small intestine, folate, biotin, and riboflavin can be transported across colonic epithelial cells, with uncertain clinical significance. This article reviews recent studies on the requirement, metabolism, and deficiency state of each water-soluble vitamin, followed by a discussion of current knowledge on the regulation of its intestinal absorption.

### Advances in the understanding of cobalamin assimilation and metabolism [^11668JDX]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

The haematological and neurological consequences of cobalamin deficiency define the essential role of this vitamin in key metabolic reactions. The identification of cubilin-amnionless as the receptors for intestinal absorption of intrinsic factor-bound cobalamin and the plasma membrane receptor for cellular uptake of transcobalamin bound cobalamin have provided a clearer understanding of the absorption and cellular uptake of this vitamin. As the genes involved in the intracellular processing of cobalamins and genetic defects of these pathways are identified, the metabolic disposition of cobalamins and the proteins involved are being recognized. The synthesis of methylcobalamin and 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin, their utilization in conjunction with methionine synthase and methylmalonylCoA mutase, respectively, and the metabolic consequences of defects in these pathways could provide insights into the clinical presentation of cobalamin deficiency.

1 Introduction

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is a cofactor with a complex structure containing a central cobalt atom. It is essential in man and needs to be taken up through the diet from foods of animal origin. Cobalamin is bioavailable in the diet in the form of methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin and is present in the form of cyanocobalamin pharmaceutically. Hydroxocobalamin and cyanocobalamin are converted into adenosylcobalamin, the active cofactor for methylmalonyl‐CoA mutase in the mitochondrion (EC 5.4.99.2, encoded by MMUT) and methylcobalamin, the active cofactor for methionine synthase in the cytosol (EC 2.1.1.13, encoded by MTR). Methylmalonyl‐CoA mutase catalyzes the conversion of L‐methylmalonyl‐CoA to succinyl‐CoA, which is a key step in the propionate anaplerotic pathway of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Methionine synthase catalyzes the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine using 5‐methyltetrahydrofolate as a methyl donor. Besides its role as a proteogenic amino acid, methionine serves as the substrate for methionine adenosyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.6), which synthesizes the universal methyl donor S ‐adenosylmethionine (SAM). Methionine synthase also links the methionine cycle with the folate cycle. Taken together, cobalamin plays a key role in central metabolic pathways such as one‐carbon metabolism, propionate metabolism, and the TCA cycle, and along with folate, is essential for the epigenetic machinery.

### Cyanocobalamin (Nascobal) [^115XbcqA]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Vitamin B12can be converted to coenzyme B12in tissues, and as such is essential for conversion of methylmalonate to succinate and synthesis of methionine from homocysteine, a reaction which also requires folate. In the absence of coenzyme B12, tetrahydrofolate cannot be regenerated from its inactive storage form, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and a functional folate deficiency occurs. Vitamin B12also may be involved in maintaining sulfhydryl (SH) groups in the reduced form required by many SH-activated enzyme systems. Through these reactions, vitamin B12is associated with fat and carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Parenteral (intramuscular) administration of vitamin B12completely reverses the megaloblastic anemia and GI symptoms of vitamin B12deficiency; the degree of improvement in neurologic symptoms depends on the duration and severity of the lesions, although progression of the lesions is immediately arrested. In pernicious anemia patients, once weekly intranasal dosing with 500 mcg B12gel resulted in a consistent increase in pre-dose serum B12levels during one month of treatment (p < 0.003) above that seen one month after 100 mcg intramuscular dose (Figure 2).

### Vitamin B deficiency [^113VrFbh]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B 12 (B12; also known as cobalamin) is a B vitamin that has an important role in cellular metabolism, especially in DNA synthesis, methylation and mitochondrial metabolism. Clinical B12 deficiency with classic haematological and neurological manifestations is relatively uncommon. However, subclinical deficiency affects between 2.5% and 26% of the general population depending on the definition used, although the clinical relevance is unclear. B12 deficiency can affect individuals at all ages, but most particularly elderly individuals. Infants, children, adolescents and women of reproductive age are also at high risk of deficiency in populations where dietary intake of B12-containing animal-derived foods is restricted. Deficiency is caused by either inadequate intake, inadequate bioavailability or malabsorption. Disruption of B12 transport in the blood, or impaired cellular uptake or metabolism causes an intracellular deficiency. Diagnostic biomarkers for B12 status include decreased levels of circulating total B12 and transcobalamin-bound B12, and abnormally increased levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid. However, the exact cut-offs to classify clinical and subclinical deficiency remain debated. Management depends on B12 supplementation, either via high-dose oral routes or via parenteral administration. This Primer describes the current knowledge surrounding B12 deficiency, and highlights improvements in diagnostic methods as well as shifting concepts about the prevalence, causes and manifestations of B12 deficiency.

### Subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people: a systematic review [^111kySvh]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Pernicious anaemia is a form of anaemia that is undeniably associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. Finding the cure for pernicious anaemia even led to the discovery of vitamin B12. Nowadays, vitamin B12 deficiency is not only associated with (pernicious) anaemia, but is also linked with other conditions such as dementia, neuropathy and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Therefore, individuals with low serum concentrations of vitamin B12 are frequently given vitamin B12 supplements. Also, since low serum vitamin B12 concentrations are very common in older individuals, screening older people for vitamin B12 deficiency has often been recommended.

Although the biological role of vitamin B12 in haematopoiesis is well-defined, the outcomes of some studies cast doubt on the relationship between low vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older individuals. The association between low vitamin B12 and anaemia has become even more difficult to study because various cut-off values for serum vitamin B12 are used and serum concentrations of vitamin B12 appear not to be an accurate reflection of vitamin B12 status at the tissue level.

Therefore, in order to evaluate the association between subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older subjects, we performed a systematic review of relevant observational (cross-sectional and longitudinal) studies and randomized placebo-controlled trials that have been published in the medical literature to date.

### Vitamin B, folate, and the methionine remethylation cycle-biochemistry, pathways, and regulation [^115UB1L8]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B 12 (cobalamin, Cbl) is a nutrient essential to human health. Due to its complex structure and dual cofactor forms, Cbl undergoes a complicated series of absorptive and processing steps before serving as cofactor for the enzymes methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methionine synthase. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is required for the catabolism of certain (branched-chain) amino acids into an anaplerotic substrate in the mitochondrion, and dysfunction of the enzyme itself or in production of its cofactor adenosyl-Cbl result in an inability to successfully undergo protein catabolism with concomitant mitochondrial energy disruption. Methionine synthase catalyzes the methyl-Cbl dependent (re)methylation of homocysteine to methionine within the methionine cycle; a reaction required to produce this essential amino acid and generate S-adenosylmethionine, the most important cellular methyl-donor. Disruption of methionine synthase has wide-ranging implications for all methylation-dependent reactions, including epigenetic modification, but also for the intracellular folate pathway, since methionine synthase uses 5-methyltetrahydrofolate as a one-carbon donor. Folate-bound one-carbon units are also required for deoxythymidine monophosphate and de novo purine synthesis; therefore, the flow of single carbon units to each of these pathways must be regulated based on cellular needs. This review provides an overview on Cbl metabolism with a brief description of absorption and intracellular metabolic pathways. It also provides a description of folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism and its intersection with Cbl at the methionine cycle. Finally, a summary of recent advances in understanding of how both pathways are regulated is presented.

### Algae acquire vitamin B12 through a symbiotic relationship with bacteria [^1132UHzp]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) was identified nearly 80 years ago as the anti-pernicious anaemia factor in liver, and its importance in human health and disease has resulted in much work on its uptake, cellular transport and utilization. Plants do not contain cobalamin because they have no cobalamin-dependent enzymes. Deficiencies are therefore common in strict vegetarians, and in the elderly, who are susceptible to an autoimmune disorder that prevents its efficient uptake. In contrast, many algae are rich in vitamin B12, with some species, such as Porphyra yezoensis (Nori), containing as much cobalamin as liver. Despite this, the role of the cofactor in algal metabolism remains unknown, as does the source of the vitamin for these organisms. A survey of 326 algal species revealed that 171 species require exogenous vitamin B12 for growth, implying that more than half of the algal kingdom are cobalamin auxotrophs. Here we show that the role of vitamin B12 in algal metabolism is primarily as a cofactor for vitamin B12-dependent methionine synthase, and that cobalamin auxotrophy has arisen numerous times throughout evolution, probably owing to the loss of the vitamin B12-independent form of the enzyme. The source of cobalamin seems to be bacteria, indicating an important and unsuspected symbiosis.
